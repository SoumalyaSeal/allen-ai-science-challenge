Introduction 	  Like Miranda Wang and Jeanny Yao, youve probably done science projects. But did you ever really think about what science is or what it means to be a scientist? In this lesson youll consider these questions. What Is Science? Most people think of science as a collection of facts or a body of knowledge. For example, you may have memorized the processes of the water cycle. As shown in Figure 1.1, the processes include evaporation and precipitation. Such knowledge of the natural world is only part of what science is. Science is as much about doing as knowing. Science is a way of learning about the natural world that depends on evidence, reasoning, and repeated testing. Scientists explain the world based on their observations. If they develop new ideas about the way the world works, they set up ways to test these new ideas. Scientific knowledge keeps changing because scientists are always doing science. 
Thinking  Like a  Scientist 	  When Miranda and Jeanny wondered whether bacteria might decompose plastic, they were thinking like a scientist. What does it mean to think like a scientist? A scientist is observant. Miranda and Jeanny observed all the plastic trash when they visited a landfill. They also saw a lot of plastic trash along a local river. A scientist wonders and asks questions. Miranda and Jeanny wondered if any bacteria could help break down plastic. They asked: Can some bacteria consume chemicals in plastic for food? A scientist tries to find answers using evidence and logic. Often, a scientist does experiments to gather more evidence and test ideas. Miranda and Jeanny did a lot of online research to find out what other scientists had already learned. Then they did their own experiments. They gathered and tested bacteria. For example, they grew bacteria on gel like the red gel in Figure 1.2. You can learn the details of their research and their amazing results by watching this video: URL A scientist is skeptical. Claims must be backed by adequate evidence. Miranda and Jeanny repeated their experiments so they were confident in their results. Only then did they draw conclusions. A scientist has an open mind. Scientific knowledge is always evolving as new evidence comes in. Miranda and Jeanny made an important contribution with the evidence they gathered. They discovered two species of bacteria that could consume a harmful chemical in plastic. 
Scientific  Theories and  Scientific  Laws 	  Some knowledge in science gains the status of a theory. Scientists use the term theory differently than it is used in everyday language. You might say, I think my dad is late because he got stuck in traffic, but its just a theory. In other words, its just one of many possible explanations for why hes late. In science, a theory is much more than that. A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence. Scientific theories are tested and confirmed repeatedly. Because theories are broad explanations, they generally help explain many different observations. An example in life science is the theory of evolution by natural selection. It explains how living things change through time as they adapt to their environment. This theory is supported by a huge amount of evidence. The evidence ranges from DNA to fossils like the ones in Figure 1.3. Another sort of scientific knowledge is called a law. A scientific law is a description of what always occurs under certain conditions in nature. In other words, it describes many observations but doesnt explain them. Examples of scientific laws in life science include Mendels laws of inheritance. These laws describe how traits are passed from parents to their offspring. Bacteria can be grown on different types of gel to see what they can consume. This amazing fossil reptile is named Dimetrodon. It lived almost 300 million years ago. It was a dinosaur ancestor. What do you think scientists might be able to learn about it from its fossilized bones? 
Lesson  Summary 	  Science is a way of learning about the natural world that depends on evidence, reasoning, and repeated testing. A scientist is observant and questioning. She tests ideas with evidence. A scientist is also skeptical and open minded. A scientific theory, such as the theory of evolution, is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence. A scientific law, such as Mendels laws of inheritance, is a description of what always occurs under certain conditions in nature. 
Think  Critically 	  Most scientists specialize in just one area of science. An example is life science. Describe the scope of life science. Identify the focus of specific fields within life science. Outline basic theories that underlie all the fields of life science. Distinguish between basic and applied life science.

Introduction 	  Life science is the study of life and living things. Living things are also called organisms. Life science is often referred to as biology. Life scientists work in many different settings, from classrooms to labs to natural habitats. Dr. Katherine Smith, who is pictured in Figure 1.4 is a life scientist who works for NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). She studies freshwater shrimp and fish in their natural habitats. 
Fields in  Life  Science 	  Life is complex, and there are millions of species alive today. Many millions more lived in the past and then went extinct. Organisms include microscopic, single-celled organisms. They also include complex, multicellular animals such as you. Clearly, life science is a huge science. Thats why a life scientist usually specializes in just one field within life science. Dr. Smith, for example, specializes in ecology. You can see the focus of ecology and several other life science fields in Table 1.1. Click on the links provided if you want to learn about careers in these fields.

Life  Science  Theories 	  Each field of life science has its own specific body of knowledge and relevant theories. However, two theories are basic to all of the life sciences. They form the foundation of every life science field. They are the cell theory and the theory of evolution by natural selection. Both theories have been tested repeatedly. Both are supported by a great deal of evidence. 
Cell  Theory 	  According to the cell theory, all organisms are made up of one or more cells. Cells are the sites where all life processes take place. Cells come only from pre-existing cells. New cells forms when existing cells divide. Most cells are too small to see without a microscope. If you were to look at a drop of your blood under a microscope, Figure 1.5 shows two types of cells you might see. You can learn more about cells and the cell theory in the chapter Cells and Their Structures. 
Theory of  Evolution by  Natural  Selection 	  The theory of evolution by natural selection explains how populations of organisms can change over time. As environments change, so must the traits of organisms if they are to survive in the new conditions. Evolution by natural selection explains how this happens. It also explains why there are so many different species of organisms on Earth today. You can see examples of the incredible diversity of living animals in Figure 1.6. You can read more about the theory of evolution in the chapter Evolution. Evolution explains how there came to be so many different species of organisms on Earth 
Basic and  Applied  Life  Science 	  Most scientific theories were developed by scientists doing basic scientific research. Like other sciences, life science may be either basic or applied science. 
Basic  Science 	  The aim of basic science is to discover new knowledge. It leads to a better understanding of the natural world. It doesnt necessarily have any practical use. An example of basic research in life science is studying how yeast cells grow and divide. Yeasts are single-celled organisms that are easy to study. By studying yeast cells, life scientists discovered the series of events called the cell cycle. The cell cycle works not only in yeasts but in all other organisms with similar cells. Therefore, this basic research made a major contribution to our understanding of living things. Watch the following animation to learn more about the basic yeast research and the cell cycle. You can also see yeast cells dividing. URL 
Applied  Science 	  Knowledge gained by this basic research on yeast cells has been applied to practical problems. Scientists have developed drugs to treat cancer based on knowledge of the cell cycle. Cancer is a disease in which cells divide out of control. The new drugs interfere with the cell cycle of cancer cells, so the cells stop dividing. This is an example of applied science. The aim of applied science is to find solutions to practical problems. Applied science generally rests on knowledge gained by basic science. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Life science is the study of life and living organisms. Life science is also called biology. Life is complex and living things are incredibly diverse. Therefore, life science is divided into many fields, such as ecology, botany, and zoology. Two theories underlie all of the fields of life science: the cell theory and the theory of evolution by natural selection. Life science may be basic or applied science. The aim of basic science is to gain new knowledge and a better understanding of the natural world. The aim of applied science is to find solutions to practical problems. 
Think  Critically 	  The cell theory and the theory of evolution by natural selection are basic to all of the fields of life science. Do you think that the same basic methods are used in all of the fields of life science? How do you think life scientists increase their knowledge of living things? Outline the steps of the scientific method. State the meaning of scientific hypothesis. Define experiment. Identify independent and dependent variables and controls. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  control dependent variable experiment hypothesis independent variable observation replication scientific method 
Introduction 	  Look at the athletes in Figure 1.7. Some athletes, like the one on the left, seem destined to be weight lifters. They respond to exercise by building big muscles. Other athletes, like the one on the right, are better suited for longdistance running. They can develop awesome levels of endurance. What determines how the human body responds to training? Could it be genetic? Might our athletic potential be controlled by our genes? How would a life scientist try to answer this question? 
Steps in a  Scientific  Investigation 	  A life scientist would carry out a scientific investigation to try to answer this question. A scientific investigation follows a general plan called the scientific method. The scientific method is a series of logical steps for testing a possible answer to a question. The steps are shown in the flow chart in Figure 1.8. 
The  Scientific  Method:  A  Closer  Look 	  The steps of the scientific method are described in greater detail below. Note that these steps are meant as a guide, not a rigid sequence. Steps may be followed in a somewhat different order, for example, or steps may be repeated or skipped. are communicated, scientists should describe their hypothesis and how it was tested in addition to the results of the test. This allows other scientists to repeat the investigation to see whether they get the same results. This is called replication. Replication is important because it adds weight to the findings. The results are more likely to be reliable if they can be repeated. Posters are a quick, visual way for scientists to communicate the results of their research to other scientists. Professional science posters serve the same purpose as science fair posters. 
Applying the  Scientific  Method 	  You can apply the scientific method to the question that was raised above about athletic ability. Assume you are a life scientist. You observe variation in athletic abilities. Some athletes tend to build more muscle mass. Others tend to develop greater endurance. You ask, Is there a gene that might explain these differences? You research the problem on the Internet. You learn about a gene named ACE that might affect how people respond to athletic training. Based on all of your research, you develop a hypothesis. You hypothesize that people with different versions (D or I) of the ACE gene will respond differently to the same athletic training program. People with D genes will increase their muscle mass but not their endurance. People with I genes will increase their endurance but not their muscle mass. How can you test your hypothesis? You can see how actual life science researchers did it by watching this video: URL . 
Lesson  Summary 	  Scientific investigations generally follow a process called the scientific method. Steps of the scientific method include making observations, asking a question, forming a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis, drawing a conclusion, and communicating the results. A hypothesis is a potential, testable answer to a scientific question. It must be possible to find evidence showing that the hypothesis is false if it really is false. An experiment is a controlled scientific test that often takes place in a lab. It investigates the effects of an independent variable on a dependent variable. Experimental controls are other factors that might affect the dependent variable. They are kept constant so they will not affect the results of the experiment. 
Think  Critically 	  Whether they do basic or applied research, many life scientists use microscopes as one of their most important tools. Define microscope. Explain why the microscope is so important in life science. Outline how the microscope was invented. Compare and contrast modern light microscopes and electron microscopes. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  electron microscope light microscope microscope 
Introduction 	  Its hard to overstate the importance of the microscope to life science. A microscope is an instrument that makes magnified images of very small objects so they are visible to the human eye. 
Importance of the  Microscope in  Life  Science 	  Many life science discoveries would not have been possible without the microscope. For example: Cells are the tiny building blocks of living things.	They couldnt be discovered until the microscope was invented.	The discovery of cells led to the cell theory.	This is one of the most important theories in life science. Bacteria are among the most numerous living things on the planet. They also cause many diseases. However, no one knew bacteria even existed until they could be seen with a microscope. The invention of the microscope allowed scientists to see cells, bacteria, and many other structures that are too small to be seen with the unaided eye. It gave them a direct view into the unseen world of the extremely tiny. You can get a glimpse of that world in Figure 1.10. 
Invention of the  Microscope 	  The microscope was invented more than four centuries ago. In the late 1500s, two Dutch eyeglass makers, Zacharias Jansen and his father Hans, built the first microscope. They put several magnifying lenses in a tube. They discovered that using more than one lens magnified objects more than a single lens. Their simple microscope could make small objects appear nine times bigger than they really were. 
Hooke  Discovers  Cells 	  In the mid-1600s, the English scientist Robert Hooke was one of the first scientists to observe living things with a microscope. He published the first book of microscopic studies, called Micrographia. It includes wonderful drawings of microscopic organisms and other objects. One of Hookes most important discoveries came when he viewed thin slices of cork under a microscope. Cork is made from the bark of a tree. When Hooke viewed it under a microscope, he saw many tiny compartments that he called cells. He made the drawing in Figure 1.11 to show what he observed. Hooke was the first person to observe the cells from a once-living organism. 
Van  Leeuwenhoek  Sees  Animalcules 	  In the late 1600s, Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch lens maker and scientist, started making much stronger microscopes. His microscopes could magnify objects as much as 270 times their actual size. Van Leeuwenhoek made many scientific discoveries using his microscopes. He was the first to see and describe bacteria. He observed them in a sample of plaque that he had scraped off his own teeth. He also saw yeast cells, human sperm cells, and the microscopic life teeming in a drop of pond water. He even saw blood cells circulating in tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The drawings in Figure 1.12 show some of tiny organisms and living cells that van Leeuwenhoek viewed with his microscopes. He called them animalcules. 
Modern  Microscopes 	  These early microscopes used lenses to refract light and create magnified images. This type of microscope is called a light microscope. Light microscopes continued to improve and are still used today. The microscope you might use in science class is a light microscope. The most powerful light microscopes now available can make objects look up to 2000 times their actual size. You can learn how to use a light microscope by watching this short video: http ://URL . Van Leeuwenhoeks drawings of animalcules as they appeared under his microscope To see what you might observe with a light microscope, watch the following video. It shows some amazing creatures in a drop of stagnant water from an old boat. What do you think the creatures might be? Do they look like any of van Leeuwenhoeks animalcules in Figure 1.12? URL For an object to be visible with a light microscope, it cant be smaller than the wavelength of visible light (about 550 nanometers). To view smaller objects, a different type of microscope, such as an electron microscope, must be used. Electron microscopes pass beams of electrons through or across an object. They can make a very clear image that is up to 2 million times bigger than the actual object. An electron microscope was used to make the image of the ant head in Figure 1.10. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A microscope is an instrument that makes magnified images of very small objects so they are visible to the human eye. Many important life science discoveries would not have been possible without the microscope. Hans and Zacharias Jansen made the first light microscope in the late 1500s. In the mid-1600s, Robert Hooke was the first scientist to study living things with a microscope. He was also the first to identify and describe cells. In the late 1600s, van Leeuwenhoek improved the microscope. He used it to observe many living cells and organisms. He was the first to observe bacteria. Light microscopes continued to improve and are still used today. However, to see extremely small objects, a different type of microscope, such as an electron microscope, must be used. 
Think  Critically 	  Microscopes are usually used in a lab setting. Science labs can be dangerous places unless you follow safety rules. Identify common safety symbols and lab safety rules. Explain how to stay safe while doing field research. State what to do in case of an accident during scientific research. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  fieldwork 
Introduction 	  Some life scientists mainly do lab research. Other life scientists, like the botanist in Figure 1.13, work in natural settings. This is called fieldwork. Whether in the lab or the field, research in life science can be dangerous. Its important to be aware of the risks and how to stay safe. This field botanist is collecting water samples near the wild pitcher plants she is studying. These insect-eating plants are rare, and there are many unanswered questions about them. Why might her research be risky? 
Safety in the  Lab 	  A science lab has many potential dangers. Thats why lab procedures and equipment are often labeled with safety symbols, like the ones in Figure 1.14. These symbols warn of specific hazards, such as flames or broken glass. Learn the symbols so you can recognize the dangers. Then learn how to avoid them. The best way to avoid lab dangers is to follow the lab safety rules listed below. Following the rules can help prevent accidents. Watch this funny student video to see just how important some of these rules are: URL om/watch?v=NjJz85bQqdM . 
Lab  Safety  Rules 	  Wear long sleeves and shoes that completely cover your feet. If your hair is long, tie it back or cover it with a hair net. Protect your eyes, skin, and clothing by wearing safety goggles, an apron, and gloves. Use hot mitts to handle hot objects. Never work alone in the lab. Never engage in horseplay in the lab. Never eat or drink in the lab. Never do experiments without your teachers approval. Always add acid to water, never the other way around. Add the acid slowly to avoid splashing. Take care to avoid knocking over Bunsen burners. Keep them away from flammable materials such as paper. Use your hand to fan vapors toward your nose rather than smelling substances directly. Never point the open end of a test tube toward anyoneincluding you! Clean up any spills immediately. Dispose of lab wastes according to your teachers instructions. Wash glassware and counters when you finish your work. Wash your hands with soap and water before leaving the lab. 
Safety in the  Field 	  Many of the lab safety rules are common-sense precautions. Common-sense should also prevail in the field. Be aware, however, that field research may have its own unique dangers. Therefore, other safety rules may apply when you work in the field. The rules will depend on the particular field setting and its specific risks. Consider the field botanist in Figure 1.13. There may be microorganisms in the water that could make her sick. She might come into contact with plants that cause an allergic reaction. The water or shore might be strewn with dangerous objects such as broken glass that could cause serious injury. To stay safe in the field, she needs to be aware of these risks and take steps to avoid them. If you work in the field or take a science fieldtrip, you should do the sameand always follow your teachers instructions. 
In  Case of  Accident 	  Even when you follow the rules, accidents can happen. Immediately alert your teacher if an accident occurs. Report all accidents, whether or not you think they are serious. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Lab safety symbols warn of specific hazards, such as flames or broken glass. Knowing the symbols allows you to recognize and avoid the dangers. Following basic safety rules, such as wearing safety gear, helps prevent accidents in the lab and in the field. All accidents should be reported immediately.

Chapter  Outline 	  MS What is a Living Organism? This colorful image represents a virus that commonly causes respiratory infections in people. Living organisms called bacteria are also common causes of human infections. Are viruses living organisms as well? Actually, this is one of the great unanswered questions of life science. Some scientists think viruses should be considered living organisms. Other scientists disagree. In this chapter, youll learn the basic characteristics of living things and the characteristics of viruses. At the end of the chapter, you can decide for yourself whether you think viruses are living organisms. Identify characteristics of living organisms. Describe cells. Explain why living things need energy. Give an example of a stimulus and response. Compare sexual and asexual reproduction. Define homeostasis. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  cell energy homeostasis reproduction response stimulus (stimuli, plural) 
Introduction 	  Look at the photos in Figure 2.1. How are they similar? All of them show living organisms. Observe how different the organisms are from each other. Clearly, living things are very diverse. Yet all of the organisms in the pictures share the same basic characteristics of life. Can you guess what these characteristics are? 
Defining  Life 	  Five characteristics are used to define life. All living things share these characteristics. All living things: These pictures represent the diversity of living organisms. Organisms in the top row (ac) are microscopic. 
Living  Things  Are  Made of  Cells 	  Cells are the basic building blocks of life. They are like tiny factories where virtually all life processes take place. Some living things, like the bacteria in Figure 2.1, consist of just one cell. They are called single-celled organisms. You can see other single-celled organisms in Figure 2.2. Some living things are composed of a few to many trillions of cells. They are called multicellular organisms. Your body is composed of trillions of cells. Regardless of the type of organism, all living cells share certain basic structures. For example, all cells are enclosed by a membrane. The cell membrane separates the cell from its environment. It also controls what enters or leaves the cell. 
Living  Things  Need  Energy 	  Everything you do takes energy. Energy is the ability to change or move matter. Whether its reading these words or running a sprint, it requires energy. In fact, it takes energy just to stay alive. Where do you get energy? You probably know the answer. You get energy from food. Figure {{ref|MS-LS-SE-02-03-Food|below}] shows some healthy foods that can provide you with energy. Just like you, other living things need a source of energy. But they may use a different source. Organisms may be grouped on the basis of the source of energy they use. In which group do you belong? Producers such as the tree in Figure 2.1 use sunlight for energy to produce their own food. The process is called photosynthesis, and the food is sugar. Plants and other organisms use this food for energy. Consumers such as the raccoon in Figure 2.1 eat plantsor other consumers that eat plantsas a source of energy. Some consumers such as the mushroom in Figure 2.1 get their energy from dead organic matter. For example, they might consume dead leaves on a forest floor. The green scum in this canal consists of billions of single-celled green algae. Algae are plant-like microorganisms that produce food by photosynthesis. 
Living  Things  Respond to their  Environment 	  When a living thing responds to its environment, it is responding to a stimulus. A stimulus ( stimuli, plural) is something in the environment that causes a reaction in an organism. The reaction a stimulus produces is called a response. Imagine how you would respond to the following stimuli: Youre about to cross a street when the walk light turns red. You hear a smoke alarm go off in the kitchen. You step on an upturned tack with a bare foot. You smell the aroma of your favorite food. You taste something really sour. It doesnt take much imagination to realize that responding appropriately to such stimuli might help keep you safe. It might even help you survive. Like you, all other living things sense and respond to stimuli in their environment. In general, their responses help them survive or reproduce. Watch this amazing time-lapse video to see how a plant responds to the stimuli of light Fruits, vegetables, and nuts are healthy sources of food energy. and gravity as it grows. Why do you think it is important for a plant to respond appropriately to these stimuli for proper growth? URL 
Living  Things  Grow and  Reproduce 	  Like plants, all living things have the capacity for growth. The ducklings in Figure 2.4 have a lot of growing to do to catch up in size to their mother. Multicellular organisms like ducks grow by increasing the size and number of their cells. Single-celled organisms just grow in size. These ducklings will grow to become as big as their mother by the time they are about a year old. As the ducklings grow, they will develop and mature into adults. By adulthood, they will be able to reproduce. Reproduction is the production of offspring. The ability to reproduce is another characteristic of living things. Many organisms reproduce sexually. In sexual reproduction, parents of different sexes mate to produce offspring. The offspring have some combination of the traits of the two parents. Ducks are examples of sexually reproducing organisms. Other organisms reproduce asexually. In asexual reproduction, a single parent can produce offspring alone. For example, a bacterial cell reproduces by dividing into two daughter cells. The daughter cells are identical to each other and to the parent cell. 
Living  Things  Maintain a  Stable  Internal  Environment 	  The tennis player in Figure 2.5 has really worked up a sweat. Do you know why we sweat? Sweating helps to keep us cool. When sweat evaporates from the skin, it uses up some of the bodys heat energy. Sweating is one of the ways that the body maintains a stable internal environment. It helps keep the bodys internal temperature constant. When the bodys internal environment is stable, the condition is called homeostasis. All living organisms have ways of maintaining homeostasis. They have mechanisms for controlling such factors as their internal temperature, water balance, and acidity. Homeostasis is necessary for normal life processes that take place inside cells. If an organism cant maintain homeostasis, normal life processes are disrupted. Disease or even death may result. 
Lesson  Summary 	  All living things are made of cells, use energy, respond to stimuli, grow and reproduce, and maintain homeostasis. Sweating is one way the body maintains homeostasis. All living things consist of one or more cells.	Cells are the basic units of structure and function of living organisms. Energy is the ability to change or move matter. All life processes require energy, so all living things need energy. All living things can sense and respond to stimuli in their environment. Stimuli might include temperature, light, or gravity. All living things grow and reproduce. Multicellular organisms grow by increasing in cell size and number. Single-celled organisms increase in cell size. All organisms can normally reproduce, or produce offspring. Reproduction can be sexual or asexual. All living things have ways of maintaining a stable internal environment.	This stable condition is called homeostasis. 
Think  Critically 	  In this lesson, you read that all living things consist of one or more cells. What are cells made of? Is there any matter that is smaller than a cell? Describe the makeup of matter. Outline the four main classes of biochemical compounds.  Explain the role of biochemical reactions in living things. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  atom biochemical compound biochemical reaction carbohydrates cellulose chemical bond chemical reaction compound element enzyme lipids matter metabolism molecule nucleic acids proteins 
Introduction 	  Did you ever wonder what youre made of? The short answer is matter. Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space. All living things consist of matter. Whats the Matter? All known matter can be divided into a little more than 100 different substances called elements. 
Elements and  Compounds 	  An element is pure substance that cannot be broken down into other substances. Each element has a particular set of properties that, taken together, distinguish it from all other elements. Table 2.2 lists the major elements in the human body. As you can see, you consist mainly of the elements oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. 
Sulfur 	  In your body, most elements are combined with other elements to form chemical compounds. A compound is a unique type of matter in which two or more elements are combined chemically in a certain ratio. For example, much of the oxygen and hydrogen in your body are combined in the chemical compound water, or H2O. 
Atoms and  Molecules 	  The smallest particle of an element that still has the properties of that element is an atom. Atoms are extremely tiny. They can be observed only with an electron microscope. They are commonly represented by models, like the one Figure 2.6. An atom has a central nucleus that is positive in charge. The nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged particles called electrons. The smallest particle of a compound that still has the properties of that compound is a molecule. A molecule consists of two or more atoms. For example, a molecule of water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Thats why the chemical formula for water is H2O. You can see a simple model of a water molecule in Figure 2.7. 
Biochemical  Compounds 	  Besides water, most of the compounds in living things are biochemical compounds. A biochemical compound is a carbon-based compound that is found in living organisms. Carbon is an element that has a tremendous ability to form large compounds. Each atom of carbon can form four chemical bonds with other atoms. A chemical bond is the sharing of electrons between atoms. Bonds hold the atoms together in chemical compounds. A carbon atom can form bonds with other carbon atoms or with atoms of other elements. 
Classes of  Biochemical  Compounds 	  Biochemical compounds make up the cells and tissues of living things. They are also involved in all life processes. Given their diversity of functions, its not surprising that there are millions of different biochemical compounds. Even so, all biochemical compounds can be grouped into just four main classes: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The classes are summarized in Table 2.2. 
Functions 	  TABLE 2.2: (continued) 
Carbohydrates 	  carbon hydrogen oxygen sugars starch glycogen cellulose provide energy to cells stores energy in plants stores energy in animals makes up the cell walls of plants 
Proteins 	  carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen sulfur enzymes hormones speed up biochemical reactions regulate life processes 
Lipids 	  carbon hydrogen oxygen fats oils phospholipids store energy in animals store energy in plants make up cell membranes 
Nucleic acids 	  carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus 
 	  stores genetic information in cells helps cells make proteins 
Characteristics of  Biochemical  Compounds 	  You can see from Table 2.2 that all biochemical compounds contain hydrogen and oxygen as well as carbon. They may also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur. Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers. Polymers are large molecules that consist of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers. Most biochemical molecules are macromolecules. The prefix macromeans large, and many biochemical molecules are very large indeed. They may contain thousands of monomer molecules. The largest known biochemical molecule contains more than 34,000 monomers! 
Carbohydrates 	  Carbohydrates are biochemical compounds that include sugar, starch, glycogen, and cellulose. Sugars are simple carbohydrates with relatively small molecules. Glucose is one of the smallest sugar molecules. Its chemical formula is C6H12O6. This means that a molecule of glucose contains 6 atoms of carbon, 12 atoms of hydrogen, and 6 atoms of oxygen. Plants and some other organisms make glucose in the process of photosynthesis. Living things that cannot make glucose can obtain it by consuming plants or organisms that consume plants. Starches are complex carbohydrates. They are polymers of glucose. Starches contain hundreds of glucose monomers. Plants make starches to store extra glucose. Consumers can get starches by eating plants. Common sources of starches in the human diet are pictured Figure 2.8. Our digestive system breaks down starches to sugar, which our cells use for energy. Like other animals, we store any extra glucose as the complex carbohydrate called glycogen. Glycogen is also a polymer of glucose. Cellulose is another complex carbohydrate found in plants that is a polymer of glucose. Cellulose molecules bundle together to form long, tough fibers. Cellulose is the most abundant biochemical compound. It makes up the cell walls of plants and gives support to stems and tree trunks. 
Proteins 	  Proteins are biochemical compounds that consist of one or more chains of small molecules called amino acids. Amino acids are the monomers of proteins. There are only about 20 different amino acids. The sequence of amino acids in chains and the number of chains in a protein determine the proteins shape. Shapes may be very complex. You can learn more about the shapes of proteins at this link: URL The shape of a protein determines its function. Proteins have many different functions. For example, proteins: make up muscle tissues. speed up chemical reactions in cells. regulate life processes. help defend against infections. transport materials around the body in the blood. Hemoglobin is an example of a transport protein in the blood. You can see how it works in Figure 2.9. The heme parts of a hemoglobin molecule bind with oxygen. Each red blood cell has hundreds of hemoglobin molecules. This is how oxygen is carried in the blood to cells throughout the body. 
Lipids 	  Lipids are biochemical compounds that living things use to store energy and make cell membranes. Types of lipids include fats, oils, and phospholipids. Fats are solid lipids that animals use to store energy. Examples of fats include butter and the fat in meat. Oils are liquid lipids that plants use to store energy. Examples of oils include olive oil and corn oil. Phospholipids contain the element phosphorus. They make up the cell membranes of living things. Lipids are made of long chains consisting almost solely of carbon and hydrogen. These long chains are called fatty acids. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. Figure 2.10 shows an example of each type of fatty acid. 
Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids 	  In saturated fatty acids, carbon atoms are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen. Saturated fatty acids are found in fats. In unsaturated fatty acids, some carbon atoms are not bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. Instead, they share double bonds with other carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids are found in oils. 
Nucleic  Acids 	  Nucleic acids are biochemical compounds that include RNA (ribonucleic acid) and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Nucleic acids consist of chains of small molecules called nucleotides. Nucleotides are the monomers of nucleic acids. A nucleotide is shown in Figure 2.11. Each nucleotide consists of: RNA consists of just one chain of nucleotides. DNA consists of two chains. Nitrogen bases on the two chains of DNA form bonds with each other. The bonded bases are called base pairs. Bonds form only between adenine and thymine, and between guanine and cytosine. They hold together the two chains of DNA and give it its characteristic double helix, or spiral, shape. You can see the shape of the DNA molecule in Figure 2.12. Sugars and phosphate groups form the backbone of each chain of DNA. Determining the structure of DNA was a huge scientific breakthrough. You can read the interesting story of its discovery and why it was so important at this link: URL DNA stores genetic information in the cells of all living things. It contains the genetic code. This is the code that instructs cells how to make proteins. The instructions are encoded in the sequence of nitrogen bases in DNAs nucleotide chains. RNA copies and interprets the genetic code in DNA. RNA is also involved in the synthesis of proteins based on the code. You can watch these events unfolding at this link: URL 
Biochemical  Reactions 	  The student athlete in Figure 2.13 is practically flying down the track! Running takes a lot of energy. But you dont have to run a race to use energy. All living things need energy all the time just to stay alive. The energy is produced in chemical reactions. A chemical reaction is a process in which some substances, called reactants, change chemically into different substances, called products. Reactants and products may be elements or compounds. Chemical reactions that take place inside living things are called biochemical reactions. Living things depend on biochemical reactions for more than just energy. Every function and structure of a living organism depends on thousands of biochemical reactions taking place in each cell. 
Metabolism 	  The sum of all of an organisms biochemical reactions is called metabolism. Biochemical reactions of metabolism can be divided into two general categories: catabolic reactions and anabolic reactions. You can watch an animation showing how the two categories of reactions are related at this link: URL Anabolic reactions involve forming bonds. Smaller molecules combine to form larger ones. These reactions require energy. For example, it takes energy to build starches from sugars. Catabolic reactions involve breaking bonds. Larger molecules break down to form smaller ones. These reactions release energy. For example, energy is released when starches break down to sugars. 
Enzymes 	  Each of the trillions of cells in your body is continuously performing thousands of anabolic and catabolic reactions. Thats an amazing number of biochemical reactionsfar more than the number of chemical reactions that might take place in a science lab or chemical plant. So many biochemical reactions can take place simultaneously in our cells because biochemical reactions occur very quickly. Thats because of enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that increase the rate of biochemical reactions. Enzymes arent changed or used up in the reactions, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again. Enzymes are highly specific for certain chemical reactions, so they are very effective. A reaction that would take years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme. 
Photosynthesis and  Cellular  Respiration 	  Some of the most important biochemical reactions are the reactions involved in photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Photosynthesis is the process in which producers capture light energy from the sun and use it to make glucose. This involves anabolic reactions. Cellular respiration is the process in which energy is released from glucose and stored in smaller amounts in other molecules that cells can use for energy. This involves catabolic reactions. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration together provide energy to almost all living cells. Figure 2.14 shows how photosynthesis and cellular respiration are related. You can read more about both processes in the chapter Cell Functions. The products of photosynthesis are oxygen (O2) and glucose. These two substances are also the reactants of cellular respiration. The products of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). These two substances are also the reactants of photosynthesis. 
Lesson  Summary 	  All living things are made of matter. Matter can consist of pure substances called elements or of combinations of elements called chemical compounds. Atoms are the smallest particles of elements. Molecules are the smallest particles of compounds. Biochemical compounds are carbon-based compounds that make up living organisms. There are four main classes of biochemical compounds: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The classes have different structures and functions. Life depends on biochemical reactions constantly taking place inside cells. Metabolism is the sum of all the biochemical reactions in an organism. It includes anabolic reactions that build up molecules and catabolic reactions that break down molecules. Enzymes speed up biochemical reactions. 
Think  Critically 	  All living things share many of the same biochemical compounds and biochemical reactions. Yet living things are extremely diverse. How do scientists make sense of the diversity of living things? How do modern scientists classify organisms? What types of traits do they use? Define taxonomy. Outline Linnaeus contributions to taxonomy. Describe the three-domain system of classification. Decide how viruses should be classified. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  binomial nomenclature class domain family genus (genera, plural) kingdom 
Linnaeus 	  order phylum (phyla, plural) species (singular and plural) taxon (taxa, plural) taxonomy virus 
Introduction 	  When you see an organism that you have never seen before, you probably group it with other, similar organisms without even thinking about it. You would probably classify it on the basis of obvious physical characteristics. For example, if an organism is green and has leaves, no doubt you would classify it as a plant. How would you classify the organisms in Figure 2.15? They look quite similar, but scientists place them in very different categories. The organism on the left is a type of fungus. The organism on the right is an animal called a sponge. In many ways, a sponge is no more like a fungus than you are. 
Taxonomy 	  Like you, scientists also group together similar organisms. The science of classifying living things is called taxonomy. Scientists classify living things in order to organize and make sense of the incredible diversity of life. Modern A fungus (left) and sponge (right) are placed in two different kingdoms of living things. scientists base their classifications mainly on molecular similarities. They group together organisms that have similar proteins and DNA. Molecular similarities show that organisms are related. In other words, they are descendants of a common ancestor in the past. 
Contributions of  Linnaeus 	  Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) is called the father of taxonomy. You may already be familiar with the classification system Linnaeus introduced. 
Linnaean  Classification  System 	  You can see the main categories, or taxa (taxon, singular), of the Linnaean system in Figure 2.16. As an example, the figure applies the Linnaean system to classify our own species, Homo sapiens. Although the Linnaean system has been revised, it forms the basis of modern classification systems. The broadest category in the Linnaean system is the kingdom. Figure 2.16 shows the Animal Kingdom because Homo sapiens belongs to that kingdom. Other kingdoms include the Plant Kingdom, Fungus Kingdom, and Protist Kingdom. Kingdoms are divided, in turn, into phyla (phylum, singular). Each phylum is divided into classes, each class into orders, each order into families, and each family into genera (genus, singular). Each genus is divided into one or more species. The species is the narrowest category in the Linnaean system. A species is defined as a group of organisms that can breed and produce fertile offspring together. 
Binomial  Nomenclature 	  Linnaeus is also famous for his method of naming species, which is still used today. The method is called binomial nomenclature. Every species is given a unique two-word name. Usually written in Latin, it includes the genus name followed by the species name. Both names are always written in italics, and the genus name is always capitalized. For example, the human species is named Homo sapiens. The species of the family dog is named Canis familiaris. Coming up with a scientific naming method may not seem like a big deal, but it really is. Prior to Linnaeus, there was no consistent way to name species. Names given to organisms by scientists were long and cumbersome. Often, different scientists came up with different names for the same species. Common names also differed, generally from one place to another. A single, short scientific name for each species avoided a lot of mistakes and confusion. 
Domains 	  When Linnaeus was naming and classifying organisms in the 1700s, almost nothing was known of microorganisms. With the development of powerful microscopes, scientists discovered many single-celled organisms that didnt fit into any of Linnaeus kingdoms. As a result, a new taxon, called the domain, was added to the classification system. The domain is even broader than the kingdom, as you can see in Figure 2.17. Most scientists think that all living things can be classified in three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. These domains are compared in Table 2.3. The Archaea Domain includes only the Archaea Kingdom, and the Bacteria Domain includes only the Bacteria Kingdom. The Eukarya Domain includes the Animal, Plant, Fungus, and Protist Kingdoms.

Yes 	  The Archaea and Bacteria Domains contain only single-celled organisms. Both Archaea and Bacteria have cells walls, but their cell walls are made of different materials. The cells of Archaea and Bacteria lack a nucleus. A nucleus is membrane-enclosed structure for holding a cells DNA. Some Eukarya are also single-celled, but many are multicellular. Some have a cell wall; others do not. However, the cells of all Eukarya have a nucleus and other organelles. Archaea and Bacteria may seem more similar to each other than either is to Eukarya. However, scientists think that Archaea may actually be more closely related to Eukarya than Bacteria are. This view is based on similarities in their DNA. How Should Viruses Be Classified? This question was posed at the beginning of the chapter. Should viruses be placed in one of the three domains of life? Are viruses living things? Before considering these questions, you need to know the characteristics of viruses. A virus is nothing more than some DNA or RNA surrounded by a coat of proteins. A virus is not a cell. A virus cannot use energy, respond to stimuli, grow, or maintain homeostasis. A virus cannot reproduce on its own. However, a virus can reproduce by infecting the cell of a living host. Inside the host cell, the virus uses the cells structures, materials, and energy to make copies of itself. Because they have genetic material and can reproduce, viruses can evolve. Their DNA or RNA can change through time. The ability to evolve is a very lifelike attribute. Many scientists think that viruses should not be classified as living things because they lack most of the defining traits of living things. Other scientists arent so sure. They think that the ability of viruses to evolve and interact with living cells earns them special consideration. Perhaps a new category of life should be created for viruses. What do you think? 
Lesson  Summary 	  Scientists classify living things to make sense of biodiversity and who how living things are related. The science of classifying living things is called taxonomy. Linnaeus introduced the classification system that forms the basis of modern classification. Taxa in the Linnaean system include the kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Linnaeus also developed binomial nomenclature for naming species. More recently, scientists have added the domain to the Linnaean system of classification. The domain is a broader taxon than the kingdom. There are three widely recognized domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.  Viruses lack many traits of living things so the majority of scientists do not classify them as living organisms.

S  Cells and  Their  Structures 	  This image shows a human cell as it looks under an electron microscope. The image makes the cell look thousands of times bigger than it really is. Clearly, cells are very small in size. However, their small size belies their importance to life. Like all other living things, you are made of cells. In fact, your body contains trillions of cells. Without cells, life as we know it would not exist. Youll learn more about these amazing building blocks of life when you read this chapter. Identify the basic parts of all cells. Compare and contrast prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Relate cell shape and cell function. Outline the levels of organization in living things. Explain why cells must be very small. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  cell membrane cell theory cytoplasm eukaryote eukaryotic cell nucleus organ organelle organ system prokaryote prokaryotic cell ribosome tissue 
Introduction 	  Cells are the building blocks of life. This is clear from the photo in Figure 3.1. It shows stacks upon stacks of cells in an onion plant. Cells are also the basic functional units of living things. They are the smallest units that can carry out the biochemical reactions of life. No matter how different organisms may be from one another, they all consist of cells. Moreover, all cells have the same basic parts and processes. Knowing about cells and how they function is necessary to understanding life itself. 
Discovery of  Cells and the  Cell  Theory 	  Cells were first discovered in the mid-1600s. The cell theory came about some 200 years later. You can see a reenactment of some of the discoveries that led to the cell theory in this video: URL scY_2QQbKU . 
Early  Observations of  Cells 	  British scientist Robert Hooke first discovered cells in 1665. He was one of the earliest scientists to study living things under a microscope. He saw that cork was divided into many tiny compartments, like little rooms. (Do the cells in Figure 3.1 look like little rooms to you too?) Hooke called these little rooms cells. Cork comes from trees, so what Hooke observed was dead plant cells. In the late 1600s, Dutch scientist Anton van Leeuwenhoek made more powerful microscopes. He used them to observe cells of other organisms. For example, he saw human blood cells and bacterial cells. Over the next century, microscopes were improved and more cells were observed. 
Development of the  Cell  Theory 	  By the early 1800s, scientists had seen cells in many different types of organisms. Every organism that was examined was found to consist of cells. From all these observations, German scientists Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden drew two major conclusions about cells. They concluded that: cells are alive. all living things are made of cells. Around 1850, a German doctor named Rudolf Virchow was observing living cells under a microscope. As he was watching, one of the cells happened to divide. Figure 3.2 shows a cell dividing, like the cell observed by Virchow. This was an aha moment for Virchow. He realized that living cells produce new cells by dividing. This was evidence that cells arise from other cells. The cell in the middle of this clump of cells is dividing. It will produce two identical daughter cells. The work of Schwann, Schleiden, and Virchow led to the cell theory. This is one of the most important theories in life science. The cell theory can be summed up as follows: All organisms consist of one or more cells. Cells are alive and the site of all life processes. All cells come from pre-existing cells. 
Structures  Found in  All  Cells 	  All cells have certain parts in common. These parts include the cell membrane, cytoplasm, DNA, and ribosomes. The cell membrane is a thin coat of phospholipids that surrounds the cell. Its like the skin of the cell. It forms a physical boundary between the contents of the cell and the environment outside the cell. It also controls what enters and leaves the cell. The cell membrane is sometimes called the plasma membrane. Cytoplasm is the material inside the cell membrane. It includes a watery substance called cytosol. Besides water, cytosol contains enzymes and other substances. Cytoplasm also includes other cell structures suspended in the cytosol. DNA is a nucleic acid found in cells. It contains genetic instructions that cells need to make proteins. Ribosomes are structures in the cytoplasm where proteins are made. They consist of RNA and proteins. These four components are found in all cells. They are found in the cells of organisms as different as bacteria and people. How did all known organisms come to have such similar cells? The answer is evolution. The similarities show that all life on Earth evolved from a common ancestor. 
Prokaryotic and  Eukaryotic  Cells 	  Besides the four parts listed above, many cells also have a nucleus. The nucleus of a cell is a structure enclosed by a membrane that contains most of the cells DNA. Cells are classified in two major groups based on whether or not they have a nucleus. The two groups are prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. 
Prokaryotic  Cells 	  Prokaryotic cells are cells that lack a nucleus. The DNA in prokaryotic cells is in the cytoplasm, rather than enclosed within a nuclear membrane. All the organisms in the Bacteria and Archaea Domains have prokaryotic cells. No other organisms have this type of cell. Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes. They are all single-celled organisms. They were the first type of organisms to evolve. They are still the most numerous organisms today. You can see a model of a prokaryotic cell in Figure 3.3. The cell in the figure is a bacterium. Notice how it contains a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and several other structures. However, the cell lacks a nucleus. The cells DNA is circular. It coils up in a mass called a nucleoid that floats in the cytoplasm. Prokaryotic Cell. This diagram shows the structure of a typical prokaryotic cell, a bacterium. Like other prokaryotic cells, this bacterial cell lacks a nucleus but has other cell parts, including a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA. Identify each of these parts in the diagram. 
Eukaryotic  Cells 	  Eukaryotic cells are cells that contain a nucleus. They are larger than prokaryotic cells. They are also more complex. Living things with eukaryotic cells are called eukaryotes. All of them belong to the Eukarya Domain. This domain includes protists, fungi, plants, and animals. Many protists consist of a single cell. However, most eukaryotes have more than one cell. You can see a model of a eukaryotic cell in Figure 3.4. The cell in the figure is an animal cell. The nucleus is an example of an organelle. An organelle is any structure inside a cell that is enclosed by a membrane. Eukaryotic cells may contain many different organelles. Each does a special job. For example, the mitochondrion is an organelle that provides energy to the cell. You can see a mitochondrion and several other organelles in the animal cell in Figure 3.4. Organelles allow eukaryotic cells to carry out more functions than prokaryotic cells can. 
Specialized  Cells 	  All living cells have certain things in common. Besides having the basic parts described above, all cells can perform the same basic functions. For example, all cells can use energy, respond to their environment, and reproduce. However, cells may also have special functions. Multicellular organisms such as you have many different types of specialized cells. Each specialized cell has a particular job. Cells with special functions generally have a shape that suits them for that job. The function of a nerve cell is to carry messages to other cells. It has many long arms that extend outward from the cell. The "arms" let the cell pass messages to many other cells at once. The function of a red blood cell is to carry oxygen to other cells. A red blood cell is small and smooth. This helps it slip through small blood vessels. A red blood cell is also shaped like a fattened disc. This gives it a lot of surface area for transferring oxygen. The function of a sperm cell is to swim through fluid to an egg cell. A sperm cell has a long tail that helps it swim. The function of a pollen cell is to pollinate flowers. The pollen cells in the figure have tiny spikes that help them stick to insects such as bees. The bees then carry the pollen cells to other flowers for pollination. Examples of specialized cells include (a) nerve cells, (b) red blood cells, (c) sperm cells, and (d) pollen cells 
Levels of  Organization 	  Cells and organelles are made of biochemical molecules. These include nucleic acids and proteins. Molecules, in turn, are made of atoms. Figure 3.6 shows these different levels of organization in living things. As you can see in Figure 3.6, living things also have levels of organization higher than the cell. These higher levels are found only in multicellular organisms with specialized cells. Specialized cells may be organized into tissues. A tissue is a group of cells of the same kind that performs the same function. For example, muscle cells are organized into muscle tissue. The function of muscle tissue is to contract in order to move the body or its parts. Tissues may be organized into organs. An organ is a structure composed of two or more types of tissue that work together to do a specific task. For example, the heart is an organ. It consists of muscle, nerve, and other types of tissues. Its task is to pump blood. Organs may be organized into organ systems. An organ system is a group of organs that work together to do the same job. For example, the heart is part of the cardiovascular system. This system also includes blood vessels and blood. The job of the cardiovascular system is to transport substances in blood to and from cells throughout the body. 
Levels of organization in living things 	  Organ systems are organized into the organism. The different organ systems work together to carry out all the life functions of the individual. For example, cardiovascular and respiratory systems work together to provide the individual with oxygen and rid it of carbon dioxide. 
Why  Cells  Are  So  Small 	  Cells with different functions often vary in shape. They may also vary in size. However, all cells are very small. Even the largest organisms have microscopic cells. Cells are so small that their diameter is measured in micrometers. A micrometer is just one-millionth of a meter. Use the sliding scale at the following link to see how small cells and cell parts are compared with other objects. URL Why are cells so small? The answer has to do with the surface area and volume of cells. To carry out life processes, a cell must be able to pass substances into and out of the cell. For example, it must be able to pass nutrients into the cell and waste products out of the cell. Anything that enters or leaves a cell has to go through the cell membrane on the surface of the cell. A bigger cell needs more nutrients and creates more wastes. As the size of a cell increases, its volume increases more quickly that its surface area. If the volume of a cell becomes too great, it wont have enough surface area to transfer all of its nutrients and wastes. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The cell theory states that all organisms consist of one or more cells; cells are alive and the site of all life processes; and all cells come from pre-existing cells. All cells have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, DNA, and ribosomes. Cells are either prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus, or eukaryotic cells, which have a nucleus. Cells may be specialized for different functions. They generally have a shape that suits their function. In multicellular organisms, specialized cells may be organized into tissues. Tissues may be organized into organs, and organs may be organized into organ systems. Organ systems work together to carry out all the functions of the whole organism. 
Think  Critically 	  All eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and other organelles. Each organelle has a special job to do. Describe the structure and functions of the cell membrane. Identify the parts and roles of the cytoplasm and cytoskeleton. List organelles in eukaryotic cells and their special jobs. Describe structures found in plant cells but not animal cells. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  ATP (adenosine triphosphate) cell wall central vacuole centriole cytoskeleton endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
Golgi apparatus 	  lysosome mitochondrion (mitochondria, plural) vacuole vesicle 
Introduction 	  In some ways, a cell resembles a plastic bag full of Jell-O. Its basic structure is a cell membrane filled with cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell is like Jell-O containing mixed fruit. It also contains a nucleus and other organelles. 
Cell  Membrane 	  The cell membrane is like the bag holding the Jell-O. It encloses the cytoplasm of the cell. It forms a barrier between the cytoplasm and the environment outside the cell. The function of the cell membrane is to protect and support the cell. It also controls what enters or leaves the cell. It allows only certain substances to pass through. It keeps other substances inside or outside the cell. 
Structure of the  Cell  Membrane 	  The structure of the cell membrane explains how it can control what enters and leaves the cell. The membrane is composed mainly of two layers of phospholipids. Figure 3.8 shows how the phospholipids are arranged in the cell membrane. Each phospholipid molecule has a head and two tails. The heads are water loving (hydrophilic), and the tails are water fearing (hydrophobic). The water-loving heads are on the outer surfaces of the cell membrane. They point toward the watery cytoplasm within the cell or the watery fluid that surrounds the cell. The water-fearing tails are in the middle of the cell membrane. 
How the  Cell  Membrane  Works 	  Hydrophobic molecules like to be near other hydrophobic molecules. They fear being near hydrophilic molecules. The opposite is true of hydrophilic molecules. They like to be near other hydrophilic molecules. They fear being near hydrophobic molecules. These likes and fears explain why some molecules can pass through the cell membrane while others cannot. Hydrophobic molecules can pass through the cell membrane. Thats because they like the hydrophobic interior of the membrane and fear the hydrophilic exterior of the membrane. Hydrophilic molecules cant pass through the cell membrane. Thats because they like the hydrophilic exterior of the membrane and fear the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. You can see how this works in the video at this link: URL . 
Cytoplasm and  Cytoskeleton 	  Cytoplasm is everything inside the cell membrane (except the nucleus if there is one). It includes the watery, gel-like cytosol. It also includes other structures. The water in the cytoplasm makes up about two-thirds of the cells weight. It gives the cell many of its properties. 
Roles of  Cytoplasm 	  Why does a cell have cytoplasm? Cytoplasm has several important functions. These include: suspending cell organelles. pushing against the cell membrane to help the cell keep its shape.  providing a site for many of the biochemical reactions of the cell. 
Cytoskeleton 	  Crisscrossing the cytoplasm is a structure called the cytoskeleton. It consists of thread-like filaments and tubules. The cytoskeleton is like a cellular skeleton. It helps the cell keep its shape. It also holds cell organelles in place within the cytoplasm. 
Organelles 	  Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and several other types of organelles. These structures carry out many vital cell functions. 
Nucleus 	  The nucleus is the largest organelle in a eukaryotic cell. It contains most of the cells DNA. DNA, in turn, contains the genetic code. This code tells the cell which proteins to make and when to make them. You can see a diagram of a cell nucleus in Figure 3.10. Besides DNA, the nucleus contains a structure called a nucleolus. Its function is to form ribosomes. The membrane enclosing the nucleus is called the nuclear envelope. The envelope has tiny holes, or pores, in it. The pores allow substances to move into and out of the nucleus. 
Mitochondrion 	  The mitochondrion (mitochondria, plural) is an organelle that makes energy available to the cell. Its like the power plant of a cell. It uses energy in glucose to make smaller molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP packages energy in smaller amounts that cells can use. Think about buying a bottle of water from a vending machine. The machine takes only quarters, and you have only dollar bills. The dollar bills wont work in the vending machine. Glucose is like a dollar bill. It contains too much energy for cells to use. ATP is like a quarter. It contains just the right amount of energy for use by cells. 
Ribosomes 	  A ribosome is a small organelle where proteins are made. Its like a factory in the cell. It gathers amino acids and joins them together into proteins. Unlike other organelles, the ribosome is not surrounded by a membrane. As a result, some scientists do not classify it as an organelle. Ribosomes may be found floating in the cytoplasm. Some ribosomes are located on the surface of another organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum. 
Endoplasmic  Reticulum 	  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that helps make and transport proteins and lipids. Its made of folded membranes. Bits of membrane can pinch off to form tiny sacs called vesicles. The vesicles carry proteins or lipids away from the ER. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum. They are called rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Both types are shown in Figure 3.11. NOTE: Crop to include only part a of the original image.] RER and SER are located outside the cell nucleus. The red dots on the RER are ribosomes. 
Golgi  Apparatus 	  The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that sends proteins and lipids where they need to go. Its like a post office. It receives molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum. It packages and labels the molecules. Then it sends them where they are needed. Some molecules are sent to different parts of the cell. Others are sent to the cell membrane for transport out of the cell. Small bits of membrane pinch off the Golgi apparatus to enclose and transport the proteins and lipids. You can see a Golgi apparatus at work in this animation: URL 
Vesicles and  Vacuoles 	  Both vesicles and vacuoles are sac-like organelles. They store and transport materials in the cell. They are like movable storage containers. Some vacuoles are used to isolate materials that are harmful to the cell. Other vacuoles are used to store needed substances such as water. Vesicles are much smaller than vacuoles and have a variety of functions. Some vesicles pinch off from the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. These vesicles store and transport proteins and lipids. Other vesicles are used as chambers for biochemical reactions. 
Lysosomes 	  A lysosome is an organelle that recycles unneeded molecules. It uses enzymes to break down the molecules into their components. Then the components can be reused to make new molecules. Lysosomes are like recycling centers. 
Centrioles 	  Centrioles are organelles that are found only in animal cells. They are located near the nucleus. They help organize the DNA in the nucleus before cell division takes place. They ensure that the DNA divides correctly when the cell divides. 
Special  Structures in  Plant  Cells 	  All but one of the structures described above are found in plant cells as well as animal cells. The only exception is centrioles, which are not found in plant cells. Plant cells have three additional structures that are not found in animals cells. These include a cell wall, large central vacuole, and organelles called plastids. You can see these structures in the model of a plant cell in Figure 3.12. You can also see them in the interactive plant cell at this link: URL 
Cell  Wall 	  The cell wall is a rigid layer that surrounds the cell membrane of a plant cell. Its made mainly of the complex carbohydrate called cellulose. The cell wall supports and protects the cell. The cell wall isnt solid like a brick wall. It has tiny holes in it called pores. The pores let water, nutrients, and other substances move into and out of the cell. 
Central  Vacuole 	  Most plant cells have a large central vacuole. It can make up as much as 90 percent of a plant cells total volume. The central vacuole is like a large storage container. It may store substances such as water, enzymes, and salts. It may have other roles as well. For example, the central vacuole helps stems and leaves hold their shape. It may also contain pigments that give flowers their colors. 
Plastids 	  Plastids are organelles in plant cells that may have various jobs. The main types of plastids are chloroplasts, chromoplasts, and leucoplasts. Chloroplasts are plastids that contain chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a green pigment. It gives plants their green color. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts. They capture sunlight and use its energy to make glucose. Chromoplasts are plastids that contain other pigments.	These other pigments give flowers and fruits their colors. Leucoplasts are plastids that make or store other molecules. For example, some leucoplasts make amino acids. Other leucoplasts store starch or oil. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The cell membrane consists of two layers of phospholipids. It encloses the cytoplasm and controls what enters and leaves the cell. The cytoplasm consists of watery cytosol and cell structures. It has several functions. The cytoskeleton is the skeleton of the cell. It helps the cell keep its shape. Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and other organelles. They include the mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles, vacuoles, lysosomes, andin animal cellscentrioles. Each type of organelle has a special function. Plant cells have several structures not found in animal cells. They include a cell wall, large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts. 
Think  Critically 	  Molecules that enter or leave a cell must pass through the cell membrane. Some of these molecules may be hydrophilic. Other may be too large to squeeze between the phospholipid molecules of the membrane. 
S  Cell  Functions 	  This window screen has a fly on it. In a way, the window screen is like a cell membrane. It lets some things pass through while keeping other things out. Air molecules and raindrops can pass through the screen, but larger objects like the fly cannot. In the first lesson of this chapter, youll learn about different ways that substances can pass through the cell membrane. Youll find out how the cell membrane lets some substances pass through while keeping other substances out. Describe the structure of the cell membrane. Identify ways that passive transport occurs. Define and give examples of active transport.

Introduction 	  The cell is the site of all of the basic biochemical processes that keep organisms alive. To do its work, the cell needs substances such as oxygen, water, and glucose. The cell also must get rid of substances, including wastes such as carbon dioxide. In addition, harmful substances must be kept out of the cell. Controlling what enters or leaves a cell is an important role of the cell membrane. 
The  Cell  Membrane 	  Youve probably blown soap bubbles like the child in Figure 4.1. In some ways, the thin film of soap molecules that forms a bubble resembles the cell membrane. Like the soap film, the cell membrane consists of a thin skin of molecules. You can see a model of the cell membrane in Figure below. The molecules that make up the cell membrane are mainly phospholipids. There are two layers of phospholipids. They are arranged so the lipid tails are on the inside of the membrane. They make the interior of the membrane hydrophobic, or "water fearing". The lipid heads point toward the outside of the membrane. The make the outer surfaces of the membrane hydrophilic, or "water loving". Different types of proteins are embedded in the lipid layers. The proteins are needed to help transport many substances across the membrane. The passage of a substance through a cell membrane is called transport. There are two basic ways that transport can occur: passive transport and active transport. For a good video introduction to passive and active transport, click on this link: URL . 
Passive  Transport 	  Passive transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane without needing any energy to pass through. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is more concentrated to an area where it is less concentrated. Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. Lets say you dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water. Then you dissolve two teaspoons of salt in another cup of water. The second solution will have a higher concentration of salt. Why does passive transport require no energy? A substance naturally moves from an area of higher to lower concentration. This is known as moving down the concentration gradient. The process is called diffusion. Its a little like a ball rolling down a hill. The ball naturally rolls from a higher to lower position without any added energy. You can see diffusion if you place a few drops of food coloring in a pan of water. Even without shaking or stirring, the food coloring gradually spreads throughout the water in the pan. Some substances can also diffuse through a cell membrane. This can occur in two ways: simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion. 
Simple  Diffusion 	  Simple diffusion occurs when a substance diffuses through a cell membrane without any help from other molecules. The substance simply passes through tiny spaces in the membrane. It moves from the side of the membrane where it is more concentrated to the side where it is less concentrated. You can see how this happens in Figure 4.2. Simple diffusion of molecules (blue) from outside to inside a cell membrane Substances that cross cell membranes by simple diffusion must squeeze between the lipid molecules in the membrane. As a result, the diffusing molecules must be very small. Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are examples of molecules that can cross cell membranes this way. When you breathe in, oxygen is more concentrated in the air in your lungs than it is in your blood. So oxygen diffuses from your lungs to your blood. The reverse happens with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is more concentrated in your blood than it is in the air in your lungs. So carbon dioxide diffuses out of your blood to your lungs. 
Facilitated  Diffusion 	  Hydrophilic molecules and very large molecules cant pass through the cell membrane by simple diffusion. They need help to pass through the membrane. The help is provided by proteins called transport proteins. This process is known as facilitated diffusion. There are two types of transport proteins: channel proteins and carrier proteins. They work in different ways. You can see how they work in Figure 4.3. A channel protein forms a tiny hole called a pore in the cell membrane. This allows water or hydrophilic molecules to bypass the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. A carrier protein binds with a diffusing molecule. This causes the carrier protein to change shape. As it does, it carries the molecule across the membrane. This allows large molecules to pass through the cell membrane. 
Osmosis 	  Osmosis is the special case of the diffusion of water. Its an important means of transport in cells because the fluid inside and outside cells is mostly water. Water can pass through the cell membrane by simple diffusion, but it can happen more quickly with the help of channel proteins. Water moves in or out of a cell by osmosis until its concentration is the same on both sides of the cell membrane. 
Active  Transport 	  Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. 
Sodium- Potassium  Pump 	  Sodium and potassium are two of the most important elements in living things. They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell and potassium ions (K+) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this "uphill" process. Figure 4.4 shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure: 
Vesicle  Transport 	  Some substances are too big to be pumped across the cell membrane. They may enter or leave the cell by vesicle transport. This takes energy, so its another form of active transport. You can see how vesicle transport occurs in Figure 4.5. Vesicle transport out of the cell is called exocytosis. A vesicle containing the substance moves through the cytoplasm to the cell membrane. Then the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and releases the substance outside the cell. You can watch this happening in this very short animation: URL ?v=V2FrQB6rX34 . Vesicle transport into the cell is called endocytosis. The cell membrane engulfs the substance. Then a vesicle pinches off from the membrane and carries the substance into the cell. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The cell membrane consists of two layers of phospholipids. Transport proteins are embedded in the layers. The movement of substances across the cell membrane may be by passive or active transport. Passive transport requires no energy because it moves substances by diffusion, from an area of higher to lower concentration. This happen by simple diffusion or by facilitated diffusion, which requires the help of transport proteins. Active transport requires energy because it moves substances from an area of lower to higher concentration. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. Another form of active transport is vesicle transport, which is needed for very large molecules.

Introduction 	  All living things need energy. You can often see energy at work in living things. Look at the hummingbird and jellyfish in Figure 4.6. Both of them are obviously using energy. Living things constantly use energy in less obvious ways as well. Inside every cell, all living things need energy to carry out life processes. Life runs on chemical energy. Where does this chemical energy come from? Some ways living things use energy are to move and to produce light. On the left, a hummingbirds wings are a blur of motion. On the right, a jellyfish glows with its own light. 
Making  Glucose 	  Chemical energy that organisms need comes from food. The nearly universal food for life is the sugar glucose. Glucose is a simple carbohydrate with the chemical formula C6H12O6. The glucose molecule stores chemical energy in a concentrated, stable form. In your body, glucose is the form of energy that is carried in your blood and taken up by each of your trillions of cells. What Is Photosynthesis? What is the source of glucose for living things? It is made by plants and certain other organisms. The process in which glucose is made using energy in light is photosynthesis. This process requires carbon dioxide and water. It produces oxygen in addition to glucose. Photosynthesis consists of many chemical reactions. Overall, the reactions of photosynthesis can be summed up by this chemical equation: In words, this means that six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) combine with six molecules of water (H2O) in the presence of light energy. This produces one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) and six molecules of oxygen (O2). Use this interactive animation to learn more about photosynthesis: URL Click on this link for a song about photosynthesis to reinforce the basic ideas: URL 1_uez5WX1o . 
Autotrophs vs.  Heterotrophs 	  Types of organisms that make glucose by photosynthesis are pictured in Figure 4.7. They include plants, plant-like protists such as algae, and some kinds of bacteria. Living things that make glucose are called autotrophs ("self feeders"). All other living things obtain glucose by eating autotrophs (or organisms that eat autotrophs). These living things are called heterotrophs ("other feeders"). Photosynthetic organisms include plants, algae, and some bacteria. 
Site of  Photosynthesis:  The  Chloroplast 	  In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts. (Photosynthetic bacteria have other structures for this purpose.) A chloroplast is a type of plastid, or plant organelle. It contains the green pigment known as chlorophyll. The presence of chloroplasts in plant cells is one of the major ways they differ from animal cells. You can see chloroplasts in plant cells Figure 4.8. The small green, circular structures in the plant cells pictured here are chloroplasts. 
Chloroplast  Structure 	  The structure of a chloroplast is shown in Figure 4.9. The chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes. Inside the chloroplast are stacks of flattened sacs of membrane, called thylakoids. The thylakoids contain chlorophyll. Surrounding the thylakoids is a space called the stroma. The stroma is filled with watery ("aqueous") fluid. 
How the  Chloroplast  Gets  Raw  Materials 	  In plants, most chloroplasts are found in the leaves. Therefore, all the raw materials needed for photosynthesis must be present in the leaves. These materials include light, water, and carbon dioxide. The shape of the leaves gives them a lot of surface area to absorb light for photosynthesis. Roots take up water from the soil. Stems carry the water from the roots to the leaves. Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through tiny openings called stomata. (The oxygen released during photosynthesis also exits the leaves through the stomata.) 
Stages of  Photosynthesis 	  Photosynthesis occurs in two stages, called the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. Figure 4.10 sums up what happens in these two stages. Both stages are described below. 
Light  Reactions 	  The light reactions occur in the first stage of photosynthesis. This stage takes place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. In the light reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll. This energy is temporarily transferred to two molecules: ATP and NADPH. These molecules are used to store the energy for the second stage of photosynthesis. The light reactions use water and produce oxygen. 
Calvin  Cycle 	  The Calvin cycle occurs in the second stage of photosynthesis. This stage takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is used to produce glucose (sugar) using the energy stored in ATP and NADPH. The energy is released from these molecules when ATP loses phosphate (Pi) to become ADP and NADPH loses hydrogen (H) to become NADP+. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Most living things use glucose for energy. The process in which glucose is made using light energy is photosynthesis. Water and carbon dioxide are needed for this process, and oxygen is produced as a byproduct. Photosynthetic organisms include plants, algae, and some bacteria. In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain stacks of membranes called thylakoids, which contain chlorophyll. Thylakoids are surrounded by a fluid-filled space called stroma. Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. The light reactions take place in the thylakoids. They capture light energy. The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma. It uses the energy to produce glucose from carbon dioxide. 
Think  Critically 	  The flow of energy through living things begins with photosynthesis. This process stores energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of glucose. All cells take up glucose for energy. Summarize what happens during cellular respiration and where it takes place. Outline the three stages of cellular respiration and how much ATP is made in each stage. Explain how cellular respiration and photosynthesis are related. Describe two types of fermentation. Identify advantages of aerobic and anaerobic respiration. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  aerobic anaerobic cellular respiration electron transport fermentation glycolysis 
Introduction 	  If youre like astronaut Chris Hadfield in Figure 4.11, you grab a piece of fruit when you need a boost of energy. Most fruits are good sources of glucose. Glucose is the simple sugar that living things use to store and transport energy. Glucose is taken up by all of your cells. However, cells dont use the energy in glucose directly. They first need to release the energy and store it in ATP, or adenosine triphosphate. The much smaller amount of energy stored in ATP is just right for fueling cell processes. How do your cells change glucose to ATP? It happens during cellular respiration. 
Using  Glucose to  Make  	  Cellular respiration is the process in which cells break down glucose, release the stored energy, and use the energy to make ATP. For each glucose molecule that undergoes this process, up to 38 molecules of ATP are produced. Each ATP molecules forms when a phosphate is added to ADP, or adenosine diphosphate. This requires energy, which is stored in the ATP molecule. When cells need energy, a phosphate can be removed from ATP. This releases the energy and forms ADP again. Astronaut Chris Hadfield eats a banana aboard the International Space Station. What Happens During Cellular Respiration? Cellular respiration involves many biochemical reactions. However, the overall process can be summed up in a single chemical equation: C6H12O6 + 6O2 ? 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy (stored in ATP) Cellular respiration uses oxygen in addition to glucose. It releases carbon dioxide and water as waste products. Cellular respiration actually "burns" glucose for energy. However, it doesnt produce light or intense heat like burning a candle or log. Instead, it releases the energy slowly, in many small steps. The energy is used to form dozens of molecules of ATP. Where Does Cellular Respiration Take Place? Cellular respiration takes place in the cells of all organisms. It occurs in autotrophs such as plants as well as heterotrophs such as animals. Cellular respiration begins in the cytoplasm of cells. It is completed in mitochondria. The mitochondrion is a membrane-enclosed organelle in the cytoplasm. Its sometimes called the "powerhouse" of the cell because of its role in cellular respiration. Figure 4.12 shows the parts of the mitochondrion involved in cellular respiration. 
Stages of  Cellular  Respiration 	  Cellular respiration occurs in three stages. The flow chart in Figure dont purge me shows the order in which the stages occur and how much ATP forms in each stage. The names of the stages are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport. Each stage is described below. 
Stage 1:  Glycolysis 	  Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration. It takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. The world glycolysis means "glucose splitting". Thats exactly what happens in this stage. Enzymes split a molecule of glucose into 
Cut-away view of a mitochondrion 	  two smaller molecules called pyruvate. This results in a net gain of two molecules of ATP. Other energy-storing molecules are also produced. (Their energy will be used in stage 3 to make more ATP.) Glycolysis does not require oxygen. Anything that doesnt need oxygen is described as anaerobic. 
Stage 2:  The  Krebs  Cycle 	  The pyruvate molecules from glycolysis next enter the matrix of a mitochondrion. Thats where the second stage of cellular respiration takes place. This stage is called the Krebs cycle. During this stage, two more molecules of ATP are produced. Other energy-storing molecules are also produced (to be used to make more ATP in stage 3). The Krebs cycle requires oxygen. Anything that needs oxygen is described as aerobic. The oxygen combines with the carbon from the pyruvate molecules. This forms carbon dioxide, a waste product. 
Stage 3:  Electron  Transport 	  The third and final stage of cellular respiration is called electron transport. Remember the other energy-storing molecules from glycolysis and the Krebs cycle? Their energy is used in this stage to make many more molecules of ATP. In fact, during this stage, as many as 34 molecules of ATP are produced. Electron transport requires oxygen, so this stage is also aerobic. The oxygen combines with hydrogen from the energy-storing molecules. This forms water, another waste product. 
Cellular  Respiration and  Photosynthesis 	  Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are like two sides of the same coin. This is clear from the diagram in Figure 4.14. The products of photosynthesis are needed for cellular respiration. The products of cellular respiration are needed for photosynthesis. Together, the two processes store and release energy in virtually all living things. 
Fermentation 	  Some organisms can produce ATP from glucose anaerobically. One way this happens is called fermentation. Fermentation includes the glycolysis step of cellular respiration. However, it doesnt include the other, aerobic steps. There are two types of fermentation: lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation. 
Lactic  Acid  Fermentation 	  In lactic acid fermentation, glycolysis is followed by a step that produces lactic acid. This step forms additional molecules of ATP. Lactic acid fermentation occurs in some bacteria, including the bacteria in yogurt. The lactic acid gives unsweetened yogurt its sour taste. Your own muscle cells can also undertake lactic acid fermentation. This occurs when the cells are working very hard. They use fermentation because they cant get oxygen fast enough for aerobic respiration to supply them with all the energy they need. The muscle cells of the hurdlers in Figure 4.15 are using lactic acid fermentation by the time the athletes reach finish line. The muscles of these hurdlers are working too hard for aerobic respiration to keep them supplied with energy. 
Alcoholic  Fermentation 	  In alcoholic fermentation, glycolysis is followed by a step that produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. This step also forms additional molecules of ATP. It occurs in yeast, such as the yeast in bread. Carbon dioxide from alcoholic fermentation creates gas bubbles in bread dough. The bubbles leave little holes in the bread after it bakes. You can see them in the bread in Figure 4.16. The holes make the bread light and fluffy. 
Aerobic vs.  Anaerobic  Respiration 	  Both aerobic and anaerobic respiration have certain advantages. Aerobic respiration releases far more energy than anaerobic respiration does. It results in the formation of many more molecules of ATP. Anaerobic respiration is much quicker than aerobic respiration. It also allows organisms to live in places where there is little or no oxygen, such as deep under water or soil. For an entertaining review of aerobic and anaerobic respiration, watch this creative music video: URL be.com/watch?v=FHWbjnzfi_U . Bread has little holes in it from carbon dioxide produced by yeast. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Cellular respiration is the process in which cells break down glucose, release the stored energy, and use it to make ATP. The process begins in the cytoplasm and is completed in a mitochondrion. Cellular respiration occurs in three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport. Glycolysis is an anaerobic process. The other two stages are aerobic processes. The products of cellular respiration are needed for photosynthesis, and vice versa. Together, the two processes store and release energy in virtually all living things. Some organisms can produce ATP from glucose anaerobically. One way is by fermentation. There are two types of fermentation: lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation. Both aerobic and anaerobic respiration have certain advantages. 
Think  Critically 	  Obtaining energy from glucose is one of the basic functions of cells. Another basic function of living cells is dividing. 
Chapter  Outline 	  This baby boy is just a few days old, but his body already consists of billions of cells. By the time hes as big as his father, his body will contain trillions of cells. Like all other organisms, the baby actually started out in life as a single cell. How do we develop from a single cell into an organism with trillions of cells? The answer is cell division. Outline the process of DNA replication. Compare and contrast cell division in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Describe the four phases of mitosis in eukaryotic cells. Identify the stages of the cell cycle in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

Introduction 	  Cell division is the process in which a cell divides to form two new cells. The original cell is called the parent cell. The two new cells are called daughter cells. All cells contain DNA. DNA is the nucleic acid that stores genetic information. Before a cell divides its DNA must be copied. That way, each daughter cell gets a complete copy of the parent cells genetic material. 
Copying  	  DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a very large molecule. It consists of two strands of smaller molecules called nucleotides. Before learning how DNA is copied, its a good idea to review its structure. 
A  Structure 	  As you can see in Figure 5.1, each nucleotide includes a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogen base. The sugar in DNA is called deoxyribose. There are four different nitrogen bases in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Chemical bonds between the bases hold the two strands of DNA together. Adenine always bonds with thymine, and cytosine always bonds with guanine. These pairs of bases are called complementary base pairs. 
Chromosomes 	  As a cell prepares to divide, its DNA first forms one or more structures called chromosomes. A chromosome consists of DNA and protein molecules coiled into a definite shape. Chromosomes are circular in prokaryotes and rodlike in eukaryotes. You can see an example of a human chromosome in Figure below. The rest of the time, DNA looks like a tangled mass of strings. In this form, it would be very difficult to copy and divide. 
A  Replication 	  The process in which DNA is copied is called DNA replication. You can see how it happens in Figure 5.3. An enzyme breaks the bonds between the two DNA strands. Another enzyme pairs new, complementary nucleotides with those in the original chains. Two daughter DNA molecules form. Each contains one new chain and one original chain. 
Cell  Division in  Prokaryotic and  Eukaryotic  Cells 	  How cell division proceeds depends on whether a cell has a nucleus. Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus. Their DNA is in the cytoplasm. It forms just one circular chromosome. Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus holding their DNA. Their DNA forms multiple rodlike chromosomes, like the one in Figure 5.2. Eukaryotic cells also have other organelles. For these reasons, cell division is more complex in eukaryotic cells. 
Prokaryotic  Cell  Division 	  You can see how a prokaryotic cell divides in Figure 5.4. This type of cell division is called binary fission. The cell simply splits into two equal halves. Binary fission occurs in bacteria and other prokaryotes. It takes place in three continuous steps: 
Eukaryotic  Cell  Division 	  Before a eukaryotic cell divides, the nucleus and other organelles must be copied. Only then will each daughter cell have all the needed structures. These three steps are shown in Figure 5.6. 
Mitosis 	  Mitosis, or division of the nucleus, occurs only in eukaryotic cells. By the time mitosis occurs, the cells DNA has already replicated. Mitosis occurs in four phases, called prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. You can see what happens in each phase in Figure below. The phases are described below. You can also learn more about the phases of mitosis by watching this video: URL . 
The  Cell  Cycle 	  Cell division is just one of the stages that a cell goes through during its lifetime. All of the stages that a cell goes through make up the cell cycle. 
Prokaryotic  Cell  Cycle 	  The cell cycle of a prokaryotic cell is simple. The cell grows in size, its DNA replicates, and the cell divides. 
Eukaryotic  Cell  Cycle 	  In eukaryotes, the cell cycle is more complicated. The diagram in Figure 5.7 shows the stages that a eukaryotic cell goes through in its lifetime. There are two main stages: interphase and mitotic phase. They are described below. You can watch a eukaryotic cell going through the phases of the cell cycle at this link: URL ll_cycle.htm Interphase is longer than mitotic phase. Interphase, in turn, is divided into three phases: Mitotic phase is when the cell divides. It includes mitosis (M) and cytokinesis (C). 
Lesson  Summary 	  DNA is the nucleic acid that stores genetic information. It must be copied before a cell divides. DNA replication is the process in which DNA is copied. Cell division is the process in which a parent cell divides to form two daughter cells. It occurs by binary fusion in most prokaryotic cells. It is more complex in eukaryotic cells. Mitosis is the process by which the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell divides. It happens in four phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Cell division is just one stage of the cell cycle. The cell cycle includes all of the stages in the life of a cell. The cell cycle is more complex in eukaryotic than prokaryotic cells. 
Think  Critically 	  Cell division is how organisms grow and replace worn out or damaged cells. Its also how they produce offspring. Producing offspring is known as reproduction. How do you think prokaryotes reproduce? How do you think multicellular eukaryotes reproduce? Identify three methods of asexual reproduction. Give an overview of sexual reproduction. Explain how meiosis produces haploid gametes. State advantages of asexual and sexual reproduction. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  asexual reproduction diploid egg fertilization gamete haploid homologous chromosomes meiosis sexual reproduction sperm zygote 
Introduction 	  Reproduction is how organisms produce offspring. The ability to reproduce is a characteristic of all living things. In some species, all the offspring are genetically identical to the parent. In other species, each offspring is genetically unique. Look at the kittens in Figure 5.8. They are brothers and sisters, but they are all different from each other. Why does this happen in some species but not others? Its because there are two types of reproduction. Reproduction can be sexual or asexual. 
Asexual  Reproduction 	  Asexual reproduction is simpler than sexual reproduction. It involves just one parent. The offspring are genetically identical to each other and to the parent. All prokaryotes and some eukaryotes reproduce this way. There are several different methods of asexual reproduction. They include binary fission, fragmentation, and budding. These kittens have the same parents, but each kitten is unique. 
Binary  Fission 	  Binary fission occurs when a parent cell simply splits into two daughter cells. This method is described in detail in the lesson "Cell Division." Bacteria reproduce this way. You can see a bacterial cell reproducing by binary fission in Figure 5.9. 
Fragmentation 	  Fragmentation occurs when a piece breaks off from a parent organism. Then the piece develops into a new organism. Sea stars, like the one in Figure 5.10, can reproduce this way. In fact, a new sea star can form from a single arm. A sea star can reproduce by asexually by fragmentation. It can also reproduce sexually. 
Budding 	  Budding occurs when a parent cell forms a bubble-like bud. The bud stays attached to the parent while it grows and develops. It breaks away from the parent only after it is fully formed. Yeasts can reproduce this way. You can see two yeast cells budding in Figure 5.11. 
Sexual  Reproduction 	  Sexual reproduction is more complicated. It involves two parents. Special cells called gametes are produced by the parents. A gamete produced by a female parent is generally called an egg. A gamete produced by a male parent is usually called a sperm. An offspring forms when two gametes unite. The union of the two gametes is called fertilization. You can see a human sperm and egg uniting in Figure 5.12. The initial cell that forms when two gametes unite is called a zygote. 
Chromosome  Numbers 	  In species with sexual reproduction, each cell of the body has two copies of each chromosome. For example, human beings have 23 different chromosomes. Each body cell contains two of each chromosome, for a total of 46 chromosomes. You can see the 23 pairs of human chromosomes in Figure 5.13. The number of different types of chromosomes is called the haploid number. In humans, the haploid number is 23. The number of chromosomes in normal body cells is called the diploid number. The diploid number is twice the haploid number. In humans, the diploid number is two times 23, or 46. 
Homologous  Chromosomes 	  The two members of a given pair of chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. We get one of each homologous pair, or 23 chromosomes, from our father. We get the other one of each pair, or 23 chromosomes, from our mother. A gamete must have the haploid number of chromosomes. That way, when two gametes unite, the zygote will have the diploid number. How are haploid cells produced? The answer is meiosis. 
Meiosis 	  Meiosis is a special type of cell division. It produces haploid daughter cells. It occurs when an organism makes gametes. Meiosis is basically mitosis times two. The original diploid cell divides twice. The first time is called 
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in each body cell 	  meiosis I. The second time is called meiosis II. However, the DNA replicates only once. It replicates before meiosis I but not before meiosis II. This results in four haploid daughter cells. Meiosis I and meiosis II occurs in the same four phases as mitosis. The phases are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. However, meiosis I has an important difference. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and then separate. As a result, each daughter cell has only one chromosome from each homologous pair. 
Meiosis  	  After DNA replicates during interphase, the nucleus of the cell undergoes the four phases of meiosis I: 
Phases of meiosis  	  Meiosis I is followed by cytokinesis. Thats when the cytoplasm of the cell divides. Two haploid daughter cells result. Both of these cells go on to meiosis II. 
Meiosis  	  Meiosis II is just like mitosis. Meiosis II is also followed by cytokinesis. This time, four haploid daughter cells result. Thats because both daughter cells from meiosis I have gone through meiosis II. The four daughter cells must continue to develop before they become gametes. For example, in males, the cells must develop tails, among other changes, in order to become sperm. 
Advantages of  Sexual and  Asexual  Reproduction 	  Both types of reproduction have certain advantages. 
Advantage of  Asexual  Reproduction 	  Asexual reproduction can happen very quickly. It doesnt require two parents to meet and mate. Under ideal conditions, 100 bacteria can divide to produce millions of bacteria in just a few hours! Most bacteria dont live under ideal conditions. Even so, rapid reproduction may allow asexual organisms to be very successful. They may crowd out other species that reproduce more slowly. 
Advantage of  Sexual  Reproduction 	  Sexual reproduction is typically slower. However, it also has an advantage. Sexual reproduction results in offspring that are all genetically different. This can be a big plus for a species. The variation may help it adapt to changes in the environment. How does genetic variation arise during sexual reproduction? It happens in three ways: crossing over, independent assortment, and the random union of gametes. Crossing over occurs during meiosis I. It happens when homologous chromosomes pair up during prophase I. The paired chromosomes exchange bits of DNA. This recombines their genetic material. You can see where crossing over has occurred in Figures 5.15 and 5.16. Independent assortment occurs when chromosomes go to opposite poles of the cell in anaphase I. Which chromosomes end up together at each pole is a matter of chance. You can see this in Figures 5.15 and 5.16 as well. In sexual reproduction, two gametes unite to produce an offspring. Which two gametes is a matter of chance. The union of gametes occurs randomly. Due to these sources of variation, each human couple has the potential to produce more than 64 trillion unique offspring. No wonder we are all different! 
Lesson  Summary 	  Asexual reproduction involves just one parent. It produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent. Methods of asexual reproduction include binary fission, fragmentation, and budding. Sexual reproduction involves two parents. It produces offspring that are all genetically unique. It requires the production of haploid gametes. The union of gametes is called fertilization. It results in a diploid zygote. Haploid gametes are produced through meiosis. This is a special type of cell division. The cell divides twice, called meiosis I and meiosis II. However, the DNA replicates just once. Homologous chromosomes separate. The outcome is four haploid cells. Asexual reproduction has the advantage of occurring quickly. Sexual reproduction has the advantage of creating genetic variation. This can help a species adapt to environmental change. The genetic variation arises due to crossing over, independent assortment, and the random union of gametes. 
Think  Critically 	  All of our cells contain DNA. Meiosis ensures that each gamete receives a copy of each chromosome. Why do cells need DNA? What specific role does DNA play? Identify the structure and functions of RNA. Describe the genetic code and how to read it. Explain how proteins are made. List causes and effects of mutations.

Introduction 	  Blueprints, like those pictured in Figure 5.15, contain the instructions for building a house. Your cells also contain blueprints. They are encoded in the DNA of your chromosomes. 
A,  A, and  Proteins 	  DNA and RNA are nucleic acids. DNA stores genetic information. RNA helps build proteins. Proteins, in turn, determine the structure and function of all your cells. Proteins consist of chains of amino acids. A proteins structure and function depends on the sequence of its amino acids. Instructions for this sequence are encoded in DNA. In eukaryotic cells, chromosomes are contained within the nucleus. But proteins are made in the cytoplasm at structures called ribosomes. How do the instructions in DNA reach the ribosomes in the cytoplasm? RNA is needed for this task. 
Comparing  A with  	  RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. RNA is smaller than DNA. It can squeeze through pores in the membrane that encloses the nucleus. It copies instructions in DNA and carries them to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. Then it helps build the protein. RNA is not only smaller than DNA. It differs from DNA in other ways as well. It consists of one nucleotide chain rather than two chains as in DNA. It also contains the nitrogen base uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). In addition, it contains the sugar ribose instead of deoxyribose. You can see these differences in Figure 5.16. 
Types of  	  There are three different types of RNA. All three types are needed to make proteins. Messenger RNA (mRNA) copies genetic instructions from DNA in the nucleus. Then it carries the instructions to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) helps form a ribosome. This is where the protein is made. Transfer RNA (tRNA) brings amino acids to the ribosome. The amino acids are then joined together to make the protein. 
The  Genetic  Code 	  How is the information for making proteins encoded in DNA? The answer is the genetic code. The genetic code is based on the sequence of nitrogen bases in DNA. The four bases make up the letters of the code. Groups of three bases each make up code words. These three-letter code words are called codons. Each codon stands for one amino acid or else for a start or stop signal. There are 20 amino acids that make up proteins. With three bases per codon, there are 64 possible codons. This is more than enough to code for the 20 amino acids plus start and stop signals. You can see how to translate the genetic code in Figure 5.17. Start at the center of the chart for the first base of each three-base codon. Then work your way out from the center for the second and third bases. Find the codon AUG in Figure 5.17. It codes for the amino acid methionine. It also codes for the start signal. After an AUG start codon, the next three letters are read as the second codon. The next three letters after that are read as the third codon, and so on. You can see how this works in Figure 5.18. The figure shows the bases in a molecule of RNA. The codons are read in sequence until a stop codon is reached. UAG, UGA, and UAA are all stop codons. They dont code for any amino acids. 
Characteristics of the  Genetic  Code 	  The genetic code has three other important characteristics. The genetic code is the same in all living things. This shows that all organisms are related by descent from a common ancestor. Each codon codes for just one amino acid (or start or stop). This is necessary so the correct amino acid is always selected. Most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. This is helpful. It reduces the risk of the wrong amino acid being selected if there is a mistake in the code. 
Protein  Synthesis 	  The process in which proteins are made is called protein synthesis. It occurs in two main steps. The steps are transcription and translation. Watch this video for a good introduction to both steps of protein synthesis: URL ww.youtube.com/watch?v=h5mJbP23Buo . 
Transcription:  A ?  	  Transcription is the first step in protein synthesis. It takes place in the nucleus. During transcription, a strand of DNA is copied to make a strand of mRNA. How does this happen? It occurs by the following steps, as shown in Figure 5.19. 
Transcription step of protein synthesis 	  Translation is the second step in protein synthesis. It is shown in Figure 5.20. Translation takes place at a ribosome in the cytoplasm. During translation, the genetic code in mRNA is read to make a protein. Heres how it works: 
Causes of  Mutations 	  Mutations have many possible causes. Some mutations occur when a mistake is made during DNA replication or transcription. Other mutations occur because of environmental factors. Anything in the environment that causes a 
Translation step of protein synthesis 	  mutation is known as a mutagen. Examples of mutagens are shown in Figure 5.21. They include ultraviolet rays in sunlight, chemicals in cigarette smoke, and certain viruses and bacteria. 
Effects of  Mutations 	  Many mutations have no effect on the proteins they encode. These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders. Mutations also vary in their effects depending on whether they occur in gametes or in other cells of the body. Mutations that occur in gametes can be passed on to offspring.	An offspring that inherits a mutation in a gamete will have the mutation in all of its cells. Mutations that occur in body cells cannot be passed on to offspring. They are confined to just one cell and its daughter cells. These mutations may have little effect on an organism. 
Types of  Mutations 	  The effect of a mutation is likely to depend as well on the type of mutation that occurs. A mutation that changes all or a large part of a chromosome is called a chromosomal mutation. This type of mutation tends to be very serious. Sometimes chromosomes are missing or extra copies are present. An example is the mutation that causes Down syndrome. In this case, there is an extra copy of one of the chromosomes. Deleting or inserting a nitrogen base causes a frameshift mutation. All of the codons following the mutation are misread. This may be disastrous. To see why, consider this English-language analogy. Take the sentence The big dog ate the red cat. If the second letter of big is deleted, then the sentence becomes: The bgd oga tet her edc at. Deleting a single letter makes the rest of the sentence impossible to read. Some mutations change just one or a few bases in DNA. A change in just one base is called a point mutation. Table 5.1 compares different types of point mutations and their effects.

Lesson  Summary 	  DNA encodes instructions for proteins. RNA copies the genetic code in DNA and carries it to a ribosome. There, amino acids are joined together in the correct sequence to make a protein. The genetic code is based on the sequence of nitrogen bases in DNA. A code word, or codon, consists of three bases. Each codon codes for one amino acid or for a *Protein synthesis is the process in which proteins are made. In the first step, called transcription, the genetic code in DNA is copied by RNA. In the second step, called translation, the genetic code in RNA is read to make a protein. A mutation is a change in the base sequence of DNA or RNA. Environmental causes of mutations are called mutagens. The effects of a mutation depend on the type of mutation and whether it occurs in a gamete or body cell. 
Think  Critically 	  Offspring generally resemble their parents. This is true even when the offspring are not genetically identical to the parents. Can you apply your knowledge of reproduction and protein synthesis to explain why offspring and parents have similar traits? 
S  Genetics 	  Believe it or not, but this pea plant holds the secrets of heredity. A monk named Gregor Mendel studied pea plants like this one in the 1800s. From his research, he discovered how parents pass traits to their offspring. Mendels discoveries apply to you as well as to peas. In fact, they apply to all living things that reproduce sexually. In this chapter, youll read about Mendels experiments. Youll also learn the secrets of heredity he discovered. Identify Mendel, and explain why peas were good plants for him to study. Outline Mendels experiments, and state his laws of heredity. Summarize Mendels scientific legacy.

Introduction 	  People have long known that offspring are similar to their parents. Whether its puppies or people, offspring and parents usually share many traits. However, before Gregor Mendels research, people didnt know how parents pass traits to their offspring. 
A  Monk and  His  Peas 	  Mendel was an Austrian Monk who lived in the 1800s. You can see his picture in Figure 6.1. 
Mendel the  Scientist 	  Mendel didnt call himself a scientist. But he had all the traits of good scientist. He was observant and curious, and he asked a lot of questions. He also tried to find answers to his questions by doing experiments. Working alone in his garden in the mid-1800s, he grew thousands of pea plants over many years. He carefully crossed plants with different traits. Then he observed what traits showed up in their offspring. He repeated each experiment many times. Why Study Peas? Pea plants were a good choice to study for several reasons. One reason is that they are easy to grow. They also grow quickly. In addition, peas have many traits that are easy to observe, and each trait exists in two different forms. Figure 6.2 shows the traits that Mendel studied in pea plants. For example, one trait is flower color. Flowers may be either white or violet. Another trait is stem length. Plants may be either tall or short. Pea plants reproduce sexually. The male gametes are released by tiny grains of pollen. The female gametes lie deep within the flowers. Fertilization occurs when pollen from one flower reaches the female gametes in the same or a different flower. This is called pollination. Mendel was able to control which plants pollinated each other. He transferred pollen by hand from flower to flower. 
Mendels  Experiments and  Laws of  Heredity 	  At first, Mendel studied one trait at a time. This was his first set of experiments. These experiments led to his first law, the law of segregation. Then Mendel studied two traits at a time. This was his second set of experiments. These experiments led to his second law, the law of independent assortment. 
Mendels  First  Set of  Experiments 	  An example of Mendels first set of experiments is his research on flower color. He transferred pollen from a plant with white flowers to a plant with violet flowers. This is called cross-pollination. Then Mendel observed flower color in their offspring. The offspring formed the first generation (F1). You can see the outcome of this experiment in Figure 6.3. All of the F1 plants had violet flowers. Mendel wondered, "What happened to the white form of the trait?" "Did it disappear?" If so, the F1 plants should have only violet-flowered offspring. Mendel let the FI plants pollinate themselves. This is called self-pollination. Then he observed flower color in their offspring. These offspring formed the second generation (F2). Surprisingly, the trait of white flowers showed up in the F2 plants. One out of every four F2 plants had white flowers. The other three out of four had violet flowers. In other words, F2 plants with violet flowers and F2 plants with white flowers had a 3:1 ratio. Mendel repeated this experiment with each of the other traits. For each trait, he got the same results. One form of the trait seemed to disappear in the F1 plants. Then it showed up again in the F2 plants. Moreover, the two forms of the trait always showed up in the F2 plants in the same 3:1 ratio. 
Law of  Segregation 	  Based on these results, Mendel concluded that each trait is controlled by two factors. He also concluded that one of the factors for each trait dominates the other. He described the dominating factor as dominant. He used the term recessive to describe the other factor. If both factors are present in an individual, only the dominant factor is expressed. This explains why one form of a trait always seems to disappear in the F1 plants. These plants inherit both factors for the trait, but only the dominant factor shows up. The recessive factor is hidden. When F1 plants reproduce, the two factors separate and go to different gametes. This is Mendels first law, the law of segregation. It explains why both forms of the trait show up again in the F2 plants. One out of four F2 plants inherits two of the recessive factors for the trait. In these plants, the recessive form of the trait is expressed. 
Second  Set of  Experiments 	  Mendel wondered whether different traits are inherited together. For example, are seed form and seed color passed together from parents to offspring? Or do the two traits split up in the offspring? To answer these questions, Mendel studied two traits at a time. For example, he crossed plants that had round, yellow seeds with plants that had wrinkled, green seeds. Then he observed how the two traits showed up in their offspring (F1). You can see the results of this cross in Figure 6.4. All of the F1 plants had round, yellow seeds. The wrinkled and green forms of the traits seemed to disappear in the F1 plants. Seed color: B = yellow (dominant); b = green (recessive) Then Mendel let the F1 plants self-pollinate. Their offspring, the F2 plants, had all possible combinations of the two traits. You can see this in Figure 6.5. For example there were plants that had round, green seeds, as well as plants that had wrinkled, yellow seeds. In this case the ratios were 9:3:3:1. The ratios are shown across the bottom of Figure 6.5. Mendel repeated this experiment with other combinations of two traits. In each case, he got the same results. One form of each trait seemed to disappear in the F1 plants. Then these forms reappeared in the F2 plants in all possible combinations. Moreover, the different combinations of traits always occurred in the same 9:3:3:1 ratio. 
Law of  Independent  Assortment 	  The results of Mendels two-trait experiments led to the law of independent assortment. This law states that factors controlling different traits go to gametes independently of each other. This explains why F2 plants have all possible combinations of the two traits. 
Mendels  Legacy 	  You might think that Mendels discoveries would have made him an instant science rock star. Hed found the answers to age-old questions about heredity. In fact, Mendels work was largely ignored until 1900. Thats when three other scientists independently arrived at Mendels laws. Only then did people appreciate what a great contribution to science Mendel had made. Mendels discoveries form the basis of the modern science of genetics. Genetics is the science of heredity. For his discoveries, Mendel is now called the "father of genetics." Watch this entertaining, upbeat video for an excellent review of Mendels life and work. Its also a good introduction to the next lesson, "Introduction to Genetics." URL 
Lesson  Summary 	  Gregor Mendel was an Austrian monk who studied heredity in pea plants in the mid-1800s. Peas were a good choice for this purpose for several reasons. Mendel first experimented with one trait at a time. This led to his law of segregation. According to this law, the two factors that control a trait separate and go to different gametes. Mendel then experimented with two traits at a time. This led to his law of independent assortment. According to this law, the factors that control different traits go to gametes independently of each other. Mendels discoveries were not appreciated until 1900. Now Mendel is called the "father of genetics." Genetics is the science of heredity. 
Think  Critically 	  Mendels research revealed that traits are controlled by "factors" that parents pass to their offspring. Today, we know that Mendels "factors" are genes. Define gene and allele.

Introduction 	  When Mendels laws were rediscovered in 1900, scientists were starting to learn about the molecules of heredity. They had already observed chromosomes and seen cells undergoing meiosis. Within a few decades they would learn the structure of DNA and how proteins are made. They would also learn that Mendels "factors" consist of DNA. We now call these factors genes. For a great review of Mendels work and an excellent introduction to this lesson, watch this entertaining video: URL . 
Genes and  Alleles 	  Today we know that the traits of organisms are controlled by genes on chromosomes. A gene can be defined as a section of a chromosome that contains the genetic code for a particular protein. The position of a gene on a chromosome is called its locus. Each gene may have different versions. The different versions are called alleles. Figure 6.6 shows an example in pea plants. It shows the gene for flower color. The gene has two alleles. There is a purple-flower allele and a white-flower allele. Different alleles account for most of the variation in the traits of organisms within a species. This diagram shows how genes and alleles are related. In sexually reproducing species, chromosomes are present in cells in pairs. Chromosomes in the same pair are called homologous chromosomes. They have the same genes at the same loci. These may be the same or different alleles. During meiosis, when gametes are produced, homologous chromosomes separate. They go to different gametes. Thus, the alleles for each gene also go to different gametes. 
Genotype and  Phenotype 	  When gametes unite during fertilization, the resulting zygote inherits two alleles for each gene. One allele comes from each parent. 
Genotype 	  The two alleles that an individual inherits make up the individuals genotype. The two alleles may be the same or different. Look at Table 6.1. It shows alleles for the flower-color gene in peas. The alleles are represented by the letters B (purple flowers) and b (white flowers). A plant with two alleles of the same type (BB or bb) is called a homozygote. A plant with two different alleles (Bb) is called a heterozygote. TABLE 6.1: Genotypes and phenotypes for alleles B and b, with B dominant to b 
Phenotypes 	  BB (homozygote) purple flowers Bb (heterozygote) purple flowers bb (homozygote) white flowers 
Phenotype 	  The expression of an organisms genotype is called its phenotype. The phenotype refers to the organisms traits, such as purple or white flowers. Different genotypes may produce the same phenotype. This will be the case if one allele is dominant to the other. Both BB and Bb genotypes in Table 6.1 have purple flowers. Thats because the B allele is dominant to the b allele, which is recessive. The terms dominant and recessive are the terms Mendel used to describe his "factors." Today we use them to describe alleles. In a Bb heterozygote, only the dominant B allele is expressed. The recessive b allele is expressed only in the bb genotype. 
Mendelian  Inheritance 	  Each trait Mendel studied was controlled by one gene with two alleles. In each case, one of the alleles was dominant to the other. This resulted in just two possible phenotypes for each trait. Each trait Mendel studied was also controlled by a gene on a different chromosome. As a result, each trait was inherited independently of the others. With traits like these, its easy to predict which forms of a trait will show up in the offspring of a given set of parents. 
Predicting  Alleles in  Gametes 	  Consider a purple-flowered pea plant with the genotype Bb. Half the gametes produced by this parent will have a B allele. The other half will have a b allele. You can see this in Figure 6.7. This is similar to tossing a coin. There is a 50 percent chance of a head and a 50 percent chance of a tail. Like a head or tail, there is a 50 percent chance that any gamete from this parent will have the B allele. There is also a 50 percent chance that any gamete will have the b allele. 
Predicting  Genotype  Ratios 	  Now lets see what happens if two parent pea plants have the Bb genotype. What genotypes are possible for their offspring? And what ratio of genotypes would you expect? The easiest way to find the answer to these questions is with a Punnett square. A Punnett square is a chart that makes it easy to find the possible genotypes in offspring of two parents. Figure 6.8 shows a Punnett square for the two parent pea plants. The gametes produced by the male parent are at the top of the chart. The gametes produced by the female parent are along the left side of the chart. The different possible combinations of alleles in their offspring can be found by filling in the cells of the chart. 
Punnett square for two  Bb parents 	  If the parents had four offspring, their most likely genotypes would be one BB, two Bb, and one bb. But the genotype ratios of their actual offspring may differ. Thats because which gametes happen to unite is a matter of chance, like a coin toss. The Punnett square just shows the possible genotypes and their most likely ratios. 
Predicting  Phenotype  Ratios 	  You know that the B allele is dominant to the b allele. Therefore, you can also use the Punnett square in Figure 6.8 to predict the most likely offspring phonotypes. If the parents had four offspring, their most likely phenotypes would be three with purple flowers (1 BB + 2 Bb) and one with white flowers (1 bb). 
Non- Mendelian  Inheritance 	  Inheritance is often more complex than it is for traits like those Mendel studied. Several factors can complicate it. 
Codominance and  Incomplete  Dominance 	  If a gene has two alleles, one may not be dominant to the other. There are other possibilities. One possibility is called codominance. Another is called incomplete dominance. With codominance, both alleles are expressed equally in heterozygotes. The red and white flower in Figure With incomplete dominance, a dominant allele is not completely dominant. Instead, it is influenced by the recessive allele in heterozygotes. The pink flower in Figure 6.9 is an example. It has an incompletely dominant allele for red petals. It also has a recessive allele for white petals. This results in a flower with pink petals. 
Multiple  Alleles 	  Many genes have more than two alleles. An example is ABO blood type in people. There are three common alleles for the gene that controls this trait. The allele for type A is codominant with the allele for type B. Both of these alleles are dominant to the allele for type O. The possible genotypes and phenotypes for this trait are shown in Table below 
Polygenic  Traits 	  Some traits are controlled by more than one gene. They are called polygenic traits. Each gene for a polygenic trait may have two or more alleles. The genes may be on the same or different chromosomes. Polygenic traits may have many possible phenotypes. Skin color and adult height are examples of polygenic traits in humans. Think about all the variation in the heights of adults you know. Normal adults may range from less than 5 feet tall to more than 7 feet tall. There are people at every gradation of height in between these extremes. 
Environmental  Influences 	  Genes play an important role in determining an organisms traits. However, for many traits, phenotype is influenced by the environment as well. For example, skin color is controlled by genes but also influenced by exposure to sunlight. You can see the effect of sunlight on skin in Figure 6.10. 
Sex  Chromosomes and  Sex- Linked  Traits 	  Animals and most plants have two special chromosomes. They are called sex chromosomes. These are chromosomes that determine the sex of the organism. All of the other chromosomes are called autosomes. Genes on sex chromosomes may be inherited differently than genes on autosomes. 
Human  Sex  Chromosomes 	  In people, the sex chromosomes are called X and Y chromosomes. Individuals with two X chromosomes are normally females. Individuals with one X and one Y chromosome are normally males. As you can see in Figure 6.11, mothers pass an X chromosome to each of their children. Fathers pass an X to their daughters and a Y to their sons. 
Sex- Linked  Traits 	  Traits controlled by genes on the sex chromosomes are called sex-linked traits. One gene on the Y chromosome determines male sex. There are very few other genes on the Y chromosome, which is the smallest human chromosome. There are hundreds of genes on the much larger X chromosome. None is related to sex. Traits controlled by genes on the X chromosome are called X-linked traits. X-linked traits have a different pattern of inheritance than traits controlled by genes on autosomes. With just one X chromosome, males have only one allele for any X-linked trait. Therefore, a recessive X-linked allele is always expressed in males. With two X chromosomes, females have two alleles for any X-linked trait, just as they do for autosomal traits. Therefore, a recessive X-linked allele is expressed in females only when they inherit two copies of it. This explains why X-linked recessive traits show up less often in females than males. 
Inheritance of  Color  Blindness 	  An example of a recessive X-linked trait is red-green color blindness. People with this trait cant see red or green colors. This trait is fairly common in males but rare in females. Figure 6.12 is a pedigree for this trait. A pedigree is a chart that shows how a trait is inherited in a family. The mother has one allele for color blindness. She doesnt have color blindness because she also has a dominant normal allele for the gene. Instead, she is called a carrier for the trait. She passes the allele to half of her children. One daughter is a carrier, and one son has the color blindness trait. No matter how many children this couple has, none of the daughters will have color blindness, but half of the sons, on average, will have the trait. Can you explain why? 
Lesson  Summary 	  Traits are controlled by genes on chromosomes. A gene may have different versions called alleles. The two alleles for a gene that an individual inherits make up the individuals genotype. The expression of the genotype as a trait is the individuals phenotype. Mendel studied simple traits controlled by one gene with two alleles and dominance. For traits like these, Punnett squares can be used to predict possible genotypes and phenotypes and their likely ratios in offspring. Inheritance is more complex for traits in which there is codominance or incomplete dominance. Traits may also be controlled by multiple alleles or multiple genes. Many traits are influenced by the environment as well. Sex chromosomes determine sex in animals and many plants. Other chromosomes are called autosomes. Sexlinked traits are controlled by genes on sex chromosomes. They may be inherited differently than autosomal traits. 
Think  Critically 	  Genetics began with the rediscovery of Mendels laws in 1900. There have been many advances in genetics since then. Explain the significance of the Human Genome Project. Describe human genetic disorders. Identify methods and uses of biotechnology. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  biotechnology gene therapy genetically modified organism (GMO) genetic disorder genome 
Introduction 	  The science of genetics has come a long way since Mendels laws were rediscovered in 1900. There have been many advances in genetics. One of the most impressive advances was sequencing the human genome. 
Sequencing the  Human  Genome 	  A species genome consists of all of its genetic information. The human genome consists of the complete set of genes in the human organism. Its all the DNA of a human being. 
The  Human  Genome  Project 	  The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990. It was an international effort to sequence all 3 billion bases in human DNA. Another aim of the project was to identify the more than 20,000 human genes and map their locations on chromosomes. The logo of the Human Genome Project in Figure 6.13 shows that the project brought together experts in many fields. The Human Genome Project was completed in 2003. It was one of the greatest feats of modern science. It provides a complete blueprint for a human being. Its like having a very detailed manual for making a human organism. 
Applications of the  Sequence 	  Knowing the sequence of the human genome is very useful. For example, it helps us understand how humans evolved. Another use is in medicine. It is helping researchers identify and understand genetic disorders. You can learn more about the Human Genome Project and its applications by watching this funny, fast-paced video: URL ww.youtube.com/watch?v=F5LzKupeHtw . 
Human  Genetic  Disorders 	  Sequencing the human genome has increased our knowledge of genetic disorders. Genetic disorders are diseases caused by mutations. Many genetic disorders are caused by mutations in a single gene. Others are caused by abnormal numbers of chromosomes. 
Disorders  Caused by  Single  Gene  Mutations 	  Table 6.3 lists some genetic disorders caused by mutations in just one gene. It include autosomal and X-linked disorders. It also includes dominant and recessive disorders. TABLE 6.3: Examples of human genetic disorders caused by single gene mutations

Sickle  Cell  Anemia 	  Defective hemoglobin protein that is needed to transport oxygen in red blood cells Sickle-shaped red blood cells that block blood vessels and interrupt blood flow 
Reduced activity of a protein needed for blood to 	  clot 
X-linked recessive 	  Relatively few genetic disorders are caused by dominant alleles. A dominant allele is expressed in everybody who inherits even one copy of it. If it causes a serious disorder, affected people may die young and fail to reproduce. They wont pass the allele to the next generation. As a result, the allele may die out of the population. One of the exceptions is Marfan syndrome. It is thought to have affected Abraham Lincoln. Hes pictured in Figure 6.14. His very long limbs are one reason for the suspicion of Marfan syndrome in this former U.S. president. Recessive disorders are more common than dominant ones. Why? A recessive allele is not expressed in heterozygotes. These people are called carriers. They dont have the genetic disorder but they carry the recessive allele. They can also pass this allele to their offspring. A recessive allele is more likely than a dominant allele to pass to the next generation rather than die out. 
Chromosomal  Disorders 	  In the process of meiosis, paired chromosomes normally separate from each other. They end up in different gametes. Sometimes, however, errors occur. The paired chromosomes fail to separate. When this happens, some gametes get an extra copy of a chromosome. Other gametes are missing a chromosome. If one of these gametes is fertilized and survives, a chromosomal disorder results. You can see examples of such disorders in Table 6.4 
Turners syndrome 	  One X chromosome and no other sex chromosome (XO) 
Klinefelters syndrome 	  One Y chromosome and two or more X chromosomes (XXY, XXXY) Male with abnormal sexual development and reduced level of male sex hormone Abraham Lincoln (center) may have had the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome Most chromosomal disorders involve the sex chromosomes. Can you guess why? The X and Y chromosomes are very different in size. The X is much larger than the Y. This difference in size creates problems. It increases the chances that the two chromosomes will fail to separate properly during meiosis. 
Biotechnology 	  Treating genetic disorders is one use of biotechnology. Biotechnology is the use of technology to change the genetic makeup of living things for human purposes. Its also called genetic engineering. Besides treating genetic disorders, biotechnology is used to change organisms so they are more useful to people. 
Methods in  Biotechnology 	  Biotechnology uses a variety of methods, but some are commonly used in many applications. A common method is the polymerase chain reaction. Another common method is gene cloning. The polymerase chain reaction is a way of making copies of a gene. It uses high temperatures and an enzyme to make new DNA molecules. The process keeps cycling to make many copies of a gene. Gene cloning is another way of making copies of a gene. A gene is inserted into the DNA of a bacterial cell. Figure 6.15 shows how this is done. Bacteria multiply very rapidly by binary fission. Each time a bacterial cell divides, the inserted gene is copied. The enzyme DNA ligase joins together a gene and bacterial (plasmid) DNA. The DNA that results is called recombinant DNA. 
Uses of  Biotechnology 	  Biotechnology has many uses. It is especially useful in medicine and agriculture. Biotechnology is used to treat genetic disorders. For example, copies of a normal gene might be inserted into a patient with a defective gene. This is called gene therapy. Ideally, it can cure a genetic disorder. create genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Many GMOs are food crops such as corn. Genes are inserted into plants to give them desirable traits. This might be the ability to get by with little water. Or it might be the ability to resist insect pests. The modified plants are likely to be healthier and produce more food. They may also need less pesticide. produce human proteins. Insulin is one example. This protein is needed to treat diabetes. The human insulin gene is inserted into bacteria. The bacteria reproduce rapidly. They can produce large quantities of the human protein. You can see another example in Figure 6.16. 
Concerns about  Biotechnology 	  Biotechnology has many benefits. Its pros are obvious. It helps solve human problems. However, biotechnology also raises many concerns. For example, some people worry about eating foods that contain GMOs. They wonder if GMOs might cause health problems. The person in Figure 6.17 favors the labeling of foods that contain GMOs. That way, consumers can know which foods contain them and decide for themselves whether to eat them. Another concern about biotechnology is how it may affect the environment. Negative effects on the environment have already occurred because of some GMOs. For example, corn has been created that has a gene for a pesticide. The corn plants have accidentally cross-pollinated nearby milkweeds. Monarch butterfly larvae depend on milkweeds for food. When they eat milkweeds with the pesticide gene, they are poisoned. This may threaten the survival of the monarch species as well as other species that eat monarchs. Do the benefits of the genetically modified corn outweigh the risks? What do you think? Bacteria are modified to produce the human protein cytokine. This is a protein that helps fight infections. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A species genome consists of all of its genetic information. One of the greatest advances in modern genetics was sequencing the human genome. This was achieved in 2003 by the Human Genome Project. Sequencing the human genome has increased our knowledge of genetic disorders. These are diseases caused by mutations. They may be caused by single gene mutations or the failure of chromosomes to separate correctly during meiosis. Biotechnology is the use of technology to treat genetic disorders or change organisms so they are more useful to people. Methods include gene cloning. Applications include gene therapy and genetically modified food crops. Chances are that some of the foods you eat contain GMOs. However, they may not be labeled that way.

Galpagos  Islands 	  natural selection theory of evolution by natural selection 
Introduction 	  Charles Darwin is one of the best-known scientists of all time. Figure 7.1 shows Darwin as a young man in the 1830s. Why is Darwin so famous? His theory of evolution was a major leap forward in human understanding. It explains and unifies all of life science. 
Darwins  Theory in a  Nutshell 	  Darwins theory of evolution by natural selection contains two major ideas: One idea is that evolution happens. Evolution is a change in the inherited traits of organisms over time. Living things have changed as descendants diverged from common ancestors in the past. The other idea is that evolution occurs by natural selection. Natural selection is the process in which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring. As a result, their traits increase in the population over time. 
Voyage of the 	  How did Darwin come up with the theory of evolution by natural selection? A major influence was an amazing scientific expedition he took on a ship called the Beagle. Darwin was only 22 years old when the ship set sail. The trip lasted for almost five years and circled the globe. Figure 7.2 shows the route the ship took. It set off from Plymouth, England in 1831. It wouldnt return to Plymouth until 1836. Imagine setting out for such an incredible adventure at age 22, and youll understand why the trip had such a big influence on Darwin. Darwins job on the voyage was to observe and collect specimens whenever the ship went ashore. This included plants, animals, rocks, and fossils. Darwin loved nature, so the job was ideal for him. During the long voyage, he made many observations that helped him form his theory of evolution. Some of his most important observations were made on the Galpagos Islands. The 16 Galpagos Islands lie 966 kilometers (about 600 miles) off the west coast of South America. (You can see their location on the map in Figure 7.2.) Some of the animals Darwin observed on the islands were giant tortoises and birds called finches. Watch this video for an excellent introduction to Darwin, his voyage, and the Galpagos: URL 
Giant  Tortoises 	  The Galpagos Islands are still famous for their giant tortoises. These gentle giants are found almost nowhere else in the world. Darwin was amazed by their huge size. He was also struck by the variety of shapes of their shells. You can see two examples in Figure 7.3. Each island had tortoises with a different shell shape. The local people even could tell which island a tortoise came from based on the shape of its shell. Giant tortoises on the Galpagos Islands varied in shell shape, depending on which island they inhabited. Darwin wondered how each island came to have its own type of tortoise. He found out that tortoises with domeshaped shells lived on islands where the plants they ate were abundant and easy to reach. Tortoises with saddleshaped shells, in contrast, lived on islands that were drier. On those islands, food was often scarce. The saddle shape of their shells allowed tortoises on those islands to reach up and graze on vegetation high above them. This made sense, but how had it happened? 
Darwins  Finches 	  Darwin also observed that each of the Galpagos Islands had its own species of finches. The finches on different islands had beaks that differed in size and shape. You can see four examples in Figure 7.4. Darwin investigated further. He found that the different beaks seemed to suit the birds for the food available on their island. For example, finch number 1 in Figure 7.4 used its large, strong beak to crack open and eat big, tough seeds. Finch number 4 had a long, pointed beak that was ideal for eating insects. This seemed reasonable, but how had it come about? 
More  Influences on  Darwin 	  Besides his observations on the Beagle, other influences helped Darwin develop his theory of evolution by natural selection. These included his knowledge of plant and animal breeding and the ideas of other scientists. 
Plant and  Animal  Breeding 	  Darwin knew that people could breed plants and animals to have useful traits. By selecting which individuals were allowed to reproduce, they could change an organisms traits over several generations. Darwin called this type of change in organisms artificial selection. You can see an example in Figure 7.5. Keeping and breeding pigeons was a popular hobby in Darwins day. Both types of pigeons in the bottom row were bred from the common rock pigeon at the top of the figure. 
Other  Scientists 	  There were three other scientists in particular that influenced Darwin. Their names are Lamarck, Lyell, and Malthus. All three were somewhat older than Darwin, and he was familiar with their writings. Jean Baptiste Lamarck was a French naturalist. He was one of the first scientists to propose that species change over time. In other words, he proposed that evolution occurs. Lamarck also tried to explain how it happens, but he got that part wrong. Lamarck thought that the traits an organism developed during its life time could be passed on to its offspring. He called this the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Charles Lyell was an English geologist. He wrote a famous book called Principles of Geology. Darwin took the book with him on the Beagle. Lyell argued that geological processes such as erosion change Earths surface very gradually. To account for all the changes that had occurred on the planet, Earth must be a lot older than most people believed. Thomas Malthus was an English economist. He wrote a popular essay called On Population. He argued that human populations have the potential to grow faster than the resources they need. When populations get too big, disease and famine occur. These calamities control population size by killing off the weakest people. 
Putting  It  All  Together 	  Darwin spent many years thinking about his own observations and the writings of Lamarck, Lyell, and Malthus. What did it all mean? How did it all fit together? The answer, of course, is the theory of evolution by natural selection. 
Evolution of  Darwins  Theory 	  Heres how Darwin thought through his theory: Like Lamarck, Darwin assumed that species evolve, or change their traits over time. Fossils Darwin found on his voyage helped convince him that evolution occurs. From Lyell, Darwin realized that Earth is very old. This meant that living things had a long time in which to evolve. There was enough time to produce the great diversity of living things that Darwin had observed. From Malthus, Darwin saw that populations could grow faster than their resources. This overproduction of offspring led to a struggle for existence, in Darwins words. In this struggle, only the fittest survive. From Darwins knowledge of artificial selection, he knew how traits can change over time. Breeders artificially select the traits that they find beneficial. These traits become more common over many generations. In nature, Darwin reasoned, individuals with certain traits might be more likely to survive the struggle for existence and have offspring. Their traits would become more common over time. In this case, nature selects the traits that are beneficial. Thats why Darwin called this process natural selection. Darwin used the word fitness to refer to the ability to reproduce and pass traits to the next generation 
Darwins  Book 	  Darwin finally published his theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859. He presented it in his book On the Origin of Species. The book is very detailed and includes a lot of evidence for the theory. Darwins book changed science forever. The theory of evolution by natural selection became the unifying theory of all life science. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Darwin proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection. Evolution is a change in the inherited traits of organisms over time. Natural selection is the process by which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring, so their traits become more common over time. During Darwins voyage on the Beagle, he made many observations that helped him form his theory of evolution. Some of his most important observations were made on the Galpagos Islands. They included observations of giant tortoises and finches. Darwin was also influenced by his knowledge of artificial selection and the ideas of Lamarck, Lyell, and Malthus. Darwin spent many years working on a book about his theory of evolution by natural selection. He finally published On the Origin of Species in 1859. 
Think  Critically 	  On his voyage, Darwin saw fossils of ancient organisms. They showed him that living things had changed over time. What are fossils? How do fossils form? Explain what fossils are, how they form, and how they are dated. Identify evidence for evolution provided by living organisms. Describe recent evolution by natural selection in Darwins finches. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  absolute dating fossil molecular clock paleontologist relative dating vestigial structure 
Introduction 	  In his book On the Origin of Species, Darwin included a lot of evidence for evolution. Since then, much more evidence has accumulated. The evidence includes millions of fossils, like the one in Figure 7.6. It also includes detailed knowledge of living organisms. What Are Fossils? Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived during earlier ages. Remains that become fossils are generally the hard parts of organismsmainly bones, teeth, or shells. Traces include any evidence of life, such as footprints like the dinosaur footprint in Figure 7.7. Fossils are like a window into the past. They provide direct evidence of what life was like long ago. A scientist who studies fossils to learn about the evolution of living things is called a paleontologist. 
How  Fossils  Form 	  The soft parts of organisms almost always decompose quickly after death. Thats why most fossils consist of hard parts such as bones. Its rare even for hard parts to remain intact long enough to become fossils. Fossils form when water seeps through the remains and deposits minerals in them. The remains literally turn to stone. Remains are more likely to form fossils if they are covered quickly by sediments. Most of what we know about dinosaurs is based on fossils such as this one. Once in a while, remains are preserved almost unchanged. For example, they may be frozen in glaciers. Or they may be trapped in tree resin that hardens to form amber. Thats what happened to the wasp in Figure 7.8. The wasp lived about 20 million years ago, but even its fragile wings have been preserved by the amber. 
How  Fossils  Are  Dated 	  Fossils are useful for reconstructing the past only if they can be dated. Scientists need to determine when the organisms lived who left behind the fossils. Fossils can be dated in two different ways: absolute dating and relative dating. Absolute dating determines about how long ago a fossil organism lived. This gives the fossil an approximate age in years. Absolute dating is often based on the amount of carbon-14 or other radioactive element that remains in a fossil. You can learn how carbon-14 dating works by watching this short video: URL 
Fossil footprint of a three-toed dinosaur 	  Relative dating determines which of two fossils is older or younger than the other but not their age in years. Relative dating is based on the positions of fossils in rock layers. Lower rock layers were laid down earlier, so they are assumed to contain older fossils. This is illustrated in Figure 7.9. 
Using  Fossils to  Understand  Evolution 	  The evolution of whales is a good example of how fossils can help us understand evolution. Scientists have long known that mammals first evolved on land about 200 million years ago. Its been a mystery, however, how whales evolved. Whales are mammals that live completely in the water. Did they evolve from earlier land mammals? Or did they evolve from animals that already lived in the water? Starting in the late 1970s, a growing number of fossils have allowed scientists to piece together the story of whale evolution. The fossils represent ancient, whale-like animals. They show that an ancient land mammal made its way Fossils found in lower rock layers are generally older than fossils found in rock layers closer to the surface. back to the sea more than 50 million years ago. It became the ancestor of modern whales. In doing so, it lost its legs and became adapted to life in the water. In Figure 7.10 you can see an artists rendition of such a whale ancestor. It had legs and could walk on land, but it was also a good swimmer. Watch this short video to learn more about the amazing story of whale evolution based on the fossils: URL This whale ancestor, called Ambulocetus, lived about 48 million years ago. 
Evidence from  Living  Organisms 	  Scientists have learned a lot about evolution by comparing living organisms. They have compared body parts, embryos, and molecules such as DNA and proteins. 
Comparing  Body  Parts 	  Comparing body parts of different species may reveal evidence for evolution. For example, all mammals have front limbs that look quite different and are used for different purposes. Bats use their front limbs to fly, whales use them to swim, and cats use them to run and climb. However, the front limbs of all three animalsas well as humanshave the same basic underlying bone structure. You can see this in Figure 7.11. The similar bones provide evidence that all four animals evolved from a common ancestor. 
Vestigial  Structures 	  Some of the most interesting evidence for evolution comes from vestigial structures. These are body parts that are no longer used but are still present in modern organisms. Examples in humans include tail bones and the appendix. Human beings obviously dont have tails, but our ancestors did. We still have bones at the base of our spine that form a tail in other, related animals, such as monkeys. The appendix is a tiny remnant of a once-larger organ. In a distant ancestor, it was needed to digest food. If your appendix becomes infected, a surgeon can remove it. You wont miss it because it no longer has any purpose in the human body. 
Comparing  Embryos 	  An embryo is an organism in the earliest stages of development. Embryos of different species may look quite similar, even when the adult forms look very different. Look at the drawings of embryos in Figure 7.12. They represent very early life stages of a chicken, turtle, pig, and human being. The embryos look so similar that its hard to tell them apart. Such similarities provide evidence that all four types of animals are related. They help document that evolution has occurred. From left to right, embryos of a chicken, turtle, pig, and human being 
Comparing  Molecules 	  Scientists can compare the DNA or proteins of different species. If the molecules are similar, this shows that the species are related. The more similar the molecules are, the closer the relationship is likely to be. When molecules are used in this way, they are called molecular clocks. This method assumes that random mutations occur at a constant rate for a given protein or segment of DNA. Over time, the mutations add up. The longer the amount of time since species diverged, the more differences there will be in their DNA or proteins. Table 7.1 compares the DNA of four different organisms with modern human DNA. The DNA of chimpanzees is almost 99 percent the same as the DNA of modern humans. This shows that chimpanzees are very closely related to us. We are less closely related to the other organisms in the table. Its no surprise that grapes, which are plants, are less like us than the animals in the table. 
E 7.1:  Comparing  A sequences 	  Organism	Similarity with Human DNA (percent the same) 
Observing  Evolution in  Action 	  The best evidence for evolution comes from actually observing changes in organisms through time. In the 1970s, biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant went to the Galpagos Islands to do fieldwork. They wanted to re-study Darwins finches. They spent the next 40 years on the project. Their hard work paid off. They were able to document evolution by natural selection taking place in the finches. A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived long ago. They form mainly when minerals in water turn remains to stone. Fossils can be dated using methods such as carbon-14 dating or their positions in rock layers. Scientists have learned a lot about evolution from species that are living today. They have compared body parts, vestigial organs, embryos, and molecules in different species. Species that are the most similar in these ways are generally the most closely related. The best evidence for evolution is seeing it in action. An example is the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant. They documented recent evolution by natural selection in Darwins finches. 
Think  Critically 	  Understanding how evolution occurs requires knowledge of genetics. How is variation in traits within a species related to genes? How would you define evolution in genetic terms? Compare and contrast microevolution and macroevolution. Identify forces that change allele frequencies in populations. Explain how speciation, convergent evolution, and coevolution can occur. Describe variation in the rate of evolution. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  allele frequency coevolution convergent evolution gene flow gene pool genetic drift macroevolution microevolution population speciation 
Introduction 	  Darwin thought that evolution occurs by the process of natural selection. For this process to take place, variation in traits must be passed from parents to their offspring. Darwin didnt know about Mendels laws of heredity. As a result, he didnt understand how traits are inherited. Mendels laws only came to light in 1900. That was about 40 years after Darwin published On the Origin of Species. Only with knowledge of genetics could scientists fully understand how evolution changes traits over time. 
Two  Scales of  Evolution 	  We now know how variation in traits is inherited. Variation in traits is controlled by different alleles for genes. Alleles, in turn, are passed to gametes and then to offspring. Evolution occurs because of changes in alleles over time. How long a time? That depends on the time scale of evolution you consider. Evolution that occurs over a short period of time is known as microevolution. It might take place in just a couple of generations. This scale of evolution occurs at the level of the population. The Grants observed evolution at this scale in populations of Darwins finches. Beak size in finch populations changed in just two years because of a serious drought. Evolution that occurs over a long period of time is called macroevolution. It might take place over millions of years. This scale of evolution occurs above the level of the species. Fossils provide evidence for evolution at this scale. The evolution of the horse family, shown in Figure 7.13, is an example of macroevolution. Fossils show how horses evolved over the past 50 million of years. Horses increased in size. Their teeth and feet also changed. 
Microevolution 	  Individuals dont evolve. Their alleles dont change over time. The unit of microevolution is the population. 
Genes in  Populations 	  A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area. All the genes in all the members of a population make up the populations gene pool. For each gene, the gene pool includes all the different alleles in the population. The gene pool can be described by its allele frequencies for specific genes. The frequency of an allele is the number of copies of that allele divided by the total number of alleles for the gene in the gene pool. A simple example will help you understand these concepts. The data in Table 7.2 represent a population of 100 individuals. For each gene, the gene pool has a total of 200 alleles (2 per individual x 100 individuals). The gene in question exists as two different alleles, A and a. The number of A alleles in the gene pool is 140. Of these, 100 are in the 50 AA homozygotes. Another 40 are in the 40 Aa heterozygotes. The number of a alleles in the gene pool is 60. Of these, 40 are in the 40 Aa heterozygotes. Another 20 are in the 10 aa homozygotes. The frequency of the A allele is 140/200 = 0.7. The frequency of the a allele is 60/200 = 0.3. 
Aa 	  aa 
Totals 	  Evolution occurs in a population when its allele frequencies change over time. For example, the frequency of the A allele might change from 0.7 to 0.8. If that happens, evolution has occurred. What causes allele frequencies to change? The answer is forces of evolution. 
Forces of  Evolution 	  There are four major forces of evolution that cause allele frequencies to change. They are mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Mutation creates new genetic variation in a gene pool This is how all new alleles first arise. Its the ultimate source of new genetic variation, so it is essential for evolution. However, for any given gene, the chance of a mutation occurring is very small. Therefore, mutation alone does not have much effect on allele frequencies. Gene flow is the movement of genes into or out of a gene pool It occurs when individuals migrate into or out of the population. How much gene flow changes allele frequencies depends on how many migrants there are and their genotypes. Genetic drift is a random change in allele frequencies. It occurs in small populations. Allele frequencies in the offspring may differ by chance from those in the parents. This is like tossing a coin just a few times. You may, by chance, get more or less than the expected 50 percent heads or tails. In the same way, you may get more or less than the expected allele frequencies in the small number of individuals in the next generation. The smaller the population is, the more allele frequencies may drift. Natural selection is a change in allele frequencies that occurs because some genotypes are more fit than others. Genotypes with greater fitness produce more offspring and pass more copies of their alleles to the next generation. This is the force of evolution that Darwin identified. Figure 23.12 shows how Darwin thought natural selection led to variation in finches on the Galpagos Islands. 
Macroevolution 	  What happens when forces of evolution work over a long period of time? The answer is macroevolution. An example is the evolution of a new species. Darwins finches evolved new traits by natural selection. 
Speciation 	  The evolution of a new species is called speciation. A species is a group of organisms that can mate and produce fertile offspring together but not with members of other such groups. What must happen for a new species to arise? Some members of an existing species must change so they can no produce fertile offspring with the rest of the species. Speciation often occurs when some members of a species break off from the rest. The splinter group evolves in isolation from the original species. The original species also continues to evolve. Sooner or later, the splinter group becomes too different to breed with members of the original species. At that point, a new species has formed. A good example of speciation involves anole lizards, like the one pictured in Figure 7.15. There are about 150 different species of anole lizards in the Caribbean Islands. Scientists think that a single species of lizard first colonized one of the islands about 50 million years ago. A few lizards from this original species eventually reached each of the other islands, where they evolved in isolation. Anoles in different habitats evolved traits that affected mating. For example, they evolved skin flaps of different colors. Females didnt respond to male anoles with the wrong color skin flap. This prevented them from mating. Eventually, all the different species of anoles known today evolved. Watch this interesting video to learn more about anole speciation in the Caribbean: URL 
Convergent  Evolution 	  Sometimes two species evolve the same traits. It happens because they live in similar habitats. This is called convergent evolution. Caribbean Anoles demonstrate this as well. On each Caribbean island, anoles in similar habitats evolved the same traits. For example, anoles that lived on the forest floor evolved long legs for leaping and running on the ground. Anoles that lived on tree branches evolved short legs that helped them cling to small branches and twigs. Anoles that lived at the tops of trees evolved large toe pads that allowed them to walk on leaves without falling. On each of the islands, there were anole species that evolved in each of these same ways. This male anole lizard is puffing out a flap of yellow skin to attract a mate. 
Coevolution 	  Two species may often interact with each other and have a close relationship. Examples include flowers and the animals that pollinate them. When one of the two species evolves new traits, the other species may evolve matching traits. This is called coevolution. You can see an example of this in Figure 7.16. The very long beak of this hummingbird co-evolved with the tubular flowers it pollinates. Only this species of hummingbird can reach nectar deep in the flowers. 
Rate of  Evolution 	  Darwin thought that evolution occurs very slowly. This is likely if conditions are stable. But what if conditions are changing rapidly? Evolution is likely to occur more rapidly as well. For example, the Grants showed that evolution occurred in just a couple of years in Darwins finches. This happened when a severe drought killed off a lot of the plants that the birds needed for food. Millions of fossils have been found since Darwins time. They show that evolution may occur in fits and starts. Long period of little or gradual change may be interrupted by bursts of rapid change. The rate of evolution is influenced by how the environment is changing. Today, Earths climate is changing rapidly. How do you think this might affect the rate of evolution? 
Lesson  Summary 	  The time scale of evolution can vary. Evolution over a short period of time at the level of the population is called microevolution. Evolution over a long period of time above the level of the species is called macroevolution. Microevolution occurs in a population when its allele frequencies change over time. There are four major forces of evolution that cause allele frequencies to change: mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Macroevolution occurs when microevolution takes place over a long period of time. Types of macroevolution include speciation, convergent evolution, and coevolution. The rate of evolution is influenced by how quickly the environment is changing. Long periods of gradual evolutionary change may be interrupted by short bursts of rapid change.

Think  Critically 	  Evolution has been taking place since life first evolved on Earth. How old is planet Earth? How long has life been evolving on Earth? Describe geologic time and the geologic time scale. Give an overview of lifes origins and the Precambrian. Explain how life evolved during the Paleozoic Era. Outline major events in evolution during the Mesozoic Era. Describe evolution during the Cenozoic Era. 
Cenozoic  Era 	  extinction geologic time scale Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) mass extinction 
Introduction 	  Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago. Life first appeared on Earth about 4 billion years ago. The first life forms were microscopic, single-celled organisms. From these simple beginnings, evolution gradually produced the vast diversity of life today. In this lesson, youll read about the history of life from its origins until now. Youll learn that living things had to cope with some astounding changes. Giant meteorites struck Earths surface. Continents drifted and collided. Several times the majority of Earths living things went extinct. Extinction occurs when a species completely dies out. But life on Earth was persistent. Each time it came back more numerous and diverse than before. 
Geologic  Time 	  Its hard to grasp the vast amounts of time since Earth formed and life first appeared. It may help to think of Earths history as a 24-hour day. 
Geologic  Time  Scale 	  Another tool for understanding the history of Earth and its life is the geologic time scale. You can see this time scale in Figure 7.18. It divides Earths history into eons, eras, and periods. These divisions are based on major changes in geology, climate, and the evolution of life. The geologic time scale organizes Earths history on the basis of important events instead of time alone. It also puts more focus on recent events, about which we know the most. 
Precambrian:  Lifes  Origins 	  The Precambrian Supereon is the first major division of Earths history (see Figure 7.18). It covers the time from Earths formation 4.6 billion years ago to 544 million years ago. To see how life evolved during the Precambrian and beyond, watch this wonderful video. Its a good introduction to the rest of the lesson. URL 
Ancient  Earth 	  When Earth first formed, it was a fiery hot, barren ball. It had no oceans or atmosphere. Rivers of melted rock flowed over its surface. Gradually, the planet cooled and formed a solid crust. Gases from volcanoes formed an atmosphere, although it contained only a trace of oxygen. As the planet continued to cool, clouds formed and rain fell. Rainwater helped form oceans. The ancient atmosphere and oceans would be toxic to modern life, but they set the stage for life to begin. 
First  Organic  Molecules and  Cells 	  All living things consist of organic molecules. Many scientists think that organic molecules evolved before cells, perhaps as early as 4 billion years ago. Its possible that lightning sparked chemical reactions in Earths early atmosphere. This could have created a soup of organic molecules from inorganic chemicals. Some scientists think that RNA was the first organic molecule to evolve. RNA can not only encode genetic instructions. Some RNA molecules can carry out chemical reactions. All living things are made of one or more cells. How the first cells evolved is not known for certain. Scientists speculate that lipid membranes grew around RNA molecules. The earliest cells may have consisted of little more than RNA inside a lipid membrane. You can see a model of such a cell in Figure 7.19. The first cells probably evolved between 3.8 and 4 billion years ago. Scientists think that one cell, called the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), gave rise to all of the following life on Earth. LUCA may have existed around 3.5 billion years ago. 
New  Adaptations 	  The earliest cells were heterotrophs. They were unable to make food. Instead, they got energy by "eating" organic molecules in the soup around them. The earliest cells were also prokaryotes. They lacked a nucleus and other organelles. Gradually, these and other traits evolved. Photosynthesis evolved about 3 billion years ago. After that, certain cells could use sunlight to make food. These were the first autotrophs. They made food for themselves and other cells. They also added oxygen to the atmosphere. The oxygen was a waste product of photosynthesis. Oxygen was toxic to many cells. They had evolved in its absence. Many of them died out. The few that survived evolved a new way to use oxygen. They used it to get energy from food. This is the process of cellular respiration. The first eukaryotic cells probably evolved about 2 billion years ago. Thats when cells evolved organelles and a nucleus. Figure 7.20 shows one theory about the origin of organelles. According to this theory, a large cell engulfed small cells. The small cells took on special roles that helped the large cell function. In return, the small cells got nutrients from the large cell. Eventually, the large and small cells could no longer live apart. With their specialized organelles, eukaryotic cells were powerful and efficient. Eukaryotes would go on to evolve sexual reproduction. They would also evolve into multicellular organisms. The first multicellular organisms evolved about 1 billion years ago. 
Precambrian  Mass  Extinction 	  At the end of the Precambrian, a mass extinction occurred. In a mass extinction, the majority of species die out. The Precambrian mass extinction was the first of six mass extinctions that occurred on Earth. Its not certain what caused this first mass extinction. Changes in Earths geology and climate were no doubt involved. 
Paleozoic  Era 	  The Paleozoic Era lasted from 544 to 245 million years ago. It is divided into six periods. 
Cambrian  Period 	  The Precambrian mass extinction opened up many niches for new organisms to fill. As a result, the Cambrian Period began with an explosion of new kinds of living things. For example, many types of simple animals called sponges evolved. Trilobites were also very common. Sponges and trilobites were small ocean invertebrates. These are animals without a backbone. You can see examples of them in Figure 7.21. 
Ordovician  Period 	  During the Ordovician Period, the oceans became filled with many kinds of invertebrates. The first fish also evolved. Plants colonized the land for the first time. However, animals remained in the water. 
Silurian  Period 	  Corals appeared in the oceans during the Silurian period. Fish continued to evolve. On land, vascular plants appeared. These are plants that have special tissues to circulate water and other substances. This allowed plants to become larger and colonize drier habitats. 
Devonian  Period 	  During the Devonian Period, the first seed plants evolved. Seeds have a protective coat and contain stored food. This was a big advantage over other types of plant reproduction. Seed plants eventually became the most common type of plants on land. In the oceans, fish with lobe fins evolved. These fish could breathe air when they raised their head above water. This was a step in the evolution of animals that could live on land. 
Carboniferous  Period 	  In the Carboniferous Period, forests of huge ferns and trees were widespread. You can see how these first forests might have looked in Figure 7.22. After the ferns and trees died, their remains eventually turned to coal. The first amphibians also evolved during this period. They could live on land but had to return to the water to lay their eggs. After amphibians, the earliest reptiles appeared. They were the first animals that could reproduce on land and move away from the water. 
Permian  Period 	  During the Permian Period, all the major landmasses moved together to form one supercontinent. The supercontinent has been named Pangaea. You can see how it looked in Figure 7.23. At this time, temperatures were extreme and the climate became very dry. As a result, plants and animals evolved ways to cope with dryness. For example, reptiles evolved leathery skin. This helped prevent water loss. Plants evolved waxy leaves for the same purpose. The supercontinent Pangaea formed during the Permian Period. The Permian Period ended with Earths second mass extinction. During this event, most of Earths species went extinct. It was the most massive extinction ever recorded. Its not clear why it happened. One possible reason is that a very large meteorite struck Earth. Another possibility is the eruption of enormous volcanoes. Either event could create a huge amount of dust. The dust might block out sunlight for months. This would cool the planet and prevent photosynthesis. 
Mesozoic  Era 	  The Permian mass extinction paved the way for another burst of new life at the start of the Mesozoic Era. This era is known as the age of dinosaurs. It is divided into three periods. 
Triassic  Period 	  During the Triassic Period, the first dinosaurs evolved from reptile ancestors. They eventually colonized the air and water in addition to the land. There were also forests of huge seed ferns and cone-bearing conifer trees in the Triassic Period. Modern corals, fish, and insects all evolved in this period as well. The supercontinent of Pangea started to break up. The Triassic Period ended in a mass extinction. The majority of species died out, but dinosaurs were spared. 
Jurassic  Period 	  The Triassic mass extinction gave dinosaurs the opportunity to really flourish during the Jurassic Period. Thats why this period is called the golden age of dinosaurs. The earliest birds also evolved during the Jurassic from dinosaur ancestors. In addition, all the major groups of mammals appeared. Flowering plants also appeared for the first time. New insects evolved to pollinate them. The continents continued to move apart. 
Cretaceous  Period 	  During the Cretaceous Period, the dinosaurs reached their maximum size and distribution. For example, the wellknown Tyrannosaurus rex weighed at least 7 tons! You can get an idea of how big it was from the T. rex skeleton in Figure 7.24. (Notice how small the person looks in the bottom left of the photo.) By the end of the Cretaceous, the continents were close to their present locations. The period ended with another mass extinction. This time, the dinosaurs went extinct. 
Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton on display in a museum 	  What happened to the dinosaurs? Some scientists think that a comet or asteroid may have crashed into Earth. This could darken the sky, shut down photosynthesis, and cause climate change. Other factors probably contributed to the mass extinction as well. 
Cenozoic  Era 	  The extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Mesozoic Era paved the way for mammals to take over. Thats why the Cenozoic Era is called the age of mammals. They soon became the dominant land animals on Earth. The Cenozoic is divided into two periods. 
Tertiary  Period 	  During the Tertiary Period, many new kinds of mammals evolved. For example, primates and human ancestors first appeared during this period. Many mammals also increased in size. Modern rain forests and grasslands appeared. Flowering plants and insects increased in numbers. 
Quaternary  Period 	  During the Quaternary Period, the climate cooled. This caused a series of ice ages. Glaciers advanced southward from the North Pole. They reached as far south as Chicago and New York City. Sea levels fell because so much water was frozen in glaciers. This exposed land bridges between continents. The land bridges allowed land animals to move to new areas. Some mammals adapted to the cold by evolving very large size and thick fur. An example is the woolly mammoth, shown in Figure 7.25. Other mammals moved closer to the equator. Those that couldnt adapt or move went extinct, along with many plants. The last ice age ended about 12,000 years ago. By then, our own species, Homo sapiens, had evolved. After that, we were eyewitnesses to the story of life. As a result, the recent past is less of a mystery than the billions of years before it. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago. The geologic time scale is used to organize the vast expanse of time since Earth formed. It is based on major events in the history of Earth and its living things. The Precambrian Supereon (4.6 billion544 million years ago) is the first major division of the geologic time scale. The first living cells may have evolved around 4 billion years ago. By 1 million years ago, the first multicellular eukaryotes had evolved. The Precambrian ended with the first of six mass extinctions that occurred during Earths history. The Paleozoic Era (544245 million years ago) started with an explosion of new kinds of organisms. Major evolutionary events during this era included the first appearance of invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Plants also colonized the land, and vascular plants and seed plants evolved. The era ended with the Permian mass extinction. The Mesozoic Era (24565 million years ago) is called the age of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs evolved from reptiles. They flourished after the Triassic mass extinction. They went extinct at the end of the era in the Cretaceous mass extinction. Birds and flowering plants also first appeared during the Mesozoic Era. The Cenozoic Era (65 million years agopresent) is called the age of mammals. Mammals became more diverse, and many increased in size. A series of ice ages affected the evolution of living things during this era. The human species evolved toward the end of the Mesozoic Era. 
Think  Critically 	  The first living things to evolve in the Precambrian were single-celled prokaryotes. When did they evolve? In which domain(s) of life are they placed? 
S  Prokaryotes 	  This photo shows the steaming hot water of Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park of Wyoming. Believe it or not, but tiny organisms live in abundance in the very hot water. What living things can withstand such high temperatures? They are prokaryotes classified as Archaea. Besides hot water, they live in other extreme environments as well. Youll learn more about these fascinating organisms when you read this chapter. Outline the classification and evolution of prokaryotes. Describe the structure of prokaryotic cells. Identify variation in the metabolism and habitats of prokaryotes. Explain how prokaryotes reproduce and increase genetic variation.

Introduction 	  No doubt youve had a sore throat before, and youve probably eaten cheese or yogurt. If so, then youve already encountered the amazing world of prokaryotes. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus. They also lack other membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotes are tiny. They can only be viewed with a microscope (see Figure 8.1). But they are the most numerous organisms on Earth. Without them, the world would be a very different place. 
Prokaryote  Classification and  Evolution 	  Prokaryotes are currently placed in two domains. A domain is the highest taxon in the classification of living things. Its even higher than the kingdom. 
Classification of  Prokaryotes 	  The prokaryote domains are the Bacteria Domain and Archaea Domain, shown in Figure 8.2. All other living things are eukaryotes and placed in the domain Eukarya. (Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a nucleus in their cells.) The tiny red rods in this micrograph are prokaryotes that cause the disease known as leprosy. The three domains of life include two prokaryote domains:	Bacteria and Archaea. 
Evolution of  Prokaryotes 	  Prokaryotes were the first living things to evolve on Earth, probably around 3.8 billion years ago. They were the only living things until the first eukaryotic cells evolved about 2 billion years ago. Prokaryotes are still the most numerous organisms on Earth. Its not certain how the three domains of life are related. Archaea were once thought to be offshoots of Bacteria that were adapted to extreme environments. For their part, Bacteria were considered to be ancestors of Eukarya. Scientists now know that Archaea share several traits with Eukarya that Bacteria do not share. How can this be explained? One hypothesis is that the first Eukarya formed when an archaean cell fused with a bacterial cell. By fusing, the two prokaryotic cells became the nucleus and cytoplasm of a new eukaryotic cell. If this hypothesis is correct, both prokaryotic domains are ancestors of Eukarya. 
Prokaryote  Structure 	  All prokaryotes consist of just one cell. They share a number of other traits as well. Watch this entertaining video from the Amoeba Sisters to see how prokaryotes differ in structure from eukaryotes: URL ?v=ruBAHiij4EA . 
Size and  Shape of  Prokaryotes 	  Most prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are typically only 0.2-2.0 micrometer in diameter. Eukaryotic cells are about 50 times as big. Prokaryotic cells have a variety of different cell shapes. Figure 8.3 shows three of the most common shapes: spirals (helices), spheres, and rods. Bacteria may be classified by their shape. 
Flagella 	  Most prokaryotes have one or more long, thin "whips" called flagella (flagellum, plural). You can see flagella in Figure 8.4. Flagella help prokaryotes move toward food or away from toxins. Each flagellum spins around a fixed base. This causes the cell to roll and tumble. 
Outer  Layers of a  Prokaryote  Cell 	  The cells of prokaryotes have two or three outer layers. Like all other living cells, prokaryotes have a cell membrane. It controls what enters and leaves the cell. Its also the site of many metabolic reactions. For example, cellular respiration takes place in the cell membrane. Most prokaryotes also have a cell wall. It lies just outside the cell membrane. It makes the cell stronger and more rigid. Many prokaryotes have another layer, called a capsule, outside the cell wall. The capsule protects the cell from chemicals and drying out. It also allows the cell to stick to surfaces and to other cells. You can see a model of a prokaryotic cell in Figure 8.5. Find the cell membrane, cell wall, and capsule in the figure. 
Cell  Structures 	  Several other prokaryotic cell structures are also shown in Figure 8.5. They include: cytoplasm. Like all other cells, prokaryotic cells are filled with cytoplasm. It includes watery cytosol and other structures. ribosomes. This is the site where proteins are made. cytoskeleton. This is a network of fibers and tubules that crisscrosses the cytoplasm. The cytoskeleton helps the cell keep its shape. pili. These are hair-like projections from the surface of the cell. They help the cell hold on to surfaces or do other jobs for the cell. 
Prokaryotic  	  All prokaryotic cells contain DNA, as you can see in Figure 8.6. Most of the DNA is in the form of a single large loop. This DNA coils up in the cytoplasm to form a structure called a nucleoid. There is no membrane surrounding it. Most prokaryotes also have one or more small loops of DNA. They are called plasmids. 
Biofilms 	  Some prokaryotes form structures consisting of many individual cells, like the cells in Figure 8.7. This is called a biofilm. A biofilm is a colony of prokaryotes that is stuck to a surface. The surface might be a rock or a hosts tissues. The sticky plaque that collects on your teeth between brushings is a biofilm. It consists of millions of prokaryotic cells. 
Prokaryote  Metabolism and  Habitats 	  Like all living things, prokaryotes need energy and carbon. They meet these needs in a variety of ways and in a range of habitats. 
Metabolism in  Prokaryotes 	  Prokaryotes may have just about any type of metabolism. They may get energy from light or from chemical compounds. They may get carbon from carbon dioxide or from other living things. Most prokaryotes get both energy and carbon from other living things. Many of them are decomposers. They break down wastes and remains of dead organisms. In this way, they help to recycle carbon and nitrogen through ecosystems. Some prokaryotes use energy in sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide. They do this by the process of photosynthesis. They are important producers in aquatic ecosystems. Look at the green streaks on the lake in Figure 8.8. They consist of billions of photosynthetic bacteria called cyanobacteria. 
Habitats of  Prokaryotes 	  Prokaryotes live in a wide range of habitats. For example, they may live in habitats with or without oxygen. Prokaryotes that need oxygen are described as aerobic. They use oxygen for cellular respiration. Examples include the prokaryotes that live on your skin. Prokaryotes that dont need oxygen or are poisoned by it are described as anaerobic. They use fermentation or other anaerobic processes rather than cellular respiration. Examples include many of the prokaryotes that live inside your body. Like most other living things, prokaryotes have a temperature range that they "like" best. Green cyanobacteria on a lake make food by photosynthesis. Thermophiles are prokaryotes that prefer a temperature above 45 C (113 F). They might be found in a compost pile. Mesophiles are prokaryotes that prefer a temperature of about 37 C (98 C). They might be found inside the body of an animal such as you. Psychrophiles are prokaryotes that prefer a temperature below 20 C (68 F). They might be found deep in the ocean. 
Prokaryote  Reproduction 	  Prokaryotes reproduce asexually. This can happen by binary fission or budding. In binary fission, a cell splits in two. First, the large circular chromosome is copied. Then the cell divides to form two new daughter cells. Each has a copy of the parent cells chromosome. In budding, a new cell grows from a bud on the parent cell. It only breaks off to form a new cell when it is fully formed. 
Genetic  Transfer 	  For natural selection to take place, organisms must vary in their traits. Asexual reproduction results in offspring that are all the same. They are also identical to the parent cell. So how can prokaryotes increase genetic variation? They can exchange plasmids. This is called genetic transfer. It may happen by direct contact between cells. Or a "bridge" may form between cells. Genetic transfer mixes the genes of different cells. It creates new combinations of alleles. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus. They are placed in two domains: the Bacteria Domain and the Archaea Domain. They were the first organisms to evolve. Its not certain how they are related to each other or to eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cells are extremely small and have a variety of shapes. Most have flagella and a cell wall. They have several other cell structures as well. Their DNA exists as large and small loops. Some prokaryotes form biofilms, which are colonies of cells stuck to a surface. Prokaryotes can have just about any type of metabolism. They may get energy from light or from chemical compounds. They may get carbon from carbon dioxide or from other living things. They also live in a wide range of habitats. For example, some are aerobic and others are anaerobic. All prokaryotes reproduce by asexual means. This may occur by binary fission or budding. They can increase their genetic variation by genetic transfer. In this process, cells exchange plasmids. 
Think  Critically 	  Prokaryotes in the Bacteria Domain cause many diseases in humans. Describe the abundance of bacteria on Earth. Outline how bacteria are classified. Identify relationships between bacteria and people. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  antibiotic drug antibiotic resistance bacteria (bacterium, singular) pathogen vector 
Introduction 	  The rod-shaped organisms in Figure below are bacteria called Salmonella. Bacteria (bacterium, singular) are prokaryotes in the Bacteria Domain. The word Salmonella may sound familiar. Thats because Salmonella is a common cause of food poisoning. Many other types of bacteria also cause human diseases. But not all bacteria are harmful to people. In fact, we could not survive without many of the trillions of bacteria that live in or on the human body. Youll learn why when you read this lesson. 
Counting  Bacteria 	  Bacteria are the most abundant living things on Earth. They live in almost all environments. They are found in the air, ocean, soil, and intestines of animals. They are even found in rocks deep below Earths surface. Any surface that has not been sterilized is likely to be covered with bacteria. The total number of bacteria in the world is amazing. Its estimated to be about 5 million trillion trillion. If you write that number in digits, it has 30 zeroes! 
Classifying  Bacteria 	  Bacteria are the most diverse organisms on Earth. Thousands of species of bacteria have been discovered. Many more are thought to exist. The known species are classified on the basis of various traits. For example, they may be classified by the shape of their cells. They may also be classified by how they react to a dye called Gram stain. 
Classifying  Bacteria by  Shape 	  Bacteria come in several different shapes. The different shapes can be seen by examining bacteria under a light microscope. Therefore, its relatively easy to classify them by shape. There are three types of bacteria based on shape: bacilli (bacillus, singular), or rod shaped. cocci (coccus, singular), or sphere shaped. spirilli (spirillus, singular), or spiral shaped. You can see a common example of each type of bacteria in Figure 8.10. 
Gram- Positive and  Gram- Negative  Bacteria 	  Different types of bacteria stain a different color when Gram stain is applied to them. This makes them easy to identify. Some stain purple and some stain red, as you can see in Figure 8.11. The two types differ in their outer layers. This explains why they stain differently. Bacteria that stain purple are called gram-positive bacteria.	They have a thick cell wall without an outer membrane. Bacteria that stain red are called gram-negative bacteria. They have a thin cell wall with an outer membrane. 
Bacteria and  People 	  Bacteria and people have many important relationships. Bacteria make our lives easier in a variety of ways. In fact, we could not survive without them. On the other hand, many bacteria can make us sick. Some of them are even deadly. For a dramatic overview of the many roles of bacteria, watch this stunning video: URL om/watch?v=qCn92mbWxd4 . 
Benefits of  Bacteria 	  Bacteria help usand all other living thingsby decomposing wastes. In this way, they recycle carbon and nitrogen in ecosystems. In addition, photosynthetic cyanobacteria are important producers. On ancient Earth, they added oxygen to the atmosphere and changed the course of evolution forever. There are billions of bacteria inside the human digestive tract. They help us digest food. They also make vitamins and play other important roles. We use bacteria in many other ways as well. For example, we use them to: create medical products such as vaccines. transfer genes in gene therapy. make fuels such as ethanol. clean up oil spills. kill plant pests. ferment foods. Do you eat any of the fermented foods pictured in Figure 8.12? If so, you are eating bacteria and their wastes. Yum! 
Bacteria and  Disease 	  You have ten times as many bacterial cells as human cells in your body. Luckily for you, most of these bacteria are harmless. However, some of them can cause disease. Any organism that causes disease is called a pathogen. Diseases caused by bacterial pathogens include food poisoning, strep throat, and Lyme disease. Bacteria that cause disease may spread directly from person to person. For example, they may spread when people shake hands with, or sneeze on, other people. Bacteria may also spread through food, water, or objects that have become contaminated with them. Some bacteria are spread by vectors. A vector is an organism that spreads bacteria or other pathogens. Most vectors are animals, commonly insects. For example, deer ticks like the one in Figure 8.13 spread Lyme disease. Ticks carry Lyme disease bacteria from deer to people when they bite them. Deer ticks are vectors for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The ticks are actually very small and may go unnoticed. 
Controlling  Bacteria 	  Bacteria in food or water usually can be killed by heating it to a high temperature. Generally, this temperature is at least 71 C (160 F). Bacteria on surfaces such as countertops and floors can be killed with disinfectants, such as chlorine bleach. Bacterial infections in people can be treated with antibiotic drugs. These drugs kill bacteria and may quickly cure the disease. If youve ever had strep throat, you were probably prescribed an antibiotic to treat it. Some bacteria have developed antibiotic resistance. They have evolved traits that make them resistant to one or more antibiotic drugs. You can see how this happens in Figure 8.14. Its an example of natural selection. Some bacteria are now resistant to most common antibiotic drugs. These infections are very hard to treat. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Bacteria are prokaryotes in the Bacteria Domain. They are the most abundant organisms on Earth. They are in or on almost everything. Bacteria are the most diverse organisms on Earth. They are often classified by shape or how they react to Gram stain. We cant live without bacteria because they provide so many benefits. However, some bacteria cause diseases. Bacteria may be controlled with high temperatures, disinfectants, or antibiotic drugs. Some bacteria have evolved antibiotic resistance. Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria. This diagram shows how antibiotic resistance evolves by natural selection. 
Think  Critically 	  Many Archaea live in extreme conditions. For example, some of them live in boiling hot water. Define archaean. Identify types of archaean extremophiles. Describe the range of habitats and ecological roles of archaeans. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  archaean extremophile methanogen 
Introduction 	  Look at the orange water in Figure 8.15. Its acidic water draining out of an old mine. What could live in such disgusting water? Surprisingly, many species of archaeans can. They thrive in the acid. Archaeans live in acidic water draining from an old mine. What Are Archaeans? Archaeans are prokaryotes in the Archaea Domain. They were first discovered in extreme environments such as hot springs. For a long time, they were classified as bacteria. As more was learned about them, they were found to be quite different from bacteria. They were finally placed in their own domain in the late 1970s. You can see the incredible story of their discovery in this brief video: URL . The study of archaeans is in its infancy. Scientists still know relatively little about them. New species of archaeans are being discovered all the time. 
Extremophiles 	  Many archaeans are extremophiles. Extremophiles are organisms that live in extreme conditions. For example, some archaeans live around hydrothermal vents. A hydrothermal vent is a crack on the ocean floor. You can see one in Figure 8.16. Boiling hot, highly acidic water pours out of the vent. These extreme conditions dont deter archaeans. They have evolved adaptations for coping with them. These conditions are like those on ancient Earth. This suggests that archaeans may have evolved very early in Earths history. There are four types of archaean extremophiles. Each type is described below. Extreme conditions pose many challenges to living cells. Archaeans have evolved adaptations that allow them to deal with the challenges. 
Halophiles 	  Halophiles are organisms that "love" salt. They can survive in very salty water. For example, they have been found in the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea between Israel and Jordan. Both of these bodies of water are much saltier than the ocean. 
Hyperthermophiles 	  Hyperthermophiles are organisms that "love" heat. Some archaeans can survive at very high temperatures. For example, they can grow in hot springs and geysers. One archaean species can even reproduce at 122 C (252 F). This is higher than the boiling point of water. It is the highest recorded temperature for any organism. 
Acidophiles 	  Acidophiles are organisms that "love" acids. They live in very acidic environments, such as acid mine drainage. They are also found near vents of volcanoes. The most acidophilic archaeans can thrive at negative pH values. No other organisms can survive in such acidic conditions. Archaea that live around hydrothermal vents like this one must be able to withstand extreme heat and acidity. 
Alkaliphiles 	  Alkaliphiles are organisms that "love" bases. Bases are like the opposite of acids. Basic environments where archaeans are found include Mono Lake in California, pictured in Figure 8.17. Mono Lake is the oldest lake in North America. The water is not only unusually basic. Its also saltier than the ocean. So archaeans that live in the water of Mono Lake must have adaptations to both salty and basic conditions. They are haloalkaliphiles. 
Archaea in the  Environment 	  Not all archaeans live in extreme conditions. In fact, archaeans are now known to live just about everywhere on Earth. They make up as much as 20 percent of Earths total mass of living things. 
Archaean  Habitats 	  Archaeans have been found in a broad range of habitats. For example, they live in soils, bodies of water, and marshlands. They even live in the human belly button! Archaeans are very common in the ocean. Archaeans in plankton may be some of the most abundant organisms on Earth. 
Ecological  Roles of  Archaeans 	  Like bacteria, archaeans are important decomposers. For example, archaeans help break down sewage in waste treatment plants. As decomposers, they help recycle carbon and nitrogen. Many archaeans live in close relationships with other organisms. For example, large numbers live inside animals, including humans. Unlike many bacteria, archaeans dont harm their hosts. None of them is known to cause human disease. Archaeans are more likely to help their hosts. For example, archaeans called methanogens live inside the gut of cows (see Figure 8.18). They help cows digest tough plant fibers made of cellulose. They produce methane gas as a waste product. Cows	like	this	one	can	digest	cellulose	only	with	the	help	of	archaean methanogens. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Archaeans are prokaryotes in the Archaea Domain. They were first discovered in extreme environments. They were classified as bacteria until placed in their own domain in the 1970s. Many archaeans are extremophiles. They include organisms that thrive in extremely salty, hot, acidic, or basic conditions. Some archaeans thrive in more than one type of extreme condition. Archaeans are now known to live just about everywhere on Earth. They are important decomposers. Many live in close relationships with other organisms. They are generally harmless and often beneficial. 
Think  Critically 	  All prokaryotes are single-celled organisms. 
S  Protists and  Fungi 	  This organism consists of a single cell with whip-like flagella. These are traits of prokaryotes such as bacteria. However, this organism has another trait that defines it as a eukaryote. It has a nucleus. This places it in the Eukarya Domain, the domain that also includes humans. Outline the classification and evolution of protists. Describe general traits of protists. Compare and contrast different types of protists. Identify human diseases caused by protists.

Introduction 	  Most single-celled eukaryotes are protists. Protists are the simplest eukaryotes. 
Protist  Classification and  Evolution 	  Protists are placed in the Protist Kingdom. This kingdom is one of four kingdoms in the Eukarya domain. The other three Eukarya kingdoms are the Fungi, Plant, and Animal Kingdoms. 
Classification of  Protists 	  The Protist Kingdom is hard to define. It includes many different types of organisms. You can see some examples of protists in Figure 9.1. The Protist Kingdom includes all eukaryotes that dont fit into one of the other three eukaryote kingdoms. For that reason, its sometimes called the trash can kingdom. The number of species in the Protist Kingdom is unknown. It could range from as few as 60,000 to as many as 200,000 species. For a beautiful introduction to the amazing world of protists, watch this video: URL be.com/watch?v=0-6dzU4gOJo . 
Evolution of  Protists 	  Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes. If so, they must have evolved from prokaryotes. How did this happen? How did cells without organelles acquire them? What was the origin of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other organelles? The most likely way organelles evolved is shown in Figure 9.2. First, smaller prokaryotic cells invaded, or were engulfed by, larger prokaryotic cells. The smaller cells benefited by getting nutrients and a safe place to live. The larger cells benefited by getting some of the organic molecules or energy released by the smaller cells. Eventually, the smaller cells evolved into organelles in the larger cells. After that, neither could live without the other. organelles may have

General  Traits of  Protists 	  Despite the diversity of protists, they do share some traits. The cells of all protists have a nucleus. They also have other membrane-bound organelles. For example, all of them have mitochondria, and some of them have chloroplasts. Most protists consist of a single cell. Some are multicellular but they lack specialized cells. Most protists live in wet places. They are found in oceans, lakes, swamps, or damp soils. Many protists can move. Most protists also have a complex life cycle. The life cycle of an organism is the cycle of phases it goes through until it returns to the starting phase. The protist life cycle includes both sexual and asexual reproduction. Why reproduce both ways? Each way has benefits. Asexual reproduction is fast. It allows rapid population growth when conditions are stable. Sexual reproduction increases genetic variation. This helps ensure that some organisms will survive if conditions change. 
Types of  Protists 	  Protists are classified based on traits they share with other eukaryotes. There are animal-like, plant-like, and funguslike protists. The three groups differ mainly in how they get carbon and energy. 
Animal- Like  Protists 	  Animal-like protists are called protozoa (protozoan, singular). Most protozoa consist of a single cell. Protozoa are probably ancestors of animals. Protozoa are like animals in two ways: 
Plant- Like  Protists 	  Plant-like protists are commonly called algae (alga, singular). Some algae consist of single cells. They are called diatoms. Other algae are multicellular. An example is seaweed. Seaweed called kelp can grow as large as trees. You can see both a diatom and kelp in Figure 9.4. Algae are probably ancestors of plants. Algae are like plants mainly because they contain chloroplasts. This allows them to make food by photosynthesis. Algae are important producers in water-based ecosystems such as the ocean. On the other hand, algae lack other plant structures. For example, they dont have roots, stems, or leaves. Also unlike plants, some algae can move. They may move with pseudopods or flagella. 
Fungus- Like  Protists 	  Fungus-like protists include slime molds and water molds, both shown in Figure 9.5. They exist as individual cells or as many cells that form a blob-like colony. They are probably ancestors of fungi. Like fungi, many fungus-like protists are decomposers. They absorb nutrients from dead logs, compost, and other organic remains Slime molds are commonly found on rotting organic matter such as compost. Swarms of cells move very slowly over the surface. They digest and absorb nutrients as they go. Water molds are commonly found in moist soil and surface water. Many water molds are plant pathogens or fish parasites. The slime mold (top) is called dog vomit mold. The water mold (bottom) is a plant parasite that has infiltrated a potato. 
Protists and  Human  Diseases 	  Many human diseases are caused by protists. Most of them are caused by protozoa. They are parasites that invade and live in the human body. The parasites get a place to live and nutrients from the human host. In return, they make the host sick. Examples of human diseases caused by protozoa include giardiasis and malaria. Protozoa that cause giardiasis are spread by contaminated food or water. They live inside the intestine. They may cause abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea. Protozoa that cause malaria are spread by a vector. They enter the blood through the bite of an infected mosquito. They live inside red blood cells. They cause overall body pain, fever, and fatigue. Malaria kills several million people each year. Most of the deaths occur in children. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Protists are eukaryotes in the Protist Kingdom. Most are single-celled organisms. Protists are thought to be the oldest eukaryotes. They probably evolved when some prokaryotic cells invaded or were engulfed by others. Traits of most protists include the ability to move, living in wet places, and complicated life cycles. Most reproduce both asexually and sexually. Protists are classified as animal-like, plant-like, or fungus-like. The three groups differ mainly in how they obtain carbon and energy. Several protozoa are human parasites. They cause diseases such as giardiasis and malaria. 
Think  Critically 	  Fungus-like protists resemble fungi. What are fungi? How do fungi differ from plants and animals? Define and give examples of fungi. Explain how fungi are classified and how they evolved. Describe fungal hyphae and mycelia. Outline how fungi reproduce. Identify roles of fungi in ecosystems. List uses human uses of fungi and examples of fungal diseases.

Introduction 	  Look at the gray fuzz growing on the bread in Figure 9.6. Its a type of fungus. It looks gross and it spoils the bread. But fungi like this actually play important roles in many ecosystems. There are also many human uses of fungi, which youll learn when you read this lesson. What Are Fungi? Fungi (fungus, singular) are relatively simple eukaryotic organisms. They are placed in their own kingdom, the Fungus Kingdom. Most fungi are multicellular organisms. These fungi are called molds. However, some fungi exist as single cells. These fungi are called yeasts. You can see examples of different types of fungi in Figure 9.7.

Classification and  Evolution of  Fungi 	  For a long time, scientists classified fungi as members of the Plant Kingdom. Fungi share several obvious traits with plants. For example, both fungi and plants lack the ability to move. Both grow in soil, and both have cell walls. Some fungi even look like plants. 
Fungi  Classification 	  Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have important traits that set them apart from plants. Thats why they are placed in their own kingdom. How do fungi differ from plants? The cell walls of fungi are made of chitin. Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the outer skeleton of insects. The cell walls of plants are made of cellulose. Fungi are heterotrophs that absorb food from other organisms. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food. The Fungus Kingdom is large and diverse. It may contain more than a million species. However, fewer than 100,000 species of fungi have been identified. 
Fungi  Evolution 	  The earliest fungi evolved about 600 million years ago. They lived in the water. Fungi colonized the land around the same time as plants. That was probably between 400 and 500 million years ago. After that, fungi became very abundant on land. By 250 million years ago, they may have been the dominant life forms on land. 
Structure of  Fungi 	  Yeasts grow as single cells. Other fungi grow into multicellular, thread-like structures. These structures are called hyphae (hypha, singular). You can see a photo of hyphae in Figure 9.8. They resemble plant roots. Each hypha consists of a group of cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus. The body is called the mycelium (mycelia, plural). A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact, the largest living thing on Earth is the mycelium of a single fungus. Nicknamed the humongous fungus, it grows in a forest in Oregon. A small part of the fungus is pictured in Figure 9.9. The giant fungus covers an area of 2384 acres. Thats about the size of 1,665 football fields! The fungus is estimated to be at least 2400 years old, but it could be much older. 
Fungi  Reproduction 	  Most fungi reproduce both asexually and sexually. In both types of reproduction, they produce spores. A spore is a special reproductive cell. When fungi reproduce asexually, they can spread quickly. This is good when conditions These mushrooms are a visible part of the humongous fungus in Oregon. Most of the fungus is underground in the soil. It spreads by sending out hyphae into the surrounding soil. are stable. They can increase their genetic variation by sexual reproduction. This is beneficial when conditions are changing. Variation helps ensure that at least some organisms survive the changing conditions. 
Asexual  Reproduction in  Fungi 	  During asexual reproduction, fungi produce haploid spores by mitosis of a haploid parent cell. A haploid cell has just one of each pair of chromosomes. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. Spores may be spread by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Wherever the spores land, they will develop into new hyphae only when conditions are suitable for growth. 
Sexual and asexual reproduction in fungi 	  Yeasts are an exception. They reproduce asexually by budding instead of by producing spores. An offspring cell forms on a parent cell. After it grows and develops, it buds off to form a new cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. You can see yeast cells budding in Figure 9.11. 
Sexual  Reproduction in  Fungi 	  Sexual reproduction also occurs in most fungi. It happens when two haploid hyphae mate. During mating, two haploid parent cells fuse. The single fused cell that results is a diploid spore. It is genetically different from both parents. The spore undergoes meiosis to form haploid daughter cells. These haploid cells develop into new hyphae. 
Roles of  Fungi in  Ecosystems 	  Most fungi grow on moist soil or rotting vegetation such as dead logs. Some fungi live in water. Others live in or on other organisms. Fungi get their nutrition by absorbing organic compounds from other organisms. The other organisms may be dead or alive, depending on the fungus. 
Fungi as  Decomposers 	  Most fungi get organic compounds from dead organisms. Fungi use their hyphae to penetrate deep into decaying organic matter. They produce enzymes at the tips of their hyphae. The enzymes digest the organic matter so the fungal cells can absorb it. Fungi are the main decomposers in forests. They are the only decomposers that can break down cellulose and wood. They have special enzymes for this purpose. 
Fungi  Symbiosis 	  Many fungi get organic compounds from living organisms. They have close relationships with other species. A close relationship between two species is called a symbiotic relationship. Two symbiotic relationships in fungi are mycorrhiza and lichen. These relationships are beneficial for both species. Mycorrhiza is a relationship between a fungus and a plant. The fungus grows in or on the plants roots. The fungus benefits from easy access to food made by the plant. The plant benefits because the fungal hyphae absorb water and nutrients from the soil that the plant needs. Lichen is a relationship between a fungus and cyanobacteria or green algae. The fungus grows around the bacterial or algal cells. The fungus benefits by getting some of the food made by the photosynthetic cells. The bacteria or algae benefit by getting some of the water and nutrients absorbed by the fungus. You can see a picture of lichen in Figure 9.12. Some fungi have a different kind of relationship with plants. They are plant parasites. They get food from the plants and cause harm to the plants in return. Fungi are the major causes of disease in agricultural crops. They may eventually kill their plant hosts. Some fungi are animal parasites. The wasp in Figure 9.13 is infected with a fungus. The fungus is the white fuzzy matter on the dark brown moth. 
Fungi and  People 	  Fungi may cause disease in people as well as other organisms. On the other hand, people have been using fungi for thousands of years. 
Human  Uses of  Fungi 	  One way we use fungi is by eating them. Many species of mushrooms are edible. Yeasts are used for break making. Other fungi are used to ferment foods, such as soy sauce and cheeses. You can see the fungus growing through the blue cheese in Figure 9.14. The fungus gives the cheese its distinctive appearance and taste. Blue cheese is blue because of the fungus growing throughout it. People also use fungi: to produce antibiotics. to produce human hormones such as insulin. as natural pesticides. as model research organisms. 
Fungi and  Human  Diseases 	  Several common human diseases are caused by fungi. They include ringworm and athletes foot, both shown in Figure 9.15. Ringworm isnt caused by a worm. Its a skin infection by a fungus that leads to a ring-shaped rash. The rash may occur on the head, neck, trunk, arms, or legs. Athletes foot is caused by the same fungus as ringworm. But in athletes foot, the fungus infects the skin between the toes. Athletes foot is the second most common skin disease in the U.S. Ringworm (left) and athletes foot (right) are fungal infections of the skin. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Fungi are eukaryotes in the Fungus Kingdom. Fungi include molds, which are multicellular, and yeasts, which are single-celled. Fungi are similar in some ways to plants but have unique traits that set them apart from plants. Fungi first evolved about 600 million years ago. Most fungi grow into multicellular threadlike hyphae. A mass of hyphae makes up the body, or mycelium, of the fungus. Most fungi reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction is by haploid spores (or by budding in yeasts). Sexual reproduction is by diploid spores. Most fungi are decomposers. They are the main decomposers in forests. Many fungi have symbiotic relationships with other species. People use fungi for food and other purposes. Some fungi cause human diseases.

S  Plants 	  These interesting yellow flowers grow on a plant called a skunk cabbage. Its named for its odor, which smells like rotten meat. The plant stores food in its fleshy roots all winter so it can flower very early in the spring. When the flowers bloom, there may still be snow on the ground. However, the plant produces enough heat to melt the snow. Why does the skunk cabbage put so much energy into producing its unusual, smelly blooms? The purpose is to attract flies and other insects that will pollinate its flowers. The production of flowers for reproduction was one of the most important traits to evolve in plants. Describe plants, their needs, and their importance. Identify three major types of plant tissues. Describe the structure and function of roots, stems, and leaves. Explain how plants grow. Outline the general life cycle of plants.

Introduction 	  Most modern plants, like the skunk cabbage, produce flowers. However, flowers evolved relatively late in the history of plants. The earliest plants not only lacked flowers. They also lacked leaves, roots, and stems. They probably resembled the alga in Figure 10.1. If the earliest plants were so different from modern plants, why are they even considered plants? What traits define a plant? Before reading the answer to this question, watch this amazing visual introduction to plants: URL outube.com/watch?v=_F8kYkn49Ec . The earliest plants may have resembled this modern-day alga. It grows under the water. What Are Plants? Plants are multicellular eukaryotes that are placed in the Plant Kingdom. Plant cells have cell walls that are made of cellulose. Plant cells also have chloroplasts. They allow plants to make food by photosynthesis. In addition, plants have specialized reproductive organs that produce gametes. Male reproductive organs produce sperm. Female reproductive organs produce eggs. Male and female reproductive organs may be on the same plant or on different plants. 
Needs of  Plants 	  Plants are somewhat limited by temperature in terms of where they can grow. They need temperatures above freezing while they are actively growing. They also need light, carbon dioxide, and water. These substances are required for photosynthesis. Like most other living things, plants need oxygen. Oxygen is required for cellular respiration. In addition, plants need minerals. The minerals are required to make proteins and other organic molecules. 
Importance of  Plants 	  Life as we know it would not be possible without plants. Why are plants so important? Plants supply food to nearly all land organisms, including people. We mainly eat either plants or other living things that eat plants. Plants produce oxygen during photosynthesis. Oxygen is needed by all aerobic organisms. Plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis.	This helps control the greenhouse effect and global warming. Plants recycle matter in ecosystems. For example, they are an important part of the water cycle. They take up liquid water from the soil through their roots. They release water vapor to the air from their leaves. This is called transpiration. Plants provide many products for human use. They include timber, medicines, dyes, oils, and rubber. Plants provide homes for many other living things. For example, a single tree may provide food and shelter to many species of animals, like the birds in Figure 10.2. Many birds build their nests in trees. Plant materials are often used to build them. 
Plant  Tissues 	  A tissue is a group of specialized cells of the same kind that perform the same function. Modern plants have three major types of tissues. Theyre called dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. 
Dermal  Tissue 	  Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant. Its like the plants skin. Cells of dermal tissue secrete a waxy substance called cuticle. Cuticle helps prevent water loss and damage to the plant. 
Ground  Tissue 	  Ground tissue makes up much of the inside of a plant. The cells of ground tissue carry out basic metabolic functions and other biochemical reactions. Ground tissue may also store food or water. 
Vascular  Tissue 	  Vascular tissue runs through the ground tissue inside a plant. It transports fluids throughout the plant. Vascular tissue actually consists of two types of tissues, called xylem and phloem. The two types of vascular tissue are packaged together in bundles. You can see them in the celery in Figure 10.3. Xylem carries water and dissolved minerals from the roots upward to the leaves. Phloem carries water and dissolved sugar from the leaves to other parts of the plant. These stalks of celery contain bundles of vascular tissue inside ground tissue. 
Plant  Organs 	  An organ is a structure composed of two or more types of tissues that work together to do a specific task. Most modern plants have several organs that help them survive and reproduce in a variety of habitats. Major organs of most plants include roots, stems, and leaves. These and other plant organs generally contain all three major tissue types. 
Roots 	  Roots are important organs in most modern plants. There are two types of roots: primary roots, which grow downward; and secondary roots, which branch out to the sides. Together, all the roots of a plant make up the plants root system. Figure 10.4 shows two different types of plant root systems. A taproot system has a very long primary root, called a taproot. A fibrous root system has many smaller roots and no large, primary root. The roots of plants have three major jobs: absorbing water and minerals, anchoring and supporting the plant, and storing food. Roots are covered with thin-walled dermal cells and tiny root hairs. These features are well suited to absorb water and dissolved minerals from the soil. Root systems help anchor plants to the ground. They allow plants to grow tall without toppling over. A tough covering may replace the dermal cells in older roots. This makes them ropelike and even stronger. In many plants, ground tissue in roots stores food produced by the leaves during photosynthesis. 
Stems 	  Stems are organs that hold plants upright. They allow plants to get the sunlight and air they need. Stems also bear leaves, flowers, cones, and smaller stems. These structures grow at points called nodes. The stem between nodes is called an internode. (See Figure 10.5.) Stems are needed for transport and storage. Their vascular tissue carries water and minerals from roots to leaves. It carries dissolved sugar from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Without this connection between roots and leaves, plants could not survive high above the ground in the air. In many plants, ground tissue in stems also stores food or water during cold or dry seasons. 
Leaves 	  Leaves are the keys not only to plant life but to virtually all life on land. The primary role of leaves is to collect sunlight and make food by photosynthesis. Leaves vary in size, shape, and how they are arranged on stems. You can see examples of different types of leaves in Figure 10.6. Each type of leaf is well suited for the plants environment. It maximizes light exposure while conserving water, reducing wind resistance, or benefiting the plant in some other way in its particular habitat. For example, some leaves are divided into many smaller leaflets. This reduces wind resistance and water loss. Leaves are basically factories for photosynthesis. A factory has specialized machines to produce a product. In a leaf, the "machines" are the chloroplasts. 
Nodes and internode of a stem 	  A factory is connected to a transportation system that supplies it with raw materials and carries away the finished product. In a leaf, transport is carried out by veins containing vascular tissue. Veins carry water and minerals to the cells of leaves. They carry away dissolved sugar. A factory has bricks, siding, or other external protection. A leaf is covered with dermal cells. They secrete waxy cuticle to prevent evaporation of water from the leaf. A factory has doors and windows to let some materials enter and leave. The surface of the leaf has tiny pores called stomata (stoma, singular). They can open and close to control the movement of gases between the leaves and the air. You can see a close-up of a stoma in Figure 10.7. 
How  Plants  Grow 	  Most plants continue to grow throughout their lives. Like other multicellular organisms, plants grow through a combination of cell growth and cell division. Cell growth increases cell size. Cell division increases the number of cells. As plant cells grow, they also become specialized into different cell types. Once cells become specialized, they can no longer divide. So how do plants grow after that? The key to continued growth is meristem. Meristem is a type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide. Meristem at the tips of roots and stems allows them to grow in length. This is called primary growth. The stem (trunk) of the giant sequoia tree in Figure 10.8 has achieved amazing growth in length during its many years of life. Meristem within and around vascular tissues allows growth in width. This is called secondary growth. The rings in the tree stump in Figure 10.8 show secondary growth in a tree. Each ring represents one year of growth. Tree height (left) represents growth in length. Tree rings (right) represent growth in width. 
Life  Cycle of  Plants 	  All plants have a life cycle that includes alternation of generations. You can see a general plant life cycle in Figure 10.9. For an entertaining introduction to alternation of generations, watch this video: URL atch?v=iWaX97p6y9U . This diagram shows the general life cycle of a plant. There is variation in the details of the life cycle of different plant species. 
Alternation of  Generations 	  Plants alternate between haploid and diploid generations. Haploid cells have one of each pair of chromosomes. Diploid cells have two of each pair. Plants in the haploid generation are called gametophytes. They form from haploid spores. They have male and/or female reproductive organs and reproduce sexually. They produce haploid gametes by mitosis. Fertilization of gametes produces diploid zygotes. Zygotes develop into the diploid generation. Plants in the diploid generation are called sporophytes. They form from the fertilization of gametes. They reproduce asexually. They have a structure called a sporangium that produces haploid spores by meiosis. Spores develop into the haploid generation. Then the cycle repeats. 
Variation in the  Life  Cycle of  Plants 	  One of the two generations of a plants life cycle is usually dominant. Individuals in the dominant generation generally live longer and grow larger. They are the organisms that you would recognize as a fern, tree, or other plant. Individuals in the nondominant generation tend to be smaller and shorter-lived. They often live in or on the dominant plant. They may go unnoticed. Early plants spent most of their life cycle as gametophytes. Some modern plants such as mosses still have this type of life cycle. However, almost all modern plants spend most of their life cycle as sporophytes. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Plants are multicellular eukaryotes in the Plant Kingdom. They have cell walls of cellulose and chloroplasts for photosynthesis. Life as we know it depends on plants. They feed most other organisms. They also perform many other services. Modern plants have three different types of tissues. They are called dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. Each type of tissue has a different function. The three types of tissues work together in most plant organs. Three organs commonly found in modern plants are roots, stems, and leaves. Plants continue to grow throughout life. Cells increase in both size and number. Undifferentiated cells in meristem tissue can keep dividing. They allow growth to continue. All plants have a life cycle that alternates between haploid and diploid generations. Plants vary in terms of which generation is dominant. Most modern plants have a dominant diploid generation. 
Think  Critically 	  The earliest plants were similar to green algae and lived in water. Describe the first plants. Discuss colonization of land by plants. Describe the early evolution of vascular plants. Explain why the evolution of seeds was such an important event. Explain why the evolution of flowers made flowering plants so successful. Outline the classification of modern plants. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  angiosperm cone embryo flower fruit germination gymnosperm petal pistil pollen pollinator seed stamen 
Introduction 	  The first plants lived in water. As shown in Figure 10.10, plants are thought to have evolved from aquatic green algae. Plants were the first organisms to move from water to land. They evolved important adaptations for life out of water. These adaptations included vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. Each of these major adaptations made plants better suited for dry land and much more successful. For a good introduction to the origin and diversity of plants, watch this short video: URL . 
The  First  Plants 	  The first plants were probably similar to the stoneworts in Figure 10.11. Stoneworts are green algae. Like stoneworts, the first plants were aquatic. They may have had stalks but not stems. They also may have had hair-like structures called rhizoids but not roots. The first plants probably had male and female reproductive organs and needed water to reproduce. In stoneworts, sperm need at least a thin film of moisture to swim to eggs. Individual stonewort alga (left) and an underwater field of stoneworts (right) 
Colonizing the  Land 	  By the time the earliest plants evolved, animals were already the dominant living things in the water. Plants were also limited to the upper layer of water. Only near the top of the water column is there enough sunlight for photosynthesis. So plants never became dominant aquatic organisms. 
Moving  From  Water to  Land 	  All that changed when plants moved from water to land. This may have happened by 500 million years ago or even earlier. On land, everything was wide open. There were no other living things. Without plants, there was nothing for other organisms to eat. Land could not be colonized by other organisms until land plants became established. The earliest land plants may have resembled the modern liverworts in Figure 10.12. Liverworts are small plants that grow close to the ground. 
Life  Is  Hard  Without  Water 	  Moving to the land was a huge step in plant evolution. Until then, virtually all life had evolved in water. Dry land was a very different kind of place. The biggest problem was the dryness. Simply absorbing enough water to stay alive was a huge challenge. It kept early plants small and low to the ground. Water was also needed for sexual reproduction, so sperm could swim to eggs. There were other hardships on land besides dryness. For example, sunlight on land was strong and dangerous. Solar radiation put land organisms at high risk of mutations. 
Evolution of  Vascular  Plants 	  After they left the water, plants evolved adaptations that helped them withstand the harsh conditions on land. One of the earliest and most important adaptations to evolve was vascular tissue. For a fast-paced introduction to vascular plants and their successes, watch this video: URL . 
Evolution of  Vascular  Tissues 	  Vascular tissue forms a plants "plumbing system." It carries water and dissolved minerals from the soil to all the other cells of the plant. It also carries food (sugar dissolved in water) from photosynthetic cells to other cells in the plant for growth or storage. The evolution of vascular tissue revolutionized the plant kingdom. Vascular tissue greatly improved the ability of plants to absorb and transfer water. This allowed plants to grow larger and taller. They could also liver in drier habitats and survive periods of drought. Early vascular plants probably resembled the fern in Figure 10.13. 
Other  Adaptations in  Vascular  Plants 	  Other early adaptations to life on land included the evolution of true leaves and roots. Leaves allowed plants to take better advantage of sunlight for photosynthesis. Roots helped plants absorb water and minerals from soil. Early land plants also evolved a dominant sporophyte generation. Sporophytes are diploid, so they have two copies of each gene. This gives them a "back-up" copy in case of mutation. This was important for coping with the strong solar radiation and higher risk of mutations on land. 
Success of  Vascular  Plants 	  With all these adaptations, its easy to see why vascular plants were very successful. They spread quickly and widely on land. As vascular plants spread, many nonvascular plants went extinct. Vascular plants became and remain the dominant land plants on Earth. Modern ferns are similar to early vascular plants. The yellow structures on this fern are sporangia. They produce spores for reproduction. 
Evolution of  Seed  Plants 	  Early vascular plants still needed moisture. They needed it in order to reproduce. Sperm had to swim from male to female reproductive organs for fertilization. Even spores needed some water to grow and often to disperse as well. In addition, dryness and other harsh conditions made it very difficult for tiny new offspring plants to survive. With the evolution of seeds in vascular plants, all that changed. Seed plants evolved a number of adaptations that made it possible to reproduce without water. Seeds also nourished and protected tiny new offspring. As a result, seed plants were wildly successful. They exploded into virtually all of Earths habitats. 
Why  Seeds  Are  Adaptive on  Land 	  A seed is a reproductive structure that contains an embryo and a food supply, called endosperm. Both the embryo and endosperm are enclosed within a tough outer coating, called a hull (or shell). You can see these parts of a seed in Figure 10.14. An embryo is a zygote that has already started to develop and grow. Early growth and development of a plant embryo inside a seed is called germination. The seed protects and nourishes the embryo and gives it a huge head start in the "race" of life. Both a parent plant and its offspring are better off if they dont grow too closely together. That way, they will not need to compete for resources. Many seeds have structures that help them travel away from the parent plant. You can see some examples in Figure 10.15. Some seeds can also wait to germinate until conditions are favorable for growth. This increases the offsprings chances of surviving even more. 
Other  Reproductive  Adaptations in  Seed  Plants 	  Seed plants also evolved other reproductive structures. These included ovules, pollen, and pollen tubes. An ovule is a female reproductive structure in seed plants. It contains a tiny female gametophyte. The gametophyte produces an egg cell. After the egg is fertilized by sperm, the ovule develops into a seed. Pollen is a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough capsule. Pollen carries sperm to an ovule while preventing the sperm from drying out. Pollen grains cant swim, but they are very light, so the wind can carry them. Therefore, they can travel through air instead of water. Pollen also evolved the ability to grow a tube, called a pollen tube. Sperm could be transferred through the tube directly from the pollen grain to the egg. This allowed sperm to reach an egg without swimming through a film of water. It finally freed plants from depending on moisture to reproduce. 
Early  Seed  Plants 	  The first seed plants formed seeds in cones, like the cone in Figure 10.16. Cones are reproductive structures made of overlapping scales. Scales are modified leaves. Male cones contain pollen. Female cones contain eggs. They are also where seeds develop. The seeds in cones are "naked." They arent protected inside an ovary, which was a later adaptation of seed plants. and	loose, naked 
Evolution of  Flowering  Plants 	  Some seed plants evolved another major adaptation. This was the formation of seeds in flowers. Flowers are plant structures that contain male and/or female reproductive organs. 
Parts of a  Flower 	  You can see the parts of a typical flower in Figure 10.17. The male reproductive organ in a flower is the stamen. It has a stalk-like filament that ends in an anther. The anther is where pollen forms. The female reproductive organ in a flower is the pistil. It consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. The stigma is the top of the pistil. It is sticky to help it "catch" pollen. The style connects the stigma to the ovary. The ovary is where eggs form and seeds develop. As seeds develop, the ovary turns into a fruit. The fruit protects the seeds. It also attracts animals that may eat the fruit and help disperse the seeds. Petals are usually the most visible parts of a flower. They may be large and showy and are often brightly colored. Leaf-like green sepals protect the flower while it is still a bud. 
Pollinators 	  The showy petals of flowers evolved to help attract pollinators. Wind-blown pollen might land just anywhere and be wasted. A pollinator is an animal that picks up pollen on its body and carries it directly to another flower of the same species. This helps ensure that pollination occurs. Pollinators are usually small animals such as bees, butterflies, and bats. You can see an example in Figure 10.18. 
Classification of  Modern  Plants 	  The most basic division of modern plants is between nonvascular and vascular plants. Vascular plants are further divided into those that reproduce without seeds and those that reproduce with seeds. Seed plants, in turn, are divided into those that produce naked seeds in cones and those that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers. 
Nonvascular  Plants 	  Modern nonvascular plants are called bryophytes. There are about 17,000 bryophyte species. They include liverworts, hornworts, and mosses. Mosses are the most numerous group of bryophytes. You can see an example of This bee is peppered with yellow pollen grains that it will carry to other flowers of the same species. moss in Figure 10.19. Like the moss in the figure, most bryophytes are small. They lack not only vascular tissues. They also lack true roots, leaves, seeds, and flowers. Bryophytes live in moist habitats. Without the adaptations of vascular plants, bryophytes are not very good at absorbing water. They also need water to reproduce. 
Vascular  Plants 	  Todays vascular plants are called tracheophytes. Their vascular tissue is specialized to transport fluid. This allows them to grow tall and take advantage of sunlight high up in the air. It also allows them to live in drier habitats. Most modern plants are tracheophytes. There are hundreds of thousands of species of them. Seedless vascular plants include plants such as ferns. You can see a fern in Figure 10.20. Ferns reproduce with spores instead of seeds. The black dots on the back of the fern leaf in Figure 10.20 are spores. 
Seed  Plants 	  Seed plants are vascular plants that reproduce with seeds. Modern seed plants are called spermatophytes. Seeds allow the plants to reproduce without water. Most vascular plants today are seed plants. Modern seed plants include gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms are seed plants that produce naked seeds in cones. There are about 1000 species of gymnosperms. Conifers are the most common group of gymnosperms. The spruce tree in Figure 10.21 is an example of a conifer. Angiosperms are seed plants that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers. Today, they are by far the most diverse type of seed plants. In fact, the vast majority of all modern plants are angiosperms. There are hundreds of thousands of species of them. The apple tree in Figure 10.21 is an example of a common angiosperm. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The first plants probably evolved from aquatic green algae. They had male and female reproductive organs. However, they lacked true stems, roots, and leaves. Plants were the first living things to move from water to land. They had to cope with dryness and strong solar radiation. The first major adaptation that evolved in land plants was vascular tissue. This type of tissue helped land plants cope with dryness. Vascular plants also evolved true stems, roots, and leaves. Some vascular plants evolved seeds. This freed them from needing water to reproduce. Early seed plants produced naked seeds in cones. Some seed plants evolved flowers for the production of seeds. Flowers contain both male and female reproductive organs, including an ovary where eggs form and seeds develop. Flowers also attract pollinators. The most basic division of modern plants is between nonvascular and vascular plants. Vascular plants are further divided into those that reproduce without seeds and those that reproduce with seeds. Seed plants, in turn, are divided into those that produce naked seeds in cones (gymnosperms) and those that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers (angiosperms). 
Think  Critically 	  Plants cant move away from danger. Explain how plants respond to stimuli in their environment. Identify special adaptations in plants. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  aquatic plant carnivorous plant epiphyte gravitropism phototropism tropism xerophyte 
Introduction 	  Like all living things, plants detect and respond to stimuli in their environment. Unlike animals, plants cant run, fly, or swim toward food or away from danger. They are usually rooted firmly in the soil, like the tree in Figure 10.22. 
Plant  Responses 	  Instead of fleeing, a plants primary way of responding is to change how it is growing. One way is by tropisms. 
Plant  Tropisms 	  A tropism is a turning toward, or away from, a stimulus in the environment. Examples of tropisms in plants include gravitropism and phototropism. You can see both tropisms in action in this amazing time-lapse video: URL outube.com/watch?v=F3Oj2er-91s . Gravitropism is a response to gravity. Plant roots always grow downward because of the pull of Earths gravity. Specialized cells in the tips of plant roots detect and respond to gravity in this way. Phototropism is a response to light. Plant stems and leaves grow toward a light source. The house plant in Figure 10.23 shows the effects of phototropism. The plant receives light mainly from the left so it grows in that direction. 
Daily and  Seasonal  Responses of  Plants 	  Plants also detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness. For example, some plants open their leaves during the day to collect sunlight and then close their leaves at night to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by going dormant. They suspend growth and development in order to survive the extreme coldness and dryness of winter. Part of this response causes the leaves of many trees to change color and then fall off (see Figure 10.24). Dormancy ensures that plants will grow and produce seeds only when conditions are favorable. The leaves of many trees turn brilliant colors of red and yellow when days grow shorter in the fall. 
Plant  Responses to  Disease 	  Plants dont have an immune system, but they do respond to disease. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of cells surrounding infected tissue. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce hormones and toxins to fight pathogens. For example, willow trees, like the one in Figure 10.25, produce salicylic acid to kill bacteria. The same compound is used in many acne products for the same reason. Exciting new research suggests that plants may even produce chemicals that warn other, nearby plants of threats to their health. The warnings allow nearby plants to prepare for their own defense. As these and other responses show, plants may be rooted in place, but they are far from helpless. 
Plants with  Special  Adaptations 	  Plants live just about everywhere on Earth. To live in so many different habitats, they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce under a diversity of conditions. Some plants have evolved special adaptations that let them live in extreme environments. 
Aquatic  Plants 	  All plants are adapted to live on land. Or are they? All living plants today have land-plant ancestors. But some plants now live in the water. They have had to evolve new adaptations for their watery habitat. This willow tree produces a compound that fights bacteria. Modern plants that live in water are called aquatic plants. Living in water has certain advantages for plants. One advantage is, well, the water. Theres plenty of it and its all around. Therefore, most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving water. They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticle on leaves. Support is also less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water. As a result, adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not necessary for most aquatic plants. Living in water does present challenges to plants, however. For one thing, pollination by wind or animals isnt feasible under water. Sunlight also cant penetrate very far below the water surface. Thats why some aquatic plants have adaptations that help them keep their flowers and leaves above water. An example is the water lily, shown in Figure 10.26. The water lily has bowl-shaped flowers and broad, flat leaves that float. Plants that live in moving water, such as streams or rivers, may have different adaptations. For example, the cattails shown in Figure 10.26 have narrow, strap-like leaves that reduce their resistance to moving water. Water lilies and cattails have different adaptations for life in the water. 
Xerophytes 	  Plants that live in extremely dry environments have the opposite problem: how to get and keep water. Plants that are adapted to very dry environments are called xerophytes. Their adaptations may help them increase water intake, decrease water loss, or store water when its available. The saguaro cactus pictured in Figure 10.27 has adapted in all three ways. When it was still a very small plant, just a few inches high, its shallow roots already reached out as much as 2 meters (7 feet) from the base of the stem. By now, its root system is much more widespread. It allows the cactus to gather as much moisture as possible from rare rainfalls. The saguaro doesnt have any leaves to lose water by transpiration. It also has a large, barrel-shaped stem that can store a lot of water. Thorns protect the stem from thirsty animals that might try to get at the water inside. 
Epiphytes 	  Plants called epiphytes grow on other plants. They obtain moisture from the air instead of the soil. Most epiphytes are ferns or orchids that live in rainforests. Host trees provide support for the plants. They allow epiphytes to get air and sunlight high above the forest floor. This lets the plants get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough light for photosynthesis. Being elevated may also reduce the risk of being eaten by herbivores. In addition, it may increase the chances of pollination by wind. 
Carnivorous  Plants 	  Carnivorous plants are plants that get some or most of their nutrients (but not energy or carbon compounds) from other organisms. They trap and digest insects or other small animals or protozoa. However, they still need sunlight in order to make food by photosynthesis. Carnivorous plants have adapted to grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients. They are found in places such as bogs and rock outcroppings. Venus fly traps, like those in Figure 10.28, are well-known carnivorous plants. Watch this amazing video trailer to see these and other carnivorous plants in action: URL . Venus fly traps are carnivorous plants. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A plants main response to stimuli in its environment is to change how it is growing. For example, plant roots grow toward Earths gravity. Stems and leaves bend toward sunlight. Plants also respond to daily and seasonal changes and to disease. Some plants have evolved special adaptations to extreme environments. Such plants include aquatic plants, xerophytes, epiphytes, and carnivorous plants.

Chapter  Outline 	  Do you know what this photo shows? Is it a strange tree branch? A cactus? Maybe a fungus? Actually, its an animal called a sea sponge. A sea sponge doesnt look anything like the animals youre probably familiar withanimals like ducks and dogs, fish and frogs. Why is a sea sponge considered an animal? What traits must an organism have to be classified in the Animal Kingdom? Youll find out in this chapter. Youll learn just what it means to be an animal. Identify basic traits of animals. Outline the classification of animals.

Introduction 	  There is great variation among species that are called animals. You can see some of the variation in Figure 11.1. Despite this variation, there are a number of traits that are shared by all animals. What traits do all animals share? Read on to find out. 
Basic  Animal  Traits 	  Animals are multicellular eukaryotes in the Animal Kingdom. All animals are heterotrophs. They eat other living things because they cant make their own food. All animals also have specialized cells that can do different jobs. Most animals have higher levels of organization as well. They may have specialized tissues, organs, and even organ systems. Having higher levels of organization allows animals to perform many complex functions. For a visual introduction to what makes a living thing an animal, watch this short video: URL DXPhJUHooP8 . 
Specialized  Cells 	  Like the cells of all eukaryotes, animal cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Unlike the cells of eukaryotes in the Plant and Fungus Kingdoms, animal cells lack a cell wall. This gives animal cells flexibility. It lets them take on different shapes. This in turn allows them to become specialized for particular jobs. The human nerve cell in Figure 11.2 is a good example of a specialized animal cell. Its shape suits it for its function of sending nerve signals to other cells. A nerve cell couldnt take this shape if it were surrounded by a rigid cell wall. 
What  Animals  Can  Do 	  With their specialized cells and higher levels of organization, animals can do several things that other eukaryotes cannot. Animals can detect and quickly respond to a variety of stimuli. They have specialized nerve cells that can detect light, sound, touch, or other stimuli. Most animals also have a nervous system that can direct the body to respond to the stimuli. All animals can move, at least during some stage of their life cycle. Specialized muscle and nerve tissues work together to allow movement. Being able to move lets animals actively search for food and mates. It also helps them escape from predators and other dangers. Virtually all animals have internal digestion of food. Animals consume other organisms and may use special tissues and organs to digest them. (Other heterotrophs, such as fungi, absorb nutrients directly from the environment.) 
General  Life  Cycle of  Animals 	  Many animals have a relatively simple life cycle. A general animal life cycle is shown in Figure 11.3. Most animals spend the majority of their life as diploid organisms. Just about all animals reproduce sexually. Diploid adults undergo meiosis to produce haploid sperm or eggs. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse. The diploid zygote that forms develops into an embryo. The embryo eventually develops into an adult, often going through one or more larval stages on the way. A larva (larvae, plural) is a distinct juvenile form that many animals go through before becoming an adult. The larval form may be very different from the adult form. For example, a caterpillar is the larval form of an insect that becomes a butterfly as an adult. 
How  Animals  Are  Classified 	  The Animal Kingdom is one of four kingdoms in the Eukarya Domain. The Animal Kingdom, in turn, is divided into almost 40 phyla. Table 11.1 lists the 9 animal phyla that contain the largest numbers of species. Each phylum in the table has at least 10,000 species.

Echinodermata 	  sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers 
Chordata 	  tunicates, lancelets, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals One basic way to divide animals is between invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrates are animals that lack a vertebral column, or backbone. All the phyla in Table 11.1, except the Phylum Chordata, consist only of invertebrates. Even the Phylum Chordata includes some invertebrate taxa. Invertebrates make up about 95 percent of all animal species. Vertebrates are animals that have a backbone. All of them are placed in the Phylum Chordata. Modern vertebrates include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Only about 5 percent of animal species are vertebrates. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Animals are multicellular eukaryotes in the Animal Kingdom. They are heterotrophic, meaning that they consume other organisms. Animals have specialized cells and often higher levels of organization. This allows them to do things that other eukaryotes cannot, such as move and digest food internally. Animals generally have a simple life cycle. The Animal Kingdom is one of four kingdoms in the Eukarya Domain. The Animal Kingdom, in turn, is divided into almost 40 modern phyla. The Animal Kingdom can also be divided into two basic groups: invertebrates and vertebrates. Most animal species are invertebrates, which lack a backbone.

Introduction 	  The creepy, crawly millipede in Figure 11.4 is a modern-day animal. It belongs to Phylum Arthropoda. It also represents a major event in animal evolution: the move from water to land. The earliest animals were aquatic, which means they lived in the water. The first terrestrial, or land-living, animals were probably arthropods like the millipede. However, the move to the land occurred relatively late in animal evolution. The story of animal evolution actually began at least 200 million years before the first animals went ashore. For a good visual introduction to the evolution of animals, watch this short video: URL . This modern millipede probably resembles the first animals to live on land. 
Timing of  Animal  Evolution 	  The partial geologic time scale in Figure 11.5 shows when some of the major events in animal evolution took place. The oldest animal fossils are about 630 million years old, so presumably animals evolved around that time or somewhat earlier. The earliest animals were aquatic invertebrates. The first vertebrates evolved around 550 million years ago. By 500 million years ago, most modern phyla of animals had evolved. The first terrestrial animals evolved about 50 million years after that. 
Trends in  Invertebrate  Evolution 	  Animals evolved many important traits that set them apart from other eukaryotes. The traitsand the order in which they evolvedinclude: multicellularity and cell specialization; tissues and higher levels of organization; body symmetry; third embryonic cell layer (mesoderm); digestive system; fluid-filled body cavity (coelom);  segmented body; and notochord. Each of these traits is described below. All of them evolved in invertebrates. Each major trait to evolve led to a new stage in animal evolution. The phyla in Table 11.1 represent modern animals at each of these major stages. Refer back to the table as you read about the evolution of these traits. 
Multicellularity 	  The first animal trait to evolve was multicellularity. This is the presence of multiple cells in a single organism. Scientists think that the earliest animals with multiple cells evolved from animal-like protists that lived in colonies. Some of the cells in the colonies became specialized for different jobs. After a while, the specialized cells came to need each other for survival. Thus, the first multicellular animals evolved. Multicellularity was highly adaptive. Multiple cells could do different jobs. They could evolve special adaptations that allowed them to do a particular job really well. Modern animals that represent this stage of animal evolution are sponges. They are placed in Phylum Porifera (see Table 11.1). They have multiple specialized cells, but their cells are not organized into tissues. 
Tissues 	  The next major stage of animal evolution was the evolution of tissues. It was the first step in the evolution of organs and organ systems. At first, invertebrates developed tissues from just two embryonic cell layers. There was an outer cell layer called ectoderm and an inner cell layer called endoderm. The two cell layers allowed different types of tissues to form. Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution include jellyfish. They are placed in Phylum Cnidaria. 
Body  Symmetry 	  Another trait that evolved early was symmetry. A symmetrical organism can be divided into two identical halves. Both the coral and the beetle in Figure 11.6 have symmetry, while the sponge lacks symmetry. There are two types of symmetry: radial and bilateral. Radial symmetry is demonstrated by the coral in Figure 11.6. It can be divided into identical halves along any diameter, just like a circular pie. Radial symmetry was the first type of symmetry to evolve. Animals with radial symmetry, such as cnidarians, have no sense of left or right. This makes controlled movement in these directions impossible. Bilateral symmetry is demonstrated by the beetle in Figure 11.6. It can be divided into identical halves just down the middle from top to bottom. Bilateral symmetry could come about only after animals evolved a distinctive head region where nerve tissue was concentrated. The concentration of nerve tissue in the head region was the first step in the evolution of a brain. Animals with bilateral symmetry can tell left from right. This gives them better control over the direction of their movements. 
Mesoderm 	  The next major trait to evolve was mesoderm. This is a third embryonic layer of cells between the ectoderm and the endoderm. Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution are the flatworms. They are placed in Phylum Platyhelminthes. You can see the mesoderm in a flatworm in Figure 11.7. Evolution of this new cell layer allowed animals to develop new types of tissues, such as muscle tissue. 
Digestive  System 	  Even early invertebrates had a digestive system. However, the earliest digestive system was incomplete. There was just one opening for food to enter the body and waste to leave the body. In other words, the same opening was both mouth and anus. A modern jellyfish has this type of digestive system, as shown in Figure 11.8. Eventually a complete digestive system with two body openings evolved, as shown in Figure 11.8. With a separate mouth and anus, food could move through the body in just one direction. This made digestion more efficient. An animal could keep eating while digesting food and getting rid of waste. Different parts of the digestive tract could also become specialized for different digestive functions. This led to the evolution of digestive organs. Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution are roundworms. They are placed in Phylum Nematoda. Three Cell Layers in a Flatworm. A flatworm has three cell layers. Two Types of Digestive Systems in Invertebrates. On the left is an incomplete digestive system, found in a jellyfish; on the right is the complete digestive system of a roundworm. Invertebrates may have either of these two types of digestive system. 
Fluid- Filled  Body  Cavity 	  The next major animal trait to evolve was a body cavity filled with fluid. At first, this was just a partial body cavity, called a pseudocoelom. A pseudocoelom isnt completely enclosed by mesoderm. However, it still allows room for internal organs to develop. The fluid in the cavity also cushions the internal organs. The pressure of the fluid provides stiffness as well. It gives the body internal support. Modern invertebrates with a pseudocoelom include roundworms. Flatworms lack this trait. This difference explains why roundworms are round whereas flatworms are flat. Later, a true coelom evolved. This is a fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm. The coelom lies between the digestive cavity and body wall. You can see it in the invertebrate in Figure 11.9. Modern invertebrates with a coelom include mollusks (Phylum Mollusca) and annelids (Phylum Annelida). Cross Section of an invertebrate with a coelom. The coelom forms within the mesoderm. 
Segmented  Body 	  Segmentation evolved next. Segmentation is the division of the body into multiple parts, or segments. Both the earthworm (Phylum Annelida) in Figure 11.10 and ant (Phylum Arthropoda) in Figure 11.11 have segmented bodies. The earthworm has many small segments. The ant has three larger segments. Segmentation increases an animals flexibility. It allows a wider range of motion. Different segments can also be specialized for different functions. All modern annelids and arthropods are segmented. Arthropods also evolved jointed appendages. For example, they evolved jointed legs for walking and jointed feelers (antennae) for sensing. Notice the ants jointed legs and antennae in Figure 11.11 . 
Notochord 	  Some invertebrates evolved a rigid rod along the length of their body. This rod is called a notochord. You can see the notochord in the tunicates in Figure 11.12. The notochord gives the body support and shape. It also provides a place for muscles to attach. It can counterbalance the pull of the muscles when they contract. Animals with a notochord are called chordates. All of them are placed in Phylum Chordata. Some early chordates eventually evolved into vertebrates. 
Evolution of  Vertebrates 	  The earliest vertebrates evolved around 550 million years ago. It happened when some chordates evolved a backbone to replace the notochord after the embryo stage. They also evolved a cranium, or bony skull. The cranium enclosed and protected the brain. The earliest vertebrates probably looked like the hagfish in Figure 11.13. This hagfish is a simple vertebrate. It may resemble the earliest vertebrates. 
Colonizing the  Land 	  Invertebrates were the first animals to colonize the land. The move to land occurred about 450 million years ago. It required new adaptations. For example, animals needed a way to keep their body from drying out. They also needed a way to support their body on dry land without the buoyancy of water. 
Evolution of the  Exoskeleton 	  One way early land invertebrates solved these problems was with an exoskeleton. This is a non-bony skeleton that forms on the outside of the body. It supports the body and helps it retain water. As the organism grows, it sheds its old exoskeleton and grows a new one. Figure 11.14 shows the discarded exoskeleton of a dragonfly. 
Evolution of  Amphibians 	  The first vertebrates moved onto land about 365 million years ago. They were early amphibians. They were the first animals to have true lungs and limbs for life on land. However, they still had to return to the water to reproduce. Thats because their eggs lacked a waterproof covering and would dry out on land. 
Evolution of  Amniotes 	  The first vertebrates to live fully on land were amniotes. Amniotes are animals that produce eggs with waterproof membranes. The membranes let gases but not water pass through. They allow embryos to breathe without drying out. Amniotic eggs were the first eggs that could be laid on land. The earliest amniotes evolved about 350 million years ago. Amniotes would eventually evolve into modern reptiles, mammals, and birds. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The oldest animal fossils are about 630 million years old. The earliest animals were aquatic invertebrates. The first vertebrates evolved around 550 million years ago. By 500 million years ago, most modern phyla of animals had evolved. Invertebrates evolved many traits that set animals apart from other eukaryotes. They include multicellularity, tissues and higher levels of organization, body symmetry, mesoderm, digestive system, coelom, segmented body, and notochord. The earliest vertebrates evolved when some chordates evolved a backbone to replace the notochord after the embryo stage. Invertebrates colonized the land about 450 million years ago. This required new adaptations, such as an exoskeleton. Vertebrates colonized the land about 365 million years ago. They were amphibians that had to return to the water to reproduce. The first vertebrates to live fully on land were amniotes. 
Think  Critically 	  Some of the earliest animals evolved multiple, specialized cells. However, they lacked other animal traits, such as tissues. These traits evolved later. 
 	  What could this creature possibly be? Heres a hint. The picture is greatly magnified. The creature is actually only a few millimeters long. Now can you guess what it is? The organism in the microphoto is an insect commonly called a bedbug. Insects are invertebrates in Phylum Arthropoda. Insects may just be invertebrates, but they are surprisingly sophisticated animals. They have a brain, for example, and multiple sensory organs. Some insects even live in complex societies. Insects evolved relatively late in invertebrate evolution, so they are fairly complex as invertebrates go. Many other invertebrates are much simpler. The simplest invertebrates are sponges and cnidarians. Describe the structure and function of sponges. Outline cnidarian adaptations, reproduction, and ecology.

Introduction 	  What are sponges and cnidarians? You can see an example of a sponge in Figure 12.1 and a jellyfish example in Figure 12.2. Sponges are also called sea sponges. Cnidarians include jellyfish and corals. Invertebrates in these phyla have existed virtually unchanged for hundreds of millions of years. This shows that they are well adapted for their habitats. They are also very interesting animals, as you will find out when you read this lesson. 
Sponges 	  Sponges are aquatic invertebrates that make up Phylum Porifera. The word porifera means pore-bearing. As you can see from the close-up view in Figure 12.3, a sponge has a porous body with many small holes in it. There are at least 5000 living species of sponges. Almost all of them inhabit the ocean. Most live on coral reefs or the ocean floor. Adult sponges are unable to move from place to place. They have root-like projections that anchor them to surfaces. They may live in colonies of many sponges. You can visit the incredible world of sponges by watching this short video: URL . 
Specialized  Cells in  Sponges 	  Sponges have several different types of specialized cells, although they lack tissues. You can see the basic sponge body plan and specialized cells in Figure 12.4. Some of the specialized cells grow short, sharp projections called spicules. Spicules make up the sponges internal skeleton, or endoskeleton. The endoskeleton helps to support and protect the sponge. Other specialized cells are involved in feeding. Sponges are filter feeders. They filter food out of the water as it flows through them. Sponges pump water into their body through specialized pore cells called porocytes. The water flows through a large central cavity. As it flows by, specialized cells called collar cells trap and digest food particles in the water. Specialized cells called amebocytes carry nutrients from the digested food to the rest of the cells in the sponge. As water flows through the sponge, oxygen diffuses from the water to the sponges cells. The cells also expel wastes into the water. The water then flows out of the sponge through an opening called the osculum. 
How  Sponges  Reproduce 	  Sponges reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction occurs by budding. Sexual reproduction occurs by the production of eggs and sperm. Males release sperm into the water through the osculum. Sperm may enter a female sponge through a pore and fertilize her eggs. The resulting zygotes develop into larvae. Unlike sponge adults, sponge larvae can swim. They have cilia that propel them through the water. As larvae develop and grow, they become more similar to an adult sponge and lose their ability to swim. 
Sponges and  Other  Organisms 	  Many sponges live on coral reefs, like the one in Figure 12.5. Reef sponges typically have symbiotic relationships with other reef species. For example, the sponges provide shelter for algae, shrimp, and crabs. In return, they get nutrients from the metabolism of the organisms they shelter. Sponges are a source of food for many species of fish. Because sponges are anchored to a reef or rock, they cant 
Orange sponges on a coral reef 	  run away from predators. However, their sharp spicules provide some defense. They also produce toxins that may poison predators that try to eat them. 
Cnidarians 	  Cnidarians are invertebrates such as jellyfish and corals. They belong to Phylum Cnidaria. All cnidarians are aquatic. Most of them live in the ocean. Cnidarians are a little more complex than sponges. Besides specialized cells, they have tissues and radial symmetry. There are more than 10,000 cnidarian species, see Figure 12.6. 
Special  Features of  Cnidarians 	  An interesting feature of all cnidarians is one or more stingers called nematocysts. You can see a nematocyst in the sketch of a hydra in Figure 12.7. The nematocyst is long and thin and has a poison barb on the end. When not in use, it lies coiled inside a special cell. Nematocysts are used to attack prey or defend against predators. Watch this awesome animation to see a nematocyst in action: URL Another interesting feature of many cnidarians is the ability to produce light. The production of light by living things is called bioluminescence. A more familiar example of bioluminescence is the light produced by fireflies. In cnidarians, bioluminescence may be used to startle predators or to attract prey or mates.

Diversity of cnidarians:	(clockwise from top left) jellyfish, anemones, hydra and corals. 
Medusa and  Polyp 	  Cnidarians have two basic body forms, called medusa and polyp: The medusa (medusae, plural) is a bell-shaped form. It is typically able to move. The polyp is a tubular form. It is usually attached to a surface and unable to move. As you can see in Figure 12.8, both body plans have radial symmetry. Some cnidarian species alternate between medusa and polyp forms. Other species exist in just one form or the other. 
Digestive and  Nervous  Systems 	  Cnidarians have an incomplete digestive system with a single opening. The opening is surrounded by tentacles, which are covered with nematocyst cells and used to capture prey. Digestion takes place in the digestive cavity. Nutrients are absorbed and gases are exchanged through the cells lining this cavity. Fluid in the cavity supports and stiffens the cnidarian body. Cnidarians have a simple nervous system. It consists of a net of nerves that can sense touch. You can see a sketch of the nerve net in a hydra in Figure 12.9. Some cnidarians also have other sensory structures. For example, jellyfish have light-sensing structures and gravity-sensing structures. 
How  Cnidarians  Reproduce 	  Cnidarians in the polyp form usually reproduce asexually. One type of asexual reproduction in polyps leads to the formation of new medusae. Medusae usually reproduce sexually with sperm and eggs. Fertilization forms a zygote. The zygote develops into a larva, and the larva develops into a polyp. There are many variations on this general life cycle. Obviously, species that exist only as polyps or medusae have a life cycle without the other form. 
Cnidarian  Ecology 	  Cnidarians can be found in almost all ocean habitats. A few species live in fresh water. Jellyfish spend most of their lives as medusae. They live virtually everywhere in the ocean. They prey on zooplankton, other invertebrates, and the eggs and larvae of fish. Corals form large colonies in shallow tropical water. They are confined to shallow water because they have a symbiotic relationship with algae that live inside of them. The algae need sunlight for photosynthesis, so they must stay relatively close to the surface of the water to get enough light. Corals exist only as polyps. They catch plankton with their tentacles. Many corals form a hard, mineral exoskeleton. Over time, this builds up to become a coral reef. A coral reef is pictured in Figure 12.10. Coral reefs provide food and shelter to many other ocean organisms.

Lesson  Summary 	  Sponges are aquatic invertebrates in Phylum Porifera. Sponges have specialized cells and an endoskeleton, but they lack tissues and body symmetry. Many live on coral reefs and have symbiotic relationships with other reef species. Cnidarians are aquatic invertebrates in Phylum Cnidaria. They include jellyfish and corals, both of which have radial symmetry. All cnidarians have nematocysts, and many are bioluminescent. They may exist in medusa and/or polyp form. Corals build hard exoskeletons that grow to become coral reefs. 
Think  Critically 	  Cnidarians such as jellyfish have radial symmetry. Flatworms and roundworms, which you will read about next, have bilateral symmetry. Describe flatworm adaptations, reproduction, and ecology. Outline roundworm traits, and explain how roundworms reproduce and make a living. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  flatworm roundworm 
Introduction 	  Thats not a tape measure in Figure 12.11. Its a tapeworm! A tapeworm may grow to more than 20 meters in lengthall while living inside a human intestine! A tapeworm is a type of flatworm. Many flatworms are parasites, as youll learn in this lesson. 
Flatworms 	  Flatworms are invertebrates that belong to Phylum Platyhelminthes. There are more than 25,000 species in the flatworm phylum. Not all flatworms are as long as tapeworms. Some are only about a millimeter in length. 
Flatworm  Adaptations 	  Flatworms have a flat body because they lack a fluid-filled body cavity. They also have an incomplete digestive system with a single opening. However, flatworms represent several evolutionary advances in invertebrates. They have the following adaptations: Flatworms have three embryonic cell layers. They have a mesoderm layer in addition to ectoderm and endoderm layers. The mesoderm layer allows flatworms to develop muscle tissues so they can move easily over solid surfaces. Flatworms have a concentration of nerve tissue in the head end. This was a major step in the evolution of a brain. It was also needed for bilateral symmetry. Flatworms have bilateral symmetry. This gives them a better sense of direction than radial symmetry would. Watch this amazing flatworm video to learn about some of the other firsts these simple animals achieved, including being the first hunters: URL 
How  Flatworms  Reproduce 	  Flatworms reproduce sexually. In most species, the same individuals produce both eggs and sperm. After fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs pass out of the adults body and hatch into larvae. There may be several different larval stages. The final larval stage develops into the adult form. Then the life cycle repeats. 
Ecology of  Flatworms 	  Some flatworms live in water or moist soil. They eat invertebrates and decaying animals. Other flatworms, such as tapeworms, are parasites that live inside vertebrate hosts. Usually, more than one type of host is needed to complete the parasites life cycle, as shown in Figure 12.12. 
Roundworms 	  Roundworms are invertebrates in Phylum Nematoda. This is a very diverse phylum. It has more than 80,000 known species. Roundworms range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 7 meters in length. You can see an example of a roundworm in Figure 12.13. 
Roundworm  Adaptations 	  Roundworms have a round body because they have a partial fluid-filled body cavity (pseudocoelom). This is one way that roundworms differ from flatworms. Another way is their complete digestive system. It allows them to eat, digest food, and eliminate wastes all at the same time. Roundworms have a tough covering of cuticle on the surface of their body. It prevents their body from expanding. This allows the buildup of fluid pressure in their partial body cavity. The fluid pressure adds stiffness to the body. This provides a counterforce for the contraction of muscles, allowing roundworms to move easily over surfaces. 
Roundworm  Reproduction 	  Roundworms reproduce sexually. Sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female adults. Fertilization takes place inside the female organism. Females lay huge numbers of eggs, sometimes as many as 100,000 per day! The eggs hatch into larvae, which develop into adults. Then the life cycle repeats. 
How  Roundworms  Make a  Living 	  Roundworms may be free-living or parasitic organisms. Free-living worms are found mainly in freshwater habitats. Some live in moist soil. They generally feed on bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or decaying organic matter. By breaking down organic matter, they play an important role in the carbon cycle. Parasitic roundworms may have plant, invertebrate, or vertebrate hosts. Several roundworm species infect humans. Besides ascaris, they include hookworms. Hookworms are named for the hooks they use to grab onto the hosts intestines. You can see the hooks in Figure 12.14. Hookworm larvae enter the host through the skin. They migrate to the intestine, where they mature into adults. Female adults lay large quantities of eggs. Eggs pass out of the host in feces. Eggs hatch into larvae in the feces or soil. Then the cycle repeats. You can learn more about parasitic roundworms in humans by watching this short video: URL . 
Lesson  Summary 	  Flatworms are invertebrates in Phylum Platyhelminthes. Flatworm adaptations include mesoderm, muscle tissues, a head region, and bilateral symmetry. Flatworms are free-living heterotrophs or parasites. Roundworms are invertebrates in Phylum Nematoda. Roundworms have a pseudocoelom and complete digestive system. They are free-living heterotrophs or parasites. 
Think  Critically 	  In the next lesson, youll read about worms called annelids. Mollusks such as snails are also described in the next lesson. Outline the traits, reproduction, and ecology of mollusks. Describe annelid segmentation, organ systems, reproduction, and feeding strategies. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  annelid mollusk 
Introduction 	  Mollusks are invertebrates such as the common snail. Most mollusks have shells. Annelids are worms such as the familiar earthworm. They have segmented bodies. Annelids look like roundworms on the outside, but on the inside they are more like mollusks. 
Mollusks 	  Have you ever been to the ocean or eaten seafood? If you have, then youve probably encountered members of Phylum Mollusca. In addition to snails, mollusks include squids, slugs, scallops, and clams. You can see a clam in Figure 12.15. There are more than 100,000 known species of mollusks. Some mollusks are nearly microscopic. The largest mollusk, the colossal squid, may be as long as a school bus and weigh over half a ton! Watch this short video to see an amazing diversity of mollusks: URL . 
Traits of  Mollusks 	  Mollusks have a true coelom and complete digestive system. They also have circulatory and excretory systems. They have a heart that pumps blood, and organs that filter out wastes from the blood. You can see some other traits of mollusks in the garden snail in Figure 12.16. Like the snail, many other mollusks have a hard outer shell. It is secreted by special tissue called mantle on the outer surface of the body. The shell covers the top of the body and encloses the internal organs. Most mollusks have a distinct head region. The head may have tentacles for sensing the environment and grasping food. Mollusks generally have a muscular foot, which may be used for walking or other purposes. A unique feature of mollusks is the radula. This is a feeding organ with teeth made of chitin. It is located in front of the mouth in the head region. It can be used to scrape algae off rocks or drill holes in the shells of prey. You can see the radula of the sea slug in Figure 12.17. 
Mollusk  Reproduction 	  Mollusks reproduce sexually. Most species have separate male and female sexes. Fertilization may be internal or external, depending on the species. Fertilized eggs develop into larvae. There may be one or more larval stages. Each one is different from the adult stage. 
Mollusk  Ecology 	  Mollusks live in most terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats. However, the majority of species live in the ocean. They can be found in both shallow and deep water and from tropical to polar latitudes. They have a variety of ways of getting food. Some are free-living heterotrophs. Others are internal parasites. Mollusks are also eaten by many other organisms, including humans. 
Annelids 	  Annelids are segmented worms in Phylum Annelida. There are about 15,000 species of annelids. They range in length from less than a millimeter to more than 3 meters. To learn more about the amazing diversity and adaptations of annelids, watch this excellent video: URL 
Annelid  Segments 	  Annelids are divided into many repeating segments. The earthworm in Figure 12.18 is an annelid. You can clearly see its many segments. Segmentation of annelids is highly adaptive. Each segment has its own nerve and muscle tissues. This allows the animal to move very efficiently. Some segments can also be specialized to carry out particular functions. They may have special structures on them. For example, they might have tentacles for sensing or feeding, paddles for swimming, or suckers for clinging to surfaces. 
Annelid  Organ  Systems 	  Annelids have a large coelom. They also have several organ systems. These include a: circulatory system; excretory system; complete digestive system; and nervous system, with a brain and sensory organs. 
Annelid  Reproduction 	  Most annelids can reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction may occur by budding or fission. Sexual reproduction varies by species. Some species go through a larval stage before developing into adults. Other species grow to adult size without going through a larval stage. 
How  Annelids  Feed 	  Annelids live in a diversity of freshwater, salt-water, and terrestrial habitats. They vary in what they eat and how they get their food. Some annelids, such as earthworms, eat soil and extract organic material from it. Annelids called leeches are either predators or parasites. Some leeches capture and eat other invertebrates. Others feed off the blood of vertebrate hosts. Annelids called polychaete worms live on the ocean floor. They may be filter feeders, predators, or scavengers. The amazing feather duster worm in Figure 12.19 is a polychaete that has a fan-like crown of tentacles for filter feeding. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Mollusks are mainly aquatic invertebrates in Phylum Mollusca. They include snails, squids, and clams. Mollusks have a coelom and several organ systems. Most also have a shell, head, foot, and radula, which is a feeding organ. Mollusks are either free-living heterotrophs or parasites. Annelids are segmented invertebrates in Phylum Annelida. They include earthworms, polychaete worms, and leeches. Annelids have a coelom and several organ systems. Their body segments may have a variety of different structures such as tentacles or suckers. Annelids may be predators, parasites, filter feeders, or decomposers. 
Think  Critically 	  The majority of mollusks and annelids live in the water or inside hosts. Arthropods are invertebrates that include insects. The majority of arthropods live on land. Describe arthropod characteristics and life cycles. Identify special traits of insects, and explain why they have been so successful. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  arthropod cocoon incomplete metamorphosis insect metamorphosis molting pupa 
Introduction 	  The animal pictured in Figure 12.20 is an insect called a weevil. Insects belong to the phylum of invertebrates called Phylum Arthropoda. This phylum is not only the largest phylum of invertebrates. Its the largest phylum in the entire Animal Kingdom. Obviously, animals in this phylum have been very successful. What Are Arthropods? Arthropods are invertebrates in Phylum Arthropoda. There are more than a million known species of arthropods. However, scientists estimate that only about a tenth of all arthropod species have been identified. In addition to insects, arthropods include animals such as spiders, centipedes, and lobsters. You can see why arthropods were successful both in the water and on land, by watching these excellent videos: URL 
Weevil: an insect in  Phylum  Arthropoda 	  URL There are several traits shared by all arthropods. Arthropods have a complete digestive system. They also have a circulatory system and a nervous system. In addition, they have special organs for breathing and excreting wastes. Other traits of arthropods include: segmented body;  hard exoskeleton; and jointed appendages. 
Body  Segments of  Arthropods 	  Most arthropods have three body segments. The segments are the head, thorax, and abdomen. You can see the three segments in a range of arthropods in Figure 12.21. In some arthropods, the head and thorax are joined together. 
Arthropod  Exoskeleton 	  The exoskeleton (or external skeleton) of an arthropod consists of several layers of cuticle. The exoskeleton prevents water loss. It also protects and supports the body. In addition, it acts as a counterforce for the contraction of muscles. The exoskeleton doesnt grow larger as the animal grows. Eventually, it must be shed and replaced with a new one. This happens periodically throughout an arthropods life. The shedding of the exoskeleton is called molting. You can see a time-lapse video of an insect molting at this link: URL g_animated-2.gif?fastcci_from=9630 Arthropods have three body segments. 
Arthropod  Appendages 	  Because arthropod appendages are jointed, they can bend. This makes them flexible. Jointed appendages on the body are usually used as legs for walking or jumping. Jointed appendages on the head may be modified for other purposes. Head appendages often include upper and lower jaws. Jaws are used for eating and may also be used for defense. Sensory organs such as eyes and antennae are also found on the head. You can see some of these head appendages on the bee in Figure 12.22. 
Arthropod  Life  Cycles 	  Arthropods reproduce sexually. Male and female adults produce gametes. If fertilization occurs, eggs hatch into offspring. After hatching, most arthropods go through one or more larval stages before reaching adulthood. The larvae may look very different from the adults. They change into the adult form in a process called metamorphosis. During metamorphosis, the arthropod is called a pupa. It may or may not spend this stage inside a special container called a cocoon. A familiar example of arthropod metamorphosis is the transformation of a caterpillar (larva) into a butterfly (adult) (see Figure 12.23). Distinctive life stages and metamorphosis are highly adaptive. They allow functions to be divided among different life stages. Each life stage can evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without affecting the adaptations of the other stages. In some arthropods, newly hatched offspring look like small adults. These arthropods dont go through larval stages. They just grow larger until they reach adult size. This type of life cycle is called incomplete metamorphosis. You can see incomplete metamorphosis in a grasshopper in Figure 12.24. include jaws, Bee head appendages eyes, and antennae. 
Insects 	  The majority of arthropods are insects (Class Insecta). In fact, more than half of all known organisms are insects. There may be more than 10 million insect species in the world, although most of them have not yet been identified. In terms of their numbers and diversity, insects clearly are the dominant animals in the world. 
Insect  Traits 	  Like other arthropods, insects have three body segments and many jointed appendages. The abdomen contains most of the internal organs. Six legs are attached to the thorax. There are several appendages on the insects head: The head has a pair of antennae. Insects use their antennae to smell and taste chemicals. Some insects can also use their antennae to hear sounds. The head generally has several simple eyes and a pair of compound eyes. Simple eyes have a single lens, like the human eye. Compound eyes have many lenses. For feeding, the insect head contains one pair of lower jaws and two pairs of upper jaws. Insects have also evolved a wide range of specialized mouthparts for eating certain foods. You can see some examples in Figure 
Insect  Flight 	  The main reason that insects have been so successful is their ability to fly. Insects are the only invertebrates that can fly. They were also the first animals to evolve flight. The ability to fly is highly adaptive. Its a guaranteed means of escape from nonflying predators. Its also useful for finding food and mates. Insects that fly have wings, like the dragonfly in Figure 12.26. Insects generally have two pairs of wings. They are attached to the thorax. The wings form from the exoskeleton. You can learn how insects flyand how scientists study insect flightby watching this short video: URL ght-of-the-fly.html 
Insects and  People 	  Most humans interact with insects every day. Many of these interactions are harmless and often go unnoticed. However, insects can also cause humans a lot of harm. Some insects are vectors for human diseases. The mosquito in Figure 12.27 is a vector for malaria. Malaria kills millions of people each year. Many other insects feed on food crops. Growers may need to apply chemical pesticides to control them. On the other hand, without insects to pollinate them, many flowering plants, including important food crops, could not reproduce. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Arthropods are invertebrates in the Phylum Arthropoda. They include insects, spiders, centipedes, and lobsters. Traits of arthropods include three body segments, a hard exoskeleton, and jointed appendages. The arthropod life cycle may include larva and pupa stages and the process of metamorphosis. The majority of arthropods are insects. All insects have six legs and multiple head appendages and sensory organs. The main reason for the success of insects is the ability of many insects to fly. Insects both help and harm human beings. Anopheles mosquitos like this one are vectors for malaria. 
Think  Critically 	  One species in a mystery phylum is called a starfish, but its not a fish. Another species in the same phylum is called a sea cucumber, but its not a plant. Describe echinoderms, their traits, and their reproduction. Define chordates and list chordate traits. Identify invertebrate chordates and their traits. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  echinoderm lancelet tunicate 
Introduction 	  What do the sea creatures in Figure 12.28 have in common? Both of them are invertebrates known as echinoderms. Echinoderms are some of the most distinctive organisms in the Animal Kingdom: sea urchin (left) and sea cucumber (right). 
Echinoderms 	  Echinoderms are invertebrates in Phylum Echinodermata. All of them are ocean dwellers. They can be found in marine habitats from the equator to the poles. They live at all depths of water. There are about 6000 living species of echinoderms. Besides sea urchins and sea cucumbers, they include sea stars (starfish), feather stars, and sand dollars. Learn more about the amazing world of echinoderms and why they are called the ultimate animal by watching this video: URL 
Spiny  Skin and  Tube  Feet 	  The term echinoderm means spiny skin. An echinoderms spines arent actually made of skin. They are part of the animals endoskeleton and just covered with a thin layer of skin. Most adult echinoderms have radial symmetry. This is clear from the sea star pictured in Figure 12.29. However, echinoderms evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry. You can tell because echinoderm larvae have bilateral symmetry and only develop radial symmetry as adults. Adult sea starslike other adult echinodermshave spiny skin, radial symmetry, and tube feet. This photo shows the underside of a sea star. Another unique trait of echinoderms is a network of internal canals. Most of the canals have projections called tube feet. The end of each tube foot has a sucker. The suckers can stick to surfaces and help the animal crawl. The suckers can also be used to pry open the shells of prey. You can see suckers on the sea star in Figure 12.29. Although echinoderms have a well-developed coelom and complete digestive system, they lack a centralized nervous system and do not have a heart. Some echinoderms have simple eyes that can sense light. Like annelids, echinoderms can regrow a missing body part. In fact, a complete starfish can regrow from a single arm. 
How  Echinoderms  Reproduce 	  Some echinoderms can reproduce asexually by fission. However, most echinoderms reproduce sexually. They generally have separate sexes that produce sperm and eggs. Fertilization typically occurs outside the body in the water. Eggs hatch into larvae that have bilateral symmetry and can swim. The larvae undergo metamorphosis to change into the adult form. During metamorphosis, their bilateral symmetry changes to radial symmetry. What Are Chordates? Chordates are animals in Phylum Chordata. They are animals that have a notochord and certain other traits. The notochord is a rigid rod that runs down the back of the body. Phylum Chordata is a large and diverse phylum. It includes at least 60,000 species, including the human species. For a visual introduction to chordates, watch this video: URL 
General  Characteristics of  Chordates 	  Chordates have three embryonic cell layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. They also have a segmented body with a complete coelom and bilateral symmetry. In addition, chordates have a complete digestive system, central nervous system, and circulatory system. 
Defining  Phylum  Chordata 	  There are four traits that are unique to chordates and define Phylum Chordata. The four traits are a post-anal tail, dorsal hollow nerve cord, notochord, and pharyngeal slits. You can see the four traits in Figure 12.30. In some chordates, all four of these defining traits last throughout life and have important functions. For example, in some chordates, pharyngeal slits are used to filter food out of water. In many chordates, however, including humans, all four traits are present only in the embryo. After that, some of the traits disappear or develop into other structures. For example, in humans, pharyngeal slits are present in the embryo but later develop into parts of the ear. 
Invertebrate  Chordates 	  Living chordates are mainly vertebrates. In vertebrates, the notochord develops into a backbone, or vertebral column, after the embryonic stage. A small percentage of chordates are invertebrates. Their notochord never develops into a backbone. Invertebrate chordates include tunicates and lancelets. Both groups of animals are small and relatively primitive. They are probably similar to the earliest chordates that evolved more than 500 million years ago. 
Tunicates 	  Tunicates are invertebrate chordates that lose some of the four defining chordate traits by adulthood. Tunicates are also called sea squirts. There are about 3000 living species of tunicates. All are ocean dwellers and live in shallow water. You can see examples of tunicates in Figure 12.31. As larvae, tunicates can swim freely to find food. As adults, tunicates lack a post-anal tail and notochord, and they can no longer swim. Instead, they remain in one place and are filter feeders. Tunicates can reproduce both sexually and asexually. The same adults produce sperm and eggs. However, fertilization always involves gametes from different parents. Asexual reproduction is by budding. 
Lancelets 	  Lancelets are invertebrate chordates that retain all four defining chordate traits as adults. There are only about 25 species of living lancelets. Lancelets resemble tunicates in several ways. For example: lancelets live in shallow ocean water; lancelet larvae can swim to find food; and lancelet adults are filter feeders that can no longer swim. Adult lancelets spend most of their time buried in sand on the ocean floor. Lancelets reproduce sexually, with separate sexes producing sperm and eggs. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Echinoderms are ocean-dwelling invertebrates in Phylum Echinodermata. They include such animals as sea stars and sand dollars. They have a spiny endoskeleton, radial symmetry (as adults), and tube feet with suckers. They reproduce asexually or sexually. Chordates are animals in Phylum Chordata. Their defining traits are a notochord, post-anal tail, hollow dorsal nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits. Some of these traits may disappear after the embryonic stage. Chordates include all of the vertebrates, in which the notochord develops into a backbone, as well as some invertebrates. Invertebrate chordates include tunicates and lancelets. These animals are small and primitive and live in shallow ocean water. Lancelets retain all four defining chordate traits throughout life. Tunicates lose some of these traits by adulthood. Both tunicate and lancelet larvae are free swimming, whereas the adults are filter feeders that cannot swim.

Chapter  Outline 	  This odd-looking creature is a fish called a puffer fish. Like all fish, puffer fish are vertebrates. The puffer fish puffs up by rapidly filling its stretchy stomach with water. The reason? Getting bigger makes the fish seem larger to potential predators. Just to be on the safe side, the puffer fish also produces venom. In fact, its the second-mostpoisonous vertebrate in the world after the poison dart frog. In this chapter, youll learn more about vertebrates such as these. Youll find out that vertebrates are a diverse and fascinating group of animals. Describe traits of vertebrates. Identify three reproductive strategies of vertebrates.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  bone cartilage ectothermy endothermy  ovipary ovovivipary vertebra (vertebrae, plural) vivipary 
Introduction 	  Vertebrates are animals in Phylum Chordata. Modern vertebrates include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. You can see examples of all these groups of vertebrates in Figure 13.1. What Are Vertebrates? Like all chordates, vertebrates are animals with four defining traits, at least during the embryonic stage. The four traits are: a notochord; a dorsal hollow nerve cord;  a post-anal tail; and pharyngeal slits. Some invertebrates also have these traits and are classified as chordates. What traits do vertebrates have that set them apart from invertebrate chordates? 
Vertebral  Column 	  The main trait that sets vertebrates apart from invertebrate chordates is their vertebral column, or backbone. It develops from the notochord after the embryonic stage. As you can see in Figure 13.2 the vertebral column runs from head to tail along the dorsal (top) side of the body. The vertebral column is made up of repeating units of bone called vertebrae (vertebra, singular). The vertebral column helps the vertebrate body hold its shape. It also protects the spinal (nerve) cord that runs through it. This sketch of the vertebral column of a goat shows the groups of vertebrae into which the vertebral column is commonly divided. 
Vertebrate  Endoskeleton 	  The vertebral column is the core of the vertebrate endoskeleton, or internal skeleton. You can see a human skeleton as an example of the vertebrate endoskeleton in Figure 13.3. In addition to the vertebral column, the vertebrate endoskeleton includes: a cranium, or bony skull, that encloses and protects the brain; two pairs of limbs (in humans, arms and legs); limb girdles that connect the limbs to the rest of the endoskeleton (in humans, shoulders and hips). 
Bone and  Cartilage 	  The vertebrate endoskeleton is made of bone and cartilage. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that contains a protein called collagen. Bone is a hard tissue consisting of a collagen framework that is filled in with minerals such as calcium. Bone is less flexible than cartilage but stronger. A bony endoskeleton allows an animal to grow larger and heavier than a cartilage endoskeleton would. Bone also provides more protection for soft tissues and internal organs. 
Other  Traits of  Vertebrates 	  Most vertebrates share several other traits. The majority of vertebrates have: scales, feathers, fur, or hair covering their skin; muscles attached to the endoskeleton to allow movement; a circulatory system with a heart that pumps blood through a closed network of blood vessels; an excretory system that includes a pair of kidneys for filtering wastes out of the blood; a central nervous system with a brain, spinal cord, and nerve fibers throughout the body; an adaptive immune system that learns to recognize specific pathogens and launch tailor-made attacks against them; and an endocrine system with glands that secrete chemical messenger molecules called hormones. 
How  Vertebrates  Reproduce 	  Vertebrates reproduce sexually. Most have separate male and female sexes. Vertebrates have one of three reproductive strategies: ovipary, ovovivipary, or vivipary. Ovipary refers to the development of an embryo within an egg outside the mothers body. This occurs in most fish, amphibians, and reptiles. It also occurs in all birds. Ovovivipary refers to the development of an embryo inside an egg within the mothers body. The egg remains inside the mothers body until it hatches, but the mother provides no nourishment to the developing embryo inside the egg. This occurs in some species of fish and reptiles. Vivipary refers to the development and nourishment of an embryo within the mothers body but not inside an egg. Birth may be followed by a period of parental care of the offspring. This reproductive strategy occurs in almost all mammals including humans. 
Vertebrate  Diversity 	  There are about 50,000 living species of vertebrates. They are placed in nine different classes. Table 13.1 lists these vertebrate classes and some of their traits. Five of the classes are fish. The other four classes are amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

Vertebrate  Evolution 	  The earliest vertebrates were jawless fish. They evolved about 550 million years ago. They were probably similar to modern hagfish (see Table 13.1). The tree diagram in Figure 13.4 summarizes how vertebrates evolved from that time forward. Phylogenetic Tree of Vertebrate Evolution. The earliest vertebrates evolved almost 550 million years ago. Which class of vertebrates evolved last? 
How  Fish  Evolved 	  The earliest fish had an endoskeleton made of cartilage rather than bone. They also lacked a complete vertebral column. The first fish with a complete vertebral column evolved about 450 million years ago. These fish had jaws. They may have been similar to living sharks. About 400 million years ago, the first fish with a bony endoskeleton evolved. A bony skeleton could support a bigger body. Early bony fish evolved into modern ray-finned fish and lobe-finned fish. 
How  Other  Vertebrate  Classes  Evolved 	  The earliest amphibians evolved from a lobe-finned fish ancestor. This occurred about 365 million years ago. Amphibians were the first terrestrial vertebrates. They lived on land as adults, but they had to return to the water to reproduce. The earliest reptiles evolved from an amphibian ancestor. This occurred at least 300 million years ago. Reptiles were the first vertebrates that did not need water to reproduce. Thats because they laid waterproof amniotic eggs. These eggs allowed the embryo inside to breathe without drying out. Mammals and birds both evolved from reptile-like ancestors. The first mammals appeared about 200 million years ago. The earliest birds evolved about 150 million years ago. 
Ectothermy and  Endothermy 	  Early vertebrates were ectothermic. Ectothermy means controlling body temperature to just a limited extent from the outside by changing behavior. For example, an ectotherm might stay in the shade to keep cool on a hot, sunny day. On a cold day, an ectotherm might bask in the sun to warm up, like the snake in Figure 13.5. Almost all living fish, amphibians, and reptiles are ectothermic. They can raise or lower their body temperature by their behavior but not by very much. In cold weather, an ectotherm cools down. As its body temperature drops, its metabolism slows down and it becomes inactive. A water snake climbs onto a rock to bask and warm up in the sun. Both mammals and birds evolved endothermy. Endothermy means controlling body temperature within a narrow range from the inside through biochemical or physical means. For example, on a cold day, an endotherm may produce more body heat by increasing its rate of metabolism. On a hot day, it may give off more heat by increasing blood flow to the surface of the body. That way, some of the heat can radiate into the air from the bodys surface. Endothermy requires more energy (and food) than ectothermy. However, it allows the animal to stay active regardless of the temperature outside. You can learn more about how vertebrates regulate their temperature by watching this video: URL . 
Lesson  Summary 	  Vertebrates are chordates with a vertebral column and endoskeleton of cartilage and bone. Vertebrates also have several organ systems. Vertebrates reproduce sexually.	They have one of three reproductive strategies:	ovipary, ovovivipary, or vivipary. There are about 50,000 living species of vertebrates. They are placed in nine classes: five classes of fish plus amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The first vertebrates evolved about 550 million years ago. The evolution of amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds occurred over the next 400 million years. The first vertebrates were ectotherms; endothermy evolved later. Modern fish, amphibians, and reptiles are ectotherms. Modern birds and mammals are endotherms.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  fin fish gill spawning swim bladder 
Introduction 	  If the word fish makes you think of cute little goldfish in a tank, check out the anglerfish pictured in Figure 13.6. Its also called a black sea devil. Surprisingly, goldfish and angler fish arent all that different from each other as far as fish diversity goes. Both fish are placed in the same fish class. Clearly, fish are a diverse and interesting group of vertebrates. What Are Fish? Fish are aquatic vertebrates. They make up more than half of all living vertebrate species. Most fish are ectothermic. They share several adaptations that suit them for life in the water. 
Aquatic  Adaptations 	  You can see some of the aquatic adaptations of fish in Figure 13.7. For a video introduction to aquatic adaptations of fish, go to this link: URL . Fish are covered with scales. Scales are overlapping tissues, like shingles on a roof. They reduce friction with the water. They also provide a flexible covering that lets fish move their body to swim. Fish have gills. Gills are organs behind the head that absorb oxygen from water. Water enters through the mouth, passes over the gills, and then exits the body. Fish typically have a stream-lined body. This reduces water resistance. Most fish have fins. Fins function like paddles or rudders. They help fish swim and navigate in the water. Most fish have a swim bladder. This is a balloon-like organ containing gas. By inflating or deflating their swim bladder, fish can rise or sink in the water. 
Organ  Systems of  Fish 	  Fish have a circulatory system with a heart. They also have a complete digestive system. It includes several organs and other structures. Fish with jaws use their jaws and teeth to chew food before swallowing it. This allows them to eat larger prey animals. Fish have a nervous system with a brain. Fish brains are small compared with the brains of other vertebrates. However, they are large and complex compared with the brains of invertebrates. Fish also have highly developed sense organs. They include organs to see, hear, feel, smell, and taste. gill cover; Aquatic adaptations in fish: scales; fins 
How  Fish  Reproduce 	  Almost all fish have sexual reproduction, generally with separate sexes. Each fish typically produces large numbers of sperm or eggs. Fertilization takes place in the water outside the body in the majority of fish. Most fish are oviparous. The embryo develops in an egg outside the mothers body. 
Spawning and  Brooding 	  Many species of fish reproduce by spawning. Spawning occurs when many adult fish group together and release their sperm or eggs into the water at the same time. You can see fish spawning in Figure 13.8. Spawning increases the changes that fertilization will take place. It typically results in a large number of embryos forming at once. This makes it more likely that at least some of the embryos will avoid being eaten by predators. You can watch trout spawning in Yellowstone Park in this interesting video: URL Adult salmon gather near the water surface to spawn. With spawning, fish parents cant identify their own offspring. Therefore, in most species, there is no parental care of offspring. However, there are exceptions. Some species of fish carry their fertilized eggs in their mouth until they hatch. This is called mouth brooding. 
Larvae and  Metamorphosis 	  Fish eggs hatch into larvae. Each larva swims around attached to a yolk sac from the egg (see Figure 13.9). The yolk sac provides it with food. Fish larvae look different from adult fish of the same species. They must go through metamorphosis to change into the adult form. Salmon larvae, each with a yolk sac attached to it. 
Classification of  Fish 	  There are about 28,000 living species of fish. They are placed in five different classes. The classes are commonly called hagfish, lampreys, cartilaginous fish, ray-finned fish, and lobe-finned fish. Table 13.2 shows pictures of fish in each class. It also provides additional information about the classes. 
Hagfish 	  Hagfish are very primitive fish. They lack scales and fins. They even lack a backbone, but they do have a cranium. They secrete large amounts of thick, slimy mucus. This makes them slippery, so they can slip out of the jaws of predators. hagfish 
Lampreys 	  Lampreys lack scales but have fins and a partial backbone. Their mouth is surrounded by a large round sucker with teeth. They use the sucker to suck the blood of other fish. lampreys 
Cartilaginous  Fish 	  Cartilaginous fish include sharks, rays, and ratfish. Their endoskeleton is made of cartilage instead of bone. They also lack a swim bladder. However, they have a complete vertebral column and jaws. They also have a relatively big brain. shark TABLE 13.2: (continued) 
Ray- Finned  Fish 	  Ray-finned fish make up the majority of living fish species. They are a type of bony fish, with an endoskeleton made of bone instead of cartilage. Their fins consist of webs of skin over flexible bony spines, called rays. They have a swim bladder. puffer 
Lobe- Finned  Fish 	  Lobe-finned fish include only coelacanths and lungfish. They are bony fish with an endoskeleton made of bone. Their fleshy fins contain bone and muscle. Lungfish are named for a lung-like organ that they can use for breathing air. It evolved from the swim bladder. It allows them to survive for long periods of time out of water. lungfish 
Fish  Ecology 	  Fish vary in the types of places they live and what they eat. Many fish live in the salt water of the ocean. Other fish live in freshwater lakes, ponds, rivers, or streams. Most fish are predators, but they may differ in their prey and how they get it. Hagfish are deep-ocean bottom dwellers. They feed on other fish, either living or dead. They enter the body of their prey through the mouth or anus. Then they literally eat their prey from the inside out. Lampreys generally live in shallow water, either salty or fresh. They eat small invertebrates or suck the blood of larger fish. Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks, mainly live in the ocean. They prey on other fish and aquatic mammals, or else they eat plankton. Their jaws and teeth allow them to eat large prey. Bony fish, such as ray-finned or lobe-finned fish, may live in salt water or fresh water. They may eat algae, smaller fish like the butterfly fish in Figure 13.10, or dead organisms. To see how one species of predatory bony fish catches its prey, watch this amazing video: URL Butterfly fish like this one have fake eyespots. The eyespots may confuse larger predators long enough for the butterfly fish to escape. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Fish are aquatic vertebrates. They make up more than half of all vertebrate species. Most fish are ectothermic. They share several adaptations that suit them for life in the water, such as gills and fins. Almost all fish have sexual reproduction, generally with separate sexes. Most fish are oviparous. Many species reproduce by spawning. Eggs hatch to form larvae, which undergo metamorphosis to become adults. There are about 28,000 species of living fish. They are placed in five different classes: hagfish, lampreys, cartilaginous fish, ray-finned fish, and lobe-finned fish. Fish may live in salt water or fresh water. Most are predators. 
Think  Critically 	  Amphibians evolved from lobe-finned fish. Define amphibians and identify their traits. Describe how amphibians reproduce. Outline how amphibians are classified. Explain the roles of amphibians in ecosystem and why they are at risk of extinction. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  amphibian cloaca keratin tadpole 
Introduction 	  Golden toads, like the one pictured in Figure 13.11, havent been seen since 1989. Its feared that this beautiful and unusual amphibian has gone extinct. Its just one example of a much larger problem. As many as one-third of all amphibian species are presently at risk of extinction. Reasons include loss of habitat, pollution, and climate change. Amphibians are especially sensitive to such changes. In this lesson, youll learn why. Youll also learn what you can do to help save them. What Are Amphibians? Amphibians are vertebrates that live part of the time in fresh water and part of the time on land. They were the first vertebrates to evolve four legs and colonize the land. They most likely evolved from lobe-finned fish. Modern amphibians include frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians. They are ectotherms, so they have little control over their body temperature. This allows them to be active in warm weather, but they become sluggish when the temperature cools. 
Amphibian  Skin 	  Amphibians have moist skin without scales. The skin is kept moist by mucus, which is secreted by mucous glands. In some species, the mucous glands also secrete toxins that make the animal poisonous to predators. The blue poison-dart frogs in Figure 13.12 are a good example. The toxin in their mucus is used by native people in South America to poison the tips of their hunting arrows. Amphibian skin contains keratin, a protein that is also found in the outer covering of most other four-legged vertebrates. The keratin in amphibians is not too tough to allow gases and water to pass through their skin. Most amphibians breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults. However, extra oxygen is absorbed through the skin. 
Organ  Systems in  Amphibians 	  All amphibians have digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems. All three of these organ systems use a single body cavity, called the cloaca. Wastes enter the cloaca from the digestive and excretory systems. Gametes enter the cloaca from the reproductive system. A single external opening in the cloaca allows the wastes and gametes to exit the body. (Many other four legged vertebrates also have a cloaca.) Amphibians have relatively complex circulatory and nervous systems. They have sensory organs for smelling and tasting, as well as eyes and ears. Frogs also have a larynx, or voice box, that allows them to make sounds. The purpose of frog calls varies. Some calls are used to attract mates, some are used to scare off other frogs, and some are signals of distress.You can hear a collection of frog calls at this link: URL llections/frog_calls/ 
How  Amphibians  Reproduce 	  Amphibians reproduce sexually. Fertilization may take place inside or outside the body. Amphibians are oviparous. Embryos develop in eggs outside the mothers body. 
Laying  Eggs 	  Amphibians do not produce amniotic eggs with waterproof membranes. Therefore, they must lay their eggs in water. The eggs are usually covered with a jelly-like substance that helps keep them moist and offers some projection from predators. You can see a mass of frog eggs in jelly in Figure 13.13. Amphibians generally lay large numbers of eggs. Often, many adults lay eggs in the same place at the same time. This helps ensure that the eggs will be fertilized. Once eggs are laid, amphibian parents typically provide no parental care. 
Larvae and  Metamorphosis 	  Most amphibians go through a larval stage that is different from the adult form. In frogs, for example, the early larval stage resembles a fish, as you can see in Figure 13.14. Frogs at this stage of development are called tadpoles. Tadpoles live in the water. They lack legs and have a long tail that helps them swim. They also have gills, which absorb oxygen from the water. During metamorphosis, the tadpole changes to the form of an adult frog. It grows legs, loses its tail, and develops lungs. All of these changes prepare it to live on the land. In Figure 13.15, you can see how a frog larva looks as it changes to the adult form. 
How  Amphibians are  Classified 	  There are only about 6200 known species of amphibians. They are placed in three orders: frogs, salamanders, and caecilians. Table 13.4 shows a picture of an amphibian in each order. It also provides additional information about the orders. 
Frogs 	  The frog order also includes toads. Unlike other amphibians, frogs and toads lack a tail by adulthood. Their back legs are also longer because they are specialized for jumping. Frogs can jump as far as 20 times their body length. Thats like you jumping more than the length of a basketball court! red-eyed tree frog TABLE 13.3: (continued) 
Salamanders 	  The salamander order also includes newts. Salamanders and newts keep their tails as adults. They have a long body with short legs. They are adapted for walking and swimming rather than jumping. Unlike other vertebrates, salamanders can regrow legs or other body parts if they are bitten off by a predator. smooth newt 
Caecilians 	  The caecilian order is the amphibian order with the fewest species. Caecilians are closely related to salamanders. They have a long, worm-like body. They are the only amphibians without legs. Caecilians evolved from a four-legged ancestor but lost their legs later in their evolution. As adults, they often burrow into the soil. Thats one reason why Caecilians tend to be less well known than other amphibians. microcaecilia 
Ecology of  Amphibians 	  Amphibians live in freshwater and moist-soil habitats throughout the world. The only continent that lacks amphibians is Antarctica. Amphibians are especially common in temperate lakes and ponds and in tropical rainforests. 
Predator and  Prey 	  Amphibians are the prey of many other vertebrates, including birds, snakes, raccoons, and fish. Amphibians are also important predators. As larvae, they may eat water insects and algae. As adults, they typically eat invertebrates, including worms, snails, and insects. You can watch a frog catching an invertebrate in the slow-motion video at the following link. At its real speed, you would barely see it because it happens so quickly. URL 
The  Threat of  Extinction 	  Why are so many amphibian species threatened by extinction, and why should you care? The second question is easy. Amphibians control pests, may be a source of new medicines, and help feed many other animals. The nature of amphibian skin may help explain why so many amphibian species are at risk. Their skin easily absorbs substances from the environment, such as pollutants in water or air. Therefore, they may suffer from poor environmental quality before other animals do. As such, they may provide an early-warning system of environmental damage. What can you do to help save amphibians? Protect the natural environment. For example, reduce your use of energy to curb greenhouse gases and global warming. Avoid the use of garden pesticides. Poisoned insects may be eaten by amphibians that are also harmed by the poison. Make a backyard habitat. A small pond surrounded by native vegetation provides a place for amphibians to live. Help raise awareness. Start a letter-writing campaign to politicians, asking them to support conservation activities for amphibians.

Lesson  Summary 	  Amphibians are vertebrates that live part of the time in fresh water and part of the time on land. They were the first vertebrates to evolve four legs and colonize the land. They are ectothermic. They have permeable skin and several organ systems. Amphibians reproduce sexually. Fertilization may take place inside or outside the body. Eggs are laid in water. They hatch into larvae that live in the water until they undergo metamorphosis to the adult form. There are only about 6200 known species of amphibians. They are placed in three orders: frogs, salamanders, and caecilians. Frogs include toads and have the most species. Caecilians have the fewest species. Amphibians are the prey of many other vertebrates. They are also important predators. Many amphibian species are threatened by extinction. There are many steps individuals can take to help protect amphibians. 
Think  Critically 	  Amphibians were the dominant land vertebrates until they gave rise to reptiles. List terrestrial adaptations of reptiles. Describe how reptiles reproduce. Explain how reptiles are classified. Identify where reptiles live and what they eat. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  carnivore crocodilian diaphragm herbivore omnivore reptile 
Introduction 	  Loggerhead turtles spend most of their life in the ocean. Adult female loggerheads go ashore briefly to lay their eggs in the sand. Then they return to the water and leave the eggs to hatch on their own. Figure 13.16 shows baby loggerheads on a beach shortly after hatching. The baby turtles must make their way back to the water, hopefully without being snatched up by a predator. Loggerhead turtles are reptiles. Unlike amphibians, turtles and other reptiles can lay their eggs on dry land. Thats because they produce amniotic eggs. Amniotic eggs have waterproof membranes to prevent them from drying out. What Are Reptiles? Reptiles are ectothermic, four-legged vertebrates that produce amniotic eggs. The reptile class is one of the largest classes of vertebrates. Besides turtles, it includes crocodiles, alligators, lizards, and snakes. Although some turtles and other reptiles now live mainly in the water, reptiles evolved many adaptations for life on land. For an amusing overview of reptiles, watch this Bill Nye the Science Guy reptile video: URL k3zhh8 . Newly hatched loggerhead turtles start crossing the sand to the ocean. 
Adaptations for  Life on  Land 	  Reptiles were the first vertebrates to lay amniotic eggs. This freed them from returning to the water to reproduce. In addition to amniotic eggs, reptiles have several other adaptations for living on land. For example, reptile skin is covered with scales. You can see how the scales overlap and cover the snake in Figure 13.17. Reptile scales are made of very tough keratin. They help protect reptiles from injury as well as loss of water. Because of their tough scales, reptiles cant absorb oxygen through their skin as amphibians can. However, reptiles have more efficient lungs for breathing air. They also have various ways of moving air into and out of their lungs. For example, their chest muscles contract to push air out of the lungs. The muscles relax to allow air to rush into the lungs. Another muscle, called the diaphragm, which lies below the lungs, also helps move air into and out of the lungs. (Mammals also have a diaphragm for breathing air.) 
Reptile  Organ  Systems 	  Reptiles have a circulatory system with a heart that pumps blood. Reptiles also have a centralized nervous system with a brain. Their brain is relatively small, but the parts of the brain that control the senses and learning are larger than in amphibians. Reptiles have good senses of sight and smell. They use their tongue to smell scents. Thats what the blue-tongued lizard in Figure 13.18 is doing. Some reptiles also have a heat-sensing organ that helps them locate the warm bodies of prey animals such as birds and small mammals. Like other reptiles, this tree viper snake is covered with overlapping, waterproof scales. This lizard, called a skink, is flicking out its blue tongue to sniff the air. 
How  Reptiles  Reproduce 	  Most reptiles have sexual reproduction with internal fertilization. Reptiles have a body cavity called a cloaca that is involved in reproduction. Sperm or eggs are released into an adult reptiles cloaca. Males have one or two penises that pass sperm from their cloaca to the eggs in the cloaca of a female, where fertilization takes place. In most reptile species, once fertilized the eggs leave the body through an opening in the cloaca. These reptiles are oviparous. Eggs develop and hatch outside the mothers body. Young reptiles, like the baby alligator in Figure 13.19, look like smaller versions of the adults. They dont have a larval stage as most amphibians do. Baby reptiles are able to move and search for food but are at high risk of predation. Adult reptiles rarely provide any care for their offspring once the eggs are laid. The only exceptions are female alligators and crocodiles. They defend their eggs and hatchlings from predators and help them reach the water. This baby alligator, being held gently by a game warden, looks just like an adult alligator but on a much smaller scale. 
How  Reptiles are  Classified 	  There are over 8200 living species of reptiles. They are classified in four orders, called Crocodilia, Sphenodontia, Squamata, and Testudines. Table 13.4 shows a picture of a reptile in each order. It also provides additional information about the orders. For an online gallery of amazing photos of reptiles, go to this link: URL .nationalgeographic.com/video/magazine/my-shot-minute/ngm-reptiles-msm 
Crocodilia 	  Reptiles in the Crocodilia Order are called crocodilians. They include crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and gharils. They have four sprawling legs that allow them to run surprisingly fast. They have strong jaws and replace their teeth throughout life. Crocodilians have relatively complex brains and greater intelligence than other reptiles. crocodile TABLE 13.4: (continued) 
Sphenodontia 	  The Sphenodontia Order includes only tuataras like the one in this photo. They resemble lizards but are the least specialized of all living reptiles. Their brain is similar to the amphibian brain. tuatara 
Squamata 	  The Squamata order includes lizards and snakes. Lizards have four legs for running or climbing, and they can also swim. Many change their color when threatened. Snakes do not have legs, although they evolved from a four-legged ancestor. They have a very flexible jaw for swallowing large prey whole. Some inject poison into their prey through fangs. lizard 
Testudines 	  The Testudines Order includes turtles, tortoises, and terrapins. They have four legs for walking. They have a hard shell covering most of their body. terrapin 
Reptile  Ecology 	  Modern reptiles live in many different habitats. They can be found on every continent except Antarctica. 
Reptile  Habitats 	  Many turtles are aquatic. They may live in the ocean or in fresh water. Other turtles are terrestrial and live on land. All lizards are terrestrial. Their habitats may range from deserts to rainforests. They may live in a range of places, from underground burrows to the tops of trees. Most snakes are terrestrial, but some are aquatic. Crocodilians live in and around swamps or bodies of water. The water may be fresh or salty, depending on the species of crocodilian. 
What  Reptiles  Eat 	  All reptiles are heterotrophs, and the majority eats other animals. Heterotrophs that eat only or mainly animals are called carnivores. Large carnivorous reptiles such as crocodilians are the top predators in their ecosystems. They prey on large birds, fish, deer, turtles, and sometimes farm livestock. Their powerful jaws are strong enough to crush bones and turtle shells. Smaller carnivorous reptilesincluding tuataras, snakes, and many lizardsare lower-level predators. They prey on small animals such as insects, frogs, birds, and mice. Most terrestrial turtles eat plants. Heterotrophs that eat only or mainly plants are called herbivores. Herbivorous turtles graze on grasses, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Marine turtles and some lizards feed on both plants and animals. Heterotrophs that eat a variety of foods including both plants and animals are called omnivores. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Reptiles are a class of ectothermic, four-legged vertebrates that produce amniotic eggs. They include turtles, crocodiles, lizards, and snakes. Reptiles were the first vertebrates to live full time on land, and they evolved many terrestrial adaptations. Most reptiles reproduce sexually and have internal fertilization. They lay eggs on land and generally do not provide parental care. Reptile hatchlings look like miniature adults. They lack a larval stage and do not go through metamorphosis. There are over 8200 living species of reptiles. They are classified in four orders: Crocodilia, Sphenodontia, Squamata, and Testudines. Reptiles live in a wide range of habitats. Some are aquatic, but most are terrestrial. Most reptiles are carnivores, but some are herbivores or omnivores. 
Think  Critically 	  Birds evolved from a reptile ancestor, but modern birds and reptiles are very different. Birds are now the most numerous four-limbed reptiles on Earth. Dendroaspis_angusticeps.jpg?fastcci_from=437112 URL URL . public domain/CC BY 2.0/3.0 . CC CY 2.0 public domain 
S  Birds and  Mammals 	  What is this flying animal? Is it a bird? Look closely and youll see that its actually a bat, the only type of mammal that evolved true flight. Other than its ability to fly, a bat isnt much more birdlike than you are. For example, like you and other mammals, a bat has jaws with teeth rather than a beak. Its body is also covered with fur rather than feathers. Bats are adapted for flight. But the vertebrate masters of flight are the birds. Define the bird class. Identify adaptations of birds for flight. Describe how birds reproduce and care for their young. Compare and contrast birds that are specialists and birds that are generalists.

Introduction 	  Birds are some of the most colorful and diverse animals on Earth. Look at the birds in Figure 14.1. The colors of the macaw and lorikeet are as different as they are beautiful. The range in size of birds is also impressive. The tiny hummingbird is just a few centimeters (couple of inches) long. The big ostrich stands almost 3 meters (about 9 feet) tall. What Are Birds? Birds are four-limbed, endothermic vertebrates. The upper pair of limbs are wings that most birds use for flying. The lower pair of limbs are legs with feet that birds use for walking. Because birds walk on two legs, they are called bipedal. (Humans are bipedal too.) Birds also have feathers and beaks, and they produce amniotic eggs. Of all vertebrate classes, birds are the most numerous, even though they evolved most recently. Why have birds been so successful? The answer is flight. Being able to fly opened up a whole new world to birds: the world of the air above the land and water. Other than insects, virtually no other animals can inhabit the airy world. Flying is a sure-fire way to escape from all but the quickest nonflying predators. Flying also gives birds a good view for finding food and mates. Diversity of birds: (from left to right) Macaw, Lorikeet, Hummingbird, and Ostrich. 
Adaptations for  Flight 	  Wings and feathers are two adaptations for flight that evolved in birds. Both are clearly displayed in the flying gull in Figure 14.2. Wings evolved from the front limbs of a four-legged ancestor. The wings are controlled by large flight muscles in the chest. Feathers also help birds fly. They provide air resistance and lift. In addition, they provide insulation and serve other roles. 
Organ  Systems 	  To keep their flight muscles well supplied with oxygen, birds evolved specialized respiratory and circulatory systems. Birds have special air sacs for storing extra air and pumping it into the lungs. They also have a relatively large heart and a rapid heart rate. These adaptations keep plenty of oxygenated blood circulating to the flight muscles. 
Bird  Brains 	  Birds have relatively big brains for their body size. This is reflected in their high level of intelligence and complex behavior. Some birds, including crows, are more intelligent than many mammals. They are smart enough to use tools to solve problems. You can see this in the video below. However, the part of the brain that is most developed in birds is the part that controls flying. This is another adaptation for flight. URL This gull depends on its feathered wings and large flight muscles to fly 
How  Birds  Reproduce 	  Birds reproduce sexually and have separates sexes. Fertilization occurs internally, so males and females must mate. Many bird species have special behaviors, such as unique songs or visual displays, for attracting mates. These special behaviors are called courtship. The white peacock in Figure 14.3 is putting on a stunning display of his amazing tail feathers to court a mate. 
Nest  Building 	  After mating and fertilization occur, eggs are laid, usually in a nest. Most birds build nests for their eggs and hatchlings, and each species has a certain way of doing it. You can see examples of different types of bird nests in Figure 14.4. Nests range from little more than a depression in the ground (killdeer) to elaborately built structures (weaver bird). You can see how skillful a weaver bird is at weaving its nest by watching this video: URL outube.com/watch?v=6svAIgEnFvw . A white peacock spreads out his tail feathers to attract a mate. Variation in bird nests: Killdeer with eggs in nest on ground (left) and Weaver bird weaving elaborate nest in tree (right). 
Parental  Care 	  In most species, one or both parents take care of the eggs. They sit on the eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. This is called incubation. After the eggs hatch, the parents generally continue their care. They feed the hatchlings until they are big enough to feed on their own. This is usually at a younger age in ground-nesting birds such as ducks than in tree-nesting birds such as robins. 
Classification of  Birds 	  There are about 10,000 living species of birds. Almost all of them can fly. Very few birds are flightless. 
Flying  Birds 	  Birds that can fly are classified in 29 orders. Birds in the different orders vary in their physical traits and how they behave. You can see seven of the most common orders of flying birds in Table 14.1. The majority of flying birds are perching birds, described in the last row of the table. There are more species in this order than in all other bird orders combined. Many perching birds are familiar songbirds such as the mockingbird. You can hear a mockingbirds amazing and complex song in this video: URL

Nocturnal  Raptors: burrowing owls, barn owls, horned owls 	  They range from small to large; they are active during the night and sleep during the day; they have a sharp, hooked beak and strong legs with clawed feet; they have large, forward-facing eyes; they have excellent hearing and can hunt with their sense of hearing alone. burrowing owl TABLE 14.1: (continued) 
Parrots:	cockatoos, parrots, parakeets 	  They range from small to large; they are found in tropical regions; they have a strong, curved bill; they stand upright on strong legs with clawed feet; many are brightly colored; they are very intelligent. cockatoo 
Perching  Birds: honeyeaters, sparrows, crows 	  They are small in size; they perch above the ground in trees and on buildings and wires; they have four toes for grasping a perch; many are songbirds. honeyeater 
Flightless  Birds 	  Some birds lost the ability to fly during their evolution. They include the ostrich, pictured above in Figure 14.1, as well as the kiwi, rhea, cassowary, and moa. All of these birds have long legs that are adapted for running. Penguins, like the one pictured in Figure 14.5, are also flightless, but they have a very different body shape. They are adapted for swimming instead of running. Penguins are flightless birds that are strong swimmers and spend much of their time in the water. 
Bird  Ecology 	  Birds are endothermic. They can maintain a warm body temperature even in a cold climate. Therefore, they can live in a wider range of habitats than ectothermic vertebrates such as amphibians and reptiles. 
Where  Birds  Live 	  Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats on Earth. They can be found on all seven continents, from the Arctic to Antarctica. However, the majority of bird species are native to tropical areas of the planet. 
What  Birds  Eat 	  Birds may be specialists or generalists in terms of what they eat. Generalists are organisms that eat many different types of food. Birds that are generalists include the red-winged blackbird in Figure 14.6. It has a basic beak that can eat many different foods. Red-winged blackbirds are omnivores. They may eat a wide variety of seeds as well as insects and other small animals such as snails and frogs. A red-winged blackbird is a generalist that eats a variety of plant and animal foods. Specialists are organisms that eat just one type of food. Birds that are specialists include ospreys, which eat only live fish. You can see an osprey in Figure 14.7. The ospreys feet are very well-adapted for catching fish. Its eyes are also well-adapted for seeing fish under the water. Its beak is well suited for gripping and ripping into fish flesh. Ospreys are so well-adapted to catching fish that they cant catch anything else! 
Lesson  Summary 	  Birds are four-limbed, endothermic vertebrates with wings and feathers. They produce amniotic eggs and are the most numerous class of vertebrates. Birds have several adaptations for flight. These include wings, feathers, and large flight muscles. Birds also have specialized respiratory and circulatory systems to keep their flight muscles well supplied with oxygen. This osprey is specialized for catching and eating live fish. Birds reproduce sexually and have separate sexes. Many birds have courtship behaviors to attract mates. Most birds build nests for their eggs and feed their hatchlings. There are about 10,000 living species of birds. Almost all of them can fly. Flying birds are classified in 29 orders. Most species belong to the order of perching birds. A few birds are flightless, such as the ostrich and penguin, but they evolved from a flying ancestor. Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats on Earth. Some birds are generalists. They eat a variety of foods and do not have specialized beaks. Other birds are specialists. They eat a single type of food and have specialized beaks and other special adaptations for the food source on which they depend. 
Think  Critically 	  Birds arent the only endothermic vertebrates. Mammals are also endotherms. Identify traits of mammals. Explain how mammals keep their body temperature stable. Describe variation in mammalian diets. Compare and contrast monotreme, marsupial, and placental mammals. Outline the classification of mammals.

Introduction 	  The dogs in Figure 14.8 are playing. Most mammals engage in play, especially when theyre young. Play is just one of many complex behaviors displayed by mammals. Mammals are amazing vertebrates, and they include you! What Are Mammals? Mammals are endothermic vertebrates with four limbs. Examples of mammals include bats, whales, mice, and humans. Clearly, mammals are a very diverse group. Nonetheless, they share several traits that set them apart from other vertebrates. 
Defining  Mammals 	  Two traits are used to define the mammal class. They are fur or hair and mammary glands in females. Like all young mammals, these young dogs like to play. All mammals have fur or hair on their skin. It provides insulation and helps keep the body warm. It also can be used for sensing. For example, cats can feel with their whiskers. All female mammals have mammary glands. Mammary glands are glands that produce milk after the birth of offspring. Producing milk for offspring is called lactation. The colt in Figure 14.9 is getting milk from its mother. 
Other  Mammal  Traits 	  Most mammals share several other traits. These include: a large, complex brain and relatively great intelligence; ears with specialized structures that make them extremely good at hearing; four different types of teeth (reptiles have just one type), allowing them to eat a wide range of foods; tiny air sacs called alveoli (alveolus, singular) in the lungs for enhanced gas exchange; and glands in the skin that produce sweat, a salty fluid that helps cool down the body. 
How  Mammals  Move 	  Mammals are noted for the many ways they can move. Some mammals are well known for their speed. The fastest land animal is a mammal, the cheetah. It can race at speeds of up to 112 kilometers (70 miles) per hour. The limbs of most mammals are specialized for a particular way of moving. They may be specialized for running, jumping, climbing, flying, gliding, or swimming. The limbs of some mammals are even specialized for swinging through tree tops. You can see mammals with some of these specializations in Figure 14.10. Some ways that mammals move: (left) the flying squirrel has webbed skin between its legs that allows it to glide from trees to the ground; (middle) the kangaroo rat has large lower limbs for jumping and can jump farther than any other mammal for its size; (right) the dolphin is well adapted for moving in the water it has a streamlined body to reduce water resistance and fins to help it swim. 
How  Mammals  Control  Their  Temperature 	  Mammals have a variety of ways to keep their body temperature stable. 
Staying  Warm 	  Mammals stay warm in cool weather in two general ways. One way is by generating more heat. The other way is by conserving the heat that is generated. Mammals generate heat mainly by maintaining a high rate of metabolism. Compared with the cells of other animals, the cells of mammals have more mitochondria. Mitochondria are the cell organelles that generate energy. Mammals may also produce little bursts of heat by shivering. Shivering occurs when many muscles all contract slightly at the same time. The muscle contractions generate a small amount of heat. Mammals conserve heat with their hair or fur. It works like the layer of insulation in the walls of a house. It traps warm air next to the skin so it cant escape into the environment. Like the squirrel in Figure 14.11, most mammals can make their hair or fur stand up from the skin. This makes it a better insulator. Mammals also have a layer of insulating fat beneath their skin. Other vertebrates lack this layer of fat. 
Losing  Heat 	  In hot weather, mammals may need to lose excess body heat. One way they do this is by increasing blood flow to the body surface. The increased blood flow warms the skin, which gives off heat to the environment. Most mammals also sweat to lose excess heat. Sweating wets the skin. Evaporation of the sweat requires heat. The heat comes from the body and cools it down. Animals with fur, like the dogs in Figure 14.12, may pant instead of sweat to lose body heat. Water evaporates from the tongue and other moist surfaces of the mouth, using heat from the body. Watch this video to learn about some unique ways that elephants lose excess heat: URL l_LKno . What Do Mammals Eat? Generating body heat to stay warm takes a lot of energy. Mammals are heterotrophs that get their energy by eating other organisms. Mammals eat a wide range of different foods. Except for leaf litter and wood, almost any kind of organic matter is consumed by some type of mammal. The organic matter typically comes from plants, other animals, or some mix of these sources. 
Mammals that  Eat  Plants 	  Many mammals are herbivores. Herbivores are heterotrophs that eat only or mainly plant foods (or algae). Depending on the species of mammals, they may eat leaves, shoots, stems, roots, seeds, nuts, fruits, flowers, and/or grasses. Some mammals even eat conifer needles or tree bark. Mammals that are herbivores include rabbits, mice, sheep, zebras, deer, kangaroos, and monkeys. The manatee in Figure 14.13 is also a herbivorous mammal. It eats mainly kelp (seaweed). Dogs pant to lose excess body heat. 
Mammals that  Eat  Other  Animals 	  Some mammals are carnivores. Carnivores are heterotrophs that eat only or mainly animal foods. Depending on their species, carnivorous mammals may eat other mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, mollusks, worms, and/or insects. Mammals that are carnivores include anteaters, whales, hyenas, wolves, and seals. The bat in Figure 
Mammals that  Eat  Both  Plants and  Animals 	  Some mammals are omnivores. Omnivores are heterotrophs that eat a mix of plant and animal foods. Mammals that are omnivores include bears, foxes, rats, pigs, and human beings. The chimpanzees in Figure 14.15 are also omnivorous mammals. In the wild, they eat mainly plant foods, but they supplement plants with birds, bird eggs, insects, small monkeys, and other small mammals. Their favorite and most common food, however, is fruit. Animals that eat mainly fruit are called frugivores. These chimpanzees are omnivores that eat mainly fruit. 
How  Mammals  Reproduce 	  Mammals have separate sexes and reproduce sexually. They produce eggs or sperm and must mate in order for fertilization to occur. A few mammals are oviparous. They lay eggs, which later hatch. These mammals are called monotremes. Most mammals are viviparous and give birth to live young. These mammals are either placental mammals or marsupials. Placental mammals give birth to relatively large and well-developed fetuses. Marsupials give birth to smaller, less-developed embryos. In both placental and marsupial mammals, the young grow and develop inside the mothers body in an organ called the uterus. At birth, they pass through a tube-like organ called the birth canal, or vagina. 
Placental  Mammals 	  Placental mammals get their name from the placenta. This is a spongy structure that develops during pregnancy only in placental mammals. You can see where a human placenta forms in Figure 14.16. The placenta sustains the fetus while it grows inside the mothers uterus. It consists of membranes and blood vessels from both mother and fetus. It allows substances to pass between the mothers blood and that of the fetus. The fetus gets oxygen and nutrients from the mother. It passes carbon dioxide and other wastes to the mother. The placenta permits a long period of fetal growth. As a result, the fetus can become relatively large and mature before birth. This increases its chances of survival. On the other hand, supporting a growing fetus may be difficult for the mother. She has to eat more while pregnant and may become less mobile as the fetus grows larger. Giving birth to a large infant is also risky. 
Marsupial  Mammals 	  By giving birth to tiny embryos, marsupial mothers are at less risk. However, the tiny newborn marsupial may be less likely to survive than a newborn placental mammal. The marsupial embryo completes its growth and development outside the mothers body in a pouch. It gets milk by sucking on a nipple in the pouch. There are very few living species of marsupials. They include kangaroos, koalas, and opossums. You can see a baby koala peeking out of its mothers pouch in Figure 14.17. 
Monotreme  Mammals 	  There are very few living species of monotremes, or egg-laying mammals. They include the echidna and platypus, both pictured in Figure 14.18. Monotremes are found only in Australia and the nearby island of New Guinea. Female monotremes lack a uterus and vagina. Instead, they have a cloaca with one external opening, like the cloaca of reptiles and birds. The opening is used to excrete wastes as well as lay eggs. The eggs of monotremes have a leathery shell, like the eggs of reptiles. Female monotremes have mammary glands but not nipples. They secrete milk to feed their young from a patch on their belly. This form of reproduction is least risky for the mother but most risky for the offspring. Monotremes: echidnas (left) and a platypus (right) 
Classification of  Mammals 	  Mammals are a class in Phylum Chordata. Monotremes, marsupials, and placental mammals are subclasses of mammals. Almost all living mammals are placental mammals. Placental mammals, in turn, are divided into many orders. Some of the larger orders are described in Table 14.2. TABLE 14.2: Orders of Placental Mammals (Traditional Classification) 
Insectivora 	  mole small sharp teeth 
Chiroptera 	  bat digits support membranous wings TABLE 14.2: (continued)

Lagomorpha 	  rabbit chisel-like incisor teeth 
Artiodactyla 	  deer even-toed hooves 
Cetacea 	  whale paddle-like forelimbs 
Primates 	  monkey five digits on hands and feet The orders in Table 14.2 are still widely used, but ideas about mammal classification are constantly changing. Traditional classifications are based on similarities and differences in physical traits. More recent classifications are based on similarities and differences in DNA. The latter are more useful for determining how mammals evolved. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Mammals are endothermic vertebrates that have four limbs and produce amniotic eggs. Defining traits of mammals are fur or hair and mammary glands. Mammals are noted for the many different ways they can move and their specialized limbs. Mammals have a variety of ways to keep their body temperature stable. They generate heat with a high rate of metabolism and shivering, and they conserve heat with insulating hair or fur and a layer of fat under the skin. They lose excess heat by increasing blood flow to the skin and by sweating or panting. Mammals may be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. Some carnivore mammals eat mainly insects and are called insectivores. Some omnivore mammals eat mainly fruits and are called frugivores. Mammals have separate sexes and reproduce sexually. Monotreme mammals lay eggs, but most mammals give birth to live young. Placental mammals give birth to relatively large, well-developed fetuses. Marsupials give birth to smaller, less-developed embryos. Monotremes, marsupials, and placental mammals are subclasses of mammals. Almost all living mammals are placental mammals, which are divided into many orders. 
Think  Critically 	  Human beings are mammals. Like other mammals, we have hair and mammary glands. The subclass in which the human species is classified is the placental mammals. Define primates, and identify primate traits. Describe primate habitats and diets. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  brachiation opposable thumb primate prosimian 
Introduction 	  In many ways, humans are unique among mammals. For example, we have bigger brains and a greater ability to learn than any other species in the mammalian class. In many ways, however, we are typical of the mammalian order to which we belong. That order is the Primate Order. To fully understand what it means to be human, you need to know more about this fascinating order of mammals. What Is a Primate? A primate is a mammal in the Primate Order of placental mammals. In addition to human beings, this order consists of lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, and apes. It includes mammals that range in size from the tiny mouse lemur, which weighs only 30 g (about an ounce), to the majestic gorilla, an ape that may weigh as much as 200 kg (440 lb). Both a mouse lemur and gorilla are pictured in Figure 14.19. 
Primate  Groups 	  Primates are generally divided into prosimian and non-prosimian primates. Primates called prosimians are generally smaller. There are also far fewer of them. Prosimians include lemurs, such as the mouse lemur in Figure 14.19, and lorises. Prosimians are thought to be more similar to the earliest primates. All other primates are non-prosimian primates. They are placed in groups that include tarsiers, New World (Central and South America) monkeys, Old World (Africa and Asia) monkeys, apes, and humans. You can see examples of non-prosimian primates in Figure 14.20. Non-prosimian primates: (from left to right) Tarsier, Squirrel monkey (New World monkey), Vervet (Old World monkey), Orangutan (ape). 
Primate  Traits 	  A number of traits set primates apart from other orders of placental mammals. Primates evolved from tree-living, or arboreal, ancestors. As a result, many primate traits are adaptations for life in the trees. Living in trees requires good grasping ability. Being able to judge distances is also important. Primates have five digits (fingers or toes) on each extremity. Unlike the hooves of horses or the paddles of whales, the digits of primates are relatively unspecialized. Therefore, they can be used to do a variety of tasks, including grasping branches and holding tools. Most primates have opposable thumbs. An opposable thumb can be brought into opposition with the other fingers of the same hand. This allows the hand to grasp and hold things. Primates usually rely more on the sense of vision rather than the sense of smell, which is the dominant sense in many other mammals. The importance of vision in primates is reflected by the bony socket that surrounds and protects the primate eye. Primates have widely spaced eyes in the same plane that give them stereoscopic (3-D) vision, needed for judging distances. Some primates, including humans, have also evolved color vision. Primates tend to have bigger brains for their body size than other mammals. This is reflected in their relatively high level of intelligence and their ability to learn new behaviors. Primates have slower rates of development than other mammals their size. They reach maturity later and have longer lifespans. Being dependent on adults for a long maturation period gives young primates plenty of time to learn from their elders. 
Primate  Habitats and  Diets 	  Except for humans and a few other species, most modern primates still live in trees at least some of the time. They live primarily in tropical rain forests of Central and South America, Africa, and South Asia. Some primates, such as the gibbon in Figure 14.21, have long arms and curving fingers that allow them to swing from branch to branch high up in trees. This way of traveling is called brachiation. You can watch a gibbon brachiating in this amazing video: URL Fruit is the preferred food for almost all primates except humans. However, most primate species are omnivorous and consume a variety of plant and animal foods. For example, they may eat leaves, seeds, bird eggs, insects, and other small animals. Chimpanzees may band together and hunt for animals to kill and eat. They may even sharpen sticks and use them as spears when they hunt. Watch this video to see the incredible teamwork of a group of chimpanzees hunting a monkey: URL . This gibbon is specialized for swinging through trees from branch to branch. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A primate is a mammal in the Primate Order of placental mammals. Primates include lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, New and Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Primate traits, such as five digits on each extremity and stereoscopic vision, may reflect their arboreal origins. Most modern primates, except for humans, live in tropical rainforests. Most also subsist on an omnivorous diet. They may prefer fruit but also consume a variety of other plant and animal foods.

Chapter  Outline 	  The ants in this picture are known as leafcutter ants. They cut leaves and carry them back to their nest. In the nest, ants will chew the leaves and then use them as a garden for growing fungi. The fungi will provide food for ant larvae in the nest. Are young leafcutter ants taught how to cut and carry leaves by older ants? Or do they just know how to do it when they hatch? Animals have different behaviors for different reasons. Some of the behaviors are learned. Some of the behaviors animals know how to do without any teaching or training. In the case of leafcutter ants, the ants know from the time they hatch how to cut and carry leaves. No one needs to teach them how to do it. Is this different from human behaviors? Are there certain behaviors you know how to do from birth? Or do you have to learn every new behavior? Youll find answers to questions such as these when you read this chapter. Describe how animal behaviors can increase fitness and evolve through natural selection. Define innate behavior, and give examples of innate behaviors in humans and other animals. Define learned behavior, and explain different ways that animals can learn new behaviors. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  animal behavior conditioning habituation innate behavior insight learning instinct learned behavior observational learning reflex behavior 
Introduction 	  Animal behavior is any way that an animal interact with other animals or the environment. An animal may carry out behaviors alone or with other animals. The photos in Figure 15.1 show just a few of the ways that animals behave. Look at the pictures and read about the behaviors they represent. Why do you think the animals are behaving in these ways? And how do the behaviors come about? Which, if any of them, have to be learned? 
Animal  Behavior and  Natural  Selection 	  Why do animals behave in the ways pictured in Figure 15.1? The specific answer depends on what the behavior is. Male flamingoes put on a noisy group show in order to attract females for mating. Frogs call out to attract mates or to warn other frogs to stay away from their territory. Baby ducks follow their mother to stay close to her for protection and survival. Male elephant seals fight to defend their hunting territory from each other. All of these behaviors have the purpose of promoting reproduction or survival. Like the animals pictured above, all animals have behaviors that help them achieve these basic ends. Behaviors that help animals reproduce or survive increase their fitness. Animals with greater fitness have a better chance of passing their genes to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. In other words, they evolve by natural selection. Examples of animal behavior: (clockwise from top left) flamingoes, frog, elephant seals, ducks. 
Innate  Behaviors 	  All of the animal behaviors pictured in Figure 15.1 are ways that animals act without being taught to act in these ways. Such behaviors are called innate. An innate behavior is any behavior that occurs naturally in all the animals of a given species. An innate behavior is also called an instinct. The first time an animal performs an innate behavior, the animal does it well. The animal doesnt have to practice the behavior in order to get it right or to become better at doing it. Innate behaviors are also predictable. All members of a species perform an innate behavior in the same way. 
Other  Examples of  Innate  Behaviors 	  There are many other examples of innate behaviors in animals. Even behaviors that seem complex and difficult may be innate. For example, honeybees perform dances in order to communicate about food sources. When a honeybee, like the one in Figure 15.2, finds a food source, it returns to its hive and does a dance, called the waggle dance. The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive where to find the food. Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees, so it is an innate behavior. Watch this video to see the waggle dance and find out what it communicates: URL Three other examples of innate behavior are pictured in Figure 15.3. If an animal were to perform such behaviors incorrectly, it might be less likely to survive or reproduce. Can you explain why each behavior pictured in the figure This honeybee will do a waggle dance when it returns to the hive to let the other bees in the hive know where it found food. is important for reproduction or survival? 
Innate  Behaviors in  Humans 	  Innate behaviors occur in all animals. However, the more intelligent a species is, the fewer innate behaviors it generally has. The human species is the most intelligent animal species, and it has very few innate behaviors. The only innate behaviors in humans are reflex behaviors. A reflex behavior is a simple response that always occurs when a certain stimulus is present. Human reflex behaviors occur mainly in babies. You may have seen a baby exhibit the grasp reflex shown in Figure 15.4. Whenever an object, such as someones finger, is placed in the babys palm, the baby grasps it. Babies respond this way from birth to about 6 months of age. Its easy to see why this might help a baby survive. Grabbing onto something could keep a baby from falling and being injured. 
Learned  Behavior 	  Other than infant reflexes, human behaviors are mainly learned rather than innate behaviors. Learned behavior is behavior that occurs only after experience or practice. Did you ever teach a dog to sit on command? Thats an example of a learned behavior. The dog wasnt born knowing that it should sit when it hears the word sit. The dog had to learn the behavior. Most animals are capable of learning, but animals that are more intelligent are better at learning and depend more on learned behaviors. The big advantage of learned behaviors over innate behaviors is that learned behaviors are flexible. They can be changed to suit changing conditions. Human beings depend on learned behaviors more than any other species. Think about some of the behaviors you have learned. They might include making a bed, riding a bicycle, using a computer, and playing a sport, to name just a few. You may have learned each of the behaviors in different ways. There are several different ways in which animals learn. They include habituation, observational learning, conditioning, learning through play, and insight learning. 
Habituation 	  One of the simplest ways of learning that occurs in just about all animals is habituation. Habituation means learning to get used to something after being exposed to it repeatedly. It usually involves getting used to something that is frightening or annoying but not dangerous. Look at the crows in Figure 15.5. They are no longer afraid of the scarecrow. They have gotten used to a human in this location and know that it wont hurt them. Habituation lets animals ignore things that wont harm them. It allows them to avoid wasting time and energy escaping from things that arent really dangerous. 
Observational  Learning 	  Do you remember how you learned to tie your shoe laces? You may have watched and copied the behavior of your mom or an older sibling. Learning by watching and copying the behavior of someone else is called observational learning. Human children learn many behaviors this way. Other animals also learn through observational learning. For example, the wolves in Figure 15.6 learned how to hunt in a group by watching and copying the hunting behaviors of older wolves in their pack. These crows have learned through habituation that the scarecrow is harmless. They have become used to its being in this spot and learned that it is not dangerous. Observational	learning	explains	how wolves know how to hunt as a group. 
Conditioning 	  Conditioning is a way of learning that involves a reward or punishment. If you ever trained a dog to obey a command, you probably gave the dog a tasty treat each time he performed the desired behavior. It may not have been very long before the dog would reliably follow the command in order to get the treat. This is an example of conditioning that involves a reward. Conditioning does not always involve a reward. It can involve a punishment instead. For example, a dog might be scolded each time she jumps up on the sofa. After repeated scolding, she may learn to stay off the sofa. Conditioning occurs in nature as well. Here are just two examples: Bees learn to find nectar in certain types of flowers because they have found nectar in those types of flowers before. In this case, the behavior is learned because it is rewarded with nectar. Many birds learn to avoid eating monarch butterflies, like the one pictured in Figure 15.7. Monarch butterflies taste bad and make birds sick. In this case, the behavior is learned because it is punished with a nasty taste and illness. 
Learning  Through  Play 	  Many animals, especially mammals, spend a lot of time playing when they are young. Although playing is fun, its likely that animals play for other reasons as well. Learning behaviors that will be important in adulthood is one likely outcome of play. Bear cubs, like the two bear cubs in Figure 15.8, frequently play together. They often pretend to be fighting. By play fighting they may be learning skills such as fighting and hunting that they will need as adults. Other young animals may play in different ways. For example, young deer play by running and kicking up their hooves. This may help them learn how to escape from predators. Human children learn by playing as well. For example, playing games and sports may help them learn how to follow rules and work with others. 
Insight  Learning 	  Insight learning is learning from past experiences and reasoning. It generally involves coming up with new ways to solve problems. Insight learning generally happens quickly. An animal has a sudden flash of insight. Insight learning requires relatively great intelligence. Human beings use insight learning more than any other species. They have used it to invent the wheel to land astronauts on the moon. Think about problems you have solved. You may have figured out how to solve a new type of math problem or how to get to the next level of a video game. If you relied on your past experiences and reasoning to do it, then you were using insight learning. One type of insight learning is making tools to solve problems. Scientists used to think that humans were the only animals intelligent enough to make tools. In recent decades, however, there have been many observations of other animal species using tools. They range from monkeys and chimpanzees to crows. You can see a monkey using a stone tool in Figure 15.9. She is using the stone to crack open the shells of marine invertebrates such as oysters. Chimpanzees have been observed using sticks to fish for termites in a termite mound. Crows have been seen bending wire to form a hook in order to pull food out of a tube. Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals besides humans can use their experience and reasoning to solve problems. They can learn through insight. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Animal behavior is any way that animals interact with each other or their environment. Many animal behaviors promote fitness by increasing the chances of surviving or reproducing. If such behaviors are controlled by genes, they evolve by natural selection. Innate behavior is any behavior that occurs naturally in all the animals of a given species. It doesnt have to be learned, and it occurs in the same way in all members of the species. Examples of innate behaviors include the waggle dance in honeybees and the grasp reflex in human babies. Learned behavior is any behavior that occurs only after experience or practice. The more intelligent a species is, the more it depends on learned behaviors, which have the advantage of being flexible. Ways in which animals learn behaviors include habituation, observational learning, conditioning, learning through play, and insight learning. 
Think  Critically 	  Some animal behaviors have the purpose of sharing information with other animals. This is called communication. Describe ways that animals may communicate, and explain why communication is essential for social animals. Give examples of social animals and how they cooperate. Identify animal behaviors involved in reproduction. Describe defensive behaviors, and explain why they occur. Give an overview of behaviors that occur in annual or daily cycles. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  biological clock circadian rhythm communication cooperation diurnal hibernation language mating migration nocturnal social animal territorial 
Introduction 	  The man in the foreground of Figure 15.10 is a sign language interpreter. Hes communicating the remarks of the speaker behind him to people who cant hear. When you think of communication, you may think of spoken or written language. But as the figure shows, communication can take other forms as well. Although humans may be the only species of animal to communicate with spoken or written language, we are far from being the only species of animal that communicates. What other animal species can communicate? And how and why do they do it? In this chapter, youll find out. 
Communication 	  Communication is any way that animals share information. Many animals live in social groups. For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict. Communication may help animals work together to find food and defend themselves from predators. It also helps them find mates and care for their offspring. In addition, communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors. Therefore, communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing. 
How  Nonhuman  Animals  Communicate 	  Different animal species use a range of senses for communicating. They may communicate using hearing, sight, or smell. Animals that communicate by making and hearing sounds include frogs, birds, and monkeys. Frogs call out to attract mates. Birds may use calls to warn other birds to stay away or to tell them to flock together. Monkeys use warning calls to tell other troop members that a predator is near. Animals may communicate by sight with gestures, body postures, or facial expressions. Look at the cat in Figure 15.11. Theres no mistaking the meaning of its arched back, standing hair, and exposed fangs. Its clearly saying stay away, or else! Bees communicate with a waggle dance. They use it to tell other bees where food is located. A wide range of animals communicate by releasing chemicals they can smell or detect in some other way. They include animals as different as ants and dogs. An ant, for example, releases chemicals to mark the trail to a food source. Other ants in the nest can detect the chemicals with their antennae and find the food. Look at the dog in Figure 15.12. Its marking its territory with a chemical that it releases in urine. It does this to keep other dogs out of its yard. 
How  Humans  Communicate 	  Humans communicate with each other in a variety of ways. Chiefly, however, we use sound and sight to share information. The most important way that humans communicate is with language. Language is the use of symbols to communicate. In human languages, the symbols are words. Words may stand for things, people, actions, feelings, or ideas. By combining words in sentences, language can be used to express very complex thoughts. Another important way that humans communicate is with facial expressions. Look at the facial expressions of the girl in Figure 15.13. You can probably tell what emotion she is trying to convey with each expression. From left to right, she looks happy, sad, and angry. Human facial expressions can communicate a range of emotions. Humans also commonly use gestures and body postures to communicate. You might answer a question by shrugging your shoulders, which means I dont know. You might use a thumbs-up gesture when a friend scores a goal to mean Good job. Can you think of other gestures you commonly use to communicate with others? 
Social  Behaviors 	  Without communication, animals would not be able to live together in groups. Animals that live in groups with other members of their species are called social animals. Social animals include many species of insects, birds, and mammals. Specific examples are ants, bees, crows, wolves, and human beings. 
Social  Animals 	  Some species of animals are very social. In these species, members of the group depend completely on one another. Thats because different animals within the group have different jobs. Therefore, group members must work together for the good of all. Most species of bees and ants are highly social animals. Look at the honeybees in Figure 15.14. Honeybees live in colonies that may consist of thousands of individual bees. Generally, there are three types of adult bees in a colony: workers, a queen, and drones. Most of the adult bees in a colony are workers. They cooperate to build the hive, collect food, and care for the young. Each worker has a specific task to perform, depending on its age. Young worker bees clean the hive and feed the offspring. Older worker bees build the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive. The oldest worker bees leave the hive to find food. Each colony usually has one queen. Her only job is to lay eggs. The colony also has a relatively small number of male drones. Their only job is to mate with the queen. 
Cooperation 	  Bees and other social animals must cooperate to live together successfully. Cooperation means working together with others. Members of the group may cooperate by dividing up tasks, defending each other, and sharing food. The ants in Figure 15.15 are sharing food. One ant is transferring food directly from its mouth to the mouth of another colony member. Besides social insects, animals in many other species also cooperate. For example, in meerkat colonies, young female meerkats act as babysitters. They take care of the baby meerkats while their parents are out looking for food. 
Reproductive  Behaviors 	  Some of the most important behaviors in animals involve reproduction. They include behaviors to attract mates and behaviors for taking care of the young. Mouth-to-mouth transfer of food is common in some species of ants. 
Courtship and  Mating 	  Mating is the pairing of an adult male and an adult female for the purpose of reproduction. In many animal species, females choose the males they will mate with. For their part, males try to show females that they would be better mates than other males. To be chosen as mates, males may perform courtship behaviors. These are special behaviors that help attract a mate. Male courtship behaviors are meant to get the attention of females and show off a males traits. Different species of animals have different courtship behaviors. An example of courtship behavior in birds is shown in Figure 15.16. The bird in the picture is a male sharp-tailed grouse, and hes doing a courtship dance. Each year in the spring, as many as two dozen grouse males gather in a grassy area to perform their courtship dance. Female grouse watch the dance and then mate with the males that put on the best display. You can see a group of male grouse performing their courtship dance in this short video: URL . 
Caring for  Offspring 	  In most species of birds and mammals, one or both parents care for the young. This may include building a nest or other shelter. It may also include feeding the young and protecting them from predators. Caring for the young increases their chances of surviving. This, in turn, increases the parents fitness, so such behaviors evolve by natural selection. Emperor penguins make great sacrifices to take care of their young. After laying an egg, a penguin mother returns to the sea for two months to feed. Her mate stays behind to keep the egg warm. He balances the egg on top of his feet to keep it warm for the entire time the mother is away. During this time, he goes without food. To survive the cold, he huddles together with other males. If the chick hatches before the mother returns, the father feeds it with a high-protein, high-fat substance he produces just for this purpose. You can see an emperor penguin father feeding his chick in Figure 15.17. A male sharp-tailed grouse does a courtship dance to attract a female for mating. 
Defensive  Behaviors 	  Some species of animals are territorial. This means that they defend an area that typically includes their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring. Animals generally dont fight to defend their territory. Instead, they are more likely to put on a defensive display. For example, male gorillas may pound on their chest and thump the ground to warn other male gorillas to stay away from their territory. This gets the message across without physical conflict, which would be riskier and take more energy. You can see a male gorilla putting on a defensive display in this video: URL . 
Behaviors that  Happen in  Cycles 	  Many animal behaviors occur in repeated cycles. Some cycles of behavior repeat each year. Other cycles of behavior repeat each day. 
Annual  Cycles 	  Examples of behaviors with annual cycles include migration and hibernation. Both are innate behaviors. They are triggered by changes in the environment, such as the days growing shorter in the fall. Migration is the movement of animals from one place to another. Migration is most common in birds, fish, and insects. In the Northern Hemisphere, many species of birds, such as finches and swallows, travel south for the winter. They migrate to areas where it is warmer and where more food is available. They return north in the spring. Migrating animals generally follow the same route each year. They may be guided by the position of the sun, Earths magnetic field, or other clues in the environment. Hibernation is a state in which an animals body processes slow down and its body temperature falls. A hibernating animal uses less energy than usual. This helps it survive during a time of year when food is scarce. Hibernation may last for weeks or even months. Examples of animals that hibernate include some species of bats, squirrels, snakes, and insects (see Figure 15.18). This ladybug is looking for a safe place to hibernate over the winter. 
Daily  Cycles 	  Many animals go through daily cycles. Daily cycles of behavior are called circadian rhythms. For example, most animals go to sleep when the sun sets down and wake up when the sun rises. These animals are active during the day and called diurnal. Other animals go to sleep when the sun rises and wake up when the sun sets. These animals are active during the night and called nocturnal. Many owls, like the owls in Figure 15.19, are nocturnal. Like some other nocturnal animals, they have large eyes that are specially adapted for seeing when light levels are low. By hunting at night, owls can avoid competing with other hunting birds such as hawks. In many species, including the human species, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock. It is located in the hypothalamus, which is a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The biological clock, in turn, is controlled by changes in the amount of light entering the eyes. Thats why the biological clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Communication is any way that animals share information. For animals that live in social groups, communication is essential. Animals may use a range of senses for communicating. The most important way that humans communicate is with language. Social animals are animals that live in groups with other members of their species. Different animals within the group may have different jobs so group members must cooperate for the good of all. Some of the most important behaviors in animals involve reproduction. They include mating and courtship behaviors as well as behaviors for protecting and feeding offspring. Some species of animals are territorial and defend their territory. They are more likely to put on a defensive display than engage in actual physical conflict. Many animal behaviors occur in repeated cycles. Migration and hibernation are examples of behaviors with annual cycles. Sleeping and waking are examples of behaviors with daily cycles.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  connective tissue epithelial tissue muscle tissue nervous tissue 
Introduction 	  The human body has often been compared to a machine. Think about common household machines, such as printers and washing machines. What do they have in common? Each machine consists of many parts, and the parts work together to perform a particular job. The human body is like a machine in these ways. It could be called the most fantastic machine on Earth. Read on to learn more about the human machine and its parts. See whether you agree that the human body is fantastic. 
Organization of the  Human  Body 	  The basic building blocks of the human body are cells. Human cells are organized into tissues, tissues are organized into organs, and organs are organized into organ systems. 
Human  Cells 	  The average human adult consists of an incredible 100 trillion cells! Cells are the basic units of structure and function in the human body, as they are in all living things. Each cell must carry out basic life processes in order to survive and help keep the body alive. Most human cells also have characteristics for carrying out other, special functions. For example, muscle cells have extra mitochondria to provide the energy needed to move the body. You can see examples of these and some other specialized human cells in Figure 16.1. To learn more about specialized human cells and what they do, watch this video: URL . Different types of cells in the human body are specialized for specific jobs. 
Human  Tissues 	  Specialized cells are organized into tissues. A tissue is a group of specialized cells of the same kind that perform the same function. There are four basic types of human tissues: connective, epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissues. The four types are shown in Figure 16.2. Connective tissue consists of cells that form the bodys structure. Examples include bone and cartilage, which protect and support the body. Blood is also a connective tissue. It circulates and connects cells throughout the body. Epithelial tissue consists of cells that cover inner and outer body surfaces. Examples include skin and the linings of internal organs. Epithelial tissue protects the body and its internal organs. It also secretes substances such as hormones and absorbs substances such as nutrients. Muscle tissue consists of cells that can contract, or shorten. Examples include skeletal muscle, which is attached to bones and makes them move. Other types of muscle include cardiac muscle, which makes the heart beat, and smooth muscle, which is found in other internal organs. Nervous tissue consists of nerve cells, or neurons, which can send and receive electrical messages. Nervous tissue makes up the brain, spinal cord, and other nerves that run throughout the body. 
Human  Organs 	  The four types of tissues make up all the organs of the human body. An organ is a structure composed of two or more types of tissues that work together to perform the same function. Examples of human organs include the skin, The human body consists of these four tissue types. brain, lungs, kidneys, and heart. Consider the heart as an example. Figure 16.3 shows how all four tissue types work together to make the heart pump blood. Tissues in the heart work together to pump blood. 
Human  Organ  Systems 	  Human organs are organized into organ systems. An organ system is a group of organs that work together to carry out a complex function. Each organ of the system does part of the overall job. For example, the heart is an organ in the circulatory system. The circulatory system also includes the blood vessels and blood. There are many different human organ systems. Figure 16.4 shows six of them and gives their functions. 
How  Human  Organ  Systems  Work  Together 	  The organ systems of the body work together to carry out life processes and maintain homeostasis. The body is in homeostasis when its internal environment is kept more-or-less constant. For example, levels of sugar, carbon dioxide, and water in the blood must be kept within narrow ranges. This requires continuous adjustments. For example: After you eat and digest a sugary snack, the level of sugar in your blood quickly rises. In response, the endocrine system secretes the hormone insulin. Insulin helps cells absorb sugar from the blood. This causes the level of sugar in the blood to fall back to its normal level. When you work out on a hot day, you lose a lot of water through your skin in sweat. The level of water in the blood may fall too low. In response, the excretory system excretes less water in urine. Instead, the water is returned to the blood to keep water levels from falling lower. What happens if homeostasis is not maintained? Cells may not get everything they need, or toxic wastes may build up in the body. If homeostasis is not restored, it may cause illness or even death. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The basic building blocks of the human body are cells. Human cells are organized into tissues, tissues are organized into organs, and organs are organized into organ systems. The organ systems of the body work together to carry out life processes and maintain homeostasis.

List organs of the integumentary system 	  Describe the two layers of the skin. Identify functions of the skin. Explain what you can do to help keep your skin healthy. Outline the structure and functions of hair and nails. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  acne dermis epidermis hair follicle integumentary system melanin melanocyte sebaceous gland sebum sweat gland 
Introduction 	  The skin is the major organ of the integumentary system. Hair and nails are also part of this organ system. All three organs provide a protective covering for the body. They also help the body maintain homeostasis. For a good video overview of the integumentary system, watch this video: URL . 
Structure of the  Skin 	  From the outside, the skin looks plain and simple, as you can see in Figure 16.5. But at a cellular level, theres nothing plain or simple about it. A single square inch of skin contains about 20 blood vessels, hundreds of sweat glands, and more than a thousand nerve endings. It also contains tens of thousands of pigment-producing cells. Clearly, there is much more to skin than meets the eye! For a dramatic introduction to the skin, watch this video: URL . The skin is much more complex that it appears from the outside. The skin is only about 2 mm thick, or about as thick as the cover of a book. Although it is very thin, it consists of two distinct layers, called the epidermis and the dermis. You can see both layers and some of their structures in Figure 16.6. Refer to the figure as you read about the epidermis and dermis below. 
Epidermis 	  The epidermis is the outer layer of skin. It consists almost entirely of epithelial cells. There are no blood vessels, nerve endings, or glands in this skin layer. Nonetheless, this layer of skin is very active. It is constantly being renewed. How does this happen? The epidermis also contains cells called melanocytes. You can see a melanocyte in Figure 16.7. Melanocytes produce melanin. Melanin is a brown pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyones skin has about the same number of melanocytes per square inch. However, the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin that is produced depends partly on your genes and partly on how much ultraviolet light strikes your skin. The more light you get, the more melanin your melanocytes produce. This explains why skin tans when its exposed to sunlight. Melanocytes are located at the bottom of the epidermis. 
Dermis 	  The dermis is the inner layer of skin. It is made of tough connective tissue. The dermis is attached to the epidermis by fibers made of the protein collagen. The dermis is where most skin structures are located. Look again at Figure 16.7. Youll see that the dermis has blood vessels and nerve endings. The nerve endings explain why skin can sense pain, pressure, and temperature. If you cut your skin and it bleeds, the cut has penetrated the dermis and damaged a blood vessel. The cut probably hurts as well because of the nerve endings in this skin layer. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands. You can see some of these structures in Figure 16.8. Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate. Each hair grows out of a follicle, passes up through the epidermis, and extends above the skin surface. Sebaceous glands are commonly called oil glands. They produce an oily substance called sebum. Sebum is secreted into hair follicles. Then it makes its way along the hair shaft to the surface of the skin. Sebum waterproofs the hair and skin and helps prevent them from drying out. Sweat glands produce the salty fluid known as sweat. Sweat contains excess water, salts, and other waste products. Each sweat gland has a duct that passes through the epidermis. Sweat travels from the gland through the duct and out through a pore on the surface of the skin. 
Skin  Functions 	  You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. In several ways, it helps maintain homeostasis. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. Melanin in the epidermis absorbs ultraviolet light. This prevents the light from reaching and damaging the dermis. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen, increasing blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface and radiate into the environment. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow, decreasing blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface so less heat is lost to the environment. 
Keeping  Skin  Healthy 	  What can you do to keep your skin healthy? The most important step you can take is to protect your skin from sun exposure. On sunny days, wear long sleeves and pants and a hat with a brim. Also apply sunscreen to exposed areas of skin. Protecting your skin in these ways will reduce damage to your skin by ultraviolet light. This is important because skin that has been damaged by ultraviolet light is at greater risk of developing skin cancer. This is true whether the damage is due to sunlight or the light in tanning beds. About 85 percent of teens develop acne, like the boy in Figure 16.9. Acne is a condition in which pimples form on the skin. It is caused by a bacterial infection. It happens when the sebaceous glands secrete too much sebum. The excess oil provides a good place for bacteria to grow. Keeping the skin clean helps prevent acne. Over-the-counter products or prescription drugs may be needed if the problem is serious or doesnt clear up on its own. 
Hair and  Nails 	  You may spend a lot of time and money on your hair and nails. You may think of them as accessories, like clothes or jewelry. However, like the skin, the hair and nails also play important roles in helping the body maintain homeostasis. 
Hair 	  Only mammals have hair. Hair is a fiber made mainly of the tough protein keratin. The cells of each hair are filled with keratin and no longer alive. The dead cells overlap each other, almost like shingles on a roof. They work like shingles as well, by helping shed water from hair. Head hair helps protect the scalp from sun exposure. It also helps insulate the body. It traps air so heat cant escape from the head. Hair in eyelashes and eyebrows helps keep water and dust out of the eyes. Hairs inside the nostrils of the nose trap dust and germs in the air so they cant reach the lungs. 
Nails 	  Fingernails and toenails are made of specialized cells that grow out of the epidermis. They too are filled with keratin. The keratin makes them tough and hard. Their job is to protect the ends of the fingers and toes. They also make it easier to feel things with the sensitive fingertips by acting as a counterforce when things are handled. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The integumentary system consists of the skin, hair, and nails. All three organs provide a protective covering for the body and help maintain homeostasis. The skin consists of two distinct layers, an outer layer called the epidermis and an inner layer called the dermis. The epidermis is constantly being renewed as dead cells on the surface are shed. This layer contains melaninproducing melanocytes. The dermis contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, and sebaceous and sweat glands. The skin prevents loss of water from the body and keeps out microorganisms. Melanin in the epidermis protects the dermis from damaging ultraviolet light. By dilating or contracting its blood vessels and releasing sweat, skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. The most important way to keep your skin healthy is to protect it from ultraviolet light. Over-exposure to ultraviolet light can cause skin cancer. Keeping the skin clean can help prevent acne. Head hair protects the scalp from ultraviolet light exposure and loss of body heat. Hair in eyelashes, eyebrows, and nostrils traps water, dust, and other irritants. Nails protect the ends of fingers and toes and enhance the sense of touch. 
Think  Critically 	  You can see all the organs of your integumentary system because they cover the outside surface of your body. Most of the organs of your other body systems are hidden inside your body. For example, your skeletal system is completely hidden by your skin and other tissues. Identify components of the skeletal system. List functions of the skeletal system. Describe the structure of bone, and explain how bones grow and develop. Describe different types of joints, and explain how they function. Identify skeletal system problems and ways to prevent them. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  bone fracture bone marrow compact bone joint ligament ossification osteoporosis periosteum skeletal system spongy bone sprain 
Introduction 	  Can you imagine what you would look like without bones? You would be a soft, wobbly pile of skin, muscles, and internal organs. Clearly, bones are needed to support and shape the body. They have several other important roles as well. Youll learn what they are when you read this lesson. But first, sit back and be entertained by this very informative and funny video about the skeletal system: URL . 
Components of the  Skeletal  System 	  Bones are the main organs of the skeletal system. In adults, the skeleton consists of a whopping 206 bones, many of them in the hands and feet. You can see many of the bones of the human skeleton in Figure 16.10. The skeletal system also includes cartilage and ligaments. Cartilage is a tough, flexible connective tissue that contains the protein collagen. It covers the ends of bones where they meet. The gray tissue in Figure 16.10 is cartilage. A ligament is a band of fibrous connective tissue. Ligaments connect bones of the skeleton and hold them together. 
Functions of the  Skeletal  System 	  Your skeletal system supports your body and gives it shape. What else does it do? The skeletal system makes blood cells. Most blood cells are produced inside certain types of bones. The skeletal system stores calcium and helps maintain normal levels of calcium in the blood. Bones take up and store calcium when blood levels of calcium are high. They release some of the stored calcium when blood levels of calcium are low. The skeletal system works with muscles to move the body. Try to walk without bending your knees and youll see how important the skeletal system is for movement. The skeletal system protects the soft organs of the body. For example, the skull surrounds and protects the brain. The ribs protect the heart and lungs. 
Bones 	  Some people think bones are like chalk: dead, dry, and brittle. In reality, bones are very much alive. They consist of living tissues and are supplied with blood and nerves. 
Bone  Structure 	  Bones are organs. Like other organs, they are made up of more than one kind of tissue. There are four different kinds of tissues in bones, as shown in Figure 16.11. From the outside of the bone to the center, the tissues are periosteum, compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Periosteum is a tough, fibrous membrane that covers and protects the outer surfaces of bone. Compact bone lies below periosteum. It is very dense and hard. Compact bone gives bones their strength. Spongy bone lies below compact bone. It is less dense than compact bone. Spongy bone contains many tiny holes, or pores, which provide spaces for blood vessels and bone marrow. Bone marrow is a soft connective tissue inside pores and cavities in spongy bone. Bone marrow makes blood cells. 
How  Bones  Grow and  Develop 	  Early in the development of a human fetus, the skeleton is made entirely of cartilage. The relatively soft cartilage gradually changes to hard bone through ossification. This is a process in which mineral deposits replace cartilage in bone. At birth, several areas of cartilage remain, including the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs. This allows these bones to keep growing in length during childhood. By the late teens or early twenties, all of the cartilage has been replaced by bone. Bones cannot grow in length after this point has been reached. However, bones can continue to grow in width. They are stimulated to grow thicker when they are put under stress by muscles. Weight-bearing activities such as weight lifting can increase growth in bone width. 
Joints 	  A joint is a place where two or more bones of the skeleton meet. There are three different types of joints based on the degree to which they allow movement of the bones: immovable, partly movable, and movable joints. Immovable joints do not allow the bones to move at all. In these joints, the bones are fused together by very tough collagen. Examples of immovable joints include the joints between bones of the skull. You can see them in Figure 16.12. Partly movable joints allow very limited movement. In these joints, the bones are held together by cartilage, which is more flexible than collagen. Examples of partly moveable joints include the bones of the rib cage. Movable joints allow the greatest movement and are the most common. In these joints, the bones are connected by ligaments. The surfaces of the bones at the joints are covered with a smooth layer of cartilage. It reduces friction between the bones when they move. The space between the bones is also filled with a liquid called synovial fluid. It helps to cushion the bones. There are several different types of movable joints. You can see three of them in Figure 16.13. Move these three joints in your own skeleton to experience the range of motion each allows. shoulder, Examples of movable joints: elbow, and knee 
Skeletal  System  Problems and  How to  Prevent  Them 	  What you eat as a teen can affect how healthy your skeletal system is not only now but also in the future. Eating a diet with plenty of calcium and vitamin D can help keep your bones strong. If you dont get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet as a teen, you will be more likely to develop osteoporosis when you are older. 
Osteoporosis 	  Osteoporosis is a disease in which the bones become porous and weak because they do not contain enough calcium. The graph in Figure 16.14 shows how the mass of calcium in bone peaks around age 30 and declines after that, especially in women. Maximizing the calcium in your bones while youre young will reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis later in of life. 
Fractures 	  People with osteoporosis have an increased risk of bone fractures. A bone fracture is a crack or break in bone. Even if you have healthy bones, you may fracture a bone if too much stress is placed on it. This could happen in a car crash or while playing a sport. Wearing a seatbelt when you ride in a motor vehicle and wearing safety gear when you play sports may help prevent bone fractures. Bone mass declines with age, leading to osteoporosis in many people by old age. Bone fractures heal naturally as new bone tissue forms at the site of the fracture. However, the bone may have to be placed in a cast or have rods or screws inserted into it to keep it correctly aligned until it heals. The healing process usually takes several weeks or even months. 
Sprains 	  Another type of skeletal system injury is a sprain. A sprain is a strain or tear in a ligament that has been twisted or stretched too far. Ankle sprains are a common type of sprain. Athletes often strain a ligament in the knee called the ACL. Warming up adequately and stretching before playing sports may reduce the risk of a sprain. Ligament injuries can take a long time to heal. Rest, ice, compression, and elevation of the sprained area may help the healing process. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Bones are the main organs of the skeletal system. The skeletal system also includes cartilage and ligaments. Functions of the skeletal system include supporting and shaping the body, allowing movement, producing blood cells, and storing calcium. Bones consist of four different types of tissue: periosteum, compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Ossification gradually changes the cartilage skeleton of the fetus to the bony skeleton of the adult. Joints may be immovable, partly movable, or movable. Types of movable joints include ball-and-socket, hinge, and pivot joints. Skeletal system problems include osteoporosis, bone fractures, and ligament sprains. A diet rick in calcium and vitamin D may reduce the risk of osteoporosis and related bone fractures. Following safe practices may also reduce the risk of fractures as well as sprains. 
Think  Critically 	  The skeletal system allows the body to move, but the muscular system is also needed. Define muscle. Explain how muscles contract. Identify three types of muscle tissue. Describe the structure and function of skeletal muscles. List ways to keep the muscular system healthy. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  cardiac muscle muscle muscle fiber muscular system myofibril skeletal muscle smooth muscle tendon 
Introduction 	  You may think of muscles as the end result of exercises, like the pushups the soldier in Figure 16.15 is doing. Muscles in the arms and shoulders, which move the body, are easy to see and feel. However, they arent the only type of muscles. Many muscles are deep inside the body, mostly in the walls of organs. For example, your heart is almost completely muscle. These muscles dont directly move your body, but you couldnt survive without them. What Are Muscles? Muscles are the main organs of the muscular system. Muscles are composed primarily of cells called muscle fibers. A muscle fiber is a very long, thin cell, as you can see in Figure 16.16. It contains multiple nuclei and many mitochondria, which produce ATP for energy. It also contains many organelles called myofibrils. Myofibrils allow muscles to contract, or shorten. Muscle contractions are responsible for virtually all the movements of the body, both inside and out. A soldier prepares for a fitness challenge by doing one-arm pushups. A muscle fiber is a single cell that can contract. Each muscle fiber contains many myofibrils. 
How a  Muscle  Contracts 	  To understand how a muscle contracts, you need to dive deeper into the structure of muscle fibers. You can see in Figure 16.16 that a muscle fiber is full of myofibrils. Each myofibril is made up of two types of proteins, called actin and myosin. These proteins form thread-like filaments. The myosin filaments use energy from ATP to pull on the actin filaments. This causes the actin filaments to slide over the myosin filaments and shorten a section of the myofibril. You can see a simple animation of the process at this link: URL The sliding-and-shortening process occurs all along many myofibrils and in many muscle fibers. It causes the muscle fibers to shorten and the muscle to contract. 
Types of  Muscle  Tissue 	  There are three different types of muscle tissue in the human body: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle tissues. All three types consist mainly of muscle fibers, but the fibers have different arrangements. You can see how each type of muscle tissue looks in Figure 16.17. Cardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart. It is striated, or striped, because its muscle fibers are arranged in bundles. Contractions of cardiac muscle are involuntary. This means that they are not under conscious control. When cardiac muscle contracts, the heart beats and pumps blood. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of other internal organs such as the stomach. It isnt striated because its muscle fibers are arranged in sheets rather than bundles. Contractions of smooth muscle are involuntary. When smooth muscles in the stomach contract, they squeeze food inside the stomach. This helps break the food into smaller pieces. Skeletal muscle is attached to the bones of the skeleton. It is striated like cardiac muscle because its muscle fibers are arranged in bundles. Contractions of skeletal muscle are voluntary. This means that they are under conscious control. Whether you are doing pushups or pushing a pencil, you are using skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscles are the most common type of muscles in the body. You can read more about them below. 
A  Closer  Look at  Skeletal  Muscles 	  The human body has more than 600 skeletal muscles. You can see some of them in Figure 16.18. A few of the larger muscles are labeled in the figure. 
Structure and  Function of  Skeletal  Muscles 	  You can see the bundles of muscle fibers that make up a skeletal muscle in Figure 16.19. You can also see in the figure how the muscle is attached to a bone by a tendon. Tendons are tough connective tissues that anchor skeletal muscles to bones throughout the body. Many skeletal muscles are attached to the ends of bones where they meet at a joint. The muscles span the joint and connect the bones. When the muscles contract, they pull on the bones, causing them to move. Human Skeletal Muscles. Skeletal muscles enable the body to move. Skeletal muscles are attached to bones by tendons. 
Skeletal  Muscles  Work in  Pairs 	  Muscles can only contract. They cant actively lengthen. Therefore, to move bones back and forth at a joint, skeletal muscles must work in pairs. For example, the bicep and triceps muscles of the upper arm work as a pair. You can see how this pair of muscles works in Figure 16.20. When the bicep muscle contracts, it bends the arm at the elbow. When the triceps muscle contracts, it straightens the arm. 
Keeping  Your  Muscular  System  Healthy 	  Did you ever hear the saying, Use it or lose it? Thats certainly true when it comes to muscles. If you dont exercise your muscles, they will actually shrink in size. They will also become weaker and more prone to injury. 
Keeping  Muscles  Strong 	  Exercising muscles increases their size, and bigger muscles have greater strength. What type of exercises should you do? For all-round muscular health, you should do two basic types of exercise. To increase the size and strength of skeletal muscles, you need to make these muscles contract against a resisting force. For example, you can do sit-ups or pushups, where the resisting force is your own body weight. You can see another way to do it in Figure 16.21. To exercise cardiac muscle and increase muscle endurance, you need to do aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise increases the size and strength of muscles in the heart and helps all your muscles develop greater endurance. This means they can work longer without getting tired. Aerobic exercise is any exercise such as running, biking, or swimming that causes an increase in your heart rate. You can see another example of aerobic exercise in Figure 16.22. Lifting weights is one way to pit skeletal muscles against a resisting force. Snowshoeing is a fun way to get aerobic exercise. 
Preventing  Muscle  Injuries 	  You are less likely to have a muscle injury if you exercise regularly and have strong muscles. Stretching also helps prevent muscle injuries. Stretching improves the range of motion of muscles and tendons at joints. You should always warm up before stretching or doing any type of exercise. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to be injured. One way to warm up is to jog slowly for a few minutes. Exercising muscles makes them stronger and increases their endurance. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Muscles are the main organs of the muscular system. They consist primarily of long, thin cells called muscle fibers. A muscle fiber contracts when myosin filaments pull on actin filaments in myofibrils throughout the fiber. There are three types of muscle tissues: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle tissues. Most muscles are skeletal muscles, which are attached to bones by tendons. Skeletal muscles work in pairs to move bones back and forth at joints. Regular resistance exercise and aerobic exercise, preceded by warming up and stretching, can help keep the muscular system strong and healthy. 
Think  Critically 	  You may have heard that eating certain foods causes acne. This may or may not be true. But theres no question that what you eat is important for the health of your skin, bones, muscles. 
Chapter  Outline 	  Youve probably heard the saying, You are what you eat. Actually, its not just a saying. Its true. What you eat plays an important role in your health. Fried Twinkies may be tasty, but should you eat them? In this chapter youll find out. Youll learn how to choose foods that promote good health and provide energy for growth and activity. List three reasons why your body needs food. Define nutrient, and identify the six major types of nutrients. Describe macronutrients, their functions, and foods that contain them. Describe micronutrients, their functions, and foods that contain them.

Introduction 	  An apple a day keeps the doctor away. Thats another saying about food that you may have heard. Will eating apples really prevent you from getting sick? Probably not, but eating apples and other fresh fruits and vegetables like those in Figure 17.1 can help keep you healthy. Why do you need foods like these for good health? What roles does food play in the body? In this lesson, youll find out. For a good visual introduction to lesson content, watch this video: URL . Fresh fruits and veggies are an important part of a healthy diet. 
Why  Your  Body  Needs  Food 	  Your body needs food for three purposes: What Are Nutrients? There are a variety of substances in foods that the body needs. Any substance in food that the body needs is called a nutrient. There are six major types of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, water, minerals, and vitamins. Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids can be used for energy. Proteins also provide building materials. Proteins, minerals, and vitamins help control body processes. Water is needed by all cells just to stay alive. The six types of nutrients can be divided into two major categories based on how much of them the body needs. The categories are macronutrients and micronutrients. 
Macronutrients 	  Macronutrients are nutrients the body needs in relatively large amounts. They include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water. 
Carbohydrates 	  Carbohydrates include sugars, starches, and fiber. Sugars and starches are used by the body for energy. One gram of sugar or starch provides 4 Calories of energy. Fiber doesnt provide energy, but it is needed for other uses. At age 13 years, you need about 130 grams of carbohydrates a day. Figure 17.2 shows good food sources of each type. Sugars are small, simple carbohydrates. They are found in foods such as milk and fruit. Sugars in foods such as these are broken down by your digestive system to glucose, the simplest of all sugars. Glucose is taken up by cells for energy. Starches are larger, complex carbohydrates. They are found in foods such as grains and vegetables. Starches are broken down by your digestive system to glucose, which is used for energy. Fiber is a complex carbohydrate that consists mainly of cellulose and comes only from plants. High-fiber foods include whole grains and legumes such as beans. Fiber cant be broken down by the digestive system, but it plays important roles in the body. It helps keep sugar and lipids at normal levels in the blood. It also helps keep food waste moist so it can pass easily out of the body. 
Proteins 	  Proteins are nutrients made up of smaller molecules called amino acids. The digestive system breaks down proteins in food to amino acids, which are used for protein synthesis. Proteins synthesized from the amino acids in food serve many vital functions. They make up muscles, control body processes, fight infections, and carry substances in the blood. If you eat more protein than you need for these functions, the extra protein is used for energy. One gram of protein provides 4 Calories of energy, the same as carbohydrates. A 13-year-old needs to eat about 34 grams of protein a day. Figure 17.3 shows good food sources of protein. 
Lipids 	  Lipids are nutrients such as fats. They are used for energy and other important purposes. One gram of lipids provides the body with 9 Calories of energy, more than twice as much as carbohydrates or proteins. Lipids also make up cell membranes, protect nerves, control blood pressure, and help blood clot. You must consume some lipids for these purposes. Good food sources of lipids are shown in Figure 17.4. Any extra lipids you consume are stored as fat. A certain amount of stored fat is needed to cushion and protect internal organs and insulate the body. However, too much stored fat can lead to obesity and cause significant health problems. Good sources of lipids include fish, nuts, and seeds. A type of lipid called trans fat is found in many processed foods. Trans fat is rare in nature but is manufactured and added to foods to preserve freshness. Eating foods that contain trans fat increases the risk of heart disease. Trans fat may be found in such foods as cookies, doughnuts, crackers, fried foods, ground beef, and margarine. 
Water 	  Water is essential to life because chemical reactions within cells take place in water. Most people can survive only a few days without consuming water to replace their water losses. How do you lose water? You lose water in your breath each time you exhale. You lose water in urine. You lose water in sweat, especially if you are active in warm weather. The boy in Figure 17.5 is taking a water break while playing outside on a hot day. If he doesnt take in enough water to replace the water lost in sweat, he may become dehydrated. Symptoms of dehydration include dry mouth, headache, and dizziness. Dehydration can be very serious. It can even cause death. When you are active outside on a warm day, its important to drink plenty of water. You need to replace the water you lose in sweat. 
Micronutrients 	  Micronutrients are nutrients the body needs in relatively small amounts. They include minerals and vitamins. These nutrients dont provide the body with energy, but they are still essential for good health. 
Minerals 	  Minerals are chemical elements that dont come from living things or include the element carbon. Many minerals are needed in the diet for normal functioning of the body. Several minerals that are needed in relatively large amounts are listed in Table 17.1. As you can see from these examples, minerals have a diversity of important functions. Your body cant produce any of the minerals it needs, so you must get them from the food you eat. The table shows good food sources of the minerals. TABLE 17.1: Some of the minerals needed by the human body 
Calcium 	  strong bones and teeth milk, green leafy vegetables 
Chloride 	  salt-water balance table salt, most packaged foods 
Magnesium 	  strong bones whole grains, nuts 
Phosphorus 	  strong bones and teeth poultry, whole grains 
Potassium 	  muscle and nerve functions meat, bananas 
Sodium 	  muscle and nerve functions table salt, most packaged foods Not getting enough minerals can cause health problems. For example, not getting enough calcium may cause osteoporosis. This is a disease in which the bones become porous so they break easily. Getting too much of some minerals can also cause health problems. Many people get too much sodium. Sodium is added to most packaged foods. People often add more sodium to their food by using table salt. Too much sodium has been linked to high blood pressure in some people. 
Vitamins 	  Vitamins are organic compounds that the body needs in small amounts to function properly. Humans need 16 410different vitamins. Six of them are listed in Table 17.2. Vitamin D is made in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. Bacteria that normally live in the gut make vitamins B12 and K. All other vitamins must come from food. The table The vitamins to watch out for are A, D, E, and K. These vitamins are stored by the body, so they can build up to high levels. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Your body needs food for energy, building materials, and substances that control body processes. Nutrients are substances in food that your body needs. There are six types of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, water, minerals, and vitamins. Macronutrients are nutrients that are needed in relatively large amounts. They include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water. Except for water, macronutrients can all provide the body with energy. Micronutrients are nutrients that are needed in relatively small amounts. They include minerals and vitamins. They do not provide the body with energy but are needed for good health. 
Think  Critically 	  Now you know what nutrients you need and some of the foods that contain them. Describe how to use MyPlate to make nutritious food choices. Outline how to use food labels to choose healthy foods. Explain why you must balance food with exercise to maintain a healthy weight and avoid obesity. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  ingredient main ingredient 
My Plate 	  nutrition facts label obesity 
Introduction 	  Foods such whole grains and fresh vegetables provide nutrients you need for good health. You need a range of foods because different foods give you different types of nutrients. You also need different amounts of each nutrient. How can you choose the right mix of foods to get the proper balance of nutrients? Two tools can help you choose foods wisely: MyPlate and food labels. 
My Plate 	  MyPlate is a diagram that shows you how to balance foods at each meal. It represents the relative amounts of five food groups that you should put on your plate (and in your cup). You can see MyPlate in Figure 17.6. The five food groups in MyPlate are: Enjoy your food, but eat less. Avoid oversized portions. Make half your plate fruits and vegetables, including both green and yellow or orange vegetables. Make at least half your grains whole grains. Choose fat-free or low-fat milk. Avoid high-sodium foods. Drink water instead of sugary drinks. Youll notice that there is no food group on MyPlate for foods like ice cream, cookies, and potato chips. These foods have little nutritional value. They may also be high in fats, sugars, or salt. They should be eaten only sparingly if at all. 
Food  Labels 	  How do you know which foods contain whole grain and which are low in fat and sodium? Thats where food labels come in. In the U.S., packaged foods must be labeled with nutritional information. A nutrition facts label shows the main nutrients in one serving of the food. Packaged foods must also be labeled with their ingredients. An ingredient is a specific item that a food contains. 
Using  Nutrition  Facts  Labels 	  Look at the nutrition facts label in Figure 17.7. Instructions at the right of the label tell you what to look for. At the top of the label, look for the serving size. The serving size tells you how much of the food you should eat to get the nutrients listed on the label. For this food, 1 cup is a serving. The Calories in one serving are listed next. In this food, there are 250 Calories per serving. Next on the nutrition facts label, look for the percent daily values (% DV) of several nutrients. The percent daily value shows what percent of daily needs for a given nutrient that the food provides (based on a 2000Calorie-per-day diet). A food is low in a nutrient if the %DV is 5% or less. This particular food is low in fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, and iron. A food is high in a nutrient if the %DV is 20% or more. This food is high in sodium, potassium, and calcium. Reading nutrition facts labels can help you choose healthy foods. Look at the nutrition facts label shown here. Do you think this food is a good choice for a healthy eating plan? Why or why not? To learn more about nutrition facts labels and how to use them, watch this video: URL 
Using  Ingredients  Lists 	  The food label in Figure 17.8 represents a different food and includes the list of ingredients. The main ingredient is always listed first. The main ingredient is the ingredient that is present in the food in the greatest amount. As you go down the list, the ingredients are present in smaller and smaller amounts. This food label includes the list of ingredients in the food. The main ingredient is enriched wheat flour, followed by highfructose corn syrup. Why should you avoid foods with ingredients such as these at the top of the ingredients list? Reading the ingredients lists on food labels can help you choose the healthiest foods. At the top of the list, look for ingredients such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and low-fat milk. Ingredients such as these are needed in the greatest amounts for balanced eating. Avoid foods that list fats, oils, sugar, or salt near the top of the list. For good health, you should avoid getting too much of these ingredients. Be aware that ingredients such as corn syrup are sugars. You should also use moderation when eating foods that contain ingredients such as white flour or white rice. These ingredients have been processed, and processing removes nutrients. The word enriched is a clue that an ingredient has been processed. Ingredients are enriched with added nutrients to replace those lost during processing. Even so, they are still likely to have fewer nutrients than unprocessed ingredients. 
Balancing  Food with  Exercise 	  Physical activity is an important part of balanced eating. It helps you use up any extra Calories in the foods you eat. You should try to get at least an hour of exercise just about every day (see Figure 17.9). Exercise has many health benefits in addition to balancing the energy in food. For example, it strengthens the bones and muscles and may improve your mood. 
Obesity 	  What happens if you dont get enough exercise to balance the food you eat? Any unused energy in the food is stored as fat. If you take in more energy than you use day after day, you will store more and more fat and become overweight. Eventually, you may become obese. Obesity is diagnosed in people who have a high percentage of body fat. A measure called Body Mass Index, or BMI, is often used to diagnose obesity. You can learn more about BMI by watching this video: URL be.com/watch?v=5UsGqPrZjN8 . Obesity is associated with many health problems, including high blood pressure and diabetes. People that remain obese during their entire adulthood usually do not live as long as people that stay within a healthy weight range. The current generation of young people in the U.S. is the first generation in our history that may have a shorter life span than their parents because of obesity and the health problems associated with it. 
Avoiding  Obesity 	  You can avoid gaining too much weight and becoming obese. Choose healthy foods and balance the energy in food with exercise. To choose healthy foods, use MyPlate and nutrition facts labels. On food labels, pay attention to Calories as well as nutrients. Keep in mind that the average 1113 year old needs about 2000 Calories a day. To balance energy with exercise, aim to get about an hour of physical activity each day. You can use an online calculator like this one to find the number of Calories you use in a wide range of activities: URL nesspal.com/exercise/lookup 
Lesson  Summary 	  MyPlate is a diagram that shows you how to balance foods at each meal. It represents the relative amounts of five food groups that you should put on your plate (and in your cup). The five food groups are grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and protein. A nutrition facts label shows the main nutrients in one serving of the food. Packaged foods must also be labeled with their ingredients. Knowing how to interpret this information can help you choose the healthiest foods. Exercise is important for balanced eating. Exercise helps you use up any extra Calories in the foods you eat. You should try to get at least an hour of physical activity just about every day. This will help you avoid obesity and its health problems. 
Think  Critically 	  The food you eat provides your body with nutrients. But first, the food must be broken down by the digestive system. Identify the major organs and general functions of the digestive system. Explain the role of enzymes and other secretions in digestion. Outline the digestive functions of the mouth, esophagus, and stomach. Explain how digestion and absorption occur in the small intestine. State functions of the large intestine and roles of intestinal bacteria. Describe two digestive system problems and how to prevent them. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  absorption chemical digestion digestion digestive system elimination esophagus food allergy foodborne illness gall bladder gastrointestinal (GI) tract large intestine liver mechanical digestion pancreas peristalsis small intestine stomach villi (villus, singular) 
Introduction 	  Nutrients in the food you eat are needed by the cells of your body. How do they get from your sandwich to your cells? What organs and processes break down the food and make the nutrients available to cells? The organs are those of the digestive system. The processes are digestion and absorption. 
Overview of the  Digestive  System 	  The digestive system is the body system that breaks down food and absorbs nutrients. It also eliminates solid food wastes that remain after food is digested. The major organs of the digestive system are shown in Figure 17.10. For an entertaining overview of the digestive system and how it works, watch this video: URL atch?v=JnzwbipJuAA . Major organs of the digestive system make up the GI tract. 
The  I  Tract 	  The organs in Figure 17.10 make up the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This is essentially a long tube that connects the mouth to the anus. Food enters the mouth and then passes through the rest of the GI tract. Food waste leaves the body through the anus. In adults, the GI tract is more than 9 meters (30 feet) long! Organs of the GI tract are covered by muscles that contract to keep food moving along. A series of involuntary muscle contractions moves rapidly along the tract, like a wave travelling through a spring toy. The muscle contractions are called peristalsis. The diagram in Figure 17.11 shows how peristalsis works. 
Digestion 	  As food is pushed through the GI tract by peristalsis, it undergoes digestion. Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks of food are broken down into smaller pieces. This is a physical process that happens mainly in the mouth and stomach. Chemical digestion occurs when large food molecules are broken down into smaller nutrient molecules. This is a chemical process that begins in the mouth and stomach but occurs mainly in the small intestine. 
Absorption 	  After food is broken down into nutrient molecules, the molecules are absorbed by the blood. Absorption is the process in which nutrients or other molecules are taken up by the blood. Once absorbed by the blood, nutrients can travel in the bloodstream to cells throughout the body. 
Elimination 	  Some substances in food cant be broken down into nutrients. They remain behind in the digestive system after the nutrients have been absorbed. Any substances in food that cant be digested pass out of the body as solid waste. This process is called elimination. 
Digestive  Enzymes and  Other  Secretions 	  Chemical digestion could not take place without the help of digestive enzymes and other substances secreted into the GI tract. An enzyme is a protein that speeds up a biochemical reaction. Digestive enzymes speed up the reactions of chemical digestion. Table 17.3 lists a few digestive enzymes, the organs that produce them, and their functions in digestion. 
Amylase 	  mouth starch 
Pepsin 	  stomach protein TABLE 17.3: (continued) 
Lipase 	  pancreas fat 
Ribonuclease 	  pancreas 
 	  Most digestive enzymes are secreted into the GI tract by organs of the GI tract or from a nearby gland named the pancreas. Figure 17.12 shows where the pancreas is located. The figure also shows the locations of the liver and gall bladder. These organs produce or store other digestive secretions. The liver secretes bile acids.	Bile acids help digest fat. Some liver bile is secreted directly into the small intestine. Some liver bile goes to the gall bladder. This sac-like organ stores and concentrates the liver bile before releasing it into the small intestine. 
The  Start of  Digestion:  Mouth to  Stomach 	  Does the sight or smell of your favorite food make your mouth water? When this happens, you are getting ready for digestion. 
Mouth 	  The mouth is the first digestive organ that food enters. The sight, smell, or taste of food stimulates the release of saliva and digestive enzymes by salivary glands inside the mouth. Saliva wets the food, which makes it easier to break up and swallow. The enzyme amylase in saliva begins the chemical digestion of starches to sugars. Your teeth help to mechanically digest food. Look at the different types of human teeth in Figure 17.13. Sharp teeth in the front of the mouth cut or tear food when you bite into it. Broad teeth in the back of the mouth grind food when you chew. Your tongue helps mix the food with saliva and enzymes and also helps you swallow. When you swallow, a lump of chewed food passes from the mouth into a tube in your throat called the pharynx. From the pharynx, the food passes into the esophagus. 
Esophagus 	  The esophagus is a long, narrow tube that carries food from the pharynx to the stomach. It has no other purpose. Food moves through the esophagus because of peristalsis. At the lower end of the esophagus, a circular muscle, called a sphincter, controls the opening to the stomach. The sphincter relaxes to let food pass into the stomach. Then the sphincter contracts to prevent food from passing back into the esophagus. 
Stomach 	  The stomach is a sac-like organ at the end of the esophagus. It has thick muscular walls that contract and relax to squeeze and mix food. This helps break the food into smaller pieces. It also helps mix the food with enzymes and other secretions in the stomach. For example, the stomach secretes the enzyme pepsin, which helps digest proteins. Water, salt, and simple sugars can be absorbed into the blood from the lining of the stomach. However, most substances must undergo further digestion in the small intestine before they can be absorbed. The stomach stores the partly digested food until the small intestine is empty. Then a sphincter between the stomach and small intestine relaxes, allowing food to enter the small intestine. 
Digestion and  Absorption:  The  Small  Intestine 	  The small intestine is a narrow tube that starts at the stomach and ends at the large intestine. In adults, its about 7 meters (23 feet) long. Most chemical digestion and almost all nutrient absorption take place in the small intestine. The small intestine is made up of three parts: This diagram shows whats inside each of the millions of villi that line the jejunum and ileum of the small intestine. The villus is drawn greatly enlarged. 
Elimination and  Other  Functions of the  Large  Intestine 	  The large intestine is a wide tube that connects the small intestine with the anus. In adults, the large intestine is about 
Producing and  Eliminating  Feces 	  Food waste enters the large intestine from the small intestine in a liquid state. As the waste moves through the large intestine, excess water is absorbed from it. The remaining solid waste is called feces. After a certain amount of feces have collected, a sphincter relaxes to let the feces pass out of the body through the anus. This is elimination. 
Bacteria in the  Large  Intestine 	  Trillions of bacteria normally live in the large intestine. Dont worrymost of them are helpful. They have several important roles. For example, intestinal bacteria: produce vitamins B12 and K. control the growth of harmful bacteria. break down toxins in the large intestine. break down fiber and some other substances in food that cant be digested. 
Digestive  System  Health 	  Much of the time, you probably arent aware of your digestive system. It works well without causing any problems. But most people have problems with their digestive system at least once in a while. Did you ever eat something that didnt agree with you? Maybe you had a stomachache or felt sick to your stomach. Perhaps you had diarrhea. These can be symptoms of food poisoning. 
Food  Poisoning 	  Food poisoning is the common term for foodborne illness. This type of illness occurs when harmful bacteria enter your digestive system in food and make you sick. The bacteriaor toxins they producemay cause cramping, vomiting, or other GI tract symptoms. Following these healthy practices may decrease your risk of foodborne illness: Wash your hands after handling raw foods such as meats, poultry, fish, or eggs. These foods often contain bacteria that your hands could transfer to your mouth. Cook meats, poultry, fish, or eggs thoroughly before eating them. The heat of cooking kills any bacteria the foods may contain so they cant make you sick. Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. This is especially important when food is packed for lunch or a picnic (see Figure 17.15). Maintaining the proper temperature slows the growth of bacteria in the food. 
Food  Allergies 	  Food allergies occur when the immune system reacts to harmless substances in food as though they were harmful germs. Food allergies are relatively common. Almost 10 percent of children have them. Some of the foods most likely to cause allergies include milk, shellfish, nuts, grains, and eggs. If you eat foods to which you are allergic, you may experience vomiting, diarrhea, or a rash. In some people, eating even tiny amounts of certain foods causes them to have serious symptoms, such as difficulty breathing. They need immediate medical attention. The best way to prevent food allergy symptoms is to avoid eating the offending food. This may require careful reading of food labels. Picnic food is a potential cause of foodborne illness. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The digestive system is the body system that digests food mechanically and chemically and absorbs nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines. These organs make up the long tube called the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which goes from the mouth to the anus. Chemical digestion depends on the work of digestive enzymes and other substances. These are secreted into the GI tract by organs of the digestive system or by the pancreas, liver, or gall bladder. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Excess water is absorbed from food waste in the large intestine before it passes out of the body through the anus as feces. Trillions of helpful bacteria also live in the large intestine. They carry out important roles, such as making vitamins. Common digestive system problems include foodborne illness and food allergies. Following healthy foodhandling practices may decrease your risk of foodborne illness. Food allergy symptoms can be prevented by avoiding the offending foods. 
Think  Critically 	  In the digestive system, food is digested and its nutrients are absorbed by the blood for transport around the body. The blood is part of the cardiovascular system. 
Chapter  Outline 	  Place two fingers of one hand on the inside of your other wrist, as shown in this photo. You should be able to feel your pulse. What you are actually feeling is the pressure of blood inside a blood vessel in your wrist. Each throb of your pulse represents a beat of your heart. Your heart, blood vessels, and blood are all part of your cardiovascular system. Identify parts of the cardiovascular system. State functions of the cardiovascular system. Compare and contrast the two circulations of the cardiovascular system. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  cardiovascular system pulmonary circulation systemic circulation 
Introduction 	  The cardiovascular system is the system of organs that delivers blood to all the cells of the body. Its like the bodys lifeline. Without the cardiovascular system circulating your blood, you couldnt survive. 
Parts of the  Cardiovascular  System 	  The organs that make up the cardiovascular system are the heart and a network of blood vessels that run throughout the body. The blood in the cardiovascular system is a liquid connective tissue. Figure 18.1 shows the heart and major vessels through which blood flows in the system. The heart is basically a pump that keeps blood moving through the blood vessels. 
Functions of the  Cardiovascular  System 	  The main function of the cardiovascular system is transporting substances around the body. Figure 18.1 shows some of the substances that are transported in the blood. They include hormones, oxygen, nutrients from digested food, and cellular wastes. Transport of all these materials is necessary to maintain homeostasis of the body and life itself. The cardiovascular system also helps regulate body temperature by controlling where blood moves around the body. Blood is warm, so when more blood flows to the surface of the body, it warms the surface. This allows the body to lose excess heat from the surface. When less blood flows to the surface, it cools the surface. This allows the body system transports 
The	cardiovascular 	  many	substances	to	and throughout the body. from	cells to conserve heat and stay warm. You can see the role of blood vessels in the regulation of body temperature in this video: URL . 
Two  Circulations 	  The heart and blood vessels form a closed system through which blood keeps circulating. However, blood actually circulates in two different loops within this closed system. The two loops are called pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation. In both loops, blood passes through the heart. You can see a simple model of each circulation loop in Figure 18.2. As blood circulates through the body, it travels first through one loop and then the other loop, over and over again. 
Pulmonary  Circulation 	  Pulmonary circulation is the shorter loop of the cardiovascular system. It carries blood between the heart and lungs. Oxygen-poor blood flows from the heart to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood absorbs oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. Then the oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart. 
Systemic  Circulation 	  Systemic circulation is the longer loop of the cardiovascular system. It carries blood between the heart and the rest of the body. Oxygen-rich blood flows from the heart to cells throughout the body. As it passes cells, the blood releases oxygen and absorbs carbon dioxide. Then the oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, a network of blood vessels, and blood. Blood is a liquid tissue. The heart is a pump that keeps blood flowing through the vessels of the system. The main function of the cardiovascular system is transport. It carries substances such as hormones, oxygen, nutrients, and cellular wastes around the body. The cardiovascular system also helps regulate body temperature by controlling blood flow. The cardiovascular system circulates blood through two different loops. Pulmonary circulation is a loop that carries blood between the heart and lungs. Systemic circulation is a loop that carries blood between the heart and the rest of the body. 
Think  Critically 	  The main organs of the cardiovascular system are the heart and blood vessels. Both organs contain valves. Valves also are found in plumbing systems. They can be turned on or off to control the flow of water. Describe the structure and function of the heart. Identify types of blood vessels, and explain how blood vessels help maintain homeostasis. Describe cardiovascular diseases and ways to keep the cardiovascular system healthy. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  artery atherosclerosis atrium (atria, plural) blood vessel capillary cardiovascular disease coronary heart disease heart heart attack valve vein ventricle 
Introduction 	  You can exercise your skeletal muscles, like the bicep muscles in your upper arms, by lifting weights. In between repetitions of the exercise, you let the muscles relax and rest. Unlike your skeletal muscles, your heart muscle cant rest. It must keep contracting and pumping blood continuously throughout your life. Obviously, the heart is a very special organ. 
The  Heart 	  The heart is a muscular organ in the chest. It consists mainly of cardiac muscle tissue. It pumps blood by repeated, rhythmic contractions. This produces the familiar lub-dub sound of each heartbeat. For a good video introduction to the heart and how it works, watch this entertaining Bill Nye video: URL 
Structure of the  Heart 	  The heart has four chambers, or rooms, which you can see in Figure 18.3. Each chamber is an empty space with muscular walls through which blood can flow. The top two chambers of the heart are called the left and right atria (atrium, singular). The atria of the heart receive blood from the body or lungs and pump it into the bottom chambers of the heart. The bottom two chambers of the heart are called the left and right ventricles. The ventricles receive blood from the atria and pump it out of the heart, either to the lungs or to the rest of the body. Flaps of tissue called valves separate the hearts chambers. Valves keep blood flowing in just one direction through the heart. For example, a valve at the bottom of the right atrium opens to let blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Then the valve closes so the blood cant flow back into the right atrium. 
How  Blood  Flows  Through the  Heart 	  Blood flows through the heart in two paths. Trace these two paths in Figure 18.4 as you read about them below. You can also learn about how blood flows through the heart with this rap: URL nbSEyM . Blood flows through the heart along two different paths, shown here by blue and red arrows. Notice where valves open and close to keep the blood moving in just one direction along each path. 
How the  Heart  Beats 	  To move blood through the heart, cardiac muscles must contract in a certain sequence. First the atria must contract, followed quickly by the ventricles contracting. This series of contractions keeps blood moving continuously through the heart. Contractions of cardiac muscles arent under voluntary control. They are controlled by a cluster of special cells within the heart, commonly called the pacemaker. These cells send electrical signals to cardiac muscles so they contract in the correct sequence and with just the right timing. 
Blood  Vessels 	  Blood vessels are long, tube-like organs that consist mainly of muscle, connective, and epithelial tissues. They branch to form a complex network of vessels that run throughout the body. This network transports blood to all the bodys cells. 
Types of  Blood  Vessels 	  There are three major types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. You can see each type in Figure 18.5. You can watch a good video introduction to the three types at this link: URL L_-cwA . Arteries are muscular blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. They have thick walls that can withstand the pressure of blood pumped by the heart. Arteries generally carry oxygen-rich blood. The largest artery is the aorta, which receives blood directly from the heart. It branches to form smaller and smaller arteries throughout the body. The smallest arteries are called arterioles. Veins are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. This blood is no longer under pressure, so veins have thinner walls. To keep the blood moving, many veins have valves that prevent the backflow of blood. Veins generally carry oxygen-poor blood. The smallest veins are called venules. They merge to form larger and larger veins. The largest vein is the inferior vena cava, which carries blood from the lower body directly to the heart. Capillaries are the smallest type of blood vessels. They connect the smallest arteries (arterioles) and veins (venules). Exchange of substances between cells and the blood takes place across the walls of capillaries, which may be only one cell thick. 
Blood  Vessels and  Homeostasis 	  Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either dilating (widening) or constricting (narrowing). This changes the amount of blood flowing to particular organs. For example, dilation of blood vessels in the skin allows more blood to flow to the surface of the body. This helps the body lose excess heat. Constriction of these blood vessels has the opposite effect and helps the body conserve heat. 
Cardiovascular  Health 	  Diseases of the cardiovascular system are common and may be life threatening. A healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of such diseases developing. 
Diseases of the  Cardiovascular  System 	  Diseases of the heart and blood vessels are called cardiovascular diseases. The leading cause of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a condition in which a material called plaque builds up inside arteries. Plaque consists of cell debris, cholesterol, and other substances. As plaque builds up in an artery, the artery narrows, as shown in Figure 18.6. This reduces blood flow through the artery. If plaque blocks coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart, coronary heart disease results. Poor blood flow to the heart may cause chest pain or a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when the blood supply to part of the heart muscle is completely blocked so that cardiac muscle cells die. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in U.S adults. 
Keeping the  Cardiovascular  System  Healthy 	  Many factors influence your risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Some of these factors you cant control. Older age, male gender, and a family history of cardiovascular disease all increase the risk and cant be controlled. However, you can control many other factors. To reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, you can: avoid smoking. get regular physical activity. maintain a healthy percent of body fat. eat a healthy, low-fat diet. get regular checkups to detect and manage problems such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The heart is a muscular organ in the chest that consists mainly of cardiac muscle. It pumps blood through blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions. Blood flows through four chambers of the heart when it beats. Heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals from special cells within the heart called the pacemaker. Blood vessels are long, tube-like organs that form a complex network throughout the body. They transport blood to all the bodys cells. There are three types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. Transfer of substances between the blood and cells takes place across the thin walls of capillaries. Diseases of the cardiovascular system are common and may be life threatening. Examples include atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. A healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of such diseases developing. This includes avoiding smoking, getting regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy percent of body fat. 
Think  Critically 	  Transporting blood is the main job of the heart and blood vessels. Describe blood components, and list functions of the blood. Define blood type, and explain its medical significance. Identify some diseases of the blood.

Introduction 	  The young man in Figure 18.7 is donating blood. By donating blood, he may well be saving lives. Blood transfusions, in which patients receive blood from a donor, save countless lives each year. Thats because blood is such a vital body fluid. 
Structure and  Functions of  Blood 	  Blood is a liquid connective tissue. It circulates throughout the body via blood vessels due to the pumping action of the heart. You couldnt survive without the approximately 4.5 to 5 liters of blood that are constantly being pumped through your blood vessels. 
Blood  Components 	  Blood consists of both liquid and cells. The liquid part of blood is called plasma. Plasma is a watery, golden-yellow fluid that contains many dissolved substances. Substances dissolved in plasma include glucose, proteins, and gases. Plasma also contains blood cells. There are three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. You can see all three types in Figure 18.8. 
Functions of  Blood 	  The main function of blood is transport. Blood in arteries carries oxygen and nutrients to all the bodys cells. Blood in veins carries carbon dioxide and other wastes away from cells to be excreted. Blood also transports the chemical messengers called hormones to cells throughout the body where they are needed to regulate body functions. Blood has several other functions as well. For example, blood: defends the body against infections. repairs body tissues. controls the bodys pH. helps regulate body temperature. Blood cells include disk-shaped red blood cells (left), spherical white blood cells (right), and small cell fragments called platelets (center). 
Blood  Type 	  Red blood cells carry proteins called antigens on their surface. People may vary in the exact antigens their red blood cells carry. The specific proteins are controlled by the genes they inherit from their parents. The particular antigens you inherit determine your blood type. Why does your blood type matter? Blood type is important for medical reasons. A patient cant safely receive a transfusion of blood containing antigens not found in the patients own blood. With foreign antigens, the transfused blood will be rejected by the persons immune system. This causes a reaction in the patients bloodstream, called agglutination. The transfused red blood cells clump together, as shown in Figure 18.9. The clumped cells block blood vessels and cause other life-threatening problems. Normal and agglutinated blood: normal blood smear (left) and agglutinated blood smear (right). There are many sets of antigens that determine different blood types. Two of the best known are the ABO and Rhesus antigens. Both are described below. You can also learn more about them by watching this video: URL be.com/watch?v=L06TJTMVkBo . 
O  Blood  Type 	  ABO blood type is determined by two common antigens, often called antigen A and antigen B. If your red blood cells carry only antigen A, you have blood type A. If your red blood cells carry only antigen B, you have blood type B. If your red blood cells carry both antigen A and antigen B, you have blood type AB. If your red blood cells carry neither antigen A nor antigen B, you have blood type O. 
Rhesus  Blood  Type 	  Another red blood cell antigen determines a persons Rhesus blood type. This blood type depends on a single common antigen, typically referred to as the Rhesus (Rh) antigen. If your red blood cells carry the Rhesus antigen, you have Rhesus-positive blood, or blood type Rh+. If your red blood cells lack the Rhesus antigen, you have Rhesus-negative blood, or blood type Rh-. 
Diseases of the  Blood 	  Some diseases affect mainly the blood or its components. They include anemia, leukemia, hemophilia, and sicklecell disease. 
Anemia 	  Anemia is a disease that occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin (or iron) in the blood so it cant carry adequate oxygen to the cells. There are many possible causes of anemia. One possible cause is excessive blood loss due to an injury or surgery. Not getting enough iron in the diet is another possible cause. 
Leukemia 	  Leukemia is a type of cancer in which bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. The abnormal cells cant do their job of fighting infections. Like most cancers, leukemia is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is the most common cancer in children. 
Hemophilia 	  Hemophilia is a genetic disorder in which blood fails to clot properly because a normal clotting factor in the blood is lacking. In people with hemophilia, even a minor injury can cause a life-threatening loss of blood. Most cases of hemophilia are caused by a recessive gene on the X chromosome. The disorder is expressed much more commonly in males because they have just one X chromosome. 
Sickle- Cell  Disease 	  Sickle-Cell Disease is another genetic disorder of the blood. It is more common in people with African origins because it helps protect against malaria. Sickle-cell disease occurs in people who inherit two copies of the recessive mutant gene for hemoglobin. The abnormal hemoglobin that results causes red blood cells to take on a characteristic sickle shape under certain conditions. You can compare sickle-shaped and normal red blood cells in Figure 18.10. The sickle-shaped cells get stuck in tiny capillaries and block blood flow. This causes serious, painful symptoms.

Lesson  Summary 	  Blood consists of liquid plasma, which contains dissolved substances, and three types of cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The main function of blood is transport. Blood also fights infections, repairs tissues, controls pH, and helps regulate body temperature. Specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells determine blood type. The best-known blood types are ABO and Rhesus (Rh) blood types. Blood type is important in cases of blood transfusion. A patient must receive blood of his or her own blood type to avoid clumping of red blood cells. Many diseases affect the blood or its components. They include anemia, leukemia, hemophilia, and sickle-cell disease. 
Think  Critically 	  The blood picks up oxygen in the lungs and carries it to cells throughout the body. 
S  Respiratory and  Excretory  Systems 	  You dont have to be a musician to know that playing a wind instrument like the trumpet takes a lot of air. Having healthy lungs is necessary to play a trumpet or other wind instrument. The lungs are part of the respiratory system. Define respiration and distinguish it from cellular respiration. Identify structures of the respiratory system. Explain how breathing, gas exchange, and gas transport occur. Describe respiratory system diseases and how to keep the respiratory system healthy. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  asthma emphysema lung pneumonia respiration respiratory system trachea 
Introduction 	  All the cells of your body need oxygen, which they get from red blood cells. Red blood cells, in turn, get oxygen in the lungs. The lungs are the main organs of the respiratory system. The respiratory system is the body system that exchanges gases with the outside air. It brings air containing oxygen into the body for the cells. It also releases carbon dioxide from the cells into the air. What Is Respiration? The bodys exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the air is called respiration. Respiration actually consists of two stages. In one stage, air is taken into the body and carbon dioxide is released to the outside air. In the other stage, oxygen is delivered to all the cells of the body and carbon dioxide is carried away from the cells. Another kind of respiration takes place within body cells. This kind of respiration is called cellular respiration. Its the process in which cells obtain energy by burning glucose. Both types of respiration are connected. Cellular respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Respiration by the respiratory system supplies the oxygen needed for cellular respiration. It also removes the carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration. 
Structures of the  Respiratory  System 	  You can see the main structures of the respiratory system in Figure 19.1. They include the nose, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm. Use the figure to trace how air moves through the respiratory system when you read about it below. You can also use this interactive to explore the respiratory system and see how it functions: URL aphic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-body/lungs-article/ 
Steps in  Respiration 	  Take in a big breath of air through your nose. As you breathe in, you may feel the air pass down through your throat and notice your chest expand. Now breathe out and observe the opposite events occurring. Breathing in and out may seem like simple actions, but they are just part of the complex process of respiration. Respiration actually occurs in four steps: 
Breathing 	  Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. You can see it in Figure 19.2. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm contracts. This increases the size of the chest, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. The difference in air pressure between the lungs and outside air causes air to rush into the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest, which increases air pressure inside the lungs. The difference in air pressure between the lungs and outside air causes air to rush out of the lungs. 
How the diaphragm controls breathing 	  When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened so it wont harm delicate tissues of the lungs. Next, air passes through the pharynx, a passageway that is shared with the digestive system. From the pharynx, the air passes next through the larynx, or voice box. After the larynx, air moves into the trachea, or wind pipe. This is a long tube that leads down to the lungs in the chest. In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi (bronchus, singular). These passages are covered with mucus and tiny hairs called cilia. The mucus traps any remaining particles in the air. The cilia move and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body. Air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli (alveolus, singular). 
Gas  Exchange  Between the  Air and  Blood 	  The alveoli in the lungs are where gas exchange between the air and blood takes place. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of capillaries. When you inhale, air in the alveoli has a greater concentration of oxygen than does blood in the capillaries. The difference in oxygen concentration causes oxygen to diffuse from the air into the blood. You can see how this occurs in Figure 19.3. Unlike oxygen, carbon dioxide is more concentrated in the blood in the capillaries surrounding the alveoli than it is in the air inside the alveoli. Therefore, carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction. It moves out of the blood and into the air. 
Gas  Transport in the  Blood 	  After the blood in the capillaries in the lungs picks up oxygen, it leaves the lungs and travels to the heart. The heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood into arteries, which carry it throughout the body. The blood passes eventually into capillaries that supply body cells. 
Gas  Exchange  Between the  Blood and  Cells 	  The cells of the body have a lower concentration of oxygen that does blood in the capillaries that supply body cells. Therefore, oxygen diffuses from the blood into the cells. Carbon dioxide, which cells produce in cellular respiration, is more concentrated in the cells. Therefore, carbon dioxide diffuses out of the cells and into the blood. The carbon dioxide travels in capillaries to veins and then to the heart. The heart pumps the blood to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide diffuses into the alveoli. It passes out of the body during exhalation. This brings the process of respiration full circle. 
Respiratory  System  Health 	  No doubt youve had the common cold. When you did, you probably had respiratory system symptoms. For example, you may have had a stuffy nose that made it hard to breathe. While you may feel miserable when you have a cold, it is generally a relatively mild disease. Many other respiratory system diseases are more serious. 
Diseases of the  Respiratory  System 	  Common diseases of the respiratory system include asthma, pneumonia, and emphysema. All of them are diseases of the lungs. You can see some of the changes in the lungs that occur in each of these diseases in Figure 19.4. Asthma is a disease in which bronchioles in the lungs periodically swell and fill with mucus. Symptoms of asthma may include difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. An asthma attack may be triggered by allergies, strenuous exercise, stress, or another respiratory illness such as a cold. Pneumonia is a disease in which some of the alveoli of the lungs fill with fluid so they can no longer exchange gas. Symptoms of pneumonia typically include coughing, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and fatigue. Pneumonia may be caused by an infection or an injury to the lungs. Emphysema is a disease in which the walls of the alveoli break down so less gas can be exchanged by the lungs. The main symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath. The damage to the alveoli is usually caused by smoking and is permanent. Changes in the lungs due to asthma (top), pneumonia (bottom left), and emphysema (right) 
Keeping  Your  Respiratory  System  Healthy 	  The main way to keep your respiratory system healthy is to avoid smoking or breathing in the smoke of others. Smoking causes, or makes you more susceptible to, many respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer. Other steps you can take to keep your respiratory system healthy are listed below. Eat well, get enough sleep, and be active every day. These healthy lifestyle choices will help keep your immune system healthy so it can fight off respiratory infections and other diseases. Wash your hands often. This will reduce your risk of picking up viruses or bacteria that could make you sick with colds or other respiratory infections. Avoid contact with other people when they are sick and stay home when you are sick. These steps will help reduce the spread of infectious diseases. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The respiratory system is the body system that exchanges gases with the outside air. It brings air containing oxygen into the body for the cells. It also releases carbon dioxide from the cells into the air. This exchange of gases is called respiration. Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. It depends on the muscle called the diaphragm. The lungs are the main organs of the respiratory system. This is where gases are exchanged between the air and the blood. Gases are also transported by the blood and exchanged between the blood and all the cells of the body. Common diseases of the respiratory system include asthma, pneumonia, and emphysema. All of them are diseases of the lungs. The main way to keep your respiratory system healthy is to avoid smoking or breathing in the smoke of others. 
Think  Critically 	  The lungs release carbon dioxide into the air. Carbon dioxide is a gaseous waste product of the cells. Wastes are excreted from the body by the excretory system. Therefore, the lungs are organs of the excretory system as well as the respiratory system. Define excretion, and identify organs of the excretory system. Outline the structures and functions of the urinary system. Explain how the kidneys filter blood and produce urine. Describe how the kidneys help maintain homeostasis. Identify kidney diseases and how they are treated. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  excretion excretory system kidney kidney failure kidney stone nephron ureter urethra urinary bladder urinary system urinary tract infection urination urine 
Introduction 	  The boy in Figure 19.5 is working out on a hot day. Hes losing a lot of water in sweat. To maintain homeostasis, his body can balance the water lost in sweat by excreting less water in urine. The amount of water lost in urine is controlled by the kidneys. The kidneys are organs of excretion. 
Excretion 	  Excretion is any process in which excess water or wastes are removed from the body. Excretion is the job of the excretory system. Besides the kidneys, other organs of excretion include the large intestine, liver, skin and lungs. The large intestine eliminates food wastes that remain after digestion takes place. The liver removes excess amino acids and toxins from the blood. Water lost in sweat must be balanced in some way for the body to maintain homeostasis. Sweat glands in the skin excrete excess water and salts in sweat. The lungs exhale carbon dioxide and also excess water as water vapor. Each of the above organs of excretion is also part of another body system. For example, the large intestine and liver are part of the digestive system, and the lungs are part of the respiratory system. The kidneys are the main organs of excretion. They are part of the urinary system. 
The  Urinary  System 	  The urinary system is shown in Figure 19.6. It includes two kidneys, two ureters, the urinary bladder, and the urethra. The main function of the urinary system is to filter waste products and excess water from the blood and excrete them from the body as urine. For a visual presentation on the urinary system and how it works, watch this video: URL . 
The  Kidneys 	  The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs at each side of the body just above the waist. You can see a diagram of a kidney in Figure 19.7. The function of the kidneys is to filter blood and form urine. Tiny structures in the kidneys, called nephrons, perform this function. Each kidney contains more than a million nephrons. 
Formation of  Urine 	  Blood with wastes enters each kidney through an artery, which branches into many capillaries. After passing through capillaries and being filtered, the clean blood leaves the kidney through a vein. The part of each nephron called the glomerulus is where blood in the capillaries is filtered. Excess water and wastes are filtered out of the blood. The tubule of the nephron collects these substances. Some of the water is reabsorbed. The remaining fluid is urine. 
Excretion of  Urine 	  From the kidneys, urine enters the ureters. These are two muscular tubes that carry urine to the urinary bladder. Contractions of the muscles of the ureters move the urine along by peristalsis. The urinary bladder is a sac-like organ that stores urine. When the bladder is about half full, a sphincter relaxes to let urine flow out of the bladder and into the urethra. The urethra is a muscular tube that carries urine out of the body through another sphincter. The process of urine leaving the body is called urination. The second sphincter and the process of urination are normally under conscious control. 
How the  Kidneys  Maintain  Homeostasis 	  The kidneys help the body maintain homeostasis in several ways. They filter all the blood in the body many times each day and produce urine. They control the amount of water and dissolved substances in the blood by excreting more or less of them in urine. The kidneys also secrete hormones that help maintain homeostasis. For example, they produce a hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells when more are needed. They also secrete a hormone that regulates blood pressure and keeps it in a normal range. 
Kidney  Health and  Disease 	  You need only one kidney to live a normal, healthy life. A single kidney can do all the work of filtering the blood and maintaining homeostasis. However, at least one kidney must function properly to maintain life. Diseases that threaten the health and functioning of the kidneys include kidney stones, infections, and diabetes. You can learn more about kidney diseases in this video: URL . Kidney stones are mineral crystals that form in urine inside a kidney, as shown in Figure 19.8. The stones may be extremely painful. If a kidney stone blocks a ureter, it must be removed so urine can leave the kidney and be excreted. Bacterial infections of urinary organs, especially the urinary bladder, are common. They are called urinary tract infections. Generally, they can be cured with antibiotic drugs. However, if they arent treated, they can lead to more serious infections and damage to the kidneys. Untreated diabetes may damage capillaries in the kidneys so the nephrons can no longer filter blood. This is called kidney failure. The only cure for kidney failure is to receive a healthy transplanted kidney from a donor. Until that happens, a patient with kidney failure can be kept alive by artificially filtering the blood through a machine. This is called hemodialysis. You can see how it works in Figure 19.9. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Excretion is any process in which excess water or wastes are removed from the body. Excretion is the job of the excretory system. Organs of excretion include the large intestine, liver, skin, lungs, and kidneys. Hemodialysis filters blood through a machine in patients with kidney failure. The urinary system filters wastes and excess water from the blood, forms urine, and excretes urine from the body. It includes two kidneys, two ureters, the urinary bladder, and the urethra. Nephrons are tiny structures in the kidneys that filter blood and form urine. Diseases of the urinary system include kidney stones and urinary tract infections. Untreated diabetes may cause kidney failure and the need for hemodialysis or a kidney transplant. 
Think  Critically 	  Although the process of urination is under conscious control, the other processes of the urinary system are not. You cant control the work of your kidneys, for example, but this doesnt mean that they operate without any control. 
Chapter  Outline 	  Hakeem is a talented skater, but he almost fell off this railing when his feet got tangled together. He thought he would fall, but in the blink of an eye, he used his muscles to shift his weight and keep his balance. His heart was pounding, but at least he didnt fall and get hurt. How was Hakeem able to react so quickly? He can thank his nervous system for that. Define the nervous system, and state its functions. Describe neurons, and explain how nerve impulses travel. Give an overview of the central nervous system. Outline the divisions of the peripheral nervous system. Describe nervous system diseases and injuries. Identify how drugs may affect the nervous system. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  brain brain stem central nervous system cerebellum  cerebrum concussion drug abuse drug addiction nerve nerve impulse nervous system neuron paralysis peripheral nervous system nervous system spinal cord synapse 
Introduction 	  The nervous system is a complex network of nervous tissue that carries electrical messages. It includes the brain, spinal cord, and many nerves that run throughout the body. You can see these components of the nervous system in Figure 20.1. For a short visual introduction to the nervous system, watch this animated video: URL be.com/watch?v=dah-4mtAnsQ . 
Functions of the  Nervous  System 	  Controlling muscles and maintaining balance are just two of the functions of the human nervous system. What else does the nervous system do? It senses the surrounding environment with sense organs that include the eyes and ears. It senses the bodys own internal environment, including its temperature. It controls internal body systems to make sure the body maintains homeostasis. It prepares the body to fight or flee in the case of an emergency. It allows thinking, learning, memory, and language. Remember Hakeem the skater from the first page of the chapter? When Hakeem started to fall off the railing, his nervous system sensed that he was losing his balance. It responded by sending messages to his muscles. Some muscles contracted while other relaxed. As a result, Hakeem gained his balance again. How did his nervous system accomplish all of this in just a split second? You need to know how the nervous system transmits messages to answer that question. 
Neurons and  Nerve  Impulses 	  The nervous system is made up of nerves. A nerve is a bundle of nerve cells. A nerve cell that carries messages is called a neuron. The messages carried by neurons are called nerve impulses. A nerve impulse can travel very quickly because it is an electrical signal. Think about flipping on a light switch when you enter a room. When you flip the switch, electricity flows to the light through wires inside the walls. The electricity may have to travel many meters to reach the light. Nonetheless, the light still comes on as soon as you flip the switch. Nerve impulses travel just as quickly through the network of nerves inside the body. 
Structure of a  Neuron 	  The structure of a neuron suits it for its function of transmitting nerve impulses. You can see what a neuron looks like in Figure 20.2. It has a special shape that lets it pass electrical signals to and from other cells. A neuron has three main parts: cell body, dendrites, and axon. 
Types of  Neurons 	  There are three basic types of neurons: sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. All three types must work together to receive and respond to information. 
The  Synapse 	  The nerve endings of an axon dont actually touch the dendrites of other neurons. The messages must cross a tiny gap between the two neurons, called the synapse. Chemicals called neurotransmitters carry the message across this gap. When a nerve impulse arrives at the end of an axon, neurotransmitters are released. They travel across the synaptic gap to a dendrite of another neuron. The neurotransmitters bind to the membrane of the dendrite, triggering a nerve impulse in the next neuron. You can see how this works in Figure 20.3 and in this animation: URL atchknowlearn.org/Video.aspx?VideoID=7385&CategoryID=1505 . This diagram shows a synapse between neurons. When a nerve impulse arrives at the end of the axon, neurotransmitters are released and travel to the dendrite of another neuron, carrying the nerve impulse from one neuron to the next. The transmission of nerve impulses between neurons is like the passing of a baton between runners in a relay race. After the first runner races, she passes the baton to the second runner. Then the second runner takes over. Instead of a baton, a neuron passes neurotransmitters to the next neuron. 
Central  Nervous  System 	  The nervous system has two main parts, called the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is described later in this lesson. The central nervous system is shown in Figure 20.4. It includes the brain and spinal cord. 
The  Amazing  Human  Brain 	  The human brain is an amazing organ. It is the most complex organ in the human body. By adulthood, the brain weighs about 3 pounds and consists of billions of neurons. All those cells need a lot of energy. In fact, the adult brain uses almost a quarter of the total energy used by the body! The brain serves as the control center of the nervous system and the body as a whole. It lets us understand what we see, hear, or sense in other ways. It allows us to learn, think, remember, and use language. It controls all the organs and muscles in our body. 
Parts of the  Brain 	  The brain consists of three major parts, called the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem. You can see these three parts of the brain in Figure 20.5. You can use this interactive animation to explore these parts of the brain: URL cience.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-body/brain-article/ 
Hemispheres and  Lobes of the  Cerebrum 	  The cerebrum is divided down the middle from the front to the back of the head. The two halves of the cerebrum are called the right and left hemispheres. The two hemispheres are very similar but not identical. They are connected to each other by a thick bundle of axons deep within the brain. These axons allow the two hemispheres to communicate with each other. Did you know that the right hemisphere of the cerebrum controls the left side of the body, and vice versa? This can happen because of the connections between the two hemispheres. Each hemisphere is further divided into four parts, called lobes, as you can see in Figure 20.6. Each lobe has different functions. One function of each lobe is listed in the figure. The four lobes of the left hemisphere are color coded in this illustration. 
The  Spinal  Cord 	  The spinal cord is a long, tube-shaped bundle of neurons. It runs from the brain stem to the lower back. The main job of the spinal cord is to carry nerve impulses back and forth between the body and brain. The spinal cord is like a two-way road. Messages about the body, both inside and out, pass through the spinal cord to the brain. Messages from the brain pass in the other direction through the spinal cord to tell the body what to do. 
Peripheral  Nervous  System 	  All the other nervous tissues in the body are part of the peripheral nervous system. If you look again at Figure 20.1, you can see the major nerves of the peripheral nervous system. They include nerves that run through virtually every part of the body, both inside and out, except for the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system has two main divisions: the sensory division and the motor division. The divisions carry messages in opposite directions. Figure 20.7 shows these divisions of the peripheral nervous system. 
Sensory  Division 	  The sensory division of the peripheral nervous system carries messages from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system. For example, it carries messages about images from the eyes to the brain. Once the messages reach the brain, the brain interprets the information. The central nervous system interprets messages from sense organs and internal organs and the motor division sends messages to internal organs, glands, and muscles. 
Motor  Division 	  The motor division of the peripheral nervous system carries messages from the central nervous system to muscles, internal organs, and glands throughout the body. The brain sends commands to these tissues, telling them how to respond. As you can see in Figure 20.7, the motor division is divided into additional parts. The autonomic part of the motor division controls involuntary responses. It sends messages to organs and glands. These messages control the body both during emergencies (sympathetic division) and during nonemergencies (parasympathetic division). The somatic part of the motor division controls voluntary responses. It sends messages to the skeletal muscles for movements that are under conscious control. 
Nervous  System  Diseases and  Injuries 	  Nervous system problems include diseases and injuries. Most nervous system diseases cant be prevented. But you can take steps to decrease your risk of nervous system injuries. 
Infections of the  Nervous  System 	  Bacteria and viruses can infect the brain or spinal cord. An infection of the brain is called encephalitis. An infection of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord is called meningitis. A vaccine is available to prevent meningitis caused by viruses (see Figure 20.8). Encephalitis and meningitis arent very common, but they can be extremely serious. They may cause swelling of the brain, which can be fatal. Thats why its important to know the symptoms of these diseases. Both encephalitis and meningitis typically cause a severe headache and a fever. Meningitis also causes a stiff neck. Both require emergency medical treatment. Children as young as 2 years of age can be vaccinated against viral meningitis. 
Epilepsy 	  Epilepsy is a disease in which seizures occur. A seizure is a period of lost consciousness that may include violent muscle contractions. It is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Epilepsy may result from an infection, injury, or tumor. In many cases, however, the cause cant be identified. There is no known cure for epilepsy, but the seizures often can be prevented with medicine. Sometimes children with epilepsy outgrow it by adulthood. 
Stroke 	  A stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to part of the brain. Brain cells die quickly when their oxygen supply is cut off. Therefore, a stroke may cause permanent loss of normal mental functions. Many stroke patients suffer some degree of paralysis, or loss of the ability to feel or move certain parts of the body. If medical treatment is given very soon after a stroke occurs, some of the damage may be reversed. Strokes occur mainly in older adults. 
Alzheimers  Disease 	  Alzheimers disease is another disease that occurs mainly in older adults. In Alzheimers disease, a person gradually loses most normal mental functions. The patient typically suffers from increasing memory loss, confusion, and mood swings. The cause of Alzheimers isnt known for certain, but it appears to be associated with certain abnormal changes in the brain. There is no known cure for this devastating disease, but medicines may be able to slow its progression. 
Injuries to the  Brain and  Spinal  Cord 	  The brain and spinal cord are protected within bones of the skeletal system, but injuries to these organs still occur. With mild injuries, there may be no lasting effects. With severe injuries, there may be permanent disability or even death. Brain and spinal cord injuries most commonly occur because of car crashes or athletic activities. Fortunately, many injuries can be prevented by wearing seat belts and safety helmets (see Figure 20.9). Avoiding unnecessary risks, such as doing stunts on a bike or diving into shallow water, can also reduce the chances of brain and spinal cord injuries. Wearing the right type of helmet can reduce the risk of a brain injury when riding a bike. The most common type of brain injury is a concussion. This is a bruise on the surface of the brain. It may cause temporary symptoms such as headache and confusion. Most concussions heal on their own in a few days or weeks. However, repeated concussions can lead to permanent changes in the brain. More serious brain injuries also often cause permanent brain damage. Spinal cord injuries may cause paralysis. Some people recover from spinal cord injuries. However, many people remain paralyzed for life. This happens when the spinal cord can no longer transmit nerve impulses between the body and brain. 
Drugs and the  Nervous  System 	  A drug is any chemical substance that affects the body or brain. Some drugs are medicines. Although these drugs are helpful when used properly, they can be misused like any other drug. Drugs that arent medicines include both legal and illegal drugs. Both can do harm. 
Psychoactive  Drugs 	  Many drugs affect the brain and influence how a person feels, thinks, or acts. Such drugs are called psychoactive drugs. They include legal drugs such as caffeine and alcohol, as well as illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin. They also include certain medicines, such as antidepressant drugs and medical marijuana. Some psychoactive drugs, such as caffeine, stimulate the central nervous system. They may make the user feel more alert. Some psychoactive drugs, such as alcohol, depress the central nervous system. They may make the user feel more relaxed. Still other psychoactive drugs, such as marijuana, are hallucinogenic drugs. They may make the user have altered sensations, perceptions, or thoughts. 
Drug  Abuse and  Drug  Addiction 	  Psychoactive drugs may bring about changes in mood that users find desirable. These drugs may be abused. Drug abuse is use of a drug without the advice of a medical professional and for reasons not originally intended. Continued use of a psychoactive drug may lead to drug addiction. This occurs when a drug user is unable to stop using the drug. Over time, a drug user may need more of the drug to get the desired effect. This can lead to drug overdose and death. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The nervous system is a complex network of nervous tissue that carries electrical messages throughout the body. Its functions include controlling muscles, maintaining balance, sensing internal and external environments, controlling body systems to maintain homeostasis, preparing the body for emergencies, and allowing higher mental functions such as thinking. The nervous system is made up of bundles of nerve cells called neurons. Messages carried by neurons are called nerve impulses. A nerve impulse can travel very quickly because it is an electrical signal. Neurotransmitters carry nerve impulses between neurons at synapses. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. The brain serves as the control center of the nervous system and the body as a whole. It consists of three major parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem. The spinal cord carries nerve impulses back and forth between the body and brain. All other nervous tissue in the body makes up the peripheral nervous system, which has two major divisions. The sensory division carries messages from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system. The motor division carries messages from the central nervous system to muscles, internal organs, and glands throughout the body. The motor division is further divided into parts that control involuntary or voluntary responses. Diseases of the nervous system include infections, epilepsy, strokes, and Alzheimers disease. Injuries include concussions and spinal cord damage that may cause paralysis. Most nervous system diseases cant be prevented, but many nervous system injuries can be prevented by following safe practices. Psychoactive drugs affect the brain and influence how a person feels, thinks, or acts. They include medicines and other legal drugs as well as illegal drugs. They may stimulate or depress the central nervous system. Abuse of such drugs may lead to drug addiction, overdose, and death.

Introduction 	  The girl in Figure 20.10 is keeping her eyes on the volleyball in order to hit it at just right moment. Playing volleyball and most other sports depends on the ability to see. 
Human  Vision 	  The ability to see is called vision. It depends on both the eyes and the brain. The eyes sense light and form images. The brain interprets the images formed by the eyes and tells us what we are seeing. For a fascinating account of how the brain helps us see, watch this short video: URL . 
Seeing in 3- D and  Color 	  Did you ever use 3-D glasses to watch a movie, like the teens in Figure 20.11? If you did, then you know that the glasses make images on the flat screen seem more realistic by giving them depth. The images seem to jump right out of the screen toward you. Unlike many other animals, human beings and other primates normally see the world around them in three dimensions. Thats because we have two eyes that face the same direction but are a few inches apart. Both eyes focus on the same object at the same time but from slightly different angles. The brain uses the different images from the two eyes to determine the distance to the object. Human beings and other primates also have the ability to see in color. We have special cells inside our eyes that can distinguish different wavelengths of visible light. Visible light is light in the range of wavelengths that the human eye can sense. The exact wavelength of visible light determines its color. 
How the  Eye  Works 	  The function of the eye is to focus light and form images. We see some objects, such as stars and light bulbs, because they give off their own light. However, we see most objects because they reflect light from another source such as the sun. We form images of the objects when some of the reflected light enters our eyes. Look at the parts of the eye in Figure 20.12. Follow the path of light through the eye as you read about it below. 
Vision  Problems 	  You probably know people who need eyeglasses or contact lenses to see clearly. Maybe you need them yourself. Lenses are used to correct vision problems. Two of the most common vision problems in young people are myopia and hyperopia. You can compare myopia and hyperopia in Figure 20.13. To learn about astigmatism, another common vision problem, watch this very short video: URL . Myopia is commonly called nearsightedness. People with myopia can see nearby objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia occurs when images focus in front of the retina because the eyeball is too long. This vision problem can be corrected with concave lenses, which curve inward. The lenses focus images correctly on the retina. Hyperopia is commonly called farsightedness. People with hyperopia can see distant objects clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. Hyperopia occurs when images focus in back of the retina because the eyeball is too short. This vision problem can be corrected with convex lenses, which curve outward. The lenses focus images correctly on the retina. 
Other  Human  Senses 	  Vision is just one of several human senses. Other human senses include hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Imagine shopping at the fruit market in Figure 20.14. It would stimulate all of these senses. You would hear the noisy bustle of the market. You could feel the smooth skin of the fruit. If you tried a sample, you could smell the fruity aroma and taste its sweet flavor. This outdoor fruit market stimulates all the senses sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. 
Hearing and  Balance 	  What do listening to music and riding a bike have in common? Both activities depend on the ears. The ears are organs that sense sound. They also sense the position of the body and help maintain balance. Hearing is the ability to sense sound. Sound travels through the air in waves. Suppose a car horn blows in the distance. Sound waves spread through the air from the horn. Some of the sound waves enter your ears and cause vibrations. The vibrations trigger nerve impulses that travel to the brain through the auditory nerve. You can learn how this happens in Figure 20.15. The brain then interprets the impulses and tells you what you are hearing. To find out how the brain determines where a sound is coming from, watch this amusing video: URL atch?v=BaOCuvvX7Xg . The parts of the ears involved in balance are the semicircular canals. These are the curved structures above the cochlea in the inner ear in Figure 20.15. Like the cochlea, the semicircular canals contain liquid and are lined with tiny hair cells. As the head changes position, the liquid moves. This causes the hair cells to bend. The bending of the hair cells triggers nerve impulses that travel to the cerebellum in the brain. The cerebellum uses the information to maintain balance. 
Touch 	  Touch is the ability to sense pain, pressure, or temperature. Nerve cells that sense touch are found mainly in the skin. The skin on the palms, soles, face, and lips has the most neurons. Neurons that sense pain are also found inside the body inside the body in the tongue, joints, muscles, and other organs. Suppose you wanted to test the temperature of bath water before getting into the tub. You might stick one toe in the water. Neurons in the skin on your toe would sense the temperature of the water and send a message about it to the brain through the spinal cord. The brain would process the information. It might decide that the water is too hot and send a message to your muscles to pull your toe out of the water. 
Taste and  Smell 	  The sense of taste is controlled by sensory neurons on the tongue. They are grouped in bundles called taste buds. You can see taste buds on the tongue in Figure 20.16. Taste neurons sense chemicals in food. They can detect five different tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami, which is a meaty taste. When taste neurons sense chemicals, they send messages to the brain about them. The brain then decides what you are tasting. The tiny red bumps on this tongue are taste buds. The sense of smell also involves sensory neurons that sense chemicals. These neurons are found in the nose, and they sense chemicals in the air. Unlike taste neurons, smell neurons can detect thousands of different odors. Your sense of smell plays a big role in your sense of taste. You can use your sense of taste alone to learn that a food is sweet. However, you have to use your sense of smell as well to learn that the food tastes like apple pie. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Vision is the ability to see. Humans and other primates have 3-D and color vision. The eyes focus light, form images, and send nerve impulses to the brain. The brain interprets the images and tells us what we are seeing. Vision problems include myopia and hyperopia. Both can be corrected with lenses. Other human senses include hearing, balance, touch, taste, and smell. The ears sense sound and allow us to hear. They also sense body position to help maintain balance. Touch neurons, mainly in the skin, sense pain, pressure, and temperature. Taste neurons on the tongue sense chemicals in food. Odor neurons in the nose sense chemicals in the air. 
Think  Critically 	  Sensory organs such as the eyes and ears are part of the nervous system. The nervous system controls all other body systems. However, the nervous system doesnt work alone. The endocrine system also helps to regulate the body and its functions. Describe the endocrine system and its hormones. Identify several glands of the endocrine system. Explain how endocrine hormones work. Describe two endocrine system diseases. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  adrenal gland endocrine gland endocrine system gonad hormone hypothalamus pituitary gland target cell thyroid gland 
Introduction 	  The nervous system couldnt control the rest of the body without the help of the endocrine system. How do these two systems work together? Read on to find out. What Is the Endocrine System? The endocrine system is a system of glands that release chemical messenger molecules into the blood stream. The messenger molecules are called hormones. Hormones act slowly compared with the rapid transmission of electrical impulses of the nervous system. Endocrine hormones must travel through the bloodstream to the cells they control, and this takes time. On the other hand, because endocrine hormones are released into the bloodstream, they travel to cells everywhere in the body. For a good visual introduction to the endocrine system, watch this short video: http ://URL . 
Glands of the  Endocrine  System 	  An endocrine gland is a gland that secretes hormones into the bloodstream for transport around the body (instead of secreting hormones locally, like sweat glands in the skin). Major glands of the endocrine system are shown in Figure 20.17. The glands are the same in males and females except for the ovaries and testes. 
Hypothalamus 	  The hypothalamus is actually part of the brain, but it also secretes hormones. Some of its hormones go directly to the pituitary gland in the endocrine system. These hypothalamus hormones tell the pituitary to either secrete or stop secreting its hormones. In this way, the hypothalamus provides a link between the nervous and endocrine systems. The hypothalamus also produces hormones that directly regulate body processes. For example, it produces antidiuretic hormone. This hormone travels to the kidneys and stimulates them to conserve water by producing more concentrated urine. 
Pituitary  Gland 	  The pea-sized pituitary gland is just below the hypothalamus and attached directly to it. The pituitary receives hormones from the hypothalamus. It also secretes its own hormones. Most pituitary hormones control other endocrine glands. Thats why the pituitary gland is called the master gland of the endocrine system. Table 20.1 lists several pituitary hormones and what they do. 
Target  Glands/ Cells 	  Effects(s) 
Adrenocorticotropic	hormone 	  (ACTH) adrenal glands Stimulates the cortex (outer layer) of the adrenal glands to secrete their hormones 
Thyroid-stimulating	hormone 	  (TSH) thyroid gland 
Stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete its hormones 	  Growth hormone (GH) body cells 
Follicle-stimulating	hormone 	  (FSH) ovaries or testes Stimulates the ovaries to develop mature eggs; stimulates the testes to produce sperm Luteinizing hormone (LH) ovaries or testes Stimulates the ovaries or testes to secrete sex hormones; stimulates the ovaries to release eggs Prolactin (PRL) mammary glands 
Other  Endocrine  Glands 	  There are several other endocrine glands. Find them in Figure 20.17 as you read about them below. The thyroid gland is a relatively large gland in the neck. Hormones secreted by the thyroid gland include thyroxin. Thyroxin increases the rate of metabolism in cells throughout the body. The pancreas is a large gland located near the stomach. Hormones secreted by the pancreas include insulin. Insulin helps cells absorb glucose from the blood. It also stimulates the liver to take up and store excess glucose. The two adrenal glands are glands located just above the kidneys. Each adrenal gland has an outer layer (cortex) and inner layer (medulla) that secrete different hormones. The hormone adrenaline is secreted by the inner layer. It prepares the body to respond to emergencies. For example, it increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. The gonads are glands that secrete sex hormones. Male gonads are called testes. They secrete the male sex hormone testosterone. The female gonads are called ovaries. They secrete the female sex hormone estrogen. Sex hormones stimulate the changes of puberty. They also control the production of sperm or eggs by the gonads. 
How  Endocrine  Hormones  Work 	  Endocrine hormones travel throughout the body in the blood. However, each endocrine hormone affects only certain cells, called target cells. 
Hormones and  Target  Cells 	  A target cell is the type of cell on which a given endocrine hormone has an effect. A target cell is affected by a given hormone because it has proteins on its surface to which the hormone can bind. When the hormone binds to target cell proteins, it causes changes inside the cell. For example, binding of the hormone might cause the release of enzymes inside the cell. The enzymes then influence cell processes. 
Feedback  Loops 	  Endocrine hormones control many cell activities, so they are very important for homeostasis. But what controls the hormones? Most endocrine hormones are controlled by feedback loops. In a feedback loop, the hormone produced by a gland feeds back to control its own production by the gland. A feedback loop can be negative or positive. Most endocrine hormones are controlled by negative feedback loops. .Negative feedback occurs when rising levels of a hormone feed back to decrease secretion of the hormone or when falling levels of the hormone feed back to increase its secretion. You can see an example of a negative feedback loop in Figure 20.18. It shows how levels of thyroid hormones regulate the thyroid gland. This loop involves the hypothalamus and pituitary gland as well as the thyroid gland. Low levels of thyroid hormones in the blood cause the release of hormones by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. These hormones stimulate the thyroid gland to secrete more hormones. The opposite happens with high levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland stop releasing hormones that stimulate the thyroid. The thyroid gland is controlled by a negative feedback loop that includes the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. 
Endocrine  System  Diseases 	  Diseases of the endocrine system are fairly common. An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough hormone by an endocrine gland. This may happen because the gland develops an abnormal lump of cells called a tumor. For example, a tumor of the pituitary gland can cause secretion of too much growth hormone. If this occurs in a child, it may result in very rapid growth and unusual tallness by adulthood. This is called gigantism. Type 1 diabetes is another endocrine system disease. In this disease, the bodys own immune system attacks insulinsecreting cells of the pancreas. As a result, not enough insulin is secreted to maintain normal levels of glucose in the blood. Patients with type 1 diabetes must regularly check the level of glucose in their blood. When it gets too high, they must give themselves an injection of insulin to bring it under control. You can learn more about glucose, insulin, and type 1 diabetes by watching this video: URL . 
Lesson  Summary 	  The endocrine system is a system of glands that release chemical messenger molecules called hormones into the blood stream. Endocrine hormones travel more slowly than nerve impulses, but can reach cells anywhere in the body. The hypothalamus is part of the brain and also secretes hormones, thus connecting the nervous and endocrine systems. The pituitary gland is the master gland of the endocrine system and controls other endocrine glands. Endocrine glands also include the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, pancreas, and gonads. Each endocrine hormone affects only certain cells, called target cells. A target cell has proteins on its surface to which a given hormone can bind. Most endocrine hormones are controlled by negative feedback loops. Negative feedback occurs when low levels of a hormone feed back to increase its secretionand vice versa. Endocrine system diseases are fairly common. An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough hormone by an endocrine hormone. Examples of endocrine diseases are gigantism and Type 1 diabetes.

Chapter  Outline 	  This worm, called schistosoma, is actually very tiny. Its been greatly enlarged in this photo. Its a human parasite that spreads in contaminated water. It can penetrate pores in the skin of people who wade or swim in the water. Worldwide, infections with the schistosoma parasite are common. This poses a serious problem, because the parasite makes people very sick. Like this parasitic worm, many other organisms can make us sick if they manage to enter our body. Fortunately for us, the body can defend itself from most such invaders. In this chapter, youll learn how. Identify pathogens that cause infectious diseases, and explain how pathogens spread. List ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  infectious disease 
Introduction 	  The student sitting next to you on the bus is coughing and sneezing. He says he has a cold. You feel fine, but a day or two later, you come down with a cold too. Diseases such as the common cold are contagious. You can catch them from someone else. Contagious diseases are also called infectious diseases. What Causes Infectious Diseases? An infectious disease is a disease that is caused by a pathogen. A pathogen is an organism or virus that causes disease in another living thing. Pathogens are commonly called germs. Watch this dramatic video for an historic perspective on infectious diseases and their causes: URL . 
Types of  Pathogens 	  There are several types of pathogens that cause diseases in human beings. They include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The different types are described in Table 21.1. The table also lists several diseases caused by each type of pathogen. Many infectious diseases caused by these pathogens can be cured with medicines. For example, antibiotic drugs can cure most diseases caused by bacteria. 
How  Pathogens  Spread 	  Different pathogens spread in different ways. Some are easy to catch. Others are much less contagious. Some pathogens spread through food or water. When harmful bacteria contaminate food, they cause foodborne illness, commonly called food poisoning. An example of a pathogen that spreads through water is the protozoan named Giardia lamblia, described in Table 21.1. It causes a disease called giardiasis. Some pathogens spread through sexual contact. In the U.S., the pathogen most commonly spread this way is HPV, or human papillomavirus. It may cause genital warts and certain types of cancer. A vaccine can prevent the spread of this pathogen. Many pathogens spread by droplets in the air. Droplets are released when a person coughs or sneezes, as you can see in Figure 21.2. The droplets may be loaded with pathogens. Other people may get sick if they breathe in the pathogens on the droplets. Viruses that cause colds and flu can spread this way. Other pathogens spread when they are deposited on objects or surfaces. The fungus that causes athletes food spreads this way. For example, you might pick up the fungus from the floor of a public shower. You can also pick up viruses for colds and flu from doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces. Still other pathogens are spread by vectors. A vector is an organism that carries pathogens from one person or animal to another. Most vectors are insects such as ticks or mosquitoes. They pick up pathogens when they bite an infected animal and then transmit the pathogens to the next animal they bite. Ticks spread the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Mosquitoes spread the protozoa that cause malaria. Sneezing	sends	thousands	of	tiny droplets into the air unless the mouth and nose are covered. Each droplet may carry thousands of bacteria or viruses. 
Preventing the  Spread of  Infectious  Diseases 	  What can you do to avoid infectious diseases? Eating well and getting plenty of sleep are a good start. These habits will help keep your immune system healthy. With a healthy immune system, you will be able to fight off many pathogens. Vaccines are available for some infectious diseases. For example, there are vaccines to prevent measles, mumps, whooping cough, and chicken pox. These vaccines are recommended for infants and young children. You can also take the following steps to avoid picking up pathogens or spreading them to others. Watch this video for additional information on preventing the spread of infectious diseases: URL zh4NQg . Wash your hands often with soap and water. Spend at least 20 seconds scrubbing with soap. See Figure 21.3 for effective hand washing tips. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. This includes kissing, hugging, shaking hands, and sharing cups or eating utensils. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or shirt sleeve, not your hands. Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as keyboards and doorknobs, especially if someone is sick. Stay home when you are sick. The best way to prevent diseases spread by vectors is to avoid contact with the vectors. For example, you can wear long sleeves and long pants to avoid tick and mosquito bites. Using insect repellent can also reduce your risk of insect bites. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Infectious diseases are diseases that are caused by pathogens. Human pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Different pathogens spread in different ways. Pathogens may spread through contaminated food or water, sexual contact, droplets in the air from coughs or sneezes, contaminated objects or surfaces, or vectors. To avoid infectious diseases, eat well and get plenty of sleep to keep your immune system healthy. Get recommended vaccinations, and follow good hygiene practices such as frequent hand washing. Also, avoid contact with vectors such as ticks and mosquitoes. 
Think  Critically 	  Some diseases are not infectious. They are not caused by pathogens. Define noninfectious disease. List causes and common types of cancer, and state how cancer can be treated and prevented. Describe diabetes, and distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Identify autoimmune diseases, and explain why allergies occur. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  allergen allergy autoimmune disease cancer carcinogen diabetes noninfectious disease tumor type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes 
Introduction 	  Not all diseases are contagious. A disease that is not contagious is called a noninfectious disease. These diseases are not caused by pathogens. Instead, they are likely to have causes such as lifestyle factors, environmental toxins, or gene mutations. Common types of noninfectious diseases include cancer, diabetes, and immune system diseases. 
Cancer 	  Cancer is a disease in which cells divide out of control. Normally, the body has ways to prevent cells from dividing out of control. However, in the case of cancer, these ways fail. The rapidly dividing cells may form a mass of abnormal tissue called a tumor. This is illustrated in Figure 21.4. Watch this video for an animated introduction to cancer: URL . In panel A, an abnormal cell (2) is prevented from dividing, and the abnormal cell dies (1). In panel B, an abnormal cell is not prevented from dividing. Instead, it divides uncontrollably, leading to the formation of a tumor. As a tumor increases in size, it may harm normal tissues around it. Sometimes cancer cells break away from a tumor. If they enter the bloodstream, they are carried throughout the body. Then the cells may start growing in other tissues. This is usually how cancer spreads from one part of the body to another. Once this happens, cancer is very hard to stop. 
Causes of  Cancer 	  Most cancers are caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually occur in genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells are allowed to divide. Some mutations that lead to cancer may be inherited. However, most of the mutations are caused by environmental factors. Anything in the environment that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen. Common carcinogens include certain chemicals and some types of radiation. Many different chemicals can cause cancer. For example, tobacco contains dozens of chemicals, including nicotine, that have been shown to cause cancer. Figure 21.5 shows some of these chemicals. Smoking tobacco or using smokeless tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and urinary bladder. Types of radiation that cause cancer include ultraviolet (UV) radiation and radon. UV radiation is part of sunlight. It is the leading cause of skin cancer. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that escapes from underground rocks. It may seep into the basements of buildings. It can cause lung cancer. 
Most  Common  Types of  Cancer 	  Cancer occurs most often in adults, especially adults over the age of 50. The most common types of cancer in adults differ between males and females. The most common type of cancer in adult males is cancer of the prostate gland. The prostate gland is part of the male reproductive system. About one third of all cancers in men are prostate cancers. The most common type of cancer in adult females is cancer of the breast. About one third of all cancers in women are breast cancers. In both men and women, the second most common type of cancer is lung cancer. Most cases of lung cancer develop in people who smoke. Childhood cancer is rare. The main type of cancer in children is leukemia. It makes up about one third of all childhood cancers. It occurs when the body makes abnormal white blood cells. 
Diagnosing and  Treating  Cancer 	  Many cases of cancer can be cured if the cancer is diagnosed and treated early. Treatment often involves removing a tumor with surgery. This may be followed by other types of treatments. These treatments may include drugs and radiation, both of which target and kill cancer cells. Its important to know the warning signs of cancer so it can be diagnosed as early as possible. Having warning signs doesnt mean that you have cancer, but you should check with a doctor to be sure. Warning signs of cancer include: a change in bowel or bladder habits. a sore that doesnt heal. unusual bleeding or discharge. a lump in the breast or elsewhere. frequent, long-term indigestion. difficulty swallowing. obvious changes in a wart or mole. persistent cough or hoarseness. 
Preventing  Cancer 	  Making healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent some types of cancer. For example, you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen (see Figure 21.6). This young woman is applying sunscreen to reduce her exposure to cancer-causing UV radiation. 
Diabetes 	  Diabetes is another type of noninfectious disease. Diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesnt make enough insulin or else the bodys cells are resistant to the effects of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells absorb glucose from the blood. When there is too little insulin or cells do not respond to it, the blood contains too much glucose. High glucose levels in the blood can damage blood vessels and other cells in the body. The kidneys work harder to filter the extra glucose from the blood and excrete it in urine. This leads to frequent urination, which in turn causes excessive thirst. Watch this short video for an animated introduction to diabetes, its causes, and its consequences: URL be.com/watch?v=MGL6km1NBWE . There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. The two types of diabetes have different causes. 
Type 1  Diabetes 	  Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system attacking and destroying normal cells of the pancreas. As a result, the cells can no longer produce insulin. Why the immune system acts this way is not known for certain. Its possible that a virus may trigger the attack. This type of diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence. At present, there is no known way to prevent the development of type 1 diabetes. However, it is a treatable disease. Treatment of type 1 diabetes includes: taking several insulin injections every day or using an insulin pump (see Figure 21.7). monitoring blood glucose levels several times a day. eating a healthy diet that spreads out carbohydrate intake throughout the day. regular physical activity, which helps the body use insulin more efficiently. regular medical checkups. 
Type 2  Diabetes 	  Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells no longer respond normally to insulin. The pancreas still makes insulin, but the cells of the body cant use it. Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes usually develops in adulthood. However, it is becoming more common in teens and children because more young people are overweight now than ever before. You can greatly reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by maintaining a healthy body weight. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can be cured with weight loss. However, most people with the disease need to take medicine to control their blood glucose. Regular exercise and balanced eating also help. Like people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes must frequently check their blood glucose. 
Immune  System  Diseases 	  The immune system is the body system that normally fights infections and defends against other causes of disease. When the immune system is working well, it usually keeps you from getting sick. But like any other body system, An insulin pump monitors blood glucose levels and injects the needed amount of insulin to keep glucose levels within the normal range. the immune system can have problems and develop diseases. Two types of immune system diseases are autoimmune diseases and allergies. 
Autoimmune  Diseases 	  An autoimmune disease is a disease in which the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. Why this happens is not known for certain, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors are likely to be responsible. Type 1 diabetes is an example of an autoimmune disease. In this case, the immune system attacks cells of the pancreas. Two other examples are multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks nerve cells. This causes weakness and pain that gradually get worse over time. In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks joints. This causes joint damage and pain. These diseases cant be prevented and have no known cure. However, they can be treated with medicines that weaken the immune systems attack on normal cells. 
Allergies 	  An allergy is a disorder in which the immune system responds to a harmless substance as though it was a pathogen. Any substance that causes an allergy is called an allergen. The most common allergens are pollen, dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain foods and medications. To see in greater detail how allergies occur, watch this animated video: URL . Did you ever hear of hay fever? Its not really a fever, and it may have nothing to do with hay. Its actually an allergy to plant pollens. People with this type of allergy generally have seasonal allergies that come back year after year. Symptoms commonly include watery eyes and nasal congestion. Ragweed, shown blooming in Figure 21.8, causes more pollen allergies than any other plant. Allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Severe symptoms can cause difficulty breathing, which may be life threatening. Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions may require an injection of the hormone epinephrine. These treatments lessen or counter the immune systems response. Often, allergy symptoms can be prevented. One way is to avoid exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. If you are allergic to pollen, for example, you can reduce your exposure by staying inside when pollen levels are highest. Some people receive allergy shots to help prevent allergic reactions. The shots contain tiny amounts of allergens. After many months or years of shots, the immune system gets used to the allergens and no longer reacts to them. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Noninfectious diseases are not contagious because they are not caused by pathogens. Instead, they are caused by such factors as lifestyle choices, environmental toxins, or mutations. Most cancers are caused by mutations. Anything that causes mutations leading to cancer is called a carcinogen. Examples of carcinogens include chemicals in tobacco smoke and UV radiation. Diabetes is a disease in which insulin fails to keep blood glucose levels within a healthy range. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas doesnt produce insulin. In type 2 diabetes, body cells do not respond normally to insulin. Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. Type 1 diabetes is an example. Allergies occur when the immune system attacks a harmless substance such as pollen as though it was a pathogen. 
Think  Critically 	  Most types of cancer are noninfectious diseases. However, some types of cancer are caused by viruses. Fortunately, your body has ways to protect you from viruses and other pathogens. Describe the barriers that keep most pathogens out of the body. Explain how inflammation, phagocytosis, and fever help protect you from pathogens. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  fever inflammation mucus phagocyte phagocytosis 
Introduction 	  Your body has many ways to protect you from pathogens. Your bodys defenses are like the ancient castle in Figure 21.9. In medieval times, the moat and high walls of the castle kept out most enemies. If any enemies made it past these defenses, soldiers inside the castle were ready to fight them. Like a castle, your body has a series of defenses. Only pathogens that get through all of the defenses can harm you. 
First  Line of  Defense 	  Your bodys first line of defense is like a castles moat and walls. It keeps most pathogens out of your body. The first line of defense includes physical, chemical, and biological barriers. 
Physical  Barriers 	  The skin is a very important barrier to pathogens. It is the bodys largest organ and the most important defense against disease. It forms a physical barrier between the body and the outside environment. The outer layer of the skin, called the epidermis, consists of dead cells filled with the protein keratin. These cells form a tough, waterproof covering on the body. It is very difficult for pathogens to get through the epidermis. The inside of the mouth and nose are lined with mucous membranes. Other organs that are exposed to substances from the environment are also lined with mucous membranes. These include the respiratory and digestive organs. Mucous membranes arent tough like skin, but they have other ways of keeping out pathogens. One way mucous membranes protect the body is by producing mucus. Mucus is a sticky, moist secretion that covers mucous membranes. The mucus traps pathogens and particles so they cant enter the body. Many mucous membranes are also covered with cilia. These are tiny, hair-like projections. Cilia move in waves and sweep mucus and trapped pathogens toward body openings. You can see this in the diagram in Figure 21.10. When you clear your throat or blow your nose, you remove mucus and pathogens from your body. Cilia lining the respiratory system sweep mucus and trapped pathogens toward the pharynx in the throat. 
Chemical  Barriers 	  In addition to mucus, your body releases a variety of fluids, including tears, saliva, and sweat. These fluids contain enzymes called lysozymes. Lysozymes break down the cell walls of bacteria and kill them. Your stomach contains a very strong acid, called hydrochloric acid. This acid kills most pathogens that enter the stomach in food or water. Urine is also acidic, so few pathogens are able to grow in it. 
Biological  Barriers 	  Your skin is covered by millions of bacteria. Millions more live inside your body, mainly in your gastrointestinal tract. Most of these bacteria are helpful. For one thing, they help defend your body from pathogens. They do it by competing with harmful bacteria for food and space. They prevent the harmful bacteria from multiplying and making you sick. 
Second  Line of  Defense 	  Did you ever get a splinter in your skin, like the one in Figure 21.11? It doesnt look like a serious injury, but even a tiny break in the skin may let pathogens enter the body. If bacteria enter through the break, for example, they could cause an infection. These bacteria would then face the bodys second line of defense. A splinter in the skin may let bacteria in. 
Inflammation 	  If bacteria enter the skin through a splinter or other wound, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. It occurs due to chemicals that are released when tissue is damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the area. The chemicals also attract white blood cells to the area. The white blood cells leak out of the blood vessels and into the damaged tissue. You can see an animation of the inflammatory response by watching this video: URL . 
Phagocytosis 	  The white blood cells that go to a site of inflammation and leak into damaged tissue are called phagocytes. They start eating pathogens and dead cells by engulfing and destroying them. This process is called phagocytosis. You can see how it happens in Figure ??. You can see it in action in the animation at this link: URL edia.org/wiki/File:FAGOCITOSI_BY_RAFF.gif . Phagocytosis occurs when a phagocyte engulfs bacteria, destroys them with chemicals, and excretes the wastes. 
Fever 	  Phagocytes also release chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce quickly at this temperature. When the temperature rises higher, the pathogens cant reproduce as quickly. Therefore, a fever helps to limit the infection. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells to fight the infection. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The bodys first line of defense against pathogens includes physical, chemical, and biological barriers. These barriers keep most pathogens out of the body. If pathogens do manage to enter the body, the bodys second line of defense attacks them. The second line of defense includes inflammation, phagocytosis, and fever. 
Think  Critically 	  The phagocytes that are part of the bodys second line of defense attack any pathogens they encounter. They provide a general defense. Some white blood cells attack only certain pathogens. They provide a specific defense. Identify the parts of the immune system and the roles they play in immune responses. Compare and contrast immune responses involving B cell and those involving T cells. Define immunity, and explain two ways that immunity may be acquired. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  antibody immune response immune system immunity lymph lymph node lymphocyte spleen thymus gland tonsil vaccination 
Introduction 	  If pathogens get through the bodys first two lines of defense, a third line of defense takes over. This third line of defense involves the immune system. For a cartoon introduction to the immune system, watch this video: URL ww.youtube.com/watch?v=WJEc2GDEfz8 . What Is the Immune System? The immune system is the body system that fights to protect the body from specific pathogens. It has a special response for each type of pathogen. The immune systems specific reaction to a pathogen is called an immune response. The immune system is shown in Figure 21.13. It includes several organs and a network of vessels that carry lymph. Lymph is a yellowish liquid that normally leaks out of tiny blood vessels into spaces between cells in tissues. When inflammation occurs, more lymph leaks into tissues, and the lymph is likely to contain pathogens. 
Organs of the  Immune  System 	  Immune system organs include bone marrow, the thymus gland, the spleen, and the tonsils. Each organ has a different job in the immune system. Bone marrow is found inside many bones. Its role in the immune system is to produce white blood cells called lymphocytes. The thymus gland is in the chest behind the breast bone.	It stores some types of lymphocytes while they mature. The spleen is in the abdomen below the lungs. Its job is to filter pathogens out of the blood. The two tonsils are located on either side of the throat. They trap pathogens that enter the body through the mouth or nose. 
Circulation of  Lymph 	  Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the blood vessels of the cardiovascular system. However, lymph vessels circulate lymph instead of blood, and the heart does not pump lymph through the vessels. Lymph that collects in tissues slowly passes into tiny lymph vessels. Lymph then travels from smaller to larger lymph vessels. Muscles around the lymph vessels contract and squeeze the lymph through the vessels. The lymph vessels also contract to help move the lymph along. Eventually, lymph reaches the main lymph vessels, which are located in the chest. From these vessels, lymph drains into two large veins of the cardiovascular system. This is how lymph returns to the blood. Before lymph reaches the bloodstream, it passes through small oval structures called lymph nodes, which are located along the lymph vessels. Figure 21.14 shows where some of the bodys many lymph nodes are concentrated. Lymph nodes act like filters and remove pathogens from lymph. 
Lymphocytes 	  A lymphocyte is the type of white blood cell involved in an immune system response. You can see what a lymphocyte looks like, greatly magnified, in Figure 21.15. Lymphocytes make up about one quarter of all white blood cells, but there are trillions of them in the human body. Usually, fewer than half of the bodys lymphocytes are in the blood. The majority are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow and mature. The B in B cells stands for bone marrow, where B cells mature. The T in T cells stands for thymus gland, where T cells mature. Both B cells and T cells must be switched on in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells that are ready to fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have unique antigens, often located on their cell surface. Antigens are proteins that the body recognizes either as self or nonself. Self antigens include those found on red blood cells that determine a persons blood type. Generally, the immune system doesnt respond to self antigens. Nonself antigens include those found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Nonself antigens are also found on other cells, such as pollen cells and cancer cells. It is these antigens that trigger an immune response. 
Immune  Responses 	  There are two different types of immune responses. Both types involve lymphocytes. However, one type of response involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. Lymph nodes are represented by black dots in this drawing. 
How  B  Cells  Respond 	  B cells respond to pathogens in the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped molecule that binds to an antigen. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen. The antibody and antigen fit together like a lock and key. You can see how this works in Figure 21.16. The antibody in the figure can bind only with the type of antigen that is colored yellow. Once the antibody binds with the antigen, it signals a phagocyte to engulf and destroy them, along with the pathogen that carries the antigen on its surface. You can watch an animation of the antibody-antigen binding process at this link: URL be.com/watch?v=lrYlZJiuf18 . 
How  T  Cells  Respond 	  There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and helper T cells. Killer T cells destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells. Figure 21.17 shows how a killer T cells destroys an infected cell. When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it releases toxins. The toxins make tiny holes in the infected cells membrane. This causes the cell to burst open. Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed. Helper T cells do not destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells. However, they are still needed for an immune response. They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by helper T cells switch on B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and fight specific pathogens. 
Immunity and  Vaccination 	  Most B cells and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control. But some of them survive for many years. They may even survive for a persons lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called memory cells Memory cells allow the immune system to remember a pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again, the memory cells will start dividing in order to fight it. They will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to fight the pathogen. They will begin a faster, stronger attack than the first time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system will be able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection. Being able to fight off and resist a pathogen in this way is called immunity. You dont have to suffer through an infection to gain immunity to some diseases. Immunity can also come about by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin. Only part of the pathogens are injected, or else weakened or dead pathogens are used. This causes an immune response without causing the disease. Diseases you are likely to have been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The immune system is the body system that fights to protect the body from specific pathogens. The immune systems specific reaction to a pathogen is called an immune response. The immune system includes several organs and a system of vessels that carry lymph. White blood cells called lymphocytes are the key cells involved in an immune response. There are two main types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells. B cells respond to pathogens in the blood and lymph by making antibodies against them. Killer T cells kill infected, damaged, or cancerous cells. Helper T cells release chemicals that control other lymphocytes. Immunity is the ability of the immune system to launch a rapid attack against a particular pathogen because it remembers it. Immunity prevents the pathogen from making you sick. It can come about by having a prior infection with the pathogen or by receiving a vaccination for it.

S  Reproductive  Systems and  Life  Stages 	  This picture shows the amazing moment when a human sperm and egg unite. The process is called fertilization. If its successful, it will lead to a brand new human being. Do you know how the sperm and egg are produced? Do you know how a fertilized egg develops into a complete and complex human being? Youll find out when you read this chapter. Identify functions of the male reproductive system. Describe organs of the male reproductive system. Describe sperm, and explain how they are produced. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  epididymis penis prostate gland reproductive system  semen testis (testes, plural) testosterone vas deferens 
Introduction 	  Dogs have puppies. Cats have kittens. All living things reproduce, including human beings. Like other mammals, human beings have a body system that controls reproduction. Its called the reproductive system. Its the only human body system that differs significantly between males and females. The male and female reproductive systems have different organs and different functions. 
Functions of the  Male  Reproductive  System 	  The male reproductive system has two main functions: producing sperm and releasing testosterone. Sperm are male gametes, or reproductive cells. Sperm form when certain cells in the male reproductive system divide by meiosis to form haploid cells. Being haploid means they have half the number of chromosomes of other cells in the body. An adult male may produce millions of sperm each day! Testosterone is the major sex hormone in males. Testosterone has two primary roles: 
Organs of the  Male  Reproductive  System 	  The male reproductive organs include the penis, testes, epididymis, vas deferens, and prostate gland. These organs are shown in Figure 22.1. The figure also shows some other parts of the male reproductive system. Find each organ in the drawing as you read about it below. For a cartoon about the male reproductive system, watch this video: http ://URL . The penis is an external, cylinder-shaped organ that contains the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body. It also carries sperm out of the body. The two testes (testis, singular) are oval organs that produce sperm and secrete testosterone. They are located inside a sac called the scrotum that hangs down outside the body. The scrotum also contains the epididymis. The epididymis is a tube that is about 6 meters (20 feet) long in adults. It is tightly coiled, so it fits inside the scrotum on top of the testes. The epididymis is where sperm mature. It stores the sperm until they leave the body. The vas deferens is a tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. The prostate gland secretes a fluid that mixes with sperm to help form semen. Semen is a whitish liquid that contains sperm. It passes through the urethra and out of the body. 
Producing  Sperm 	  Sperm are tiny cells. In fact, they are the smallest of all human cells. They have a structure that suits them well to perform their function. 
Structure and  Function of  Sperm 	  As you can see in Figure 22.2, a sperm has three main parts: the head, connecting piece (or midpiece), and tail. 
How  Sperm  Form 	  It takes up to two months for mature sperm to form. The process occurs in several steps: Sperm leave the epididymis through the vas deferens. As they travel through the vas deferens, they pass by the prostate and other glands. The sperm mix with secretions from these glands, forming semen. Semen travels through the urethra and leaves the body through the penis. A teaspoon of semen may contain as many as half a billion sperm! 
Lesson  Summary 	  The male reproductive system has two main functions: producing sperm and secreting testosterone. Sperm are male gametes. Testosterone is the major sex hormone in males. The male reproductive organs include the penis, testes, epididymis, vas deferens, and prostate gland. Sperm form in the testes and mature in the epididymis. Each sperm has three main parts: head, connecting piece, and tail. Sperm mix with secretions from glands to form semen. 
Think  Critically 	  The female reproductive system has different functions and organs than the male reproductive system. Identify functions of the female reproductive system. Describe organs of the female reproductive system. Describe eggs, and explain how they are produced. Summarize the monthly cycle of the female reproductive system. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  estrogen fallopian tube menstrual cycle menstruation ovary ovulation uterus vagina 
Introduction 	  Most of the male reproductive organs are outside the body. Female reproductive organs, in contrast, are inside the body. The male and female organs also look very different and have different functions. 
Functions of the  Female  Reproductive  System 	  Two functions of the female reproductive system are similar to the functions of the male reproductive system: producing gametes and secreting a major sex hormone. In the case of females, however, the gametes are eggs, and they are produced by the ovaries. The hormone is estrogen, which is the main sex hormone in females. Estrogen has two major roles: During adolescence, estrogen causes the changes of puberty. It causes the reproductive organs to mature. It also causes other female traits to develop. For example, it causes the breasts to grow and the hips to widen. During adulthood, estrogen is needed for a woman to release eggs from the ovaries. The female reproductive system has another important function, which is not found in males. It supports a baby as it develops before birth. It also gives birth to the baby at the end of pregnancy. 
Organs of the  Female  Reproductive  System 	  The female reproductive organs include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. These organs are shown in Figure 22.3, along with some other structures of the female reproductive system. Find each organ in the drawing as you read about it below. For a cartoon about the female reproductive system, watch this video: URL tal.com/academy/lesson/female-reproductive-system-internal-anatomy.html The two ovaries are small, oval organs on either side of the abdomen. Each ovary contains thousands of eggs. However, the eggs do not develop fully until a female has gone through puberty. Then, about once a month, an egg is released by one of the ovaries. The ovaries also secrete estrogen. The two fallopian tubes are thin tubes that are connected to the uterus and extend almost to the ovaries. The upper end of each fallopian tube has fingers (called fimbriae) that sweep an egg into the fallopian tube when it is released by the ovary. The egg then passes through the fallopian tube to the uterus. If an egg is fertilized, this occurs in the fallopian tube. The uterus is a hollow organ with muscular walls. The uterus is where a baby develops until birth. The walls of the uterus stretch to accommodate the growing fetus. The muscles in the walls contract to push the baby out during birth. The uterus is connected to the vagina by a small opening called the cervix. The vagina is a cylinder-shaped organ that opens to the outside of the body. The other end joins with the uterus. Sperm deposited in the vagina swim up through the cervix, into the uterus, and from there into a fallopian tube. During birth, a baby passes from the uterus through the vagina to leave the body. 
Producing  Eggs 	  When a baby girl is born, her ovaries contain all of the eggs they will ever produce. But these eggs are not fully developed. They develop only after the female reaches puberty at about age 12 or 13. Then, just one egg develops each month until she reaches her 40s or early 50s. 
Structure and  Function of  Eggs 	  Human eggs are very large cells. In fact, they are the largest of all human cells. You can even see an egg without a microscope. Its almost as big as the period at the end of this sentence. Like a sperm cell, an egg cell is a haploid cell with half the number of chromosomes of other cells in the body. Unlike a sperm cell, the egg lacks a tail and contains a lot of cytoplasm. 
How  Eggs  Form 	  Egg production takes place in the ovaries. It occurs in several steps: After ovulation occurs, the moving fingers of the nearby fallopian tube sweep the egg into the tube. Fertilization may occur if sperm reach the egg while it is passing through the fallopian tube. If this happens, the egg finally completes meiosis. This results in two daughter cells that differ in size. The smaller cell is called a polar body. It soon breaks down and disappears. The larger cell is the fertilized egg, which will develop into a new human being. 
Menstrual  Cycle 	  Egg production in the ovary is part of the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is a series of changes in the reproductive system of mature females that repeats every month on average. These changes include the development of an egg and follicle in the ovary. While the egg is developing, other changes are taking place in the uterus. It develops a thick lining that is full of tiny blood vessels. The lining prepares the uterus to receive a fertilized egg if fertilization actually takes place. If fertilization doesnt occur, the egg passes through the uterus and vagina and out of the body. The lining of the uterus also breaks down. Blood and other tissues from the lining pass through the vagina and leave the body. This is called menstruation. Menstruation is also called a menstrual period. It typically lasts about 4 days. When the menstrual period ends, the cycle begins repeats. How an egg and its follicle develop in an ovary: (1) undeveloped eggs; (2) and (3) egg and follicle developing; (4) ovulation; (5) and (6) follicle (now called corpus luteum) breaking down 
Lesson  Summary 	  Two functions of the female reproductive system are producing eggs and secreting estrogen. Eggs are female gametes. Estrogen is the major sex hormone in females. The female reproductive system also supports a developing fetus and gives birth to an infant. The female reproductive organs include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. Eggs form in the ovaries. After puberty, an egg is released from an ovary each month in the process of ovulation. The egg passes through the fallopian tube where fertilization may take place. The menstrual cycle is a series of changes in the reproductive system of mature females that repeats every month on average. It includes changes in the uterus as well as development of an egg and ovulation. If fertilization does not occur, menstruation occurs and the cycle repeats. 
Think  Critically 	  If an egg is fertilized, this event takes place in a fallopian tube. Summarize events from fertilization to birth. Describe pregnancy and birth. Outline the major changes that occur from birth to adulthood. Give an overview of early, middle, and late adulthood. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  adolescence amniotic sac blastocyst childhood fetus implantation infancy pregnancy puberty umbilical cord 
Introduction 	  A day or two after an ovary releases an egg, the egg may unite with a sperm. Sperm are deposited in the vagina during sexual intercourse. They propel themselves through secretions in the uterus and enter a fallopian tube. This is where fertilization normally takes place. 
From  Fertilization to  Birth 	  When a sperm penetrates the cell membrane of an egg, it triggers the egg to complete meiosis. The sperm also undergoes changes. Its tail falls off, and its nucleus fuses with the nucleus of the egg. The resulting cell, called a zygote, contains the diploid number of chromosomes. Half of the chromosomes come from the egg, and half come from the sperm. You can watch the process of fertilization and the development of a baby until birth in this amazing video: URL 
The  Blastocyst 	  The zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, where it will take up residence. As it travels, it divides many times by mitosis. It soon forms a tiny, fluid-filled ball of cells called a blastocyst. The blastocyst has an inner and outer layer of cells, as you can see in Figure 22.5. The inner layer, called the embryoblast, will develop into the new human being. The outer layer, called the trophoblast, will develop into other structures needed to support the new organism. 
Implantation 	  The blastocyst continues down the fallopian tube until it reaches the uterus, about 4 or 5 days after fertilization. When the outer cells of the blastocyst contact cells lining the uterus (the endometrium in Figure 22.5), the blastocyst embeds itself in the uterine lining. This process is called implantation. It generally occurs about a week after fertilization. 
The  Embryo 	  After implantation occurs, the blastocyst is called an embryo. The embryonic stage lasts from the end of the first week following fertilization through the end of the eighth week. During this time, the embryo grows in size and becomes more complex. It develops specialized cells and tissues. Most organs also start to form. You can see some of the specific changes that take place during weeks four to eight of the embryonic period in Figure 22.6. By the end of week eight, the embryo is about 30 millimeters (just over 1 inch) in length. It may also have begun to move. Embryonic Development (Weeks 48). Most organs develop in the embryo during weeks 4 through 8. If the embryo is exposed to toxins during this period, the effects are likely to be very damaging. Can you explain why? (Note: the drawings of the embryos are not to scale.) 
The  Fetus 	  From the eighth week following fertilization until birth, the developing human being is called a fetus. Birth typically occurs at about 38 weeks after fertilization, so the fetal period generally lasts about 30 weeks. During this time, the organs complete their development. The fetus also grows rapidly in length and weight. Some of the specific changes that occur during the fetal stage are listed in Figure 22.7. By the 38th week, the fetus is fully developed and ready to be born. A 38-week fetus normally ranges from about 36 to 51 centimeters (1420 inches) in length and weighs between 2.7 and 4.6 kilograms (about 610 pounds). 
Placenta and  Amniotic  Sac 	  The fetus could not grow and develop without oxygen and nutrients from the mother. Wastes from the fetus also must be removed in order for it to survive. The exchange of these substances between the mother and fetus occurs through the placenta. The placenta is a temporary organ that starts to form shortly after implantation. It forms from the trophoblast layer of cells in the blastocyst and from maternal cells in the uterus. The placenta continues to develop and grow to meet the needs of the growing fetus. A fully developed placenta, like the one in Figure 22.8, is made up of a large mass of blood vessels from both mother and fetus. The maternal and fetal vessels are close together but separated by tiny spaces. This allows the mothers and fetuss blood to exchange substances across their capillary walls without the blood actually mixing. The fetus is connected to the placenta through the umbilical cord. This is a long tube that contains two arteries and a vein. Blood from the fetus enters the placenta through the umbilical arteries. It exchanges gases and other substances with the mothers blood. Then it travels back to the fetus through the umbilical vein. Another structure that supports the fetus is the amniotic sac. This is a membrane that surrounds and protects the fetus. It contains amniotic fluid, which consists of water and dissolved substances. The fluid allows the fetus to move freely until it grows to fill most of the available space. The fluid also cushions the fetus and helps protect it from injury. 
Pregnancy and  Birth 	  Pregnancy is the carrying of one or more offspring from the time of implantation until birth. It is the development of an embryo and fetus from the expectant mothers point of view. 
Role of the  Mother 	  The pregnant mother plays a critical role in the development of the embryo and fetus. She must avoid toxic substances such as alcohol, which can damage the developing offspring. She also must provide all the nutrients and other substances needed for normal growth and development. Most nutrients are needed in greater amounts by a pregnant woman because she is literally eating for two people. Thats why its important for a woman to eat plenty of nutritious foods during pregnancy. The pregnant woman in Figure 22.9 is eating a variety of fresh fruits, which provide energy, vitamins, and other nutrients. 
Birth 	  Near the time of birth, the amniotic sac breaks in a gush of liquid. Labor usually begins within a day of this event. Labor involves contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus. With the mothers help, the contractions eventually push the fetus out of the uterus and through the vagina. Within seconds of birth, the umbilical cord is cut. Without this connection to the placenta, the baby cant exchange gases, so carbon dioxide quickly builds up in the babys blood. This stimulates the babys brain to trigger breathing, and the newborn takes her first breath. 
From  Birth to  Adulthood 	  For the first year after birth, a baby is referred to as an infant. Childhood begins at the age of two years and continues until puberty. Adolescence begins with puberty and lasts until adulthood. A pregnant woman needs to pay special attention to her diet and eat a variety of healthy foods. 
Infancy 	  The first year of life after birth is called infancy. During infancy, a baby grows very quickly. The babys length typically doubles and her weight triples by her first birthday. Many other important changes also occur during infancy: The baby starts smiling, usually by about 6 weeks of age (see Figure 22.10).  The baby starts noticing people and grabbing toys and other objects The baby teeth start to come in, usually by 6 months of age. The baby begins making babbling sounds. By the end of the first year, the baby may be saying a few words, such as Mama and Dada. The baby learns to sit, crawl, and stand. By the end of the first year, the baby may be starting to walk. Smiling is an early milestone in infant development. 
Childhood 	  Childhood begins after the babys first birthday and continues until puberty. Between 1 and 3 years of age, a child is called a toddler. During the toddler stage, growth is still very rapid, but not as rapid as it was during infancy. Toddlers learn many new words and starts putting them together in simple sentences. Motor skills also develop quickly during the toddler stage. By the age of 3 years, most children can run and climb steps. They can hold crayons and scribble with them. They can also feed themselves, and most can use the toilet. From age 3 until puberty, growth slows down. The body also changes shape. The arms and legs grow longer relative to the trunk. Children continue to develop new motor skills. For example, many young children learn how to ride a tricycle and then a bicycle. Most learn how to play games and sports. By the age of 6 years, children start losing their baby teeth. Permanent teeth come in to replace them. Most children have started school by this age. They typically start learning to read and write around age 6 or 7 (see Figure 22.11). During the later years of childhood, children also start to develop friendships and become less dependent on their parents. 
Puberty 	  Puberty is the stage of life when a child becomes sexually mature. Puberty lasts from about 10 to 16 years of age in girls and from about 12 to 18 years of age in boys. In both girls and boys, puberty begins when the pituitary gland signals the gonads (ovaries or testes) to start secreting sex hormones (estrogen in girls, testosterone in boys). Sex hormones, in turn, cause many other changes to take place. In girls, estrogen causes the following changes to occur: The uterus and ovaries grow. The ovaries start releasing eggs. The menstrual cycle begins. Pubic hair grows. The hips widen and the breasts develop. In boys, testosterone causes these changes to take place: The penis and testes grow. Learning how to write is a major accomplishment of childhood. The testes start producing sperm. Pubic and facial hair grow. The shoulders broaden. The voice becomes deeper as the larynx in the throat grows larger (see Figure 22.12). Girls and boys of the same age are similar in height during childhood. In both girls and boys, growth in height and weight is very fast during puberty. But boys grow more quickly that girls do, and their period of rapid growth also lasts longer. In addition, boys generally start puberty later than girls, so they have a longer period of childhood growth. For all these reasons, by the end of puberty, the average height of boys is 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) greater than the average height of girls. 
Adolescence 	  Adolescence is the stage of life between the start of puberty and the beginning of adulthood. Adolescence begins with the physical changes of puberty. It also includes many other changes, including mental, emotional, and social changes. During adolescence: Teens develop new thinking abilities. For example, they develop the ability to understand abstract ideas, such as honesty and freedom. Their ability to think logically also improves. They usually get better at problem A teenage boy develops a bump in his throat called an Adams apple because of an increase in the size of the larynx, or voice box. solving as well. Teens try to establish a sense of identity. They typically become increasingly independent from their parents. Many teens have emotional ups and downs. This is at least partly due to their changing hormone levels. Teens usually start spending more time with their peers, like the girls in Figure 22.13. Adolescents usually spend much more time with their friends and classmates than they do with family members. 
Adulthood 	  Adulthood doesnt have a definite starting point. Teens may become physically mature by the age 16 years, but they are not adults in a legal sense until they are older. For example, in the U.S., you must be 18 years old to vote or serve in the armed forces. You must be 21 years old before you can take on many legal and financial responsibilities. Once adulthood begins, it can be divided into three stages: early, middle, and late adulthood. 
Early  Adulthood 	  Early adulthood refers to the 20s and early 30s. During early adulthood, most people are at their physical peak, and they are usually in good health. Often, they are completing their education and getting established in the workforce. Many people become engaged or marry during this time. 
Middle  Adulthood 	  Middle adulthood is the period from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, people start showing signs of aging. Their hair may thin and slowly turn gray. Their skin develops wrinkles. The risk of serious health problems increases. For example, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and type 2 diabetes become more common in people of middle age. This is also the stage when many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. 
Late  Adulthood 	  Late adulthood begins in the mid-60s and continues until death. This is the stage of life when most people retire from work. This frees up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, or other interests. For example, the man in Figure 22.14 enjoys creating music in old age. This elderly man not only plays the guitar. He built the guitar that hes playing in the photo. During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesnt work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimers disease. Despite problems such as these, many people remain healthy and active into their 80s and even 90s. Do you want to be one of them? If so, adopt a healthy lifestyle now and follow it for life. Doing so will increase your chances of staying fit and active in old age. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Fertilization of an egg by a sperm in a fallopian tube produces a zygote. The zygote develops into a blastocyst, which implants in the uterus. The offspring then goes through the embryonic and fetal stages. The placenta supports the needs of the developing embryo and fetus. Birth generally occurs at about 38 months after fertilization. An expectant mother must avoid toxins to protect the developing fetus. She also must eat a nutritious diet during pregnancy for the health of her child. For the first year after birth, a baby is referred to as an infant. Childhood begins at the age of two years and continues until puberty, when sexual maturation takes place. Adolescence is the last stage of life before adulthood. It starts with puberty and ends around age 20. Stages of adulthood include early, middle, and late adulthood. Each stage is associated with different physical abilities, health concerns, and social roles. 
Think  Critically 	  Many diseases become more common as people grow older. However, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are more common in teens and young adults.

Introduction 	  A healthy reproductive system is important for two reasons. Its important for overall good health. Its also important for reproduction. If the reproductive system isnt healthy, a person may be unable to have children. Many health problems can affect the reproductive system. They include sexually transmitted infections and cancers. The good news is that many reproductive health problems can be prevented or cured. 
Sexually  Transmitted  Infections 	  A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is a disease that spreads mainly through sexual contact. STIs are caused by pathogens that enter the body through the reproductive organs. Many STIs also spread through body fluids such as blood. For example, a shared tattoo needle is one way that some STIs can spread. Some STIs can also spread from a mother to her infant during birth. 
I  Myths and  Facts 	  STIs are more common in teens and young adults than in older people. One reason is that young people are more likely to engage in risky behaviors. They also may not know how STIs spread. Instead, they may believe myths about STIs, like those in Table 22.1. Knowing the facts is important to prevent the spread of STIs. 
Fact 	  If you are sexually active with just one person, then you cant get STIs. The only sure way to avoid getting STIs is to practice abstinence from sexual activity. If you dont have any symptoms, then you dont have an STI. Many STIs do not cause symptoms, especially in females. Getting STIs is no big deal, because they can be cured with medicines. Only some STIs can be cured with medicines; others cannot be cured. 
Bacterial  Is 	  A number of STIs are caused by bacteria. Bacterial STIs can usually be cured with antibiotics. However, some people with bacterial STIs may not have symptoms so they fail to get treatment. Left untreated, these infections may damage reproductive organs and lead to an inability to have children. Three bacterial STIs are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STI in the U.S. Females are more likely to develop it than males. Symptoms may include burning during urination and a discharge from the vagina or penis. Gonorrhea is another common bacterial STI. Symptoms may include painful urination and a discharge from the vagina or penis. Syphilis is a very serious STI but somewhat less common than chlamydia or gonorrhea. It usually begins with a small sore on the genitals. This is followed a few months later by a rash and flu-like symptoms. If syphilis isnt treated, it can eventually damage the heart, brain, and other organs and even cause death. 
Viral  Is 	  Several STIs are caused by viruses. Viral STIs cant be cured with antibiotics. Other drugs may help control the symptoms of viral STIs, but the infections usually last for life. Three viral STIs are genital warts, genital herpes, and AIDS. Genital herpes is a common STI caused by a herpes virus. The virus causes painful blisters on the penis or near the vaginal opening. The blisters generally go away on their own, but they may return repeatedly throughout life. There is no cure for genital herpes, but medicines can help prevent or shorten outbreaks. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV destroys lymphocytes that normally fight infections. AIDS develops if the number of lymphocytes drops to a very low level. People with AIDS come down with diseasessuch as certain rare cancersthat almost never occur in people with a healthy immune system. Medicines can delay the progression of an HIV infection and may prevent AIDS from developing. Genital warts is an STI caused by human papilloma virus (HPV), which is pictured in Figure 22.15. This is one of the most common STIs in U.S. teens. Genital warts cant be cured, but a vaccine can prevent most HPV infections. The vaccine is recommended for boys and girls starting at 11 or 12 years of age. Its important to prevent HPV infections because they may lead to cancer later in life. HPV, the virus that causes genital warts, may also cause cancer. 
Other  Disorders of the  Reproductive  System 	  Other reproductive system disorders include injuries and noninfectious diseases. These are different in males and females. 
Male  Reproductive  System  Disorders 	  Most common disorders of the male reproductive system involve the testes. They include injuries and cancer. Injuries to the testes are very common. In teens, such injuries occur most often while playing sports. Injuries to the testes are likely to be very painful and cause bruising and swelling. However, they generally subside fairly quickly. Cancer of the testes is most common in males aged 15 to 35. It occurs when cells in the testes grow out of control and form a tumor. If found early, cancer of the testes usually can be cured with surgery. 
Female  Reproductive  System  Disorders 	  Disorders of the female reproductive system may involve the vagina, uterus, or ovaries. They may also affect the breasts. Vaginitis is a very common disorder. Symptoms include redness and itching of the vagina. It may be caused by soap or bubble bath. Another possible cause is a yeast infection. Yeast normally grow in the vagina. If they multiple too quickly, they may cause irritation. A yeast infection can be treated with medication. Cysts may develop in the ovaries. A cyst is a sac filled with fluid or other material. Ovarian cysts are usually harmless and often disappear on their own. However, some cysts may be painful and require surgery. Many females experience abdominal cramps during menstruation. This is usually normal and not a cause for concern. Exercise, heat, or medication may help relieve the pain. In severe cases, prescription medicine may be needed. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in females. It occurs when cells in the breast grow out of control and form a tumor. Breast cancer is rare in teens but becomes more common as females get older. Regular screening is recommended for most women starting around age 40. If found early, breast cancer usually can be cured with surgery. 
Keeping  Your  Reproductive  System  Healthy 	  Maintaining overall good health will help keep your reproductive system healthy. You should eat right, get regular exercise, and follow other healthy lifestyle behaviors. In addition, the following practices will help keep the reproductive system healthy: Keep the genitals clean. A daily shower or bath is all thats needed. Avoid harsh soaps or other personal hygiene products that may be irritating. Avoid risky behaviors. This includes contact with blood or dirty needles as well as sexual activity. If you are a girl and use tampons, be sure to change them every 4 to 6 hours. This will reduce your risk of toxic shock syndrome. This is a very dangerous condition that may occur if tampons are left in too long. If you are a boy, wear a protective cup if you play a contact sport. This will help protect the testes from injury. You should also learn how to check yourself for testicular cancer (see Figure 22.16). You can learn how by watching this video: URL 
Lesson  Summary 	  A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is a disease that spreads mainly through sexual contact. STIs are more common in teens and young adults than in older people. Bacterial STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Viral STIs include genital warts, genital herpes, and AIDS. Other reproductive system disorders include injuries and noninfectious diseases such as cancer. These disorders are different in males and females. Maintaining overall good health, keeping the genitals clean, and avoiding risky behaviors are ways to keep the reproductive system healthy. 
Think  Critically 	  Reproduction is important not only to families but also to planet Earth. Human reproduction has led to rapid growth of the human population.

Chapter  Outline 	  The lake in this photo looks as though it might be completely lacking in life. Even its namethe Dead Seaadds to that impression. Located far below sea level, the Dead Sea is much saltier than the ocean. Its too salty for fish, frogs, or other animals to survive. Yet even here, living things thrive. The bottom of the Dead Sea, for example, is carpeted with mats of microorganisms. How do they manage to live in these unusual conditions? How have they adapted to their extreme environment? All organisms must adapt to their environment in order to survive. This is true whether they live in the highly salty water of the Dead Sea or in a lush tropical rainforest that is bursting with life. Most environments are not as extreme as the Dead Sea. But they all have conditions that require adaptations. In this chapter, youll read about a wide variety of environments and the organisms that live in them. Define ecology. Distinguish between biotic and abiotic factors in the environment. Outline levels of organization in ecology. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  abiotic factor biosphere biotic factor ecology 
Introduction 	  The science of how living things interact with each other and their environment is called ecology. Ecology is a major branch of life science, but it overlaps with many other fields. For example, it shares data and theories with geography, biology, climatology, and other sciences. In this lesson, youll learn some of the basic concepts of ecology. 
Organisms and  Environmental  Factors 	  Organisms are individual living things. They range from microscopic bacteria to gigantic blue whales (see Figure 23.1). Despite their great diversity, all organisms have the same basic needs: energy and matter. Energy and matter must be obtained from the environment. Organisms show tremendous diversity. Some of the smallest and largest living organisms are pictured here: billions of microorganisms that thrive in this hot spring give it its striking colors (left); blue whales are the largest living organisms (right). Organisms depend on their environment to meet their needs, so they are greatly influenced by it. There are many factors in the environment that affect organisms. The factors can be classified as either biotic or abiotic. Biotic factors are all of the living or once-living aspects of the environment. They include all the organisms that live there as well as the remains of dead organisms. Abiotic factors are all of the aspects of the environment that have never been alive. They include factors such as sunlight, minerals in soil, temperature, and moisture. 
Levels of  Organization in  Ecology 	  Ecologists study organisms and environments at several different levels, from the individual to the biosphere. The levels are depicted in Figure 23.2 and described below. For a video introduction to the levels of organization in ecology, click on this link: URL . From individuals to the biosphere, ecology can be studied at several different levels. An individual is an organism, or single living thing. A population is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area. Members of the same population generally interact with each other. A community is made up of all the populations of all the species that live in the same area. Populations in a community also generally interact with each other. An ecosystem consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area. It includes a community, the abiotic factors in the environment, and all their interactions. A biome is a group of similar ecosystems with the same general abiotic factors and primary producers. Biomes may be terrestrial (land-based) or aquatic (water-based). The biosphere consists of all the parts of Earth where life can be found. This is the highest level of organization in ecology. It includes all of the other levels below it. The biosphere consists of all the worlds biomes, both terrestrial and aquatic. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Ecology is the science of how living things interact with each other and their environment. All organisms depend on their environment for energy and matter and are influenced by their environment. Factors in the environment that can affect organisms include biotic factors and abiotic factors. Ecologists study organisms and environments at several different levels. From smallest to largest, they include the individual, population, community, ecosystem, biome, and biosphere. 
Think  Critically 	  The population is an important level of organization in ecology. It is also the unit of microevolution. Define population. Identify measures of population size, growth, and structure. Describe how the human population grew in the past and is predicted to grow in the future. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  age-sex structure carrying capacity demographic transition exponential growth logistic growth population density population distribution population growth rate population pyramid 
Introduction 	  A population is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area. The population is the unit of natural selection, adaptation, and microevolution. In ecology, how large a population is and how quickly it is growing are often used as measures of a species health. 
Population  Size,  Growth, and  Structure 	  Population size is the number of individuals in a population. Population size influences the chances of a species surviving or going extinct. If a species populations become very small, the species may be at risk of going extinct. 
Population  Density and  Distribution 	  Another sign of a species state of health is the density of its populations. Population density is the average number of individuals in a population for a given area. Density is a measure of how crowded or spread out the individuals in a population are on average. For example, a population of 100 deer that live in an area of 10 square kilometers has a population density of 10 deer per square kilometer. Population density is an average measure. Often, individuals in a population are not spread out evenly. Instead, they may live in clumps or some other pattern. How individuals in a population are distributed, or spread throughout their area, is called population distribution. You can see different patterns of population distribution in Figure 23.3. Different patterns characterize different species and types of environments, as you can read in the figure. Patterns of population distribution include clumped, random, and uniform distributions. Each pattern is associated with different types of species or environments. 
Population  Growth 	  Whether its populations are growing or shrinking in size may be another indicator of a species health. Individuals may be added to a population through births and the migration of individuals into the population. Individuals may be lost from a population through deaths and the migration of individuals out of the population. The population growth rate is how quickly a population changes in size over time. The rate of growth of a population may be positive or negative. A positive growth rate means that the population is increasing in size because more people are being added than lost. A negative growth rate means that the population is decreasing in size because more people are being lost than added. Populations may show different patterns of growth. The growth pattern depends partly on the conditions under which a population lives. Two common growth patterns are exponential growth and logistic growth. Both are represented in Figure 23.4. With exponential growth, the population starts out growing slowly. As population size increases, the growth rate also increases. The larger the population becomes, the more quickly it grows. This type of growth generally occurs only when a population is living under ideal conditions. However, it cant continue for very long. With logistic growth, the population starts out growing slowly, and then the rate of growth increasesbut only to a point. The rate of growth tapers off as the population size approaches its carrying capacity. Carrying capacity is the largest population size that can be supported in an area without harming the environment. This type of growth characterizes many populations. Curve A represents exponential population growth. Curve B represents logistic population growth. 
Population  Age and  Sex  Structure 	  Another way of describing a population is its age-sex structure. This refers to the numbers of individuals of each sex and age in the population. The age-sex structure of a population may influence the population growth rate. This is because only individuals of certain ages are able to reproduce, and because individuals of certain ages may be more likely to die. For example, if there are many individuals of reproductive age, there are likely to be many births, causing the population to grow rapidly. The age-sex structure of a population is often represented with a special bar graph called a population pyramid. You can see an example of a population pyramid in Figure 23.5. The graph in the figure actually has a pyramid shape because the bars become narrower from younger to older ages. However, this is not always the case. In some populations, for example, there may be more people at older than younger ages, resulting in a top-heavy population pyramid. Learn more about population pyramids and what you can learn from them, watch this TED video: URL ww.youtube.com/watch?v=RLmKfXwWQtE . 
The  Human  Population 	  Human beings have been called the most successful weed species on Earth. Like garden weeds, populations of human beings grow quickly and disperse rapidly. Human beings have colonized almost every terrestrial part of the planet. Overall, the human population has had a pattern of exponential growth, as you can see in Figure 23.6. The early human population grew very slowly. However, as the population grew larger, it started to grow more rapidly. A population pyramid shows the age-sex structure of a population. This population pyramid represents the human population of the African country of Angola in 2005. Growth of the Human Population. 
Early  Population  Growth 	  The earliest members of the human species evolved around 200,000 years ago in Africa. Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Human beings remained in Africa until about 40,000 years ago. After that, they spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, the first human beings colonized the Americas. During this long period of time, the total number of human beings increased very slowly. Birth rates were fairly high but so were death rates, producing low rates of population growth. Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. 
Demographic  Transition 	  Major changes in the human population first began in the 1700s. These changes occurred mainly in Europe, North America, and a few other places that became industrialized. First death rates fell. Then, somewhat later, birth rates also fell. These changes in death and birth rates affected the rate of population growth and are referred to as the demographic transition. The graph in Figure 23.7 shows the stages in which the demographic transition occurred. You can learn more about the stages by watching this video: URL emographic-transition-definition-stages.html The demographic transition occurred in the stages shown in this graph. In Stage 1, both birth and death rates were high so population growth was slow. In Stage 2, death rates fell while birth rates remained high. Why did death rates fall? There were several reasons, including new scientific knowledge of the causes of disease. Water supplies were cleaned up and sewage was disposed of more safely. Better farming techniques and machines increased the food supply and the distribution of food. For all these reasons, death rates fell, especially in children. Birth rates, on the other hand, remained high. This resulted in faster population growth. Before long, birth rates also started to fall. People started having fewer children because large families became too expensive. For example, with better farming machines, farm families no longer needed as many children to work in the fields. Laws were also passed that required children to go to school. They could no longer work and help support the family. Having many children became too costly. Eventually, birth rates fell to match death rates (Stage 4). As a result, population growth slowed down. 
Recent  Population  Growth 	  Just as they did in Europe and North America, death rates have fallen throughout the world. No country today remains in Stage 1 of the demographic transition. However, birth rates are still high in many of the poorest countries of the world. These populations seem to be stuck in Stage 2 or 3 of the demographic transition. They have high population growth rates because low death rates are not matched by equally low birth rates. Whether these populations will ever enter Stage 4 and attain very low rates of population growth is uncertain. 
Future  Population  Growth 	  As of 2014, there were more than 7 billion human beings on planet Earth. That number is increasing rapidly. More than 200,000 people are added to the human population each day! At this rate, the human population will pass 9 billion by 2050. Many experts think that the human population has reached its carrying capacity. It has already harmed the environment. An even larger human population may cause severe environmental problems. It could also lead to devastating outbreaks of disease, starvation, and war. To solve these problems, two approaches may be needed: Slow down human population growth so there are fewer people. Distribute Earths resources more fairly so that everyone has enough. Hopefully, we will act before its too late. Otherwise, the planet may be ruined for future generations of human beings and other species. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A population is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area. Populations can be described in terms of size, density, and distribution. Population growth may be exponential or logistic. The age-sex structure of a population affects the rate of population growth. The worlds human population has shown exponential growth. It grew very slowly for tens of thousands of years. Then it started growing very rapidly as many populations reached and remained in Stage 2 or 3 of the demographic transition. At the current rate of growth, the human population is predicted to pass 9 billion by 2050. 
Think  Critically 	  A population doesnt exist alone. It is part of a community. Define community. Explain how predation affects predator and prey populations. Describe outcomes of intraspecific and interspecific competition. Identify three types of symbiotic relationships. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  commensalism community competition host keystone species mutualism parasite parasitism predation predator prey symbiosis 
Introduction 	  A community is the biotic component of an ecosystem. It consists of the populations of all the species that live in the same area. Populations in communities often interact with each other. Community interactions are important factors in natural selection. They help shape the evolution of the interacting species. Types of community interactions include predation, competition, and symbiosis. Youll read about each type of interaction in this lesson. 
Predation 	  Predation is a relationship in which members of one species consume members of another species. The consuming species is called the predator. The species that is consumed is called the prey. In Figure 23.8, the wolves are predators, and the moose is their prey. 
Predator and  Prey  Populations 	  A predator-prey relationship tends to keep the populations of both species in balance. Look at the graph in Figure 23.9. As the prey population increases, there is more food for the predators. So after a slight lag time, the predator population also increases. As the number of predators increases, more prey are captured. This causes the prey population to decrease, followed by the predator population decreasing again. 
Keystone  Species 	  Some predator species play a special role in their community. They are called keystone species. When the population size of a keystone species changes, the populations of many other species are affected. Prairie dogs, pictured in Figure 23.10, are an example of a keystone species. Their numbers affect most of the other species in their community. Prairie dog actions improve the quality of soil and water for plants, upon which most other species in the community depend. 
Adaptations to  Predation 	  Both predators and prey have adaptations to predation that evolve through natural selection. Predator adaptations help them capture prey. Prey adaptations help them avoid predators. A common adaptation in both predator and prey species is camouflage. You can see an example in Figure 23.11. You can also see some amazing examples in this video: URL There is a well-camouflaged frog in this photo. Do you see it? 
Competition 	  Competition is a relationship between organisms that depend on the same resources. The resources might be food, water, or space. Competition can occur between organisms of the same species or between organisms of different species. Competition within a species is called intraspecific competition. It leads to natural selection within the species, so the species becomes better adapted to its environment. Competition between different species is called interspecific competition. It might lead to the less well-adapted species going extinct. Or it might lead to one or both species evolving specialized adaptations. For example, competing species might evolve adaptations that allow them to use different food sources. You can see an example in Figure 23.12. These species of birds have evolved different types of beaks to exploit different food sources. This allows them to live in the same area without competing for food. 
Symbiosis 	  Symbiosis is a close relationship between two species in which at least one species benefits. For the other species, the relationship may be beneficial, harmful, or neutral. There are three types of symbiosis: mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism. 
Mutualism 	  Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit. An example of mutualism is pictured in Figure 23.13. The clownfish in the photo is hiding among the tentacles of a sea anemone. The tentacles have stingers that can inject poison in the anemones prey. The clownfish is protected from the stingers by mucus that covers its body. How do the two species benefit from their close relationship? The anemone provides the clownfish with a safe place to live by keeping away predatory fish. The clownfish also feeds on the remains of the anemones prey. In return, the clownfish helps the anemone catch food by attracting prey with its bright colors. Its feces also provide nutrients to the anemone. 
Parasitism 	  Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits and the other species is harmed. The species that benefits is called the parasite. The species that is harmed is called the host. Many species of animals are parasites, at least during some stage of their life cycle. Most animal species are also hosts to one or more parasites. A parasite generally lives in or on its host. An example of a parasite that lives in its host is the hookworm. Figure 23.14 shows two hookworms living inside a human hosts intestines. The hookworms obtain nutrients and shelter from their host, which is harmed by the loss of nutrients and blood. Some parasites kill their host, but most do not. Its easy to see why. If a parasite kills its host, the parasite may also die. Instead, parasites usually cause relatively minor damage to their host. 
Commensalism 	  Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other species is not affected. An example is the relationship between birds called cattle egrets and cattle (see Figure 23.15). Cattle egrets feed on insects. They follow cattle herds around to take advantage of the insects stirred up by the feet of the cattle. The egrets get ready access to food from the relationship, whereas the cattle are not affected. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A community is the biotic component of an ecosystem. It consists of the populations of all the species that live in the same area. Predation is a relationship in which members of one species, called the predator, consume members of another species, called the prey. Competition is a relationship between organisms that depend on the same resources. Competition can occur between members of the same species or between members of different species. Symbiosis is a close relationship between two species in which at least one species benefits. Types of symbiosis include mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism. 
Think  Critically 	  A community is the biotic component of an ecosystem. Define ecosystem. Describe the role of energy and matter in ecosystems. Define niche and habitat, and explain the competitive exclusion principle. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  competitive exclusion principle ecosystem habitat niche 
Introduction 	  The focus of study in ecology is often the ecosystem. Ecosystems are units of nature. Each ecosystem consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and all the ways in which the factors interact. A forest could be an ecosystem, but so could a dead log on the forest floor. Both the forest and the log contain a community of species that interact with each other and with abiotic factors. For an entertaining introduction to ecosystems, watch this great music video: URL . 
Energy and  Matter in  Ecosystems 	  Ecosystems need a constant input of energy to supply the needs of their organisms. Most ecosystems get energy from sunlight. A few ecosystems get energy from chemical compounds. Unlike energy, matter doesnt need to be constantly added to ecosystems. Instead, matter is recycled through ecosystems. Water and elements such as carbon and nitrogen that living things need are used over and over again. 
Key  Ecosystem  Concepts 	  Two important concepts associated with the ecosystem are niche and habitat. 
Niche 	  Niche is the role that a particular species plays in its ecosystem. This role includes all the ways that the species interacts with the biotic and abiotic factors in the ecosystem. A major aspect of any niche is how the species obtains energy and matter. Look at Figure 23.16. The grass in the figure obtains energy from sunlight and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water to sugar by photosynthesis. The deer in the figure gets matter and energy by consuming and digesting the grass. Each species has a different and distinctive niche. 
Habitat 	  Another important aspect of a species niche is its habitat. Habitat is the physical environment in which a species lives and to which it has adapted. Features of a habitat depend mainly on abiotic factors, such as temperature and rainfall. These factors influence the traits of the organisms that live there. Just One Species Please! A given habitat may contain many different species. However, each species in the same habitat must have a different niche. Two different species cannot occupy the same niche in the same habitat at the same time. This is called the competitive exclusion principle. What do you think would happen if two species were to occupy the same niche in the same habitat? The two species would compete for everything they needed in the environment. One species might outcompete and replace the other. Or, both species might evolve different specializations so they can fill slightly different niches. 
Lesson  Summary 	  An ecosystem is a unit of nature. It consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and all the ways in which they interact. Ecosystems need a constant input of energy for their organisms, but matter is recycled through ecosystems. Niche is the role that a particular species plays in its ecosystem. Habitat is the physical environment in which a species lives and to which it has adapted. According to the competitive exclusion principle, two different species cannot occupy the same niche in the same habitat at the same time. 
Think  Critically 	  Similar ecosystems are found in different parts of the world. For example, forests and deserts are found on almost all of Earths continents. Define biome. Explain how climate affects terrestrial biomes, and give examples of terrestrial biomes. Identify freshwater and marine biomes and relate them to sunlight and nutrients. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  aphotic zone aquatic biome biome climate freshwater biome marine biome photic zone terrestrial biome 
Introduction 	  Look at the two photos in Figure 23.17. The left photo shows a forest in South Carolina. The right photo shows Death Valley, a desert in California. Both places are found at about the same latitude, or distance from the equator. However, in many other ways, the two places could hardly be more different. What explains the differences? The South Carolina forest is near an ocean, giving it a wet climate. Death Valley is the rain shadow of mountains, giving it a very dry climate. Two locations in the US at about 35 degrees North latitude: South Carolina forest (left) and California desert (right). The two photos in Figure 23.17 represent two different biomes. A biome is a group of similar ecosystems with the same general abiotic factors and primary producers. Producers are organisms that produce food for themselves and other organisms. Biomes may be terrestrial or aquatic. 
Terrestrial  Biomes 	  Terrestrial biomes are land-based biomes. They range from arctic tundra to tropical rainforests. Figure 23.18 shows the locations of the worlds major terrestrial biomes. 
Terrestrial  Biomes and  Climate 	  Plants are the primary producers in terrestrial biomes. They make food for themselves and other organisms by photosynthesis. The major plants in a given biome, in turn, help determine the types of animals and other organisms that can live there. Which plants grow in a given biome depends mainly on climate. Climate is the average weather in a place over a long period of time. The major climatic factors affecting plant growth are temperature and moisture. 
Examples of  Terrestrial  Biomes 	  You can read about three different terrestrial biomes in Figure 23.19: tropical rainforest, temperate grassland, and tundra. You can learn more about these and other terrestrial biomes by watching this video: URL om/watch?v=dTaWsFct32g . Terrestrial biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate grassland, and tundra. 
Aquatic  Biomes 	  Aquatic biomes are water-based biomes. They include both freshwater biomes, such as rivers and lakes, and marine biomes, which are salt-water biomes in the ocean. The primary producers in most aquatic biomes are phytoplankton. Phytoplankton consist of microscopic bacteria and tiny algae that make food by photosynthesis. Unlike terrestrial biomes, which are determined mainly by temperature and moisture, aquatic biomes are determined mainly by sunlight and dissolved substances in the water. These factors, in turn, depend mainly on depth of water and distance from shore. 
Aquatic  Biomes and  Sunlight 	  Only the top 200 meters or so of water receive enough sunlight for photosynthesis. This part of the water is called the photic zone. Below 200 meters, there is too little sunlight for photosynthesis to take place. This part of the water is called the aphotic zone. In this zone, food must come from other sources. It may be made by chemosynthesis, in which microorganisms use energy in chemicals instead of sunlight to make food. Or, food may drift down from the water above. 
Aquatic  Biomes and  Dissolved  Substances 	  In addition to sunlight, aquatic producers also need dissolved oxygen and nutrients. Water near the surface generally contains more dissolved oxygen than deeper water. Many nutrients enter the water from the land. Therefore, water nearer shore usually contains more dissolved nutrients than water farther from shore. 
Freshwater  Zones 	  A lake is an example of a freshwater biome. Water in a lake generally forms three different zones based on water depth and distance from shore. The shallow water near the shore is called the littoral zone. It has diverse community of organisms. There is adequate light for photosynthesis and plenty of dissolved oxygen and nutrients. Producers include algae and aquatic plants (see Figure 23.20). Animals in this zone may include insects, crustaceans, fish, and turtles. The top layer of water farther from shore is called the limnetic zone. There is enough light for photosynthesis and plenty of dissolved oxygen. However, dissolved nutrients tend not to be as plentiful as they are in the littoral zone. Producers here are mainly phytoplankton. A variety of zooplankton and fish also occupy this zone. The deeper water of a lake makes up the profundal zone. There isnt enough light for photosynthesis in this zone, so most organisms here eat dead organisms that drift down from the water above. Organisms in the profundal zone may include clams, snails, and some species of fish. Plants and algae are producers in the littoral zone along the shore of this lake in Iceland. 
Ocean  Zones 	  Zones in the oceans include the intertidal, pelagic, and benthic zones. The types of organisms found in these ocean zones are also determined by such factors as depth of water and distance from shore, among other factors. One of the most familiar ocean zones is the intertidal zone. This is the narrow strip along a coastline that is covered by water at high tide and exposed to air at low tide. You can see an example of an intertidal zone in Figure 23.21. There are plenty of nutrients and sunlight in the intertidal zone. Producers here include phytoplankton and algae. Other organisms include barnacles, snails, crabs, and mussels. They must have adaptations for the constantly changing conditions in this zone. Other ocean zones are farther from shore in the open ocean. All the water in the open ocean is called the pelagic zone. It is further divided by depth: The top 200 meters of water is the photic zone. Producers here include seaweeds and phytoplankton. Other organisms are plentiful. They include zooplankton and animals such as fish, whales, and dolphins. Below 200 meters is the aphotic zone. There are no primary producers here because there isnt enough sunlight for photosynthesis. However, the water may be rich in nutrients because of dead organisms drifting down from above. Organisms that live here may include bacteria, sponges, sea anemones, worms, sea stars, and fish. The bottom of the ocean is called the benthic zone. It includes the sediments on the bottom of the ocean and the water just above it. Organisms living in this zone include clams and crabs. They may be few in number due to relatively scarce nutrients in this zone. There are many more organisms around deep-sea vents. Microorganisms use chemicals that pour out of the vents to make food by chemosynthesis. These producers support large numbers of other organisms, including crustaceans and red tubeworms like those pictured in Figure 23.22. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A biome is a group of similar ecosystems with the same general abiotic factors and primary producers. Terrestrial biomes are determined mainly by temperature and moisture. Plants are the primary producers. Examples of terrestrial biomes include tropical rainforests, temperate grasslands, and tundra. Aquatic biomes are determined mainly by depth of water and distance from shore. They include freshwater and marine biomes. 
Think  Critically 	  In all biomes, ecosystems need a constant input of energy. Matter, on the other hand, is constantly recycled in ecosystems. .org/wiki/File:Grand_prismatic_spring_edit.jpg (left); URL

Chapter  Outline 	  Sunlight strikes the leaves of this plant. The leaves are like tiny factories. They use the energy in sunlight to manufacture food. Light from the sun is the driving force behind photosynthesis and most of the planets ecosystems. Explain how living things are classified based on the way they obtain energy. Show how food chains and food webs model the flow of energy through ecosystems. Identify trophic levels, and state how they are related to energy and biomass. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  biomass chemoautotroph chemosynthesis consumer decomposer detritivore food chain food web photoautotroph producer saprotroph scavenger trophic level 
Introduction 	  Energy is the ability to change or move matter. All living things need energy. They need energy for everything they do, whether it is to move long distances or simply to carry out basic biochemical processes inside cells. Energy enters most ecosystems in the form of sunlight. In a few ecosystems, energy enters in the form of chemical compounds. All ecosystems need a constant input of energy in one of these two forms. 
Types of  Organisms and  Energy 	  Living things can be classified based on how they obtain energy. Some use the energy in sunlight or chemical compounds directly to make food. Some get energy indirectly by consuming other organisms, either living or dead. 
Producers 	  Producers are living things that produce food for themselves and other organisms. They use energy and simple inorganic molecules to make organic compounds. Producers are vital to all ecosystems because all organisms need organic compounds for energy. Producers are also called autotrophs. There are two basic types of autotrophs: photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs. Photoautotrophs use energy in sunlight to make organic compounds by photosynthesis. They include plants, algae, and some bacteria (see Figure 24.1). Chemoautotrophs use energy in chemical compounds to make organic compounds. This process is called chemosynthesis. Chemoautotrophs include certain bacteria and archaea. The green streaks in this brilliant blue Guatemalan lake are billions of photosynthetic bacteria. 
Consumers 	  Consumers are organisms that depend on other living things for food. They take in organic compounds by eating or absorbing other living things. Consumers include all animals and fungi. They also include some bacteria and protists. Consumers are also called heterotrophs. There are several different types of heterotrophs depending on exactly what they consume. They may be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. Herbivores are heterotrophs that consume producers such as plants or algae. Examples include rabbits and snails. Carnivores are heterotrophs that consume animals. Examples include lions and frogs. Omnivores are heterotrophs that consume both plants and animals. They include crows and human beings. The grizzly bears pictured in Figure 24.2 are also omnivores. 
Decomposers 	  Decomposers are heterotrophs that break down the wastes of other organisms or the remains of dead organisms. When they do, they release simple inorganic molecules back into the environment.	Producers can then use the Grizzly bears eat both plant and animal foods, including grasses, berries, fish, and clams. inorganic molecules to make new organic compounds. For this reason, decomposers are essential to every ecosystem. Imagine what would happen if there were no decomposers. Organic wastes and dead organisms would pile up everywhere, and their nutrients would no longer be recycled. Decomposers are classified by the type of organic matter they break down. They may be scavengers, detritivores, or saprotrophs. Scavengers are decomposers that consume the soft tissues of dead animals. Examples of scavengers include hyenas and cockroaches. Detritivores are decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris that collects on the ground or at the bottom of a body of water. Examples of detritivores include earthworms and catfish. You can see another example in Figure 24.3. Saprotrophs are decomposers that feed on any remaining organic matter that is left after other decomposers do their work. Examples of saprotrophs include fungi and protozoa. 
Modeling the  Flow of  Energy 	  Energy flows through ecosystems from producers, to consumers, to decomposers. Food chains and food webs are diagrams that model this flow of energy. They represent feeding relationships by showing who eats whom. 
Food  Chains 	  A food chain is a diagram that represents a single pathway through which energy flows through an ecosystem. Food chains are generally simpler than what really happens in nature. Thats because most organisms consume and are consumed by more than one species. You can see examples of terrestrial and aquatic food chains in Figure 24.4. See if you can construct a food chain of each type by playing the animation at this link: URL b/eco_info/topics/frogs/chain_reaction/play_chainreaction.cfm 
Food  Webs 	  A food web is a diagram that represents many pathways through which energy flows through an ecosystem. It includes a number of intersecting food chains. Food webs are generally more similar to what really happens in nature. They show that most organisms consume and are consumed by multiple species. You can see an example of a food web in Figure 24.5. 
Trophic  Levels 	  Each food chain or food web has organisms at different trophic levels. A trophic level is a feeding position in a food chain or web. The trophic levels are identified in the food web in Figure 24.5. All food chains and webs have at least two or three trophic levels, but they rarely have more than four trophic levels. The trophic levels are: Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. For example, the bivalves in Figure 24.5 eat both producers and primary consumers. Therefore, they feed at trophic levels 2 and 3. 
Trophic  Levels and  Energy 	  Energy is passed up a food chain or web from lower to higher trophic levels. However, only about 10 percent of the energy at one level is passed up the next level. This is represented by the ecological pyramid in Figure 24.6. The other 90 percent of energy at each trophic level is used for metabolic processes or given off to the environment as heat. This loss of energy explains why there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain or web. There isnt enough energy left to support additional levels. It also explains why ecosystems need a constant input of energy. You can learn more about ecological pyramids in this video: URL . This ecological pyramid shows how energy and biomass decrease from lower to higher trophic levels. 
Trophic  Levels and  Biomass 	  Biomass is the total mass of organisms at a trophic level. With less energy at higher trophic levels, there are usually fewer organisms as well. This is also represented in the pyramid in Figure 24.6. Organisms tend to be larger in size at higher trophic levels. However, their smaller numbers result in less biomass. 
Lesson  Summary 	  All ecosystems need a constant input of energy in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds. Living things can be classified based on how they obtain energy as producers, consumers, or decomposers. Food chains and food webs are diagrams that model the flow of energy through ecosystems. They show who eats whom. A trophic level is a feeding position in a food chain or food web. Most food chains and webs have a maximum of four trophic levels. There is less energy and biomass at higher trophic levels. 
Think  Critically 	  Energy must constantly be added to an ecosystem for use by organisms. Matter, on the other hand, is continuously recycled through ecosystems. Define biogeochemical cycle. Describe the processes of the water cycle. Summarize the carbon cycle. Outline the nitrogen cycle. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  biogeochemical cycle carbon cycle condensation evaporation groundwater nitrogen cycle precipitation runoff sublimation water cycle 
Introduction 	  Where does the water come from that is needed by your cells? What is the source of the carbon and nitrogen that are needed to make your organic molecules? These forms of matter are recycled in an ecosystem. Unlike energy, matter is not lost as it passes through an ecosystem. It just keeps cycling. 
Biogeochemical  Cycles 	  The chemical elements and water that are needed by living things keep recycling on Earth. They pass back and forth through biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Thats why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles. For example, a chemical element or water might move from organisms (bio) to the atmosphere or ocean (geo) and back to organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a biogeochemical cycle. An exchange pool is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a short period of time. For example, the atmosphere is an exchange pool for water. It usually holds water (as water vapor) for just a few days. A reservoir is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a long period of time. For example, the ocean is a reservoir for water. It may hold water for thousands of years. The rest of this lesson describes three biogeochemical cycles: water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. 
Water  Cycle 	  Water is an extremely important aspect of every ecosystem. Life cant exist without water. Most organisms contain a large amount of water, and many live in water. Therefore, the water cycle is essential to life on Earth. Water on Earth is billions of years old. However, individual water molecules keep moving through the water cycle. The water cycle is a global cycle. It takes place on, above, and below Earths surface, as shown in Figure 24.7. During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas (water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice). Many processes are involved as water changes state to move through the cycle. Watch this video for an excellent visual introduction to the water cycle: URL . The water cycle has no beginning or end. It just keeps repeating. 
Evaporation,  Sublimation, and  Transpiration 	  Water changes to a gas by three different processes called evaporation, sublimation, and transpiration. Evaporation takes place when water on Earths surface changes to water vapor. The sun heats the water and gives water molecules enough energy to escape into the atmosphere. Most evaporation occurs from the surface of the ocean. Sublimation takes place when snow and ice on Earths surface change directly to water vapor without first melting to form liquid water. This also happens because of heat from the sun. Transpiration takes place when plants release water vapor through pores in their leaves called stomata. 
Condensation and  Precipitation 	  Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation. Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the atmosphere. It includes rain, snow, sleet, hail, and freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or even longer. Condensation may also form fog or dew. Some living things, like the lizard in Figure 24.8, depend directly on these sources of liquid water. The thorny devil lizard lives in such a dry environment in Australia that it has a unique specialization for obtaining water. The scales on its body collect dew and channel it to the corners of the mouth, so the lizard can drink it. 
Runoff and  Groundwater 	  Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the ground. This water is called runoff. It may eventually flow into a body of water. Some precipitation that falls on land soaks into the ground. This water becomes groundwater. Groundwater may seep out of the ground at a spring or into a body of water such as the ocean. Some groundwater is taken up by plant roots. Some may flow deeper underground to an aquifer. An aquifer is an underground layer of rock that stores water. Water may be stored in an aquifer for thousands of years. 
Carbon  Cycle 	  The element carbon is the basis of all life on Earth. Biochemical compounds consist of chains of carbon atoms and just a few other elements. Like water, carbon is constantly recycled through the biotic and abiotic factors of ecosystems. The carbon cycle includes carbon in sedimentary rocks and fossil fuels under the ground, the ocean, the atmosphere, and living things. The diagram in Figure 24.9 represents the carbon cycle. It shows some of the ways that carbon moves between the different parts of the cycle. You can see an animated carbon cycle at this link: URL ikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Carbon_cycle#mediaviewer/File:Carbon_Cycle-animated_forest.gif 
Carbon  Reservoirs 	  Major reservoirs of carbon include sedimentary rocks, fossil fuels, and the ocean. Sediments from dead organisms may form carbon-containing sedimentary rocks. Alternatively, the sediments may form carbon-rich fossil fuels, which include oil, natural gas, and coal. Carbon can be stored in these reservoirs for millions of years. However, if fossil fuels are extracted and burned, the stored carbon enters the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions, can also release underground carbon from rocks into the atmosphere. Water erosion by runoff, rivers, and streams dissolves carbon in rocks and carries it to the ocean. Ocean water near the surface dissolves carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Dissolved carbon may be stored in the deep ocean for thousands of years. 
Carbon  Exchange  Pools 	  Major exchange pools of carbon include organisms and the atmosphere. Carbon cycles more quickly between these components of the carbon cycle. Photosynthesis by plants and other producers removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make organic compounds for living things. Cellular respiration by living things releases carbon into the atmosphere or ocean as carbon dioxide. Decomposition of dead organisms and organic wastes releases carbon back to the atmosphere, soil, or ocean. 
Nitrogen  Cycle 	  Nitrogen is another common element found in living things. It is needed to form both proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. Nitrogen gas makes up 78 percent of Earths atmosphere. In the nitrogen cycle, nitrogen flows back and forth between the atmosphere and living things. You can see how it happens in Figure 24.10. Several different types of bacteria play major roles in the cycle. Animals get nitrogen by eating plants or other organisms that eat plants. Where do plants get nitrogen? They cant use nitrogen gas in the air. The only form of nitrogen that plants can use is in chemical compounds called nitrates. Plants absorb nitrates through their roots. This is called assimilation. Most of the nitrates are produced by bacteria that live in soil or in the roots of plants called legumes. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria change nitrogen gas from the atmosphere to nitrates in soil. When organisms die and decompose, their nitrogen is returned to the soil as ammonium ions. Nitrifying bacteria change some of the ammonium ions into nitrates. The other ammonium ions are changed into nitrogen gas by denitrifying bacteria. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Water and chemical elements that organisms need keep recycling through biogeochemical cycles. These cycles include biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. The water cycle includes the ocean, atmosphere, ground, and living things. During the water cycle, water keeps changing state by processes such as evaporation, transpiration, condensation, and precipitation. The carbon cycle includes photosynthesis, in which plants change carbon dioxide to organic compounds. It also includes cellular respiration, in which living things burn organic compounds and release carbon dioxide. Rocks, fossil fuels, and the ocean are also part of the carbon cycle. Bacteria play important roles in the nitrogen cycle. They change nitrogen gas and products of decomposition into nitrates, which plants can assimilate. Animals obtain nitrogen by eating plants or other organisms. Still other bacteria return nitrogen gas to the atmosphere. 
Think  Critically 	  Ecosystem dynamics include more than the flow of energy and recycling of matter. Ecosystems are also dynamic because they change through time. Define ecological succession. Explain how primary succession occurs. Explain why secondary succession occurs more rapidly than primary succession. Discuss the concept of climax community. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  climax community ecological succession pioneer species primary succession secondary succession 
Introduction 	  Imagine walking in the forest in Figure 24.11. The towering trees have been growing here for hundreds of years. It may seem as though the forest has been there forever. But no ecosystem is truly static. The numbers and types of species in most ecosystems change to some degree through time. This is called ecological succession. Important cases of ecological succession are primary succession and secondary succession. An old redwood forest seems unchanging, but even here change happens. 
Primary  Succession 	  Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before been colonized by living things. Generally, the area is nothing but bare rock. 
Where  It  Happens 	  This type of environment could come about when: a landslide uncovers bare rock a glacier retreats and leaves behind bare rock lava flows from a volcano and hardens into bare rock (see Figure 24.12) 
How  It  Happens 	  The first few species to colonize a disturbed area are called pioneer species. In primary succession, pioneer species must be organisms that can live on bare rock. They usually include bacteria and lichens (see Figure 24.12). Along with wind and water, the pioneer species help weather the rock and form soil. Once soil begins to form, plants can move in. The first plants are usually grasses and other small plants that can grow in thin, poor soil. As more plants grow and die, organic matter is added to the soil. This improves the soil and helps it hold water. The improved soil allows shrubs and trees to move into the area. 
Secondary  Succession 	  Secondary succession occurs in a formerly inhabited area that was disturbed. 
Where  It  Happens 	  Secondary succession could result from a fire, flood, or human action such as farming. For example, a forest fire might kill all the trees and other plants in a forest, leaving behind only charred wood and soil. 
How  It  Happens 	  Secondary succession is faster than primary succession. The soil is already in place. After a forest fire, for example, the pioneer species are plants such as grasses and fireweed. You can see a forest in this stage of recovery in Figure 24.13. As organic matter from the pioneer species improves the soil, trees and other forest plants will move into the area. You can see the amazing real-world story of secondary succession on Mount St. Helens by watching this short video: URL . Just a few months after a forest fire, fireweed and other pioneer plants are already growing among the charred tree trunks. 
Climax  Community 	  Does a changing ecosystem ever stop changing? Does its community of organisms ever reach some final, stable state? Scientists used to think that ecological succession always ended at a stable state, called a climax community. Now their thinking has changed. Theoretically, a climax community is possible. But continued change is probably more likely for real-world ecosystems. Most ecosystems are disturbed too often to ever develop a climax community. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Ecological succession is the process in which the numbers and types of species in an ecosystem change over time. Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before been colonized. Pioneer species include bacteria and lichens that can grow on bare rock and help make soil. Secondary succession occurs in a formerly inhabited area that was disturbed. Soil is already in place, so pioneer species include small plants such as grasses. Most ecosystems are disturbed too often to attain a final, stable climax community. 
Think  Critically 	  Many ecosystems have changed because of human actions. The human species is responsible for a range of environmental problems. _Atitl%C3%A1n,_Guatemala.jpg?fastcci_from=17139002 . public domain 
Chapter  Outline 	  It was a sunny afternoon when this picture was taken, but youd never know it. Noxious smoke from a steel plant filled the air and obscured the sun. The picture was taken in Houston, Texas, in 1972. Since then, laws have been passed in the U.S. to reduce air pollution. However, air pollution is still a major environmental problem. 
Define air pollution 	  Identify causes and effects of outdoor air pollution. Describe sources and ways of controlling indoor air pollution. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  acid rain air pollution global climate change greenhouse effect 
Introduction 	  The air we breathe plays an important role in maintaining all life on Earth. For example, the atmosphere is a major part of the water cycle. It refills rivers and lakes with fresh water from precipitation. In addition, the atmosphere provides organisms with the gases needed for life. It contains oxygen needed for cellular respiration and carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis. It also contains nitrogen needed for proteins and nucleic acids. Earths atmosphere is vast. However, it has been seriously polluted. Air pollution consists of chemical substances and particles released into the atmosphere, mainly by human actions. Before reading more about the causes of air pollution, watch this video to see some of its devastating effects: URL 4E . 
Outdoor  Air  Pollution 	  The major cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are burned in power plants, factories, motor vehicles, and home heating systems. Ranching and using chemicals such as fertilizers also cause outdoor air pollution. Erosion of soil in farm fields, mining activities, and construction sites adds dust particles to the air as well. Some specific outdoor air pollutants are described in Table 25.1.

Carbon dioxide 	  all fossil fuel burning global climate change Particles (dust, smoke) wood and coal burning respiratory problems 
Mercury 	  coal burning nerve poisoning 
Smog 	  coal burning respiratory problems 
Ground-level ozone 	  motor vehicle exhaust respiratory problems 
Heath  Effects of  Outdoor  Air  Pollution 	  Outdoor air pollution causes serious human health problems. For example, pollutants in the air are major contributors to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Air pollution may trigger asthma attacks and heart attacks in people with underlying health problems. In fact, more people die each year from air pollution than automobile accidents. 
Acid  Rain 	  Air pollution may also cause acid rain. This is rain that is more acidic (has a lower pH) than normal rain. Acids form in the atmosphere when nitrogen and sulfur oxides mix with water in air. Nitrogen and sulfur oxides come mainly from motor vehicle exhaust and coal burning. If acid rain falls into lakes, it lowers the pH of the water and may kill aquatic organisms. If it falls on the ground, it may damage soil and soil organisms. If it falls on plants, it may make them sick or even kill them. Acid rain also damages stone buildings, bridges, and statues, like the one in Figure 25.1. 
Global  Climate  Change 	  Another major problem caused by air pollution is global climate change. Gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels increase the greenhouse effect and raise Earths temperature. The greenhouse effect is a natural feature of Earths atmosphere. It occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, radiate the suns heat back down to Earths surface. Figure 25.2 shows how this happens. Without greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the heat would escape into space. The natural greenhouse effect of Earths atmosphere keeps the planets temperature within a range that can support life. Earths atmosphere creates a natural greenhouse effect that moderates Earths temperature. The rise in greenhouse gases due to human actions is too much of a good thing. It increases the greenhouse effect and causes Earths average temperature to rise. Rising global temperatures, in turn, are melting polar ice caps and glaciers. Figure 25.3 shows how much smaller the Arctic ice cap was in 2012 than it was in 1984. With more liquid water on Earths surface, sea levels are rising. Adding more heat energy to Earths atmosphere also causes more extreme weather and changes in precipitation patterns. Global warming is already causing food and water shortages and species extinctions. These problems will only grow worse unless steps are taken to curb greenhouse gases and global climate change. 
Indoor  Air  Pollution 	  You may be able to avoid some of the health effects of outdoor air pollution by staying indoors on high-pollution days. However, some indoor air is just as polluted as outdoor air. 
Sources of  Indoor  Air  Pollution 	  One source of indoor air pollution is radon gas. Radon is a radioactive gas that may seep into buildings from rocks underground. Exposure to radon gas may cause lung cancer. Another potential poison in indoor air is carbon monoxide. It may be released by faulty or poorly vented furnaces or other fuel-burning appliances. Indoor furniture, carpets, and paints may release toxic compounds into the air as well. Other possible sources of indoor air pollution include dust, mold, and pet dander. 
Controlling  Indoor  Air  Pollution 	  Its easier to control the quality of indoor air than outdoor air. Steps home owners can take to improve indoor air quality include: keeping the home clean so it is as free as possible from dust, mold, and pet dander. choosing indoor furniture, flooring, and paints that are low in toxic compounds such as VOCs (volatile organic compounds). making sure that fuel-burning appliances are working correctly and venting properly. installing carbon monoxide alarms like the one in Figure 25.4 at every level of the home. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Air pollution consists of chemical substances and particles released into the atmosphere, mainly by human actions. Both outdoor and indoor air may be polluted, but indoor air pollution is easier to control. The main cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels. Outdoor air pollution causes human health problems, acid rain, and global climate change. There are many possible sources of indoor air pollution, including radon gas, fuel-burning appliances, and mold. Home owners can take several steps to improve the quality of indoor air. 
Think  Critically 	  Acid rain from air pollution can pollute bodies of water. Define water pollution. Explain how fertilizer in runoff leads to algal blooms and dead zones. Give examples of point-source pollution, and define thermal pollution. Describe how the ocean is being polluted with trash and why ocean water is becoming more acidic. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  algal bloom dead zone nonpoint-source pollution ocean acidification point-source pollution thermal pollution waterborne disease water pollution wetland 
Introduction 	  All living things need water. For most human uses, water must be fresh. Of all the water on Earth, only 1 percent is fresh, liquid water. Most of the rest of Earths water is either salt water in the ocean or ice in glaciers and ice caps. Although water is constantly recycled through the water cycle, Earths water is in danger. Water pollution is an increasing problem. It occurs when chemicals, sewage, trash, or heat enter water resources. Water pollution is threatening the limited supply of water that human beings and other living things depend on. Already, more than 1 billion people worldwide do not have enough clean, fresh water. With the rapidly growing human population and global climate change, the water shortage is likely to get worse. 
Algal  Blooms and  Dead  Zones 	  Water pollution has many causes. One of the biggest causes is fertilizer in runoff. Runoff dissolves fertilizer as it flows over farm fields, lawns, and golf courses. It carries the dissolved fertilizer into bodies of water. More dissolved fertilizer may enter a body of water at the mouth of a river, but there is generally no single point where this type of pollution enters the water. Thats why this type of water pollution is called nonpoint-source pollution. 
Algal  Blooms 	  When fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, the added nutrients cause excessive growth of algae. This is called an algal bloom. You can see one in Figure 25.5. The algae out-compete other water organisms. They may make the water unfit for human consumption or recreation. 
Dead  Zones 	  Eventually, the algae in an algal bloom die and decompose. Their decomposition uses up oxygen in the water so that the water becomes hypoxic (without oxygen). This has occurred in many bodies of fresh water and large areas of the ocean, creating dead zones. Dead zones are areas where the hypoxic water cant support life. A very large dead zone exists in the Gulf of Mexico (see Figure 25.6). Nutrients carried into the Gulf by the Mississippi River caused this dead zone. Cutting down on the use of chemical fertilizers is one way to prevent dead zones in bodies of water. Preserving wetlands is also important. Wetlands are habitats such as swamps, marshes, and bogs where the ground is soggy or covered with water much of the year. Wetlands slow down and filter runoff before it reaches bodies of water. Wetlands also provide breeding grounds for many different species of organisms. 
Point- Source  Pollution 	  Unlike runoff, which enters bodies of water everywhere, some sources of pollution enter the water at a single point. This type of water pollution is called point-source pollution. 
Sewage and  Other  Waste 	  An example of point-source pollution is the release of pollution into a body of water through a pipe from a factory or sewage treatment plant. Waste water from a factory might contain dangerous chemicals such as strong acids, mercury, or lead. Water from a sewage treatment plant might contain untreated or partially treated sewage. Such pollution can make water dangerous for drinking or other uses. You can learn more about the problem of sewage contaminating the water in U.S. coastal communities by watching this video: URL reBKDko6OY . In poor nations, many people have no choice but to drink water from polluted sources. Drinking sewage-contaminated water causes waterborne diseases, due to pathogens such as protozoa, viruses, or bacteria. Most waterborne diseases cause diarrhea. 
Thermal  Pollution 	  If heated water is released into a body of water, it may cause thermal pollution. Thermal pollution is a reduction in the quality of water because of an increase in water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and factories. This water is heated and then returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature. Warm water cant hold as much dissolved oxygen as cool water, so an increase in the temperature of water decreases the amount of oxygen it contains. Fish and other organisms adapted to a particular temperature range and oxygen concentration may be killed by the change in water temperature. 
Ocean  Pollution 	  The ocean is huge but even this body of water is becoming seriously polluted. Climate change also affects the quality of ocean water for living things. 
Plastic  Waste 	  One way that the ocean is becoming polluted is with trash, mainly plastics. The waste comes from shipping accidents, landfill erosion, and the dumping of trash. Plastics may take hundreds or even thousands of years to break down. In the meantime, the waste can be very dangerous to aquatic organisms. Some organisms may swallow plastic bags, for example, and others may be strangled by plastic six-pack rings. You can see some of the trash that routinely washes up on coastlines in Figure 25.7. There are five massive garbage patches floating on the Pacific Ocean. Watch this video to learn more about them: URL . Plastic debris in the ocean washes up on shore in the Hawaiian Islands 
Ocean  Acidification 	  Ocean water normally dissolves some of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, ocean water is also dissolving more carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms a weak acid. With higher levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean water, the water becomes more acidic. This process is called ocean acidification. Ocean acidification can kill some aquatic organisms, including corals and shellfish. It may make it more difficult for other aquatic organisms to reproduce. Both effects of acidification interfere with marine food webs, threatening the survival of many aquatic organisms. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Water pollution occurs when chemicals, sewage, trash, or heat enter water resources. Water pollution is threatening the limited supply of clean, fresh water that human beings and other living things depend on. Fertilizer in runoff leads to algal blooms and dead zones in bodies of water. This type of pollution is called nonpoint-source pollution. Point-source pollution includes waste water from factories and sewage treatment plants. Hot water discharge causes thermal pollution. The ocean is becoming increasingly polluted with trash. Ocean acidification is also occurring because ocean water dissolves some of the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The more acidic water harms aquatic organisms. 
Think  Critically 	  Water is one of our most important natural resources. Define natural resource. Distinguish between renewable and nonrenewable natural resources. Identify pros and cons of different types of energy resources. Explain how to conserve natural resources by reducing, reusing, and recycling. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  biomass energy fossil fuel natural resource nonrenewable resource recycling renewable resource soil solar energy sustainable use wind energy 
Introduction 	  A natural resource is something supplied by nature that helps support life. When you think of natural resources, you may think of fossil fuels, like the coal in the coal field pictured in Figure 25.8. However, sunlight, wind, soil, and living things are also important natural resources. 
Renewable and  Nonrenewable  Resources 	  From a human point of view, natural resources can be classified as either renewable or nonrenewable. 
Renewable  Resources 	  Renewable resources are natural resources that are remade by natural processes as quickly as people use them. Examples of renewable resources include sunlight and wind. They are in no danger of being used up. Metals and some other minerals are considered renewable as well because they are not destroyed when they are used. Instead, they can be recycled and used over and over again. This photo shows a huge coal field in the Philippines as it appears from space. Coal is a fossil fuel and a nonrenewable natural resource. Living things are also renewable resources. They can reproduce to replace themselves. However, living things can be over-used or misused to the point of extinction. For example, over-fishing has caused some of the best fishing spots in the ocean to be nearly depleted, threatening entire fish species with extinction. To be truly renewable, living things must be used wisely. They must be used in a way that meets the needs of the present generation but also preserves them for future generations. Using resources in this way is called sustainable use. 
Nonrenewable  Resources 	  Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that cant be remade or else take too long to remake to keep up with human use. Examples of nonrenewable resources are coal, oil, and natural gas, all of which are fossil fuels. Fossil fuels form from the remains of plants and animals over hundreds of millions of years. We are using them up far faster than they can be replaced. At current rates of use, oil and natural gas will be used up in just a few decades, and coal will be used up in a couple of centuries. Uranium is another nonrenewable resource. It is used to produce nuclear power. Uranium is a naturally occurring chemical element that cant be remade. It will run out sooner or later if nuclear energy continues to be used. Soil is a very important natural resource. Plants need soil to grow, and plants are the basis of terrestrial ecosystems. Theoretically, soil can be remade. However, it takes millions of years for soil to form, so from a human point of view, it is a nonrenewable resource. Soil can be misused and eroded (see Figure 25.9). It must be used wisely to preserve it for the future. This means taking steps to avoid soil erosion and contamination of soil by toxins such as oil spills. Bare soil is easily washed away by heavy rains or winds, but it takes millions of years to replace. Ruts in soil washed away by runoff are evident in this photo. 
Energy  Resources 	  Some of the resources we depend on the most are energy resources. Whether its powering our lights and computers, heating our homes, or providing energy for cars and other vehicles, its hard to imagine what our lives would be like without a constant supply of energy. 
Fossil  Fuels and  Nuclear  Energy 	  Fossil fuels and nuclear energy are nonrenewable energy resources. People worldwide depend far more on these energy sources than any others. Figure 25.10 shows the worldwide consumption of energy sources by type in 2010. Nonrenewable energy sources accounted for 83 percent of the total energy used. Fossil fuels and the uranium needed for nuclear power will soon be used up if we continue to consume them at these rates. Using fossil fuels and nuclear energy creates other problems as well. The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is one of the major greenhouse gases causing global climate change. Nuclear power creates another set of problems, including the disposal of radioactive waste. 
Alternative  Energy  Resources 	  Switching to renewable energy sources solves many of the problems associated with nonrenewable energy. While it may be expensive to develop renewable energy sources, they are clearly the way of the future. Figure 25.11 represents three different renewable energy sources: solar, wind, and biomass energy. The three types are described below. You can watch Bill Nyes introduction to renewable energy resources in this video: URL om/watch?v=grI3BDSGEC4 . Solar energy is energy provided by sunlight. Solar cells can turn sunlight into electricity. The energy in sunlight is virtually limitless and free and creates no pollution to use. Wind energy is energy provided by the blowing wind. Wind turbines, like those in Figure 25.11, can turn wind energy into electricity. The wind blows because of differences in heating of Earths atmosphere by the sun. There will never be a shortage of wind. Sunlight, wind, and living things can all be used as energy resources. Biomass energy is energy provided by burning or decomposing organic matter. For example, when garbage decomposes in a landfill, it releases methane gas. This gas can be captured and burned to produce electricity. Crops such as corn can also be converted into a liquid fuel and added to gasoline. Although biomass is renewable, burning it produces carbon dioxide, similar to fossil fuels. 
Conserving  Natural  Resources 	  Especially when it comes to nonrenewable resources, conserving natural resources is important. Using less of them means that they will last longer. It also means they will impact the environment less. Everyone can help make a difference. There are three basic ways that all of us can conserve natural resources. They are referred to as the three Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. 
Reduce 	  Reducing the amount of natural resources you use is the best way to conserve resources. It takes energy to make new items, and even reusing or recycling items takes energy. You can reduce the amount of natural resources you use by not using the resources in the first place. Often, this involves just being less wasteful. Follow these tips to reduce your use of natural resources: Walk, bike, or use public transit instead of driving. If you must drive, a fuel-efficient vehicle will reduce energy use. Plan ahead to avoid making extra trips. Dont buy more than you need. For example, dont buy more fresh food than you can use without it going to waste. You will not only reduce your use of food. You will also reduce your use of energy resources. It takes a lot of energy to grow, process, and ship many of the foods we buy. When you shop, keep packaging in mind.	"Precycle" by buying items with the least amount of wasted packaging. Use energy-efficient appliances and LED light bulbs. Also, turn off appliances and lights when you arent using them. Both steps will reduce the amount of energy resources you use. Keep the thermostat set low in the winter and high in the summer (see Figure 25.12). Instead of turning up the heat in cold weather, put on an extra layer of clothes to save energy resources. Open windows and use fans in hot weather rather than turning on the air conditioning. If you use air conditioning in hot weather, set the thermostat above normal room temperature to save energy resources. 
Reuse 	  Reusing means to use an item again rather than throwing it away and replacing it. Items can be reused for the same purpose or for a different purpose. Generally, it takes less energy to reuse an item than to recycle it, so choose this option over recycling when you can. Here are some specific tips for reusing natural resources: Consider mending or repairing worn or broken items rather than throwing them out and replacing them. Shop with reuse in mind. You can find great buys at flea markets and resale shops. You may be able to get free items online at free-cycle sites. Youll save money as well as natural resources. You can also sell (or give away) your own reusable items. Reuse cloth shopping bags. Instead of getting new plastic or paper bags for your purchases each time you shop, take your own reusable bag to the store each time. Even little steps can add up and help save natural resources. For example, unwrap gifts carefully and youll be able to reuse the gift wrap on a package for someone else. You can also reuse writing paper that has only been used on one side. Its great for notes and shopping lists. 
Recycle 	  If an item can no longer be used or reused, try to recycle it. Recycling means taking a used item, breaking it down, and reusing the components. It generally takes less energy to recycle materials than obtain new ones. Recycling also keeps waste out of landfills. Some of the items that can be recycled include: glass, paper, cardboard, plastic, aluminum, iron, steel, batteries, electronics, tires, and concrete. You can learn how some of these materials are recycled by watching this video: URL . Even kitchen scraps and garden wastes can be recycled. They can be tossed into a compost bin, like the one in Figure 25.13. The recycled compost gradually breaks down to form rich humus that can be added to lawns and gardens to improve the soil. Encourage your family to recycle if they dont already. Even if you dont have curbside recycling where you live, there are likely to be recycling drop boxes or centers available for recycling many items. If you have recycling bins at school, be sure to use them. If not, raise the issue with your teacher or principal. You can also write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper encouraging everyone in your community to recycle. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A natural resource is something supplied by nature that helps support life. From a human point of view, natural resources can be classified as either renewable or nonrenewable. Renewable resources, such as sunlight and living things, can be remade quickly by natural processes. Nonrenewable resources, such as fossil fuels and soil, cannot be remade or else take millions of years to remake. Nonrenewable energy resources (fossil fuels and nuclear energy) provide most of the energy used today. They may run out, and their use creates environmental problems. Renewable energy resources (such as solar, wind, and biomass energy) will always be available and are generally better for the environment. There are three basic ways to conserve natural resources: reduce, reuse, and recycle. 
Think  Critically 	  Biodiversity is another important natural resource. Define biodiversity. List benefits of biodiversity to people and ecosystems. Describe the sixth mass extinction, and identify its chief causes. Identify ways individuals can protect biodiversity. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  biodiversity exotic species habitat loss sixth mass extinction 
Introduction 	  Its obvious that living things are important natural resources needed by human beings. After all, other species provide us with all of the food we eat. We couldnt survive without them. But thats far from the only reason that other species are important for human survival. Biodiversity is an important natural resource in and of itself. 
Biodiversity 	  Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes. It includes the variation in living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the range of communities and ecosystems in which they live. Scientists have identified about 1.9 million species alive today, but they are discovering new species all the time. How many species actually exist in the world? No one knows for sure because only a small percentage of them have already been discovered. Estimates range from 5 to 30 million total species currently in existence. Many of them live on coral reefs and in tropical rainforests (see Figure 25.14). These two ecosystems have some of the greatest biodiversity on the planet. 
Importance of  Biodiversity 	  Biodiversity is important to human beings for many reasons. For one thing, biodiversity has direct economic benefits. Here are a few of the economic benefits of biodiversity: Besides food, diverse living things provide us with many different products. Some examples include dyes, rubber, fibers, paper, adhesives, and timber. Living things are an invaluable source of medical drugs. More than half of the most important prescription drugs come from wild species. However, only a fraction of species have yet been studied for their medical potential. Certain species may warn us of toxins in the environment. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to toxins because of their permeable skin. Their current high rates of extinction serve as an early warning of environmental damage and danger to us all. Wild organisms maintain a valuable pool of genetic variation. This is important because most domestic species have been bred to be genetically uniform. This puts domestic crops and animals at great risk of dying out due to disease. Some living things provide inspiration for technology. For example, water strider insects like the one in Figure 25.15 have helped engineers develop tiny robots that can walk on water. The robots could be used to monitor water quality, among other useful purposes. 
Ecosystem  Services 	  Biodiversity is important for healthy ecosystems. It generally increases ecosystem productivity and stability. It helps ensure that at least some species will survive environmental change. Biodiversity also provides many other ecosystem services. For example: Plants and algae maintain Earths atmosphere. They add oxygen to the air and remove carbon dioxide when they undertake photosynthesis. Plants help protect the soil. Their roots grip the soil and keep it from washing or blowing away. When plants die, their organic matter improves the soil as it decomposes. Microorganisms purify water in rivers and lakes. They also decompose organic matter and return nutrients to the soil. Certain bacteria fix nitrogen and make it available to plants. Predator species such as birds and spiders control insect pests. They reduce the need for chemical pesticides, which are expensive and may be harmful to human beings and other organisms. Animals, like the bee in Figure below, pollinate flowering plants. Many crop plants depend on pollination by wild animals. 
Extinction 	  Extinction is the complete dying out of a species. Once a species goes extinct, it can never return. More than 99 percent of all the species that ever lived on Earth have gone extinct. Five mass extinctions have occurred in Earths history. They were caused by major geologic and climatic events. The fifth mass extinction wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. 
The  Sixth  Mass  Extinction 	  Evidence shows that a sixth mass extinction is happening right now. Species are currently going extinct at the fastest rate since the dinosaurs died out. Dozens of species are going extinct every day. If this rate continues, as many as half of all remaining species could go extinct by 2050. Why are so many species going extinct today? Unlike previous mass extinctions, the sixth mass extinction is due mainly to human actions. 
Habitat  Loss 	  The single biggest cause of the sixth mass extinction is habitat loss. A habitat is the area where a species lives and to which it has become adapted. When a habitat is disturbed or destroyed, it threatens all the species that live there with extinction. More than half of Earths land area has been disturbed or destroyed by farming, mining, forestry, or the development of cities, suburbs, and golf courses. Habitats that are rapidly being destroyed include tropical rainforests. They are being cut and burned, mainly to clear the land for farming. Half of Earths mature tropical forests have already been destroyed. At current rates of destruction, they will all be gone by 2090. In the U.S., half of the wetlands and almost all of the tall-grass prairies (see Figure 25.17) have already been destroyed for farming. 
Other  Causes of  Extinction 	  There are several other causes of the sixth mass extinction. Most of them contribute to habitat destruction. The burning of fossil fuels has increased the greenhouse effect and caused global climate change. Increasing temperatures are changing basic climate factors of habitats, and rising sea levels are covering them with water. These changes threaten many species. Pollution of air, water, and soil makes habitats toxic to many organisms. A well-known example is the near extinction of the peregrine falcon in the mid-1900s due to the pesticide DDT. Humans have over-harvested trees, fish, and other wild species. This threatens not only their survival but the survival of all the other species that depend on them. Humans have introduced exotic species into new habitats. These are species that are not native to the habitat where they are introduced. They may lack predators in the new habitat so they can out-compete native species and drive them extinct. Exotic species may also carry new diseases, prey on native species, and disrupt local food webs. You can read about an example of an exotic species in Figure 25.18. Purple loosestrife is a European wildflower that was introduced to North America in the early 1800s. It soon spread to take over wetland habitats throughout the U.S. and Canada. Purple loosestrife replaces native wetland plants and threatens native wildlife by eliminating natural foods and cover. It also blocks irrigation systems. 
Protecting  Biodiversity 	  Government policies and laws are needed to protect biodiversity. Such actions have been shown to work in the past. For example, peregrine falcons made an incredible recovery after laws were passed banning the use of DDT. Individuals can also play a role in protecting biodiversity. What can you do? Here are a few suggestions: Start a compost pile to recycle organic wastes. Use the compost to enrich yard and garden soil. It will reduce the need for chemical fertilizers and added water. Make your backyard welcoming to native wildlife. Plant native plants that will provide food and shelter for native animals such as birds and amphibians. Add a water source, such as a fountain or bird bath. Avoid the introduction of exotic species to local habitats. Avoid the use of herbicides and pesticides. In addition to killing garden weeds and pests, they may harm native organisms, such as wildflowers, honey bees, and song birds. Conserve natural resources, including energy resources. Always reduce, reuse, or recycle. Learn more about biodiversity and how to protect it. Then pass on what you learn to others. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes. Biodiversity has direct economic benefits. It also increases ecosystem productivity and stability and provides vital ecosystem services. Extinction is the complete dying out of a species. Five mass extinctions have occurred in Earths history, caused by major geologic and climatic events. A sixth mass extinction is happening right now. The single biggest cause of the current mass extinction is habitat loss due to human actions. Government policies and laws are needed to protect biodiversity, but individuals can also play a role. 
Think  Critically 	  The human species has been incredibly successful. In a relatively short period of time, it has colonized almost all of Earths terrestrial habitats. Unfortunately, human beings have also impacted Earth, its climate, and its environment. Human actions threaten Earths valuable biodiversity.
