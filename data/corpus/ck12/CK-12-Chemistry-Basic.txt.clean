Chapter  Outline 	  Diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by the bodys inability to regulate glucose levels. Glucose (a component of table sugar) is needed to provide biochemical energy for all the cells of the body. When this process is disrupted, the body begins to break down fat and protein to provide the needed energy, which can eventually lead to death. Diabetes is mediated by a protein called insulin. A key piece of our understanding of diabetes came when Frederick Sanger, a British biochemist, carried out experiments to determine the structure of the insulin molecule. Sanger (shown in the opening image) used basic chemistry techniques and reactions and took twelve years to complete his research. Today, automated instruments based on his approach can perform the same analysis in a matter of days. Sanger was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 for his insulin research. The chemical processes that won Sanger the Nobel Prize is pictured on the right in the opening image. In this chapter, we will look at the history of chemistry, see the many areas of our lives that are touched by chemistry, and develop a basic understanding of what is involved in the process of scientific discovery.

A  Brief  History of  Chemistry 	  What is Chemistry? If we look up the word  chemistry in the dictionary, well find something like this: The science of the composition, structure, properties, and reactions of matter, especially of atomic and molecular systems (Free Online Dictionary). This definition is accurate, but it does not give us a good picture of the scope of chemistry or any practical aspects of the field. Chemistry touches every area of our lives. The medicines we take, the food we eat, the clothes we wear all these materials and more are, in some way or another, a product of chemistry. Later on in this chapter, we will look in detail at some of the ways that chemistry contributes to our lives. Where Did Chemistry Come From? Although the systematic study of chemistry is relatively new, chemical techniques have been used for thousands of years. Some civilizations kept good records of these techniques, which give us direct information about what earlier people knew. Fields of study such as archaeology provide additional information. Legends and folklore are also useful tools to learn about the chemical knowledge of previous cultures. Thousands of years ago, the ancient Egyptians used chemical practices to develop techniques for producing perfumes and dyes. Studies of objects found in Egyptian tombs show that materials for coloring fabrics were known as far back as 2600 B.C. Another area of chemistry that was highly developed by the early Egyptians was metallurgy. Beginning in about 3400 B.C., records show a highly developed technology for refining copper, gold, iron, and other metals. Although the reasons these techniques worked were not fully understood, the refiners were able to produce high-quality materials that were used in jewelry, decorations, and money. Glass production also appears to have been first developed by the Egyptians (see Figure 1.1). A number of tomb paintings show glass-blowing and the manufacturing of glass products. The glass was often colored, suggesting an understanding of the use of dyes for decoration. Various types of medicines were also discovered by many ancient people. Records from civilizations around the world show that certain plants were used for healing specific disorders and for dealing with pain. The earliest medical textbook consisted of hundreds of clay tablets found in Mesopotamia, dating from about 2600 B.C. These tablets had information about thousands of plants and plant materials that had beneficial effects. An Egyptian papyrus from around 1550 B.C had over 800 prescriptions and 700 natural materials that were used for medical treatment (see Figure 1.2). The famous Greek physician Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.) wrote about using lemon juice as a laxative and an extract from the belladonna plant as an anesthetic. Indian writings from around 900 B.C. describe the preparations of over 300 different medicines. Traditional Chinese medicine has records from 350 B.C. that describe over 240 medicinal preparations and 150 drug combinations used to treat various ailments. Oral traditions from both North and South America also describe preparations used for healing. Some South American tribes used the venom from specific frogs (usually very brightly colored ones) for poisons. The chemical properties of these substances was not understood at the time, but chemical techniques were often used to isolate and purify various useful materials. 
The  Rise and  Fall of the  Alchemists 	  One area of technology present in all of the societies we have mentioned was metallurgy. Properly refined metals could be made into useful tools that could last a long time. Weapons could stay sharp longer with improved metals. Additionally, precious metals such as gold and silver could be refined and used in jewelry or as money. Because it was fairly rare, gold was considered to be very valuable and became a common means of paying for goods and services. We dont know exactly when humans began mining for gold. Items made from gold have been found in Bulgarian graves that are over 7000 years old. Archaeological studies show clear evidence of gold mining in many parts of the world from over 4000 years ago. During the time of the Roman Empire, the Romans had developed very sophisticated methods for extracting gold from the earth. However, mining for gold is a slow, dirty, and dangerous process. Additionally, not everyone owns a gold mine in Pictures of herbal medicines. The Arabic text is from around 1330 A.D. both the ancient Egyptian society and during the Roman Empire, the gold mines were the property of the state and did not belong to any one individual or group. As a result, there were few ways for most people to legally get any gold for themselves. The alchemists were a varied group of scholars and charlatans ( Figure 1.3). Two of the ultimate goals of alchemy were to create the Philosophers Stone (which is a substance that could cause the transmutation of lead into gold) and the Elixir of Life (which would bestow immortality on the person who possessed it). The origin of the term alchemy is uncertain, and the roots of this word are related to a number of Greek, Arabic, and ancient Egyptian words. Three major branches of alchemy are known (Chinese, Indian, and European), and all three have certain factors in common. We will not focus on the philosophical or religious aspects of alchemy, but we will look briefly at the techniques developed by European alchemists that ultimately influenced the development of the science of chemistry. Many of the specific approaches that alchemists used when they tried changing lead into gold are vague and unclear. Each alchemist had his own methods of recording data, and the processes were kept secret so that others could not profit from them. Different scholars developed their own set of symbols as they recorded the information they came up with (see an example in Figure 1.4). Also, many alchemists were not very honest; it was not uncommon for an alchemist to take money from a nobleman by claiming to be able to make gold from lead and then to leave town in the middle of the night. Sometimes the nobleman would detect the fraud and have the alchemist hung. By the 1300s, several European rulers had declared alchemy to be illegal and set out strict punishments for those practicing the alchemical arts. An alchemical procedure and symbols. However, despite this secrecy several contributions were made to modern-day chemistry. Early acids and bases were discovered, and glassware for running chemical reactions was developed. Alchemy helped improve the study of metallurgy and the extraction of metals from ores. More systematic approaches to research were being developed, although the idea of orderly scientific experimentation was not yet well-established. The groundwork was being laid for the development of chemistry as a foundational science. The alchemists were never successful in changing lead into gold. Remarkably, modern nuclear physics can accomplish this task. If lead is subjected to nuclear bombardment in a particle accelerator, a small amount of gold can eventually be obtained. However, the cost of this procedure is far more than the value of the gold that can be obtained, so the dream of the alchemists has never (and will never) come true. 
Events in the  History of  Chemistry 	  The history of chemistry is an interesting and challenging one. As we have already seen, very early chemists often were motivated mainly by the achievement of a specific goal or product. The manufacturing of perfume or soaps did not require a high level of theory, just a good recipe and careful attention to detail. Since there was no standard way of naming materials (and no periodic table that everyone could agree on), it was often difficult to figure out exactly what a particular individual was using. Nevertheless, the science of chemistry gradually developed over the centuries. Major progress was made in putting chemistry on a solid foundation when Robert Boyle (1637-1691) began his research in chemistry. He developed basic ideas that allowed the behavior of gases to be described mathematically. Boyle also helped formulate the idea that small particles could combine to form molecules, which was expanded by John Dalton into an atomic theory a number of years later. The field of chemistry began to develop rapidly in the 1700s, mainly through the discovery and isolation of specific materials. Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) isolated and characterized several gases, including oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide. It was later discovered that nitrous oxide (laughing gas) worked as a general anesthetic, and it was first used for that purpose in 1844 during a tooth extraction. Other gases discovered during that time included chlorine, by C.W. Scheele (1742-1786), and nitrogen, by Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794). Lavoisier is considered by many scholars to be the father of chemistry. Chemistry in the 1800s continued the discovery of new compounds, but a more theoretical foundation also began to develop. John Dalton (1766-1844) put forth his atomic theory in 1807. These ideas allowed scientists to think about chemistry in a much more systematic way. It was also during this time that Avogadro (1776-1856) laid the groundwork for a more quantitative approach to chemistry by calculating the number of particles present in a given amount of a gas. Greater effort was put forth in studying chemical reactions and seeing what new materials could be produced. Following the invention of the battery by Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), the field of electrochemistry was developed through major contributions by Humphry Davy (1778-1829) and Michael Faraday (1791-1867). Other areas of the discipline, including both theoretical ideas and their practical applications, also progressed rapidly. It would take a very large book to cover every development in the history of chemistry, even if we started only at the beginning of the twentieth century. The history of specific areas will be explored as certain topics are introduced in later chapters. One major area of expansion was in the study of the chemistry of living processes. Research on photosynthesis in plants, the discovery and characterization of enzymes as biochemical catalysts, the elucidation of the structures of biomolecules such as insulin and DNA, and numerous other scientific efforts gave rise to an explosion of information in the field of biochemistry. The practical aspects of chemistry are numerous as well. The work of Volta, Davy, and Faraday eventually led to the development of batteries that provided a source of electricity to power a number of devices. Charles Goodyear (1800-1860) discovered the process of vulcanization, which produced a stable rubber product that is used in the tires of all modern vehicles. Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) pioneered the use of heat sterilization to eliminate unwanted microorganisms in wine and milk. Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) invented dynamite. After his death, the fortune he made from this product was used to fund the Nobel Prizes in science and the humanities. J.W Hyatt (1837-1920) developed the first plastic and Leo Baekeland (1863-1944) developed the first synthetic resin, which are widely used for inexpensive and sturdy dinnerware. 
Examples of  Modern  Chemistry 	  From the time we get up in the morning until the time we go to bed at night, chemistry touches our lives in many ways. What we eat, what we wear, how we get around, those cool electronic gadgets we cant live without chemistry has contributed in some way to the making of each of these things. Lets take a look at several areas where chemistry has an impact on how we live. 
Clothing 	  Many of the fibers that compose the materials for our clothes are naturally occurring. Silk and cotton are examples of natural fibers. Silk is produced by the silkworm, and cotton is grown as a plant. However, several chemical processes are used to treat silk thread so that it is shrink-resistant and will repel water. Chemical dyes are frequently used to color various fabrics. Cleaning requires special soaps or chemicals used to dry-clean materials. Cotton will grow better if the boll weevil (an insect that kills the plant) is eliminated with the use of specific insecticides. Ironing of cotton is made easier by the use of chemicals that produce a permanent press in the material. Other fabrics are human-made, such as nylon, orlon, polyester, and a number of other polymers. Many of these materials are made from hydrocarbons found in petroleum products. Synthetic polymers are also used in shoes, raingear, and camping items. The synthetic fabrics tend to be lighter than the natural ones and can be treated to make them water-resistant and more durable. Much protective apparel has its roots in chemical processes. KevlarTM is a tough polymer that is used for helmets and body armor in combat situations. First used to replace steel in racing tires, KevlarTM is now found in bicycle tires, sails, and even rope. 
Transportation 	  Car bodies were at one time made primarily of sheet metal, which could be pounded out fairly easily in case of a collision. Today, most bodies are plastic and need to be replaced when damaged. Plastic parts are easier to manufacture and are lighter in weight than metal ones. Many of the engine components are made of special metals to increase the lifetime of the engine and to make it more efficient. Gasoline and oils are complex chemical mixtures designed to burn in a way that will efficiently produce energy while emitting a minimal amount of air pollution. The refining of gasoline has improved engine performance but is much more complicated than simply using the crude products extracted from oil wells, as was common in the late 1800s. Most gasoline contained lead at one time, because this additive helped the engine run more smoothly. However, this caused lead contamination in the environment, so new unleaded formulations were created that could be burned smoothly without the addition of poisonous heavy metals. Oils for lubrication have special additives that reduce engine wear. Some special fuel blends have also been created to generate more power in race car engines. 
Farming and  Gardening 	  Three of the most important requirements for crop growth are water, nutrient-rich soil, and protection from predators such as insects. Chemistry has made major contributions in all three of these areas. Water purification uses chemical and physical techniques to remove salt and harmful contaminants that could pollute the soil. Through chemical analysis of soil, farmers can see what nutrients the soil is lacking so these nutrients can be added. In the spring, grocery stores, hardware stores, and gardening centers have high stacks of bags containing fertilizers and weed killers that farmers can then use to enrich the soil and keep unwanted plants from using up the limited water and nutrients in the soil. These same stores also provide a number of chemical sprays or solid treatments to ward off insects that might otherwise snack on the plants. 
Health  Care 	  Major contributions to health care have been made by chemistry. The development of new drugs involves chemical analysis and the synthesis of new compounds. Practically all of the drugs that you might see advertised on television were designed and created by chemists. Clinical laboratory tests for things like high cholesterol or diabetes use a wide variety of analytical chemical techniques and instruments. Chemistry also contributes to the preparation and use of surgical materials such as stitches, artificial skin, and sterile materials. Laboratory tests that at one time were only available in hospitals can now be found in your local drug store because of developments in chemistry. For example, you can test your blood glucose using a simple portable device that runs a chemical test on a blood sample ( Figure 1.9). This allows a diabetic patient to monitor their blood glucose more easily throughout the day, and regulate how much insulin to administer. Chemistry is also used to produce the insulin drug and disposable syringe that administers the drug. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Chemistry has a long and interesting history. All societies have used some facets of chemistry in the past, but it was only recently developed into a systematic field of science. Although the alchemists never did achieve their goal of making gold from lead, they did give us some useful chemical tools. *Modern chemistry contributes in many areas of our lives, making them easier, safer, and healthier.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  How did ancient civilizations know what chemical processes to use? How Do We Know What We Know? 
Earth,  Air,  Fire, and  Water 	  Humans have always wondered about the world around them. One of the questions of interest was (and still is) what is this world made of? Among other definitions, chemistry has often been defined as the study of matter. What matter consists of has been a source of debate over the centuries. One of the key arenas for this debate in the Western world was Greek philosophy. Philosophy literally means love of wisdom. The Greek philosophers held a great deal of influence in societys general knowledge and belies from about the seventh century to the first century B.C. As the Roman Empire became more powerful, Greek ideas were gradually supplanted by Roman ones. However, many of the ideas carried over into medieval Europe where they were reexamined along with the rise of modern scientific thought. In ancient Greece, the basic approach to answering questions about the world was through discussion and debate. There was very little gathering of information, and it was believed that the best way to answer fundamental questions was through reasoning and talking. As a result, several ideas about matter were put forth, but these ideas could not really be proven or disproven. For example, Thales of Miletus (~625-545 B.C.) believed that water was the fundamental unit of matter, whereas Anaximenes (~585-525 B.C.) felt that air was the basic unit. Empedocles (~490-430 B.C.) argued for the idea that matter was composed of earth, air, fire, and water. Each of these men had reasons they could offer to support their theories, but there was no way to prove who was right. The first major philosopher to gather data through observation was Aristotle (384-322 B.C., shown in Figure 1.10). He recorded many observations about the weather, the life and behaviors of plants and animals, physical motions, and a number of other topics. Aristotle could potentially be considered the first real scientist, because he made systematic observations of nature before trying to understand what he was seeing. Although Aristotle contributed greatly to Greek knowledge, not all of his observations led to correct theories. Leucippus (~480-420 B.C.) and his student Democritus (~460-370 B.C.) proposed some theories about matter that Aristotle later opposed. Since Aristotles influence was so great, others chose to reject these theories in favor of Aristotles ideas. However, it turned out that Aristotle was wrong and Leucippus and Democritus were right, but at the time there was no method for proving or disproving these opposing theories. It took almost 2000 years for people to reconsider this issue since Aristotle was held in such high regard by scholars. 
Inductive and  Deductive  Reasoning 	  Two approaches to logical thinking developed over the centuries. These two methods are inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning involves making specific observations, and then drawing a general conclusion. Deductive reasoning begins with a general principle and a prediction based on this principle; the prediction is then tested, and a specific conclusion can then be drawn. The first step in the process of inductive reasoning is making specific observations. In the periodic table of elements, which we will discuss later, there is a group of metals with similar properties called the alkali metals. The alkali metals include elements such as sodium and potassium. If I put sodium or potassium in water, I will observe a very violent reaction every time. I draw a general conclusion from these observations: all alkali metals will react violently with water. In deductive reasoning, I start with a general principle. For example, say I know that acids turn a special material called blue litmus paper red. I have a bottle of vinegar, which I believe is an acid, so I expect the litmus paper to turn red when I immerse it in the vinegar. When I dip the litmus paper in the vinegar, it does turn red, so I conclude that vinegar is in fact an acid. You can see that in order for deductive reasoning to lead to correct conclusions, the general principle you begin with must be true. I can only conclude that vinegar is an acid based on the accuracy of the general principle that acids turn blue litmus paper red. Inductive and deductive reasoning can be thought of as opposites. For inductive reasoning, we start with specific observations and draw a general conclusion. For deductive reasoning, we start with a general principle and use this principle to draw a specific conclusion. 
The  Idea of the  Experiment 	  Inductive reasoning is at the heart of what we call the scientific method. In European culture, this approach was developed mainly by Francis Bacon (1561-1626), a British scholar. He advocated the use of inductive reasoning in every area of life, not just science. The scientific method as developed by Bacon and others involved several steps: Note that this should not be considered a cookbook for scientific research. Scientists do not sit down with their daily to do list and write down these steps. The steps may not necessarily be followed in order, and testing a given explanation often leads to new questions and observations that can result in changes to the original hypothesis. However, this method does provide a general outline of how scientific research is usually done. During the early days of the scientific enterprise (up to the nineteenth century), scientists generally worked as individuals. They may have had an assistant to help with preparing materials, but their work was usually solitary. Their results might be disseminated in a letter to friends or at a scientific society meeting. Today the practice of science is very different. Research is carried out by teams of people, sometimes at a number of different locations. The details of methods and the results of the experiments are published in scientific journals and books, as well as being presented at local, national, or international meetings. Electronic publication on the Internet speeds up the process of sharing information with others. Before conclusions can be considered reliable, experiments and results must be replicated in other labs. In order for other scientists to know that the information is correct, the experiments need to be done in other labs to obtain the same results. Researchers in other labs may get ideas for new experiments that could confirm the original hypothesis. On the other hand, they may see flaws in the original thinking and experiments that would suggest the hypothesis was false. The modern scientific approach of carefully recording experimental procedures and data allows results to be tested and replicated to that everyone can have confidence in the final results. A good experiment must be carefully designed to test the hypothesis. Lets think back to our example of inductive reasoning in observing reactions with alkali metals and water. We believe that all alkali metals produce violent reactions with water. To test this hypothesis, we must design an experiment in which we can observe the reactions of each alkali metal with water. We will test each alkali metal: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium. In order for this experiment to produce consistent results, we should use the same amount of water and same size sample of these metals each time a test is formed. Based on our hypothesis, we expect a violent reaction to occur when any one of these metals is added to water. If a sample of lithium is added to our water and we observe a small explosion, our hypothesis is strengthened. If lithium is added to our water and nothing happens, our hypothesis must not be true. We can either modify our hypothesis to include this new data, or replace our hypothesis with a new one. When a hypothesis is confirmed repeatedly, it eventually becomes a theory. A theory is a general principle that is offered to explain a natural phenomenon. A theory offers a description of why something happens. Although theories, like hypotheses, can be disproved, it is more likely for a theory to be modified. However, while a hypotheses is a suggested explanation of a phenomena, a theory is a proved explanation based off of many hypotheses and much experimentation. Over time, theories evolve with new research and data, but are rarely discarded completely. A law, on the other hand, is a statement that is always true, but does not include an explanation as to why. The law of gravity says a rock will fall when dropped, but it does not explain why (gravitational theory is very complex and incomplete at present). The kinetic-molecular theory of gases, on the other hand, tells us what happens when a gas is heated in a closed container (the pressure increases), but also explains why (the motions of the gas molecules are increased due to the change in temperature). Theories do not get promoted to laws, because laws do not answer the why question. 
Phlogiston -  The  Rise and  Fall of a  Theory 	  Early chemists spent a lot of time heating things and setting them on fire (on purpose, unlike some modern-day chemistry students). They observed that flammable materials tended to weigh less after being burned. As more materials were studied, this observation was found to be very consistent. A seemingly reasonable explanation for this phenomenon was that some substance was lost from the material when it was burned. This substance was named phlogiston from the Greek word ??o????? (transliterated as phlogistn), which means burning up. The phlogiston theory was first put forth in 1667 by the German physician and alchemist Johann Joachim Becher (16351682, shown in Figure 1.11). Becher had taken the four ancient Greek elements (earth, air, fire, and water) and discarded fire and air. He expanded the earth category to three groups, one of which was involved in burning. In 1703, George Stahl, a German professor of medicine and chemistry, renamed this particular fraction of Bechers earth as phlogiston. What was the evidence that led to the development of this theory? One obvious experiment involved the burning of wood. The ashes remaining after the fire weighed considerably less than that original wood sample. Therefore, it seemed that phlogiston had been released during the burning process, leaving the dephlogisticated ashes behind. If wood or a candle was burned in a closed container, the fire would soon be extinguished. This was taken by supporters of the theory as evidence that air could only absorb so much phlogiston. Later, carbon dioxide gas was discovered and studied. An experiment was performed in 1772 that exhausted all the air in a container. Further burning of a candle and of phosphorus were then carried out in the container. After removing the carbon dioxide with an absorbent, a gas was found that did not support life or combustion. This gas (which we now know as nitrogen and which comprises about 78% of the atmosphere) was believed to be phlogiston. So far, so good. We have observations  things lose weight when they burn. We have an explanation  the original material loses phlogiston when it burns. What we dont know is what phlogiston is or how much of it is in a given material. But are there other experiments that lead us in a different direction? Other scientists started to ask questions and run experiments. They noticed some results that seemed to contradict what would be expected if the phlogiston theory was correct. If magnesium is heated, the product (a solid) weighs more than the original magnesium metal. The explanation offered was that phlogiston had negative weight in this case. Can the same material have both a positive weight and a negative weight? When mercuric oxide was heated in the absence of any charcoal, it returned to its pure metal form. The phlogiston theory would require that charcoal (thought to be essentially pure phlogiston) be present to provide the phlogiston for restoring the metal. The French scientist Antoine Lavoisier ( Figure 1.12) carried out studies on oxygen (which had originally been discovered by Joseph Priestley, an ardent supporter of the phlogiston theory). Lavoisier found that when mercury was heated, it would become mercuric oxide and gain weight. When the mercuric oxide was heated, it returned to mercury and released a gas he identified as oxygen. He also carried out a number of experiments that conclusively demonstrated the essential role of oxygen in combustion processes. Antoine Lavoisier and his wife Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze, who was also a chemist and made contributions to the work of her husband. Eventually the phlogiston theory was replaced by the oxygen-based combustion ideas developed by Lavoisier and others. Today the theory is studied as an example of how to approach a scientific question and how one theory can be supplanted by another theory that more closely fits the data. It should also be noted that the phlogiston idea took time to develop, it took time to become accepted, and it took time for researchers to discard it in favor of a better theory. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The early Greek philosophers spent a great deal of time talking about nature, but they did little or no actual exploration or investigation. Inductive reasoning means developing a general conclusion from a collection of observations. Deductive reasoning means making a specific statement based on a general principle. Scientific method is a process consisting of making observations, developing a hypothesis, and testing that hypothesis. Phlogiston theory is the disproven idea that materials lost phlogiston when they burned. 
Information about  Lavoisier and phlogiston theory: http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~meg3c/classes/tcc313/200 Rpr ojs/lavoisier2/home.html 	  Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes that matter can undergo. What is matter? Where do you encounter matter in your everyday life? What are the states of matter? Can matter be changed? 
Matter and  Change 	  Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space. Matter is everywhere. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, and the ground we walk on are all comprised of matter. Matter can take on a variety of different forms which all have a variety of different properties. In this chapter, we will introduce the characteristics of matter and study how these characteristics vary in different types of matter. Image copyright Africa Studio, 2014. URL Used under license from Shutterstock.com. Classify properties of materials as extensive, intensive, chemical, or physical. Give examples of each. Describe the concepts of intensive and extensive properties and be able to describe these properties in a given material. Describe the concepts of physical properties and chemical properties and be able to describe these properties for a given material. Explain the concept of density as it relates to other physical properties of matter. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  chemical properties: Properties that describe matters reactions with other substances. physical properties: Properties of matter that can be observed without changing the matters composition. intensive properties: Physical properties that are independent on the amount of a substance present. extensive properties: Physical properties that depend on the amount of a substance present. What are some ways that you can distinguish different substances from each other? For example, what is different between sand and sugar? 
Introduction 	  All substances have special properties by which they can be identified. For instance, substances have unique colors, densities, and boiling points. They also behave in unique ways with other substances. For example, they may react with air, water, or acids. In chemistry, we study these properties and use them to identify and categorize matter. 
Chemical  Properties 	  All types of matter exhibit chemical properties. Chemical properties are the properties that describe matters reactions with other substances. We can determine these chemical properties by seeing what happens to a substance when it is placed in the presence of the following: air water an acid a base other chemicals Chemical properties indicate how the composition of a substance will change when exposed to various other substances. You can observe many chemical properties in the objects around you. For example, the metal frame of a bicycle will become rusty over time. The process of the frame becoming rusty can be described by a chemical property of iron, one of the metals in the frame. The iron will react with the oxygen in the air to form iron oxide, or rust. (A) Elemental iron. (B) Oxidized iron plate. (C) Iron burning. In the Figure 2.1 we can observe the difference in color between pure iron, which is a lustrous dark gray color, and rusted iron, which is a cinnamon colored. We can also observe the reaction that takes place when iron is heated by a flame, in which the hot air to reacts more rapidly with the pure iron. The changes that iron undergoes when exposed to air show us some of irons chemical properties and help us to classify iron as specific type of matter. 
Example 2.1 	  Which of the following would be examples of a chemical property? A. Most metals will react with acids. B. Water can be a solid, liquid, or a gas. C. Water mixes well with ethanol. Answer: A is an example of chemical properties. Statement B does not reflect chemical properties; these are physical characteristics of water. The process described in answer C would not be a chemical property because no reaction takes place. There are no changes in the composition of either the water or the ethanol as a result of the mixing, and both components can be separated from one another using physical processes. 
Physical  Properties 	  Matter also exhibits physical properties. Physical properties are used to observe and describe matter. Physical properties can be observed or measured without changing the composition of matter. These are properties such as mass, weight, volume, and density. Density calculations will be discussed later on in chapter three, but for now just remember that density is a physical property. 
Intensive  Properties 	  Physical properties that do not depend on the amount of substance present are called intensive properties. Intensive properties do not change with changes of size, shape, or scale. Examples of intensive properties are as follows in the Table 2.1. TABLE 2.1: 
Example 	  color Aluminum metal is gray colored. taste Lemon juice (citric acid) is sour. melting point Aluminum has melting point of 660C. boiling point Water has a boiling point of 100C. density Water has a density of 1 g/mL. luster Metals are lustrous (shiny). hardness Diamond is the hardest substance known. 
Extensive  Properties 	  Physical properties that do depend on the amount of substance present are called extensive properties. Examples of extensive properties include: 
Example 2.2 	  Which of the following is an intensive property of a box of crackers? A. Calories per serving. B. Total grams. C. Total number of crackers. D. Total calories. Answer: A. Calories per serving. Total grams, total crackers, and total number of calories are extensive properties. A larger amount of crackers would have more grams, crackers, and total calories but the same number of calories per serving. 
Example 2.3 	  Which of the following is an extensive property? A. The color of charcoal is black. B. Gold is shiny. C. The volume of orange juice is 25 mL. Answer: C. The volume of orange juice is 25 mL. Charcoals black color and golds luster are intensive properties, and are not dependent on how much charcoal or gold is present. However if you had more or less orange juice, its volume would not stay the same. So, this is an extensive property. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space. The properties of matter can be classified as either chemical or physical. Chemical properties describe the reactions that can occur when matter is treated with other substances, such as how a substance reacts with air or with an acid. Physical properties, such as mass, volume, density, and color, can be observed without changing the identity of the matter. We can further categorize the physical properties of matter as either intensive or extensive. Intensive properties do not depend on the amount of the substance present. Some examples of intensive properties are color, taste, and melting point. Extensive properties vary according to the amount of matter present. Examples of extensive properties include mass, volume, and length.

Introduction 	  As we studied in our last lesson, matter can be described by its physical and chemical properties. We have seen examples of how matter exhibits specific physical and chemical properties, which can be used to distinguish one type of matter from another. In this lesson, we are going to use these properties to categorize the various forms of matter. 
States of  Matter 	  Matter typically exists in one of three states: solid, liquid, or gas. The state of a given substance is a physical property. Some substances exist as gases at room temperature (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide), while others (like water and mercury metal) exist as liquids. Most metals exist as solids at room temperature. All substances can exist in any of these three states. Water is a very common substance that we frequently encounter in all three states of matter, as seen in Figure 2.2. When water is in the solid state, we call it ice, while water in the gaseous state is referred to as steam or water vapor. The physical state of matter is a physical property because the identity of a pure substance does not change when it is melted, frozen, or boiled. Water is the same substance in any of its three states. (A) A frozen waterfall in Hungary. (B) The Nile River in Egypt. (C) A steam powered train in Wales. 
Solid 	  A solid is a form of matter that has a definite shape and volume. The shape of a solid does not change if it is transferred from one container to another. The particles of a solid are packed tightly together in fixed positions, usually in an orderly arrangement. Solids are almost completely incompressible, meaning that solids cannot be squeezed into a smaller volume. When a solid is heated or cooled, it expands or contracts only slightly. 
Liquid 	  A liquid is a form of matter that has a definite volume, but an indefinite shape. As water is poured from one container into another, it adopts the shape of its new container. However, the volume of the water does not change, because the water molecules are still relatively close to one another in the liquid state. Unlike a solid, the arrangement of particles in a liquid is not rigid and orderly. Liquids are also incompressible. 
Gas 	  A gas is a form of matter that has neither a definite shape nor a definite volume. A gas takes up the shape and volume of its container. This is because the particles of a gas are very far apart from one another compared to the particles that make up solids and liquids. Gases are easily compressed because of the large spaces in between gas particles. Gas particles are often invisible, but they can be detected in various ways, such as the light emitted when an electric current is passed through a sample of a gas ( Figure 2.3). 
Molecular  View of  Solids,  Liquids, and  Gases 	  We are quite familiar with the properties of solids, liquids, and gases from our everyday experience. These properties are fundamentally based on differences in the arrangement of atoms or molecules at the microscopic level. Figure Sodium vapor lamps glow with a distinctive yellow color. The particles of a gas are very far apart compared to the particles of a liquid or a solid. As Figure 2.4 shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states stick together, but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter. 
Pure  Substances 	  When studying the different states that matter exhibits, we have been looking at pure substances. Pure substances have a constant composition and can only be changed through chemical reactions. Constant composition indicates that a sample of a pure substance always contains the same elements in the same proportions. There are two main types of pure substances: elements: Substances that cannot be decomposed into simpler substances by chemical or physical means. compounds: Substances that can be broken down into elements through chemical means. Pure substances: (left) the element sulfur and (right) the compound water. The image on the left shows elemental sulfur in the solid state. The image on the right shows water in its liquid form. Sulfur is a pure element, and water is a compound comprised of the elements hydrogen and oxygen. Both of these substances have a constant composition, but water can be broken down into its elements, whereas sulfur cannot be decomposed into a simpler substance. Water can be broken down into its elements by passing electricity through a salt solution. 
Periodic  Table of  Elements 	  Chemists have classified and organized all of the known elements into what is called the periodic table. All known substances are made of some combination of these elements. The periodic table is a tool that we use to help identify and describe the composition of a given substance. All pure substances which cannot be broken down further, which we have called elements, are displayed in the periodic table. Figure 2.6 shows our modern periodic table. We will study the periodic table in more detail in the chapter The Periodic Table. 
Mixtures 	  When two or more pure substances are combined together, a mixture is formed. Unlike pure substances, mixtures have a variable composition. Variable composition indicates that the relative proportions of the mixtures components may vary, and they can be separated by physical methods. There are two main types of mixtures. 
Homogeneous  Mixtures 	  A homogeneous mixture is one in which the composition is uniform throughout the mixture. A glass of salt water is a homogeneous mixture because the dissolved salt is evenly distributed throughout the entire sample. It is often easy to confuse a homogeneous mixture with a pure substance because they are both uniform, and it can be difficult to tell which type you have by the naked eye. The difference is that the composition of the pure substance is always the same, while the composition of a homogeneous mixture can vary. For example, you may dissolve a small amount or a large amount of salt into a given sample of water. Although the ratio of salt to water will differ, the mixtures will both be homogeneous. However, pure water will always have the same ratio of elements that make it a pure substance (two hydrogen atoms per oxygen atom). Wine, air, and gunpowder are other examples of common homogeneous mixtures ( Figure 2.7). Their exact compositions can vary, making them mixtures rather than pure substances. Wine is a liquid mixture of water, ethanol, and a variety of other dissolved substances. Air is a mixture of nitrogen gas (78%), oxygen gas (21%), and small amounts of various other gases. Gunpowder is a solid mixture comprised of potassium nitrate (75%), charcoal (15%) and sulfur (10%). Examples of homogenous mixtures: wine and gunpowder. In the Figure 2.7, we see that the components of these mixtures cannot be distinguished from one another. However, the substances comprising these mixtures can be separated through physical means. 
Heterogeneous  Mixtures 	  Heterogeneous mixtures have visibly distinguishable parts. These mixtures will typically exist in the solid or liquid states, but not the gas state. Gas state heterogeneous mixtures are not possible because gas particles freely mix and disperse. Heterogeneous mixtures are quite common. For example, oil-and-vinegar salad dressing is a heterogeneous mixture that is in the liquid state. Its composition varies and typically includes olive oil mixed with red vinegar. An example of a solid heterogeneous mixture is soil. Soil is primarily comprised of organic and inorganic material, including substances like decaying plants and animals, minerals, water, and air. The composition of soil varies greatly from one location to another. Figure 2.8 shows these mixtures. Examples	of	heterogeneous	mixtures: (left) oil and vinegar and (right) soil. The substances that comprise heterogeneous mixtures can also be separated by physical means. We will discuss separation techniques in the following lesson. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Matter exhibits specific physical and chemical properties. Matter can exist in one of three states: solid, liquid, or gas. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place relative to one another. In the liquid and gas states, individual particles are free to move. Under the right pressure conditions, lowering the temperature of a substance in the gas state causes the substance to liquefy. The opposite effect occurs if temperature is increased. Under the right pressure conditions, lowering the temperature of a substance in the liquid state causes the substance to solidify. The opposite effect occurs if the temperature is increased. Pure substances have a constant composition and can only be changed by chemical reactions. They can be classified as either elements or compounds. Elements are substances that cannot be decomposed into simpler substances by chemical or physical means. Compounds, however, can be broken down further through chemical, but not physical, means. The periodic table is a tool that we use to help identify and describe the composition of a given substance. The table is an arrangement of elements based on their physical and chemical properties. Homogeneous or heterogeneous mixtures are formed when two or more pure substances are combined. A homogeneous mixture has a uniform distribution throughout the sample, whereas a heterogeneous mixture has visibly distinguishable components.

How might you go about breaking down a compound into its elements? The components that comprise homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures can be separated out by physical means. How might you go about separating out components of a soil mixture? Describe methods for separating mixtures, such as chromatography, distillation, fractional distillation, evaporation, and filtration. Given a specific mixture, propose methods by which the mixtures components could be isolated. Identify the chemical properties of a substance.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  chemical change: A change during which the chemical identity of a substance is altered. Chemical changes are often accompanied by a change in color, temperature, or odor, or the production of a gas or precipitate. physical change: A change in which the physical form and properties of a substance change. chromatography: The separation of a mixture by passing it through a medium in which the components move at different rates. distillation: A purification process in which the components of a liquid mixture are vaporized and then condensed and isolated. evaporation: A technique used to separate out homogeneous mixtures in which one or more solids are dissolved in a liquid. filtration: A method used to separate mixtures in which some of the particles are large enough in size to be captured with a porous material while others are not. chemical property: The ability of a substance to undergo a specific chemical change. Compare and contrast chemical properties and physical properties. Give examples of physical properties and chemical properties. Compare and contrast the following pairs of terms: element and compound; pure substance and mixture. 
Introduction 	  In the previous lesson, we discussed pure substances and mixtures. We indicated that the components of a mixture could be separated by physical means, but the components of a pure substance could not. Pure substances can only be broken down further through chemical means. In this lesson, we list several methods for separating mixtures. We will also be looking at chemical changes which alter the chemical identity of a substance, and how to recognize when a chemical change is taking place. 
Physical  Change 	  Any time the physical properties of a substance are changed, we can say the substance has undergone a physical change. All substances undergo physical changes where there is a change in the form of the substance but not in its chemical composition. For instance, the grinding of granular sugar into powdered sugar is a physical change. Similarly, dissolving sugar in water is a physical change. We can also use physical changes to separate mixtures into their components. There are a variety of methods used, and the best procedure depends largely on the nature of the mixture. Depending on the states of matter involved, the relative sizes of the mixtures components, and whether the mixture is homogeneous or heterogeneous will determine the necessary separation technique. 
Chromatography 	  Chromatography is the separation of a mixture by passing it through a medium in which the components move at different rates. Mixtures that are solutions (such as salt water), suspensions (such as sand mixed with water), or even vapors can be separated in this way. Paper chromatography is a type of chromatography that can be used for separating and identifying mixtures in which one or more components are colored, especially pigments. The following video shows paper chromatography being used to separate out the dyes present in a variety of watersoluble inks: URL (0:43). In this video, we see several different dyes that have been placed on paper through which water was absorbed. Dyes, such as the ink in colored markers, are usually a mixture of several different colored compounds. The dyes in water-soluble inks dissolve easily in water, while permanent inks dissolve more readily in organic solvents such as ethanol. 
Distillation 	  Distillation is an effective method to separate mixtures comprised of two or more pure liquids. Distillation is a purification process in which the components of a liquid mixture are vaporized (transformed from liquid to gas) and then condensed (transformed from gas back to liquid) and isolated. In a simple distillation, a mixture is gradually heated. The solution with the lowest boiling point will change into a gas first. This gas, or vapor, then passes through a cooled tube (a condenser) where it condenses back into its liquid state. This condensed liquid is called the distillate. Figure 2.9 illustrates this. When a mixture contains several components with similar boiling points, the one-step distillation may not give a pure substance in the receiving vessel. Therefore, more elaborate methods are used to completely separate a mixtures components. Distillation is an especially effective physical technique in separating out a homogeneous mixture comprised of two or more pure liquids, such as alcohol and water. In this figure, we see several important pieces of equipment. There is a heat source and a flask containing the liquid to be distilled. At the center of the set-up is the condenser. The distillate is collected in a flask. There are other more complicated assemblies for distillation that can also be used, especially to separate mixtures which are comprised of pure liquids with boiling points that are close to one another. 
Evaporation 	  Evaporation is a technique used to separate out homogeneous mixtures in which one or more solids are dissolved in a liquid. Typically, the mixture is heated until all of the liquid has vaporized, leaving behind the dissolved solids ( Figure 2.10). The vapor can also be captured and recondensed into a liquid if desired. This method can only be used to separate volatile liquid components (those which will evaporate at low temperatures) from nonvolatile solid components (those which will not evaporate at low temperatures). If there is more than one liquid or solid component, that portion of the mixture cannot be isolated purely. 
Filtration 	  Filtration can be used to separate mixtures in which the some of the particles are large enough in size to be captured with a porous material while others are not. Particle sizes can vary considerably. For instance, stream water is a mixture that contains naturally occurring biological organisms like bacteria, viruses, and protozoans. Some water filters can filter out bacteria, the length of which is on the order of 1 micrometer. Other mixtures, like wet soil, contain relatively large particles that can be filtered out using something like a coffee filter. 
Chemical  Change 	  Much of the field of chemistry is devoted to the study of chemical changes. A chemical change, also referred to as a chemical reaction, is one in which the chemical identity of a substance is altered. We witness chemical changes every day. For example, the burning of wood or the rusting of iron are chemical changes. The burning of wood is a process in which cellulose molecules break down into water and carbon dioxide. The rusting of iron is a process in which elemental iron combines with oxygen (from air or water) to produce iron oxide ( Figure 2.11). Rust (iron oxide) forms on an unprotected iron surface. As the rust forms on the surface of the iron, it flakes off to expose more iron, which will continue to rust. Rust is clearly a substance that is different from iron. Rusting is an example of a chemical change. Some chemical changes are not as obvious but are still hugely important. For example, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are chemical changes that we could not live without. Chemical changes involve the combination, decomposition, or rearrangement of elements and compounds to form new substances. A chemical property describes the ability of a substance to undergo a specific chemical change. A chemical property of iron is that it is capable of combining with oxygen to form iron oxide, the chemical name of rust. A more general term for rusting and other similar processes is corrosion. Other terms that are commonly used in descriptions of chemical changes are burn, rot, explode, decompose, and ferment. Chemical properties are very useful as a way of identifying substances. However, unlike physical properties, chemical properties can only be observed as the substance is in the process of being changed into a different substance. 
Recognizing  Chemical  Changes 	  How can you tell if a chemical change is taking place? Certain visual clues indicate that a chemical change is likely (but not necessarily) occurring, including the following examples: Mercury(II) oxide is a red solid. When it is heated to a temperature above 500C, it easily decomposes into mercury and oxygen gas. The red color of the reactant, mercury oxide, is gradually replaced by the silver color of the product, mercury. The color change is one sign that this reaction is occurring. Watch this decomposition take place at http ://URL (1:12). When zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid, the reaction bubbles vigorously as hydrogen gas is produced ( Figure 2.12). The production of a gas is also an indication that a chemical reaction may be occurring. Zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce bubbles of hydrogen gas. When a colorless solution of lead(II) nitrate is added to a colorless solution of potassium iodide, a yellow solid called a precipitate is instantly produced ( Figure 2.13). A precipitate is a solid product that forms from a reaction and settles out of a liquid mixture. The formation of a precipitate may also indicate the occurrence of a chemical reaction. All chemical changes involve a transfer of energy. When zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid, the test tube becomes very warm as energy is released during the reaction. Some other reactions absorb energy. While energy changes are a potential sign of a chemical reaction, care must be taken to ensure that a chemical reaction is indeed taking place. Physical changes may also involve a transfer of energy. A solid absorbs energy when it melts, and the condensation A yellow precipitate of solid lead(II) iodide forms immediately when solutions of lead(II) nitrate and potassium iodide are mixed. of a gas releases energy. The only way to be certain that a chemical reaction has occurred is to test the composition of the substances after the change has taken place to see if they are different from the starting substances. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Matter can undergo chemical and physical changes. Mixtures can be separated through physical changes, including techniques such as chromatography, distillation, evaporation, and filtration. Physical changes do not alter the nature of the substance, they simply alter the form. Pure substances, such as compounds, can be separated through chemical changes. Chemical changes change the chemical composition of a substance and can only occur through a chemical reaction. Four clues to a possible chemical reaction include a color change, the production of a gas, the formation of a precipitate, and an observable transfer of energy.

Chapter  Outline 	  When we think of measurement, a couple of things may come to mind. We may think of numbers, or we may think about instruments or equipment. The scale shown above, for instance, is an example of a common instrument that is used in measurement. In this case, the scale is measuring the weight of citrus fruit. Adjacent to the fruit is a 1 kilogram weight. If we were getting fruit at the market, we would likely purchase fruit in weight equivalents, like a kilogram or a pound, or some fraction of these equivalents. Measurement, in this example, allows us to measure quantities of fruit in a reliable fashion. Can you think of other food items you might measure? You might measure the temperature of a casserole, or the volume of milk used in a recipe, or the weight of dough in a pizza. Measurements depend on estimates, like estimating the weight of fruit. These estimates depend on reference points or equivalents, like one kilogram or a fraction of a kilogram. We also use measurement frequently in our study of the chemical world. Much of our modern understanding of chemistry is based on our ability to measure various physical quantities of chemical species. Image copyright Dimitar Sotirov, 2014. URL Used under license from Shutterstock.com. Distinguish between a quantity, a unit, and a measurement standard. Distinguish between base units and derived units. Perform calculations using the SI system of measurement, with the use of appropriate prefixes. Name the SI units for length, mass, time, volume, and density. Describe the concepts of magnitude and scale and how they relate to measurement. Use scientific notation to report very small and very large numbers. Be able to perform calculations with numbers that are reported in scientific notation. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  Systeme International (SI): A common metric system of units of measurement used by scientists. base unit: A measurement that has its own independent scale and cannot be expressed in terms of other base units. derived unit: A measurement that is a combination of base units. conversion factor: A factor used in solving problems in which a certain measurement must be expressed with different units. dimensional analysis: A technique that uses the units (dimensions) of the measurement in order to express quantities in the appropriate units. scientific notation: A way to express very large and very small numbers as the product of two numbers: a coefficient and the number 10 raised to a power. 
Introduction 	  We make measurements all the time in our daily lives without even realizing it. When we walk, we visually measure the proximity of objects in our environment. When we pick up an item, we measure its weight and adjust our muscular response according to our initial estimates. Measurements are observations of a quantitative nature that are taken by some form of equipment. Some equipment, like our five senses, can give us very approximate measurements, while other technology, like a scale, provides more exact measurements. Many types of instruments are used to measure and study our chemical world. Some of the common quantities we measure in chemistry are distance (length), volume, mass, time, velocity, temperature, density, pressure, amount, concentration, energy, and electric charge. In this chapter, we will investigate how various methods of measurement are used to study the chemical nature of matter. 
Measurement and  Numbers 	  Measurement is a fundamental aspect of science and chemistry. Our understanding of the chemical world would not be possible if we did not compare, contrast, categorize, and analyze our observations to obtain the information we have about chemical substances. Lets consider water as an example. Many of the qualitative (non-numerical) properties of water, including its taste, smell, texture, and color, can be observed using our senses. We can also measure quantitative (numerical) properties of water by using equipment. For example, we can use a thermometer to measure waters boiling point in degrees Celsius or a measuring cup to measure the volume of a given liquid. There can be different units that are used to measure the same physical quantity. For example, temperature can be expressed in degrees Fahrenheit (?F), degrees Celsius (?C), or degrees Kelvin (K). No one set of units is more correct than the other. However, as we begin measuring, calculating, and sharing measurements, we will want a standard set of values that we and others can use. An international governing body has developed a metric system of units of measurement for scientists called the Systme International (SI). Some of these units are listed in Table 3.1. 
Abbreviation 	  mass kilogram kg length meter m time second s or sec temperature 
 	  amount of substance mole mol electric current ampere 
 	  luminous intensity candela cd 
Base  Units vs.  Derived  Units 	  With the base units listed in the Table 3.1, we can describe many physical details of a given chemical substance. Base units are measurements that have their own independent scale and cannot be expressed in terms of other base units. All other measurement quantities, such as volume, force, and energy, can be derived from these seven base units. For instance, volume is calculated by multiplying together three different lengths (height, width, and depth). We call these combinations of base units derived units. Some examples of derived units are listed in Table 3.2. 
Abbreviation 	  area square meter m2 volume cubic meter m3 speed, velocity meter per second m/s acceleration meter per second squared m/s2 force Newton (mass  acceleration) N (kg m/s2) mass density kilogram per cubic meter kg/m3 energy joule (force  distance) J (kg m2/s2) 
Magnitude and  Scale 	  When we think about the physical quantities that are measured in chemistry, we must also consider the concepts of magnitude and scale. The following video introduces these concepts: URL vDjuy0 (9:01). As the video suggests, chemistry is a discipline in which we study things that are very, very small. We measure things like the size of an atom, which is approximately 1/10000000000 of a meter. Because individual atoms are so small, the substances that we can actually see and study, even something as small as a drop of rain, are comprised of an incredibly large number of atoms. There are literally thousands of billions of billions of particles in a drop of water. In both of these examples, we expressed size in terms of fractions or multiples of the number 10. When describing very small or very large physical quantities, we use prefixes to write the unit as a power of 10. Table 3.3 displays most of these prefixes. 
Notation 	  exabillion 
 	  petathousand trillion 
 	  teratrillion 
 	  gigabillion 
 	  megamillion 
 	  kilothousand k hectohundred h dekaten da n/a one n/a decione tenth d centihundredth c millithousandth m micromillionth nanobillionth n picotrillionth p femtoquadrillionth f attoquintillionth a 
The  Relative  Size of  Things 	  We can express the relative size of things with which we are familiar. For instance, the Figure 3.1 shows the height of a human as measured in meters, or 100 scale. We see a dust mite, measured in micrometers  10?6 scale; and a virus, measured in nanometers  10?9 scale. These are examples of length related to relative size and scale. 
Dimensional  Analysis 	  Conversion factors are used in solving problems in which a certain measurement must be expressed in different units. When a given measurement is multiplied by an appropriate conversion factor, the numerical value changes, but the actual size of the quantity measured remains the same. Dimensional analysis is a technique that uses the units (dimensions) of the measurement in order to correctly convert between units to solve problems. Dimensional analysis is best illustrated with an example. 
Example 3.3 	  How many seconds are in a day? Step 1: List the known conversion factors. Step 2: Use the conversion factors as fractions to convert the given units to the desired units. The known quantities above represent the conversion factors that we will use. The first conversion factor will have day in the denominator so that the day unit will cancel. The second conversion factor will then have hours in the denominator, while the third conversion factor will have minutes in the denominator. As a result, the unit of the last numerator will be seconds and that will be the units for the answer. s = 86,400 s 1 d	1 h In this technique, we are essentially multiplying by 1 several times. For example, because 1 day is equal to 24 hours, a fraction in which one of these values is in the numerator and the other is in the denominator will be equal to 
Dimensional  Analysis and the  Metric  System 	  The metric systems many prefixes allow quantities to be expressed in many different units. Dimensional analysis is useful to convert from one metric system unit to another. 
Example 3.4 	  A particular experiment requires 120 mL of a solution. The teacher knows that he will need to make enough solution for 40 experiments to be performed throughout the day. How many liters of solution should he prepare? Step 1: Perform the calculation. Step 2: Use a metric conversion factor (1 L = 1000 mL) to convert the given units to the desired units. Note that the conversion factor is arranged so that the mL unit is in the denominator. It therefore cancels out, leaving L as the remaining unit in the answer. Some metric conversion problems are most easily solved by breaking them down into more than one step. When both the given unit and the desired unit have prefixes, one can first convert to the simple (unprefixed) unit, followed by a conversion to the desired unit. An example will illustrate this method. 
Example 3.5 	  Convert 4.3 cm to m. Step 1: List the known conversion factors. Step 2: Use the conversion factors as fractions to convert the given units to the desired units. Each conversion factor is written so that unit of the denominator cancels with the unit of the numerator of the previous factor. 
Scientific  Notation 	  Scientific notation is a way to express numbers as the product of two numbers: a coefficient and the number 10 raised to a power. A coefficient is a numerical value that comes before the multiplying number, in this case the number 10 raised to a power. As an example, the distance from Earth to the Sun is about 150,000,000,000 meters  a very large distance indeed. In scientific notation, the distance is written as 1.5  1011 m. The coefficient is 1.5 and must be a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. The power of 10, or exponent, is 11. See Figure 3.2 for two more examples of scientific notation. Scientific notation is sometimes referred to as exponential notation. The Sun is very large and very distant, so solar data is better expressed in scientific notation. The mass of the Sun is 2.0  1030 kg and its diameter is 1.4  109 m. Very small numbers can also be expressed using scientific notation. The mass of an electron in decimal notation is 0.000000000000000000000000000911 grams. In scientific notation, the mass is expressed as 9.11  10?28 g. Notice that the value of the exponent is chosen so that the coefficient is between 1 and 10. 
Example 3.4 	  A common mosquito weights approximately 0.0000025 kg. Write the mosquitos weight in scientific notation. In scientific notation we will write this quantity as a coefficient multiplied by 10 raised to some power. Step 1: Our coefficient must be a number between 1 and 10. From 0.0000025 kg, we determine the coefficient to be Step 2: The quantity 0.0000025 kg is less than 1, so 10 must be raised to a negative exponent. The decimal place must be moved to the right by 6 places to write the coefficient 2.5, so we will write 10?6 as our power of 10 Step 3: Coefficient + Power of 10. This gives us 2.5  10?6 kg. Remember, our units in this case have not changed, we are just changing the way we are writing the numerical value. 
Adding and  Subtracting 	  There are times when we will want to add or subtract numbers that are expressed in scientific notation. We will approach such calculations in one of two ways. 
Example 3.5 	  Step 1: Convert numbers to regular notation. + 345 meters 1580 meters Step 3: Convert back to scientific notation (depending on the result, this is not always necessary). 1.580103 m We would follow the same steps for subtraction, as well as for numbers with negative exponents. 
Example 3.6 	  Step 1: Convert numbers to regular notation. Step 2: Decide on which unit you want the final answer to be expressed as and convert the numbers to this unit. Step 3: Subtract. Step 4: Convert to scientific notation. 
Example 3.7 	  (4.65103 meters)(3.56102 meters) Step 1: Group the coefficients and the exponential terms together. (4.653.56)(103 102) metersmeters Step 2: Multiply coefficients and add the exponents. (16.55)(105) meters2 Step 3: Change to scientific notation. Remember that the coefficient must be a number between 1 and 10. Note that when two values are multiplied together, the units are multiplied as well. This is different than the case for addition and subtraction, where the units for the answer are the same as the units for each of the starting values. 
Different  Base  Units 	  The procedure here is the same, except that a conversion is made so that both values are expressed in the same units. 
Example 3.8 	  (4.6510?4 liters)(3.56102 milliliters) Step 1: Convert to a common unit. In this case, we chose the common unit to be milliliters. Step 2: Group the coefficients and the exponential terms together. (4.653.56)(10?1 102) mL2 Step 3: Multiply coefficients and add the exponents. (16.55)(101) = 165.5 mL2 Step 4: Change to scientific notation. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Measurement is the process of making an observation in terms of a numerical scale and recording the value. In chemistry, we measure things that range from extremely small to extremely large. Common quantities measured include distance, mass, time, temperature, volume, density, pressure, amount, concentration, energy, velocity, molarity, viscosity, and electric charge. Because chemistry deals with very large and very small physical quantities, we utilize powers of 10 to express base units and derived units. Base units have independent scales and cannot be described by a combination of any other base units. Examples of base units used in chemistry are length, mass, temperature, and time. Derived units can be expressed as some combination of base units. Examples of derived units are area, volume, and speed. The Systeme International (SI) is a standard metric system of units that is used by scientists. Dimensional analysis is a method of problem solving in which conversion factors are arranged so that a value can be converted from one set of units to another.

Introduction 	  In the last lesson, we studied the concept of measurement and how numbers are used to express various physical quantities. We studied scale and magnitude and investigated how to use scientific notation and SI units to report numbers in an efficient and consistent manner. However, we have not yet studied how measurement takes place. There are many different measurements we make in our investigations of the chemical world. Measurements such as distance, volume, and mass are important values that are frequently used to describe the characteristics and behavior of chemical species. To make measurements, we use instruments labeled with a known scale. However, it is impossible for measurements to be exact. In this lesson, we are going to study how measurements are made as well as the error and uncertainty involved in measurements. 
Example 3.9 	  Make an estimate of the volume that is shown in Figure 3.3. Answer: We see the bottom of the meniscus is at approximately 52.9 mL. We report this in mL because our cylinder is a 100 mL graduated cylinder, with mL reference marks. There are 9 equally spaced marks between the 50 mL and 60 mL lines, so each one must represent 1 mL. As we will see next, the space between these marks represents an area of uncertainty with regard to the estimate. When the volume in our previous example was reported to be 52.9 mL, the uncertainty associated with this estimate also needed to be reported. For example, we know for certain that the true value for the volume must be between 52 mL and 53 mL. However, there is uncertainty regarding how close the value is to 52 or 53. We estimated the volume to be 52.9, but some students may have reported 52.8 or 53.0. These would be accurate estimates because they fall within the acceptable uncertainty of the device. All measurements have an uncertainty equal to one half of the smallest difference between reference marks. For our graduated cylinder, there is 1 mL between consecutive marks, so the uncertainty is one half of that value, 0.5 mL. To be rigorous about our certainty regarding this measured value, the estimate of 52.9 mL should be reported as 52.9  0.5 mL. 
Accuracy 	  In measuring quantities we always aim for high accuracy. Estimates that fall within the range of uncertainty for a given instrument are said to be accurate. In our previous example, all of the values between and including 52.4 mL and 53.4 mL would be considered accurate. Estimates that fall outside this range are inaccurate. Accuracy describes how close an estimate is to a known standard. 
Precision 	  Precision describes how close estimates are to one another. Estimates that are relatively close to one another are precise. Lets assume that ten different students made an estimate of the volume shown in Figure 3.3, and the values were: 52.9, 52.8, 52.9, 52.9, 53.3, 52.0, 52.8, 52.9, 53.0, 52.8. We can determine how precise these data by analyzing how close they are to an average. The average could be the mean, median or mode. The most common understanding of the average is the mean. This value is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by the total number of values. Other terms that can refer to the average are the median and the mode. The median is the middle value in a numerically ordered list of numbers. The mode is the value that occurs most often in a set of numbers. If no number is repeated, there is no mode for the list. Here are the calculated averages: 
Mode = 52.0,52.8,52.8,52.8,[52.9,52.9,52.9,52.9],53.0,53.3 = 52.9 	  Based on this analysis, we see the value 52.8 was the mean, and 52.9 was the median and mode. Therefore, values that are relatively close to these averages would be considered precise. We can also calculate the standard deviation for these data, which is a more refined way of determining the precision of estimates. However, we will not concern ourselves with standard deviation at this point. 
Accuracy vs.  Precision 	  As we just saw, accuracy describes how close a given set of data is to the real value, while precision describes how close the data points are to one another. These concepts are illustrated in Figure 3.4. Target A represents the best possible data. All of the data point points are clustered in the center, close to the actual value and close to one another. This data is both accurate and precise. In target B, the set of data has good accuracy overall if the points are averaged together. However, the three points are not very close to each other making the imprecise. Target C, on the other hand, shows precise but inaccurate data. The three data points are close together, making them precise, but are far from the center of the target, giving low accuracy. Target D represents the worst possible data. The data points are far from the center of the target lacking any accuracy, as well as being far apart from each other, lacking precision. Here we see three darts thrown at four different targets. Accurate shots would be those that were close to the bulls-eye (the inner circle). Precision would be the shots that were close to one another. 
Calibration 	  When using measuring devices, we often use a technique called calibration to increase the accuracy of our measurements. Calibration is a method of setting or correcting a measuring device by matching it to known measurement standards. To better understand calibration, we will look at the example of calibrating a thermometer. All thermometers are slightly different in their temperature readings. One way to calibrate a thermometer is by using the freezing point and boiling point of water ( Figure 3.5). If we know that water freezes at 0C and boils at 100C, we can calibrate our thermometer by measuring the temperature of ice water and of boiling water. We place the thermometer in ice water and wait for the thermometer liquid to reach a stable height, then place a mark at this height which represents 0C. Then we place the thermometer in boiling water, and after waiting for the thermometer liquid to reach a stable height, we place a mark at this height which represents 100C. We can then place 100 equally spaced divisions between our 0 and 100C marks to each represent 1C. Our thermometer has now been calibrated using the known values for the freezing point and boiling point of water, and can be used to measure temperatures of objects between 0 and 100C. A thermometer can be calibrated by measuring the freezing point (0C) and the boiling point (100C) of water. One hundred equally spaced divisions can then be made between 0 and 100C. Calibration is used to standardize a variety of measuring devices, including meter sticks, graduated cylinders, scales, and thermometers. It is a good idea to calibrate any measuring equipment you use in an experiment to make sure the data you are collecting is measured as accurately as possible. 
Percent  Uncertainty 	  To express the uncertainty in a measurement, we can calculate percent uncertainty. Percent uncertainty is the ratio of the uncertainty to the measured value, multiplied by one-hundred. For instance, the percent uncertainty associated with the measurement of (52.9  0.5 mL), would be % uncertainty	1% 
Example 3.10 	  Using our estimate of 52.9 mL, what would be the range of possible values for the true volume? 
Lower estimate = 52.9 - 0.5 = 52.4 m 	  Assuming that our equipment is accurate, we can be confident that the true volume of the sample is somewhere in between these two values. 
Percent  Error 	  On the other hand, percent error is an expression of the accuracy of a measurement. There are various possible sources of error that arise in measurement. For example, there can be error associated with the observation, like misreading a graduated cylinder. There is error associated with the method or the procedure, like not drying a wet solid before weighing. Error can also arise from the object being measured. For example, a pure solid may have a residue fixed to it that affects its mass. There can also be errors that arise from the measurement instrument, like not zeroing a balance, or improper calibration. Percent error is calculated as follows: |Measured?Accepted| % error =	 100 
Example 3.11 	  Make an estimate of volume for the image shown in Figure 3.6, and answer the questions below. Which of the following estimates would be accurate? Report your answer in terms of uncertainty. Which of the following sets of estimates would be most precise? If a student reported a volume of 45.0 mL, calculate the percent error in his or her measurement if the actual volume is exactly 43.0 mL. 
Significant  Figures 	  The significant figures in a measurement consist of all the certain digits in that measurement plus one uncertain or estimated digit. In the graduated cylinder example from the previous section, the measured value was reported to be 52.9 mL, which includes 3 significant figures. In a correctly reported measurement, the final digit is significant but not certain. Insignificant digits are not reported. It would not be incorrect to report the volume as 52.923 mL, because even the tenths place (the 9) is uncertain, so no reasonable estimate could be made for any of the following digits. When you look at a reported measurement, it is necessary to be able to count the number of significant figures. Table 3.4 details the rules for determining the number of significant figures in a reported measurement. For the examples in the table, assume that the quantities are correctly reported values of a measured quantity. 
Examples 	  A. 237 has three significant figures. B. 1.897 has four significant figures. A. 39,004 has five significant figures. B. 5.02 has three significant figures. A. 0.008 has one significant figure. B. 0.000416 has three significant figures. A. 140 has two significant figures. B. 75,210 has four significant figures. A. 620.0 has four significant figures. 
B. 19,000. has five significant figures 	  It needs to be emphasized that just because a certain digit is not significant does not mean that it is not important or that it can be left out. Though the zero in a measurement of 140 may not be significant, the value cannot simply be reported as 14. An insignificant zero functions as a placeholder for the decimal point. When numbers are written in scientific notation, this becomes more apparent. The measurement 140 can be written as 1.4  102, with two significant figures in the coefficient. A number with left-end zeros, such as 0.000416, can be written as 4.16  10?4, which has 3 significant figures. In some cases, scientific notation is the only way to correctly indicate the correct number of significant figures. In order to report a value of 15,000,000 with four significant figures, it would need to be written as 1.500  107. The right-end zeros after the 5 are significant. The original number of 15,000,000 only has two significant figures. 
Exact  Quantities 	  When numbers are known exactly, the significant figure rules do not apply. This occurs when objects are counted rather than measured. In your science classroom, there may be a total of 24 students. The actual value cannot be 
Adding and  Subtracting  Significant  Figures 	  The sum or difference is determined by the smallest number of significant figures to the right of the decimal point in any of the original numbers. 
Multiplying and  Dividing  Significant  Figures 	  The number of significant figures in the final product or quotient is equal to the number of significant figures in the starting value that has the fewest significant figures. 
Example 3.17 	  For this example, the value 8 is known to be exact (so it has an infinite number of significant figures). 
Calculating  Density 	  Imagine holding a tennis ball in one hand and an orange in the other. Why does the orange feel heavier than the tennis ball, even though the two objects are about the same size? This can be explained with the concept of density. Density is an expression of the mass of a substance in terms of the volume occupied by the substance. The equation for density is: mass Density = volume m D = 
 	  So, even though a tennis ball and an orange may be about the same volume, the orange contains more mass within that volume than does the tennis ball. Therefore, the orange has a higher density. This is because the orange contains mostly water and the tennis ball contains mostly air; as you might imagine, water is much heavier than air. Density is typically reported in terms of gram per milliliter (g/mL) or the equivalent value, grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). Oftentimes, scientists compare the density of an object to the density of water which is 1 g/mL at room temperature (25C). The densities of some common materials are listed in the Table 3.5. TABLE 3.5: 
Material 	  Density (g/mL) hydrogen oxygen water aluminum iron gold 
Mass vs.  Weight 	  The terms mass and weight, while often used interchangeably, are technically different terms. Mass is the quantity of inertia possessed by an object. Weight refers to the gravitational force acting on a mass, as measured on a scale. On the surface of the earth, the numerical values of mass and the corresponding force of gravity (weight) are approximately equivalent. For now, we will use the terms mass and weight interchangeably although mass is the more appropriate scientific term. 
Determining the  Volume of  Regularly  Shaped  Objects 	  In order to calculate density, we must know the volume the object occupies. We can calculate the volumes of some regularly shaped objects using the following expressions in Table 3.6. 
Volume of a cube 	  l wh 
Volume of a cylinder 	  ?r2h 
Volume of a cone 	  h 
Determining the  Volume of  Irregularly  Shaped  Objects 	  If a solid is irregularly shaped, we can determine its volume by measuring the volume of water displaced by the solid. For example, say you want to measure the volume of the toy dinosaur in Figure 3.7. After placing the dinosaur in the water, the volume measured in the container increases by an amount that is equal to the total volume of the dinosaur. Note that this method only works for solids that do not dissolve in water. If you tried to measure the volume occupied by a pile of salt, the salt would dissolve in the water and this method would not work very well. 
Temperature  Scales 	  There are three temperature scales that are commonly used in measurement. Their units are F (degrees Fahrenheit), C (degrees Celsius), and K (Kelvin). The Fahrenheit scale, which is the most commonly used scale in the United States, defines the normal freezing point and boiling point of water as 32F and 212F, respectively. The Celsius scale defines the normal freezing point and boiling point of water as 0C and 100C, respectively. The Celsius Displacement of water by irregular solid. scale is commonly used in most countries across the globe. The Kelvin scale, which is also referred to as the absolute temperature scale, defines absolute zero as the lowest theoretically possible temperature, which means that temperatures expressed in Kelvin cannot be negative numbers. We will further study the origins of this temperature scale in the chapter States of Matter. 
Converting  Temperature  Scales 	  Regardless of the temperature scale used, it is important to be able to convert from one scale to another. Here are the conversions we use. 
T? C =  K ?273.15  Example 3.19 	  The melting point of mercury is -38.84C. Convert this value to degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Kelvin. Answer 
Lesson  Summary 	  Accuracy describes how close an estimate is to a known standard. Precision describes how close estimates are to one another. The accuracy of an estimate cannot be improved through calculation. Calibration is a technique used to standardize a measuring instrument and increase the accuracy of measurements. Estimation, as used in measurement, is the process of referencing a physical quantity in terms of a calibration or reference point. All measurement devices have reference marks of some kind. All measurements have an associated uncertainty. It is expressed as one-half of the smallest difference between calibration marks. It can also be expressed as a percent. Percent error is an expression of the accuracy of a measurement, standardized to how large the measurement is. Sources of error can originate from observation errors, methods or procedural errors, as well as errors associated with object that are measured. They can also originate from the measurement instrument itself. Significant figures are figures associated with uncertainty of a measurement. Density is an expression of the mass of substance in terms of the volume occupied by the substance. Density is typically reported in terms of grams/mL (g/mL) or grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). If a solid is irregularly shaped, we can determine its volume by measuring the volume of water that the solid displaces. There are three temperature scales that are commonly used. Their units are F (degrees Fahrenheit), C (degrees Celsius), and K (Kelvin).

One way to remember the formula for density, as well as how to rearrange variables within the density equation is with the following formula triangle In this lesson we have seen that all measurements have an associated uncertainty. Yet, this does not imply there are flaws in the process of measurement. How might you explain to someone the concept of uncertainty, and how reconciling uncertainty in measurement actually makes the estimate more trustworthy, not less? 
Atomic  Structure 	  The concept of the atom was first proposed roughly two thousand years ago by the Greek philosopher Democritus. He argued that matter was finite and comprised of particles that are indivisible. Like all the philosophers of his time, Democritus based his argument on reason, not experimental data. In more recent years, the composition of matter has been studied further, and only within the last century was it determined that the atom is indeed divisible. Today, scientists believe that even some subatomic particles can theoretically be divided even further. The figure above illustrates our modern model of the atom. At the center is a nucleus containing protons and neutrons. Around the nucleus are much lighter particles called electrons. The atom is largely comprised of empty space. Can you think of how we might go about studying the behavior of matter at the atomic and subatomic level? How do you suppose we might study aspects of matter that cannot be directly observed? These are the questions that philosophers and scientists have pondered for millennia. We will address some of these questions as we attempt to further understand the particles that make up matter. Iimage copyright Anita Ponne, 2014. URL Used under license from Shutterstock.com. Describe the development of the concept of the atom from Democritus to the modern day.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  continuous theory of matter: The concept that matter is continuous, infinite, and comes in every form all around us, and could be divided and subdivided into smaller and smaller pieces without limit. discontinuous theory of matter: The concept that matter is actually finite and not limitless. atom: Fundamental, indivisible particles that make up matter. law of definite proportions: States that chemical compounds always contain the same proportion of elements by mass, regardless of amount. law of conservation of mass: States that the mass of a reactant must equal the mass of the product for any chemical process. law of multiple proportions: States that if two elements form more than one compound between them, then the ratios of the masses of the second element that combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers. What are the general properties of matter? For example, what are the properties of water that distinguish it from other substances? We widely accept that all matter is comprised of similar kinds of particles that are too small to detect with the unaided eye. We know that when a candle burns it gives off carbon dioxide and water vapor, but we cannot actually see these gases. How can we study something that we cannot directly see? Can you give an example? 
Introduction 	  For centuries, humans have been fascinated with the behavior of matter. They have recognized that certain things, like candles, burn while other things, such as metals, do not readily burn. Humans have noticed that certain substances react with one another. For instance, iron will rust over time in the presence of air or water. Similarly, they have recognized that some matter is not visible, such as the air that we breathe, but it is still there. Early philosophers believed that matter was comprised of four fundamental substances: earth, air, fire, and water. These became known as elements. Later, philosophers postulated that all matter was comprised of a fundamental particle, the atom, which was indivisible. We now know that the atom is comprised of even smaller subatomic particles that display unique behaviors. In this chapter, we will look at how our understanding of the atom has evolved over time. 
Discontinuous  Theory of  Matter 	  Our understanding of matter today is much different than it was long ago. In 440 BC, Aristotle and Plato ( Figure 4.1) proposed that matter was continuous, infinite, present in every form, and always all around us. It was thought that matter could be divided and subdivided into smaller and smaller pieces without limit. This concept was called the continuous theory of matter. One debate of the time revolved around how far a grain of sand could be divided. Most philosophers of the time believed that the sand could be sub-divided indefinitely. These were logical interpretations of their observations about the natural world. In 400 BC, Democritus ( Figure 4.2) proposed an alternate view, referred to as the discontinuous theory of matter. He expanded upon the work of Leucippus, a mentor of his, who believed matter was actually finite and not limitless. Democritus held that a grain of sand could only be divided a finite number of times. However, this idea was not well-received at the time. Aristotle, who was considered a greater authority, taught against it and influenced other philosophers to reject the ideas of Democritus. It would be thousands of years before his ideas were revisited and found to be consistent with more recently available scientific evidence. Democritus proposed that all matter is composed of fundamental, indivisible particles that he called atoms. The essential ideas behind his theory are the following: 
Prousts  Law of  Definite  Proportions 	  The French scientist Joseph Louis Proust (1754-1826) studied chemical compounds and their mass proportions. Through his experiments, Proust found chemical compounds always contain the same proportion of elements by mass, no matter the amount. Based off of this idea, Proust developed the law of definite proportions which was published in 1799. To illustrate this, suppose compound AB is made of element A and element B. Regardless of how much AB is present, the ratio between the mass of A and the mass of B will be the same for any sample. In other words, elements combine in fixed ratios based on their mass. Water, H2O, is always 1/9 by mass hydrogen and 8/9 by mass oxygen, regardless of whether we are looking at one drop or an entire lake. 
Lavoisiers  Law of  Conservation of  Mass 	  At the same time, another French scientist named Antoine Lavoisier was studying mass relations in chemical reactions. He noticed that for an isolated system, the mass of the reactants must equal the mass of the products for any chemical process. This discovery was later called the law of conservation of mass. This law greatly influenced chemistry because it quantified gaseous chemical species, which were often viewed as missing matter that was not involved in chemical processes. While it must be assumed that many more scientists, philosophers and others studied the composition of matter after Democritus, a major leap forward in our understanding of the composition of matter took place in the 1800s with the work of John Dalton ( Figure 4.3). John Dalton, a school teacher from England, studied the weights of various elements and compounds. He noticed that matter always combined in fixed ratios based on weight (and volume, in the case of gases). Chemical compounds always contain the same proportion of elements by mass, regardless of amount, which provided further support for Prousts law of definite proportions. Dalton also observed that there was more than one mass ratio in which two elements could combine. 
N2 O3 and  N2 O4 	  Notice in Table 4.1 that the elements combine in different but predictable ratios with other elements. Carbon can combine in a 1:1 ratio with oxygen to form carbon monoxide a poisonous gas. Change the ratio to 1:2 carbon to oxygen, and you get carbon dioxide, which is a gas that we exhale. His work led to the development of the law of multiple proportions. This law states that if two elements form more than one compound between them, then the ratios of the masses of the second element that combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers. Daltons Atomic Theory (1804) From his experiments and observations, as well as the work of contemporary scientists, Dalton proposed a new theory of the atom. This later became known as Daltons atomic theory. The general tenets of this theory were as follows: Daltons atomic theory has been largely accepted by the scientific community, although a couple of modifications have been made since its conception. We know now that (1) an atom can be further sub-divided, and (2) not all atoms of an element have identical masses. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Early Greek philosophers thought that matter could be divided and subdivided into smaller and smaller pieces without limit. In 400 BC, Democritus proposed that there was a point at which matter could no longer be divided any further. He suggested that all matter was composed of tiny indivisible particles, which he called atoms. Joseph Proust found that compounds always contain the same proportion of elements by mass, regardless of amount. This was later called the law of definite proportions. Antoine Lavoisier proposed the law of conservation of mass, which states that in a chemical reaction mass is not created nor destroyed. John Dalton discovered that certain combinations of elements could combine in multiple ratios. This was called the law of multiple proportions. In 1804, John Dalton proposed a modern atomic theory. This theory is still largely accepted by the scientific community, with a couple modifications.

Introduction 	  After the development of Daltons atomic theory, several important discoveries were made that led to a new understanding of the atom. A number of experiments revealed that the atom is comprised of subatomic particles called electrons, neutrons, and protons. Most of the atoms mass is concentrated in a central nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by much less massive electrons, which account for most of the volume occupied by the atom. The electron was the first subatomic particle to be discovered, followed by discoveries of the nucleus, the proton, and the neutron. In this lesson, we are going to study these important discoveries and how they led to our current understanding of the atom. 
Discovery of  Cathode  Rays 	  In 1877, William Crookes (1832-1919) was studying how electrical current behaves in a vacuum tube. In one experiment, he passed an electric current through an evacuated phosphorous-coated glass cylinder with an object in the center, as shown in Figure 4.4. Upon passing a current through the tube, Crookes noticed that a shadow was cast by the object in the tube. The phosphorus on the terminal end of the tube became brightly fluorescent, except for the region directly behind the central object. He interpreted this to mean that the electrical current was blocked by the object. He reasoned that the electrical current, which he later called cathode rays, was composed of streams of particles. Crookess work was later expanded upon by several other scientists. One scientist in particular, J. J. Thomson, was able to show that cathode rays could be deflected by a magnetic field, as shown in the following video: URL atch?v=M1REuKMeI34 (0:58). Thomsons interpretation of this effect was that cathode rays must consist of charged particles that have mass. Thomson presented his work in 1897, where he referred to these negatively charged particles as corpuscles. Later on, this name was changed and negatively charged particles became known as electrons. Thomson revised the model of the atom into what became known as the plum pudding model. He hypothesized that the atom was comprised of negatively charged particles in a field of positive charge (positively charged particles had not yet been discovered). This proposed arrangement was compared to the arrangement of plums in plum pudding, as illustrated in Figure 
The  Charge of the  Electron 	  In 1909, Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher devised what is known as the oil drop experiment to determine the charge of a single electron. The oil drop experiment consisted of an apparatus in which small, charged oil drops were passed through an electric field. The electric field was created by two oppositely charged parallel metal plates. The rate at which the oil drops fell through the field was used to determine the magnitude of the charge of an electron. The following video illustrates this experiment and explains how the charge of an electron was determined: URL ww.youtube.com/watch?v=XMfYHag7Liw (1:14). Using this information, Millikan calculated the charge of an electron to be 1.5924  10?19 coulombs. A coulomb (C) is the SI unit for electric charge, where 1 coulomb = 1 ampere  1 second. (Remember, an ampere is an SI base unit for electric current.) Today, the accepted value for the charge of an electron is 1.602176487  10?19 C. Despite the relatively simple apparatus with which it was determined, Millikans value was within 1% of the currently accepted value. Combining this value with information from J. J. Thomsons experiments, Millikan was also able to calculate the mass of an electron. The currently accepted value is 9.10938215  10?31 kg. 
Discovery of the  X-ray 	  Right around the time that Thomson was formulating his model of the atom, a scientist named Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen was studying the behavior of electricity in discharge tubes. These were partially evacuated gas-filled tubes which would conduct an electric current, similar to the Crookes tube used in the cathode ray experiments. He devised an experiment in which he covered a discharge tube with black cardboard, and several feet away, he placed a sheet of paper that had been chemically treated with a compound called barium-platinum cyanide. When he applied voltage to the discharge tube, he noticed the screen several feet away became fluorescent, emitting light. This was peculiar, because the tube had been completely covered by material that would block the escape of any cathode rays. Roentgen continued to explore this phenomenon. He moved the screen further away, he turned the screen around, and he placed objects between the screen and the discharge tube. In all cases, the screen still fluoresced when the discharge tube was turned on. Then Roentgen had his wife place her hand atop a photographic plate, and the rays were shone towards the plate. After developing the plate, he observed an image of his wifes hand that showed the shadows thrown by the bones of her hand and that of a ring she was wearing (Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen Biography). Figure 4.7 is an image of what he saw. The skeleton of Roentgens wifes hand, as captured on the photographic plate. What do you think the dark spot in the picture might be caused by? This was the first roentgenogram ever taken. He interpreted this to mean that another ray, other than the cathode rays, was being produced that could penetrate and travel through objects at a distance. He called these X-rays, and he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his brilliant work. Modern day X-rays that one might receive for a medical exam operate on the same principles that Roentgen discovered. Several major discoveries followed shortly after Roentgens discovery of X-rays. Just two months later, in 1896, radioactivity was discovered by a Frenchman named Henri Becquerel. Becquerel discovered that certain substances, like uranium salts, emit charged particles. Following this work, Marie and Pierre Curie began to study the behavior of various radioactive substances in 1897. In fact, Madame Curie coined the word radioactivity. Their work resulted in the discovery of mass changes in radioactive elements, which later became known as radioactive decay. They also identified two new radioactive elements, which later became known as polonium and radium. The Curies were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 for their work. Marie Curie later won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1911) for her contributions to our understanding of radioactivity. We will study radioactivity further in the chapter Nuclear Chemistry. 
Discovery of the  Nucleus 	  By 1900, it was known that the electron carried a negative charge. It was also known that the electron makes up an extremely small fraction of the mass of an atom. Ernest Rutherford set out to determine how the remainder of the mass and charge was distributed in the atom. Rutherford was a physicist from New Zealand who was working under the direction of J. J. Thomson. He conducted several experiments on the radioactive properties of uranium. He discovered that uranium released two different types of particles, which he referred to as alpha (?) particles, which were positively charged, and beta (?) particles, which were negatively charged. It was later shown that beta particles were simply free electrons. 
Gold  Foil  Experiment 	  One of Rutherfords famous experiments was called the gold foil experiment (illustrated in the Figure 4.9). In this experiment, Rutherford used a radioactive source to direct alpha particles toward a very thin sheet of gold foil. Surrounding the foil was a screen that fluoresced when struck by the alpha particles. Here is a short video of his experiment: URL (0:47). As shown in the video, most alpha particles easily passed through the gold foil and struck the fluorescent screen behind the foil. However, there were some instances in which the alpha particles were deflected very strongly, often back toward the emission source. If the plum pudding model were correct, all of the alpha particles would be expected to pass through the gold foil with little or no deflection. The strong deflection experienced by a small portion of the alpha particles could be better explained by an atom that contained a very small, dense nucleus. Because some of the alpha particles emitted from the source were repelled by the nucleus, Rutherford concluded that the nucleus must be made up of these positively charged alpha particles, which he named protons. He proposed that atoms consist of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons, as shown in the Figure 4.10. 
Bohrs  Atomic  Model 	  In 1913, shortly after Rutherfords work on the nucleus, Niels Bohr proposed what became known as a planetary model of the atom. Bohrs model was based upon the work done by Max Planck and Albert Einstein, who at the time were studying quantum theory which looks at the energy associated with matter. The planetary model was useful for relating atomic structure to the wavelengths of light that an element emits when heated. Bohrs model, as well as the work of Planck and Einstein, will be discussed in the chapter Electrons in Atoms. Discovery of the Neutron (1932) In 1932, James Chadwick discovered the neutron.	Chadwick was an English physicist who was mentored by Rutherford. His experiment consisted of bombarding beryllium atoms with alpha particles through a paraffin wax target and studying the effects. From his analysis, he concluded that the nucleus also contains a particle which has equal mass to the proton, but unlike the proton, is electrically neutral hence the name neutron. Here is a short video clip describing Chadwicks experiment: URL (2:14). Chadwicks work resulted in a new understanding of the nucleus of the atom; it is comprised of both protons and neutrons. Because the masses of subatomic particles are so small, a new unit, called an atomic mass unit (amu), was defined. Protons and neutrons each have a mass of approximately one amu. The Table 4.2 describes the characteristics of the three subatomic particles we have discussed.

Lesson  Summary 	  Experiments conducted during the early twentieth century revealed that the atom is comprised of subatomic particles called electrons, neutrons, and protons. In 1877, William Crookes discovered cathode rays, which later became known as electrons. Crookes discovered these rays using an apparatus he developed called the Crookes tube or cathode-ray tube. Electrons, which were initially called cathode rays, are negatively charged and have a very small mass compared to the masses of other subatomic particles. In 1895, Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen discovered X-rays. In 1897, J. J. Thomson showed that cathode rays are deflected in a magnetic field and proposed that cathode rays are streams of negatively charged particles. Thomson proposed the plum-pudding model of the atom. This model described the atom as a disperse field of positive charge containing small negatively charged particles. In 1909, the magnitude of the charge carried by an electron was determined by Robert Millikan in an experiment known as the oil drop experiment. Information from this experiment was later used to also calculate the mass of an electron. In 1919, Rutherford discovered the presence of a positively charged nucleus with his famous gold foil experiment. Rutherford proposed a new atomic model that described the atom as comprised of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. In this model, most of the atom was thought to be empty space.*Protons are positively charged and have a relatively large mass compared to electrons. Protons can be found in the nucleus of the atom. In 1932, Chadwick discovered the neutron, a particle with a mass similar to that of the proton but without any electrical charge. Neutrons are particles with a mass similar to that of the proton, but they have no electrical charge. Neutrons also reside in the nucleus.

Describe the composition of an atom. What are the three subatomic particles and what are their properties? 
Introduction 	  Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of all matter and are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Because atoms are electrically neutral, the number of positively charged protons must be equal to the number of negatively charged electrons. One of Daltons points in his atomic theory was that all atoms of a given element are identical in mass. In this section, we will see how this is not strictly true, due to variability in the number of neutrons that an atom may contain. 
Atomic  Number 	  The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of each atom of that element. An atom can be classified as a particular element based solely on its atomic number. For example, any atom with an atomic number of 8 (its nucleus contains 8 protons) is an oxygen atom, and any atom with a different number of protons would be a different element. The periodic table ( Figure 4.11) displays all of the known elements and is arranged in order of increasing atomic number. In this table, an elements atomic number is indicated above the elemental symbol. Hydrogen, at the upper left of the table, has an atomic number of 1. Every hydrogen atom has one proton in its nucleus. Next on the table is helium, whose atoms have two protons in the nucleus. Lithium atoms have three protons, beryllium atoms have four, and so on. Since atoms are neutral, the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons. Therefore, hydrogen atoms all have one electron occupying the space outside of the nucleus. 
Mass  Number 	  Rutherfords experiment showed that the vast majority of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which is composed of protons and neutrons. The mass of an electron is very small compared to the mass of a neutron or proton, so the electrons in an element do not contribute much to the total mass. The mass number is defined as the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom. Remember that both protons and neutrons have a mass of approximately 1 amu. Knowing the mass number and the atomic number of an atom therefore allows you to determine the number of neutrons present in that atom by subtraction: 
Number of neutrons = mass number - atomic number 	  The composition of any atom can be illustrated with a shorthand notation, sometimes called A-Z notation, using the atomic number (Z) and the mass number (A). The general form for this notation is as follows: 
 	  For example, a chromium atom that has 24 protons and 28 electrons could be written as: Another way to refer to a specific atom is to write the mass number of the atom after the name, separated by a hyphen. The above atom would be written as chromium-52. 
Isotopes 	  As stated earlier, not all atoms of a given element are identical. Specifically, the number of neutrons in the nucleus can vary for many elements. As an example, naturally occurring carbon exists in three forms, which are illustrated in Figure 4.12. Nuclei of the three isotopes of carbon: Almost 99% of naturally occurring carbon is carbon-12, whose nucleus consists of six protons and six neutrons. Carbon13 and carbon-14, with seven or eight neutrons, respectively, have a much lower natural abundance. Each carbon atom has the same number of protons (6), which is equal to its atomic number. Each carbon atom also contains six electrons, allowing the atom to remain electrically neutral. However the number of neutrons varies from six to eight. Isotopes are atoms that have the same atomic number but different mass numbers due to a change in the number of neutrons. The three isotopes of carbon can be referred to as carbon-12 (126 C), carbon-13 (136 C), and carbon-14 (146 C). Naturally occurring samples of most elements are mixtures of isotopes. Carbon has only three natural isotopes, but some heavier elements have many more. Tin has ten stable isotopes, which is the most of any element. While the presence of isotopes affects the mass of an atom, it does not affect its chemical reactivity. Chemical behavior is governed by the number of electrons and the number of protons. Carbon-13 behaves chemically in exactly the same way as the more plentiful carbon-12. 
Example 4.1 	  Silver has two known isotopes, one with 60 neutrons and the other with 62 neutrons. What are the mass numbers and symbols of these isotopes? 
Atomic  Mass and the  Mass  Spectrometer 	  Beginning in the early part of the twentieth century, scientists were approaching a new understanding of the composition of the atom. Several major discoveries demonstrated that the atom contained a nucleus, where protons and neutrons are situated. It was discovered that electrons surrounded the nucleus and it was later determined that electrons primarily determine the chemical properties of elements. Several devices were created during this time which demystified the inner workings of the atom and the composition of elements. One such device was the mass spectrometer, which was developed in 1918 by Arthur Jeffrey Dempster. The mass spectrometer is an instrument for determining the masses of atoms, molecules, and molecular fragments. The Figure 4.13 illustrates a modern mass spectrometer. An electron is removed from an atom to yield a positive ion (such as H+, O+, or N+). The ions are then accelerated and deflected by a magnetic field. The degree of deflection directly relates to the mass of the ion: the lighter the ion, the greater the deflection and the heavier the ion, the lesser the deflection. The beam of ions is then detected and the relative abundance of each isotope of an element can then be determined. If we were to place a sample of carbon into a mass spectrometer and analyze its mass, we would find that some of the carbon atoms have a relative mass of 12, while other atoms have a relative mass of 13, and still others have a relative mass of 14. The mass spectrometer measures the percent abundance of these carbon isotopes. Percent abundance is the percentage of atoms in a naturally occurring sample of the pure element that are a particular isotope. We can represent the percent abundance of carbon with what is known as a mass spectrogram, shown in the Figure 4.14. The spectrogram reveals the percent abundances of the variants of carbon atoms consists of 98.9% 12C, 1.1% 13C, and 0.1% 14C. Because we generally deal with very large amounts of atoms, it is more practically useful to know the average mass of each atom in a large sample as determined by the percent abundance of each isotope. The atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the atomic masses of the naturally occurring isotopes of that element. 
Example 4.2 	  Using the percent abundances for each carbon isotope as given above, calculate the weighted average for the atomic mass of carbon. Answer: We calculate average atomic mass by taking the percent abundance of each isotope and multiplying this by the atomic mass of the isotope. Then, add these values together to get the relative atomic mass: Therefore, the average atomic mass of carbon is calculated to be 12.011. This is the same number that is listed on the periodic table. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The atomic number (Z) of an element is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus. The mass number (A) of an element is equal to the sum of the protons and the neutrons in its nucleus. Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have a different mass number (A) but the same atomic number (Z). Isotopes have the same number of protons and electrons, but a different number of neutrons. The mass spectrometer measures the percent abundance of different isotopes in a given sample. The average atomic mass of an element can be calculated from the atomic mass and percent abundance of each naturally occurring isotope.

Electrons in  Atoms 	  Light has always intrigued humans. Whether it was the light from the sun or the light from a fire, we have used light and made light when none was naturally available. The interaction of light with different materials has long been studied. Research by scientists in the late nineteenth century led to an intriguing discovery. Light, under the right conditions, creates a small voltage (ejects electrons) when shined on certain metals. Einstein eventually explained this photoelectric effect, adding to our essential understanding of the nature of light. This discovery formed the foundation for a technology which later became known as photovoltaic cells. Photovoltaic cells are the materials found in the solar panels shown in the figure above. The solar panels shown here can generate enough electricity throughout the day to power 5 average American homes (assuming an average monthly energy use of about ~1000 kWh). Photovoltaic cells have become quite affordable and are now a reasonable alternative for electricity generation. Image copyright anweber, 2014. URL Used under license from Shutterstock.com. Describe the mathematical relationship between the speed, wavelength, and frequency of electromagnetic radiation. Describe the experiments that led to the discovery of the photoelectric effect and how the results were used to further inform our understanding of electrons and light. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  light: A form of energy that behaves both as a particle and a wave. frequency: Inversely proportional to wavelength. Photons with high frequency light have more energy than photons with low frequency light (Zukav 1979). wavelength: The distance between two crests of a wave of light. The color of light is related to its wavelength. This is inversely proportional to frequency. photoelectric effect: Occurs when same types of electromagnetic radiation are shined on certain kinds of matter. photon: A description of light as particles. What are the general properties of light? Are there substances whose color varies with changes in the environment or natural surroundings? 
The  Nature of  Electromagnetic  Radiation 	  Many kinds of waves exist, such as sound waves and water waves. Visible light is also a wave. It is a specific type of a more general phenomenon called an electromagnetic wave. All waves can be described in terms of the basic physical properties frequency and wavelength. These two properties are related to the speed of a wave by the following equation: speed = ?? where ? is the wavelength (usually expressed in meters) and ? is the frequency (expressed in Hertz, where 1 Hz = 1 s?1). All electromagnetic waves travel at a speed of 2.998  108 meters/second (about 186,000 miles per hour), which is known as the speed of light. We commonly abbreviate the speed of light as c when used in equations. In the case of electromagnetic radiation, this equation becomes the following: c = ?? If c is expressed in meters per second, the wavelength must be expressed in meters. 
Example 5.1 	  The brilliant red colors seen in fireworks are due to the emission of light from strontium salts such as Sr(NO3)2 and SrCO3. Calculate the frequency in Hz of red light with a wavelength of 6.50  102 nm. Answer: ?? = c ? = c/? = (2.998  108 m/sec)/(6.5  10?7 m) = 4.61  1014 sec?1 = 4.61  1014 Hz 
Electromagnetism 	  Much of our understanding of the light and the way it behaves is based on the work of Michael Faraday, James Maxwell, and Heinrich Hertz. In 1845, the English chemist and physicist Michael Faraday (17911867) discovered that light exhibited magnetic properties. His early experiments measured what happened to light when passed through magnetic fields. Following Faradays work, the Scottish physicist and mathematician James Maxwell (18311879) studied electromagnetic radiation and light. Maxwell calculated the speed of light, which was later confirmed by other scientists to be the very value Maxwell proposed. From his work, Maxwell inferred that light was probably a transverse electromagnetic wave ( Figure 5.1). He published this conclusion in 1873. The image shows light as a transverse wave. It consists of oscillating magnetic and electric fields that are perpendicular to each other and to the direction in which the light is traveling. 
The  Electromagnetic  Spectrum 	  In 1888, shortly after Maxwell published his findings, German physicist Heinrich Hertz (18571894) confirmed Maxwells inference, showing that light was indeed an electromagnetic wave. Hertz extended Maxwells work and produced electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths that were not in the visible part of the spectrum. In fact, visible light makes up only a very small part of the entire electromagnetic spectrum ( Figure 5.2). 
Example 5.2 	  Which type of light has a longer wavelength: red or blue? Answer: As is shown in Figure 5.2, red light has longer wavelength than blue light. It is to the left of blue light in the diagram. 
Example 5.3 	  Based on what is displayed in the Figure 5.2, what is the relationship between wavelength and frequency? In this figure we see the electromagnetic spectrum. Each form represented on the spectrum has a unique range of wavelengths and frequencies. For example, all visible light has wavelengths that range between ~400 nm to 700 nm. Answer: Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency. As wavelength increases, frequency decreases. As wavelength decreases, frequency increases. 
Photoelectric  Effect 	  Under the right conditions, light can be used to eject electrons from a solid material. This phenomenon, known as the photoelectric effect, occurs when some types of electromagnetic radiation are shined on certain kinds of matter. Figure 5.3 shows light rays of a specific wavelength striking a metal object and causing electrons, or photoelectrons, to be ejected from the surface. The photoelectric effect was explored by many scientists in the 1800s. It involves the same fundamental principle by which modern-day solar cells operate. Whether electrons will be released depends on two factors: the wavelength of the light source and the material onto which the light is being shined. Here is a video of a simple photoelectric experiment: URL (0:26). 
Light  Exhibits  Particle  Behavior 	  Further study of the photoelectric effect revealed some perplexing behavior that could not be explained by the classical view of light as just a wave phenomenon. For example, the intensity of the light did not affect the amount of energy possessed by the ejected photoelectrons. Photoelectrons emitted with the use of a very bright light had the same energy as those emitted with the use of a dim light of the same frequency. However, a relationship was observed between the number of photoelectrons ejected and the intensity of the light source. It was found that the brighter the light sources, the more photoelectrons were ejected. Another puzzling aspect of the photoelectric effect was that a minimum frequency of light was required in order to eject any electrons at all, regardless of how intense the light source was. Albert Einstein (18791955) studied this effect further, and in 1905, he postulated that light can also be thought of in terms of particles, now called photons. Photons of high frequency light have more energy than the photons of low frequency light (Zukav 1979), which explained why a minimum frequency was required for electrons to be ejected by a given light source. Figure 5.4 illustrates this effect. Materials that eject electrons when illuminated with light, such as potassium, are called photoemissive. Not all materials are photoemissive, nor are all light sources capable of initiating electron emission from a given substance. For example, in Figure 5.4, we see that 700 nm light will not initiate electron ejection, while 550 nm light will. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Light behaves both as a particle and as a wave. Michael Faraday discovered that light exhibited magnetic properties. James Maxwell demonstrated that the speed of light is constant and that light exists as a transverse wave. Hertz showed that light was an electromagnetic wave and only one type of electromagnetic radiation in a much larger electromagnetic spectrum. The color of light is related to its wavelength, which is the distance between two crests of a wave of light. The photoelectric effect occurs when sufficiently energetic electromagnetic radiation is shined on certain kinds of matter, causing electrons to be ejected. The photoelectric effect provides an example of light acting as a particle instead of a wave.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  emission spectra: When most substances are heated to high enough temperatures that they give off light of various wavelengths. Heisenbergs uncertainty principle: States that the more precisely the position of a particle is determined, the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant, and vice versa. What are some sources for light of different wavelengths? What is the relationship between the color of visible light and its wavelength? 
Introduction 	  Toward the end of the 1800s, we understood light as being composed of electromagnetic radiation waves that travel at a constant speed (c) and can be described by their wavelength (?) or frequency (?). However, beginning in the 1900s, new findings emerged about the workings of the atom and the composition of matter. It began with confirmation that light sometimes behaved as a particle, as seen in experiments on the photoelectric effect. Light particles, or photons, were found to have a defined and measurable amount of energy. Other findings emerged at this time, showing that not only could waves (like light) behave as a particle, but particles (such as electrons) could sometimes behave like waves. This concept of wave-particle duality ultimately led to a revolution in our understanding of matter, light, and how we view the universe. 
Hydrogen  Emission  Spectra 	  When most substances are heated to high enough temperatures, they give off light of various wavelengths; these are referred to as emission spectra. Planck studied the emission spectra of different objects and saw that when certain substances were heated, they emitted only specific wavelengths of light. In other words, the spectra were discontinuous. In particular, the emission spectrum of hydrogen included only four wavelengths within the visible light range, which could be seen separately by passing the emitted light through a prism ( Figure 5.6). Plancks interpretation of this phenomenon was that the emissions were quantized they were only emitted in fixed and predictable intervals (Haendler 1982; Goodney 1991). This was described mathematically by the following expression, E = h?, where E is the energy of a single photon, h is Plancks constant, and ? is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave. Because of this influential work on photons and quanta, Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. 
Bohrs  Atomic  Model 	  Following the discoveries of hydrogen emission spectra, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (18851962) proposed a new model of the atom in 1915. Bohr suggested that electrons do not radiate energy as they travel around the nucleus but exist in states of constant energy, which he called stationary states (Haendler 1982), orbiting at fixed distances from the nucleus ( Figure 5.7). Bohrs work was primarily based on the emission spectra of hydrogen, and it won him the Nobel Prize in physics in 1922. This model, also referred to as the planetary model of the atom, explained emission spectra in terms of electrons moving between different stationary orbits that have different levels of energy. When energy is added, an electron can jump up to a higher energy orbit, and when the electron relaxes back to a lower energy orbit, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon of light. Using the observed frequencies of the emitted photons, the energy differences between orbits in the hydrogen atom could be determined. Since the orbits had set differences in energy, only certain amounts of energy could be released for any single transition. The energy released could not be any arbitrary amount, but was instead quantized (limited to specific values). This formed the basis for what later became known as quantum theory, which accounts for a wide range of physical phenomena that could not previously be explained. Bohrs work had a strong influence on our modern understanding of the inner workings of the atom. However, although his model worked well for predicting the emissions of the hydrogen atom, it was seriously limited when applied to other atoms. Shortly after Bohr published his planetary model of the atom, several new discoveries were made, which resulted in, yet again, a revised view of the atom. 
Wave- Particle  Duality 	  French born Physicist Lois de Broglie (18921987) studied diffraction patterns of electrons, which seemed to indicate that electrons were behaving as waves, even though they were composed of matter. Further diffraction and interference experiments confirmed these findings. In 1924, de Broglie showed that particles exhibit wavelengths that are inversely proportional to their momentum. Because of this inverse relationship, large objects have wavelengths that are immeasurably small, so wave behavior is not observed. However, the momentum of a very tiny particle, like an electron, can be small enough to detect wave-like behavior during certain types of experiments. 
Electrons as  Particles 	  Two years after de Broglies work, in 1926, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrdinger (18871961) found that the behavior of electrons in atoms could be described by considering them to be standing waves. He was able to incorporate both particle behavior (mass) and wave behavior (an indefinite location in space) into one equation. The mathematical wave function for an electron provided a way to predict the probability of finding the electron in a given region of space. Schrdinger received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1933. 
Heisenberg  Uncertainty  Principle 	  At about the same time that Schrdinger was working out the mathematics of standing waves, the German physicist Werner Heisenberg (19011976) showed mathematically that it is impossible to determine simultaneously the exact location and the exact velocity of an electron, or of any other particle. In 1927, Heisenberg presented a paper in which he showed that the more precisely the position of a particle is determined, the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant, and vice versa (Hilgevoord and Uffink 2011). This later became known as Heisenbergs uncertainty principle. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The emission spectrum of hydrogen is discontinuous. The spectrum is made up of discrete lines representing transitions of the hydrogen electron between specific energy levels within the atom. In 1915, Bohr proposed a new model of the atom in which electrons exist in states of constant energy, called stationary states, orbiting at fixed distances from the nucleus. Bohrs work was primarily based on the emission spectrum of hydrogen. DeBroglie proposed in 1924 that any object exhibits a wavelength that is inversely proportional to its momentum. Because of this relationship, only very tiny particles will exhibit measurable wavelengths. Two years after DeBroglies work, in 1926, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrdinger described the behavior of electrons in atoms as standing waves. Heisenberg showed that it is impossible to determine simultaneously both the exact location and exact velocity of an electron or any other particle. This became known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. 
Lesson  Review  Questions 	  Star Light, Star Bright Teacher Page: Science Background at URL tions/light/star-light-science.html In this lesson, we studied the experimental origins for our current understanding of electrons and light. We studied the simplest of atoms, the hydrogen atom, and looked at how electrons behave in this atom. Now, we are going to study the behavior of electrons in atoms of various other elements.

Introduction 	  In the last lesson, we studied the experimental origins for an area of study called quantum mechanics. We learned that both electrons and light exhibit properties normally associated with both waves and particles, which dramatically affects the way we describe the atomic nature of matter. Our focus in this lesson will be on the arrangement of electrons in atoms. This is important because a great many phenomena in the chemical world can be explained by studying the ways that electrons are arranged in an atom of interest. For example, only a small amount of energy needs to be expended to remove an electron from atoms of some elements, most of which are metallic. Other atoms, such as nitrogen or oxygen, require a much larger energy investment in order to remove an electron. Looking at the arrangement, or configuration, of electrons in a given atom helps us to predict this and other properties that are characteristic of a given atom. 
Atomic  Orbitals 	  In the Bohr model, the atom is viewed as a densely packed nucleus comprised of neutrons and protons that is surrounded by electrons at fixed distances, which correspond to specific energy levels. However, the quantum model showed that the distances between electrons and the nucleus are not really fixed. Due to their wave-like nature, we cannot pinpoint the exact location of an electron that is in motion, but we can determine the probability that a given electron will be in a particular region in three-dimensional space. Schrdingers equations are used to determine the position of a specific electron with respect to a nearby nucleus. The region in space in which an electron is most likely to be found is referred to as an orbital. The images shown here are of simulations of probability density distributions of different electron states in the hydrogen atom. They represent where the electron is most likely to exist relative to the nucleus (Zukav 1979). There are different orbitals which can exist for a given atom and which a given electron can occupy. The four orbital types shown here are: (1) the spherically shaped s-orbital; (2) dumbbell-shaped p-orbitals (which are oriented in three different directions); (3) d-orbitals (which have five different possible orientations); and (4) f-orbitals (which have seven different possible orientations). 
Quantum  Numbers 	  We use a series of specific numbers, called quantum numbers, to describe the location of an electron in an associated atom. An electron in an atom or ion has four quantum numbers to describe its state. Think of them as important variables in an equation which describes the three-dimensional position of electrons in a given atom. 
Principal  Quantum  Number 	  The principal quantum number, signified by (n), is the main energy level occupied by the electron. Electrons in orbitals with higher principal quantum numbers are, on average, further from the nucleus and higher in energy. Possible values for the principal quantum number include any positive whole number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...). As we will see, the principal quantum number is related to the row in which an element appears on the periodic table. 
Angular  Momentum  Quantum  Number 	  The angular momentum quantum number, signified by (l), describes the general shape of the region occupied by an electron. The possible value(s) of l depend on the value of the principal quantum number n. The angular momentum quantum number can be any whole number between zero and (n-1). For example, if n = 2, l could be either 0 or 1. 
Magnetic  Quantum  Number 	  The magnetic quantum number, signified by (ml), describes the orientation of an orbital in space. For a given value of the angular momentum quantum number l, there are (2l + 1) possible values for ml, which are determined as follows: -l, (-l+1) ... 0 ... (+l 1), + l For example: If n = 2 Then l = 0 or 1 for l = 0, ml = 0 for l = 1, ml = -1, 0, or +1 The Table 5.1 shows the possible magnetic quantum number values (ml) for the corresponding angular momentum quantum number (l).

Orbitals in  Shell 	  TABLE 5.1: (continued) n

Orbitals in  Shell 	  -3 
Spin  Quantum  Number 	  The spin quantum number describes the spin for a given electron. An electron can have one of two possible spin values, either +or . An electron cannot have zero spin. We also represent spin with arrows ? or ?, and correspondingly, ms values of +or are sometimes referred to as spin up and spin down electrons. A single orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, but only if they have opposite spins. Another way to say this is that no two electrons in an atom can have the same four quantum numbers. They cannot occupy the same orbital, designated by the first three numbers, and have the same spin, indicated by the final number. s, p, d, and f Orbitals The shapes corresponding to each value of l also go by different names, each designated by a single letter (chosen based on older analyses of atomic emission spectra). For example, an electron for which l = 0 is located in an s orbital, regardless of the value of its principal quantum number n. This orbital is spherical in shape, as seen in Figure 5.10. Electrons for which l = 1 are located in dumbbell-shaped p orbitals. Table 5.1 shows us that p orbitals can have three possible orientations (designated by three values for ml), each of which is perpendicular to the two others in three-dimensional space ( Figure 5.11). When l = 2, the possible ml values include -2, -1, 0, +1, and +2, for a total of five d orbitals. The relative orientations for each of these orbitals are shown in Figure 5.12. Note that even though one of the d orbitals appears to have a different shape than the others, it is still mathematically equivalent and exhibits the same properties (such as total energy) as the other d orbitals. The most complex set of orbitals that we will encounter are the f orbitals. When l = 3, possible values for ml include -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, and +3, for a total of seven distinct orbitals. The relative orientations for each of these orbitals are shown in Figure 5.13. 
Rules for  Determining  Electron  Configurations 	  Now that we know about some of the possible locations (orbitals) in an atom that can be occupied by electrons, how can we predict which orbitals will contain electrons and how many each will contain? The set of orbitals occupied by electrons in a given atom is referred to as its electron configuration. An electron configuration essentially provides a map of where each electron is likely to be located in a given atom. In the case of a free, electrically neutral atom, the atom is considered to be in a ground state. This means its electrons are in the lowest energy locations. Several rules can be used to determine the lowest energy locations of the various electrons in a free atom. Three individual p orbitals are centered on the nucleus of the atom. This figure shows them both separately and together. 
Aufbau  Principle 	  To determine the lowest energy electron configuration for a given atom, it is first necessary to organize the atomic sublevels in order of increasing energy. Figure 5.14 shows the relative energies of various sublevels. The lowest energy sublevel is always the 1s sublevel, which consists of one orbital. The single electron of the hydrogen atom will occupy the 1s orbital when the atom is in its ground state. As we move on to atoms with more electrons, those electrons are sequentially added to the next lowest sublevels, first 2s, then 2p, then 3s, and so on. The Aufbau principle states that all lower energy orbitals must be filled before electrons can be added to a higher energy orbital. The Aufbau principle is sometimes referred to as the building-up principle. It is worth noting that, in reality, atoms are not built by adding protons and electrons one at a time. This method is merely a way for us to predict and understand the end result. As seen in Figure 5.14, the energies of the sublevels in different principal energy levels eventually begin to overlap. After the 3p sublevel, it would seem logical that the 3d sublevel should be the next lowest in energy. However, the 
Relative geometry of the f orbitals 	  the next lowest sublevels are 4p, 5s, and 4d. Note that the 4f sublevel does not fill until just after the 6s sublevel. Figure 5.15 is a useful and simple aid for keeping track of the order in which electrons are first added to each atomic sublevel. 
Pauli  Exclusion  Principle 	  As pointed out before, no two electrons in same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers; this concept is referred to as the Pauli exclusion principle. If two electrons have the same three values for n, l, and ml, they would be found in the same orbital. In order to maintain separate identities, two electrons in the same orbital would need to have different spin quantum numbers (ms). Because there are only two possible spin quantum numbers, each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, each of which must have a different spin. 
Hunds  Rule 	  Hunds rule states that, in a set of orbitals that are energetically equivalent, each orbital is occupied by a single electron before any orbital within the set is occupied by a second electron. Additionally, all electrons in singly According to the Aufbau principle, all lower energy orbitals must be filled before electrons can be added to a higher energy orbital. The principal energy levels are color coded in this figure. Sublevels are grouped together by column, and each circle represents an orbital that is capable of holding two electrons. The Aufbau principle is illustrated in the diagram by following each red arrow in order from top to bottom: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, etc. occupied orbitals prefer to have the same spin quantum number. We will see more concrete examples of how this rule works below in our discussion of orbital filling diagrams. 
Orbital  Filling  Diagrams 	  There are multiple ways to depict the electron configuration of a given atom. An orbital filling diagram provides a visual representation of the way in which an atoms electrons are distributed into various orbitals. Each orbital is shown as a single square (or circle), and orbitals within the same sublevel are drawn directly next to each other. Each sublevel is labeled by its principal quantum number and by its sublevel (which corresponds to a specific value of l). Electrons are indicated by arrows inside the circles. An arrow pointing upwards indicates one spin direction, while a downward pointing arrow indicates the other direction. The orbital filling diagrams for hydrogen, helium, and lithium are shown below. According to the Aufbau principle, sublevels and orbitals are filled with electrons in order of increasing energy. Since the s sublevel consists of just one orbital, the second electron simply pairs up with the first electron, as in helium. The next element, lithium, requires the use of the next available sublevel. The third electron must be placed in a 2s orbital, because the 1s orbital is completely filled. 
Electron  Configuration  Notation 	  Electron configuration notation is a shorthand version of the information contained in orbital filling diagrams. The squares and arrows are eliminated and replaced with the name of each occupied sublevel and a superscript indicating the number of electrons present in that sublevel. For example, the configuration of a hydrogen atom is 1s1, and the configuration of helium is 1s2. Multiple occupied sublevels are placed one after another, so the electron configuration of lithium is written 1s22s1. The sum of all the superscripts in an electron configuration is equal to the number of electrons in that atom, which is in turn equal to its atomic number. 
Noble  Gas  Notation 	  The elements that are found in the last column of the periodic table are an important group of elements called the noble gases. They include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon. For elements with large numbers of electrons, electron configurations can become quite long. The electron configuration of an atom can be abbreviated by using noble gas notation, in which the elemental symbol of the last noble gas prior to that atom is written first, followed by the configuration of the remaining electrons. Lithium can be used as an example to illustrate this method, even though its configuration (1s22s1) is not especially long. Because helium has a configuration of 1s2, that portion of the configuration for neon can be replaced by the symbol for helium written in brackets, [He]. Now, the configuration for lithium can be written as [He]2s1. This becomes more useful in the case of larger atoms. For example, the full electron configuration for cesium is 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p66s1. Using noble gas notation, this becomes [Xe]6s1. Comparing this to the configuration of lithium, it becomes easy to see the similarity. Each of these elements has a configuration equivalent to a noble gas plus a single electron in an s orbital. This fundamental similarity causes the chemical properties of lithium and cesium to be quite similar. We will revisit this trend when we discuss the structure of the periodic table. 
Hydrogen and  Helium -  The 1s  Orbital 	  Now lets see how electrons are arranged for the first several elements. We start with hydrogen, which has only one electron. According to the Aufbau principle, this should be placed into the 1s orbital, which is the lowest energy orbital. For the 1s orbital, n = 1, l = 0, and ml = 0, since that is the only possible ml value when l = 0. Because there are no other electrons, it does not matter whether ms is + or -. The configuration of hydrogen is 1s1, and possible quantum numbers for this electron would be the following: 
E 5.2:  Atomic  Number: 1  Element:  Hydrogen 	  n l ml ms 
Orbital  Type 	  + Helium has two electrons. The lowest energy orbital (1s) has enough room to accommodate both, so the first three quantum numbers are the same for both electrons. However, in order to follow the Pauli exclusion principle, the spin of the second electron must be different from that of the first. One electron has a spin of +and the other electron has a spin of . Helium has a 1s2 configuration, with two electrons in the 1s orbital. The quantum numbers for these two electrons are shown below: 
E 5.3:  Atomic  Number: 2  Element:  Helium 	  n l ml ms 
Orbital  Type 	  + - 
Lithium and  Beryllium -  The 2s  Orbital 	  Now that we have filled the 1s shell, we move to n = 2 and start to work on the second shell with lithium. 
E 5.4:  Atomic  Number: 3  Element:  Lithium 	  n l ml ms 
Orbital  Name 	  + + Lithium has a configuration of 1s22s1. There is space for one more electron in the 2s orbital, so we give that second 2s electron a -spin. 
E 5.5:  Atomic  Number: 4  Element:  Beryllium 	  n l ml ms 
Orbital  Name 	  + + Beryllium has a configuration of 1s22s2. 
Boron  Through  Neon -  The 2p  Orbitals 	  Now that the 1s and 2s orbitals are filled, the next lowest energy orbitals are the three 2p orbitals. For p orbitals, l = 1, which means that ml can have values of -1, 0, or +1. If there is only one electron in a set of p orbitals, it does not matter which of the possible values are used for ml and ms. One possible example is shown in the following table: 
E 5.6:  Atomic  Number: 5  Element:  Boron 	  n l ml ms 
Orbital  Type 	  + + -1 + Boron has a configuration of 1s22s22p1. Beginning with carbon, we start to see Hunds rule come into play. The rule states that orbitals of equal energy are each occupied by one electron before any orbital is occupied by a second electron, and all electrons in singly occupied orbitals must have the same spin. So the sixth electron in carbon goes into another p orbital (with a different ml value), and its value for ms must match as many of the other 2p electrons as possible. A possible set of quantum numbers that satisfies these criteria is shown below: 
E 5.7:  Atomic  Number: 6  Element:  Carbon 	  n l ml ms 
Orbital  Type 	  + + -1 + + Carbon has a configuration of 1s22s22p2. Nitrogen has a third 2p electron, which should go into an orbital with the third possible value for ml. Again, the ms values should be the same for as many 2p electrons as possible, provided it does not violate the Pauli exclusion principle. In this case, all three can have the same spin value. Nitrogen has a configuration of 1s22s22p3. 
E 5.8:  Atomic  Number: 7  Element:  Nitrogen 	  n l ml ms 
Orbital  Type 	  + + -1 + + +1 + Now that we have no more empty orbitals within this subshell, we need to start putting electrons in orbitals that are already partially occupied. For oxygen, one of the 2p orbitals will contain two electrons, while the others will still each have one. The electrons in the doubly occupied 2p orbital must have different spins to avoid violating the Pauli exclusion principle. Oxygen has a configuration of 1s22s22p4. 
E 5.9:  Atomic  Number: 8  Element:  Oxygen 	  n l ml ms 
Orbital  Type 	  + + -1 + -1 + +1 + Adding another 2p electron gives us fluorines configuration of 1s22s22p5. 
E 5.10:  Atomic  Number: 9  Element:  Fluorine 	  n l ml ms 
Orbital  Type 	  + + -1 + -1 + +1 + Once we reach neon, a noble gas, all of the 2p orbitals will be completely full. Neon has a configuration of 1s22s22p6. Any further electrons will need to go in the next highest energy orbital, which would be the 3s orbital.

Lesson  Summary 	  The locations where electrons are likely to be located around the nucleus are known as orbitals. Each orbital represents a three-dimensional region in which a given electron is most likely to be found. We use four quantum numbers to describe the location of an electron within an atom. The first three quantum numbers describe the orbital that the electron occupies, and the fourth indicates the relative spin of the electron.  The principal quantum number, signified by (n), is the main energy level occupied by the electron. The angular momentum quantum number, signified by (l), describes the general shape of the region in which an electron is likely to be found (the shape of its orbital). The magnetic quantum momentum quantum number, signified by (ml), describes the orientation of an orbital. The spin quantum number, signified by (ms), describes the spin for a given electron. Possible values include +or ; an electron cannot have zero spin. We also represent spin with arrows: ? (spin up) or ? (spin down). We can apply our knowledge of quantum numbers to describe the arrangement of electrons within an atom. We do this with something called electron configurations, which are effectively a map of the electrons for a given atom.

The  Periodic  Table 	  Humans have had a strong interest in classifying and working with matter throughout recorded history. Many of the elements that we are familiar with today have been known since ancient times, such as gold (aurum), silver (argentum), potassium (kalium), sodium (natrium), lead (plumbum), and copper (cuprium). An elements reactivity, solubility, flame color, compound formation, and luster are just a few of the various characteristics that people have studied and attempted to categorize. We can use our knowledge of atomic number and atomic weight in conjunction with these characteristics to arrange the elements systematically. In fact, this was how the first versions of the periodic table were created in the mid-1800s. Our modern day periodic table, pictured above, is an evolution of these earlier works. In this chapter, we will be studying how the periodic table of elements is organized and how it can be used to predict certain properties about a given element. Christopher Auyeung. CK?12 Foundation. CC BY?NC 3.0. Describe the history of the periodic table and the contributions of Luther Meyer, John Newlands, Dmitri Mendeleev, Ernest Rutherford, and Henry Moseley. Explain how the periodic table was originally organized and the inconsistencies in this first periodic table. Describe the relationship between atomic number and atomic mass. Describe our modern periodic table and how the elements are arranged. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  periodic law: States that when elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, there is a periodic repetition of their chemical and physical properties. 
Introduction 	  The earliest versions of the periodic table of elements emerged in the mid-1800s. At that time, there were approximately 60 known elements. This table has evolved over time as additional elements have been discovered and the known elements were arranged and categorized in slightly different ways. Today, there are 118 known elements, which are generally arranged in the familiar form of a modern periodic table. 
Atomic  Mass and  Periodic  Properties 	  One of the major developments that allowed for what became known as the periodic table was the discovery and measurements of atomic masses. With this discovery, some characteristic properties of the elements could be related to their relative atomic mass. This method for arranging the elements began in the early 1800s when John Dalton (17661844) described elements and compounds in terms of relative weights. Using the knowledge available at the time, Dalton prepared an early version of what later became the periodic table ( Figure 6.1). Following Daltons work, scientists began relating chemical properties to atomic weight. This resulted in several major discoveries, which led to the development of what we now know as the modern periodic table. 
Other  Early  Attempts at a  Periodic  Table 	  Following the work of Dalton, a German scientist by the name of Julius Lothar Meyer (18301895) created a table of elements that was organized based on the concept of valency, which has to do with the ratios in which one element combines with another to make a compound. Meyer published a textbook in 1864 where he presented his table of elements. Meyers table showed 28 elements systematically arranged by valence into vertical columns. The atomic weights of these elements increase by similar amounts when going stepwise from left to right across the table. There were, however, some major shortcomings of Meyers table. Only a fraction of the known elements could be easily categorized by valence, due to the fact that many elements can combine with one another in multiple different ratios (thus creating multiple different chemical compounds). Shortly after this, in 1865, a similar periodic table was published by English chemist William Odling (18291921). Odlings table described a systematic arrangement of 45 elements. However, some elements were omitted without any reasonable explanation, and this version of the periodic table was quickly replaced by subsequent versions. 
The  Law of  Octaves 	  Also in 1865, an English chemist by the name of John Newlands (18371898) published another version of the periodic table ( Table 6.1). The arrangement was based on his proposed Law of Octaves, which stated that if the chemical elements are arranged according to increasing atomic weight, those with similar physical and chemical properties occur after each interval of seven elements. 
Th 	  Newlands was one of the first to detect a periodic pattern in the properties of the elements and anticipated later developments of this periodic law. However, Newlands table, like Meyers, did not gain widespread acceptance and use, primarily because it required the omission of several known elements without any real explanation, and few testable predictions could be made from his proposals. 
Dmitri  Mendeleevs  Periodic  Table 	  At this point in history, the sharing of scientific information was not as systematic as it is today, so multiple scientists could be working on the same ideas in different parts of the world without even realizing it. In 1869, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (18341907) independently described an arrangement of about 60 elements based on increasing atomic weight ( Figure 6.2). Mendeleevs table was similar to some of the other ones mentioned above, but it gained more widespread acceptance, due in part to its predictions of properties for elements that were not yet known. Rather than omitting elements where the periodic trends did not seem to fit, he left placeholders for elements that he predicted would eventually be discovered. The predicted properties (including atomic mass, valence, and melting points) of eka-boron, ekaaluminum, and eka-silicon were found to be very close to those of the subsequently discovered elements scandium (1879), gallium (1875), and germanium (1886). The discoveries of these elements provided very strong evidence in support of Mendeleevs table, and it provided the basis for our modern periodic table of the elements. Here is a short video describing Mendeleevs discovery: URL (4:05). 
The  Modern  Periodic  Table 	  In Mendeleevs table, atomic mass increases from top to bottom of vertical columns, with successive columns going left to right. Elements that are in the same horizontal row are groups of elements that were known to exhibit similar chemical properties. However, even with the use of placeholders, there were some elements that did not quite fit the pattern. For example, Mendeleev listed tellurium before iodine even though its atomic mass is higher, because he knew that the properties of iodine were much more similar to those of fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), and bromine (Br) than they were to oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and selenium (Se). He simply assumed that there was an error in the determination of one or both of the atomic masses. This turned out not to be the case, but Mendeleev was indeed correct to group these two elements as he did. Recall that Rutherfords experiments leading to the discovery of the nucleus occurred in 1911, long after Mendeleevs periodic table was developed. Just two years later, in 1913, English physicist Henry Moseley (1887-1915) examined the x-ray spectra of a number of chemical elements. His results led to the definition of atomic number as the number of protons contained in the nucleus of each atom. He then realized that the elements of the periodic table should be arranged in order of increasing atomic number instead of increasing atomic mass. When ordered by atomic number, the discrepancies within Mendeleevs table disappeared. Tellurium has an atomic number of 52, while iodine has an atomic number of 53. Even though tellurium does indeed have a greater average atomic mass than iodine, it is properly placed before iodine in the periodic table. Mendeleev and Moseley are credited with formulating the modern periodic law, which states that when elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, there is a periodic repetition of their chemical and physical properties. We will discuss some of these chemical and physical properties later on in this chapter. The result is the periodic table as we know it today. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The early versions of the periodic table included approximately 60 known elements, while our current version includes 118. An early version of the periodic table was first published by Julius Lothar Meyer in 1864, where he used the concept of valence to group similar elements together. In 1865, Newlands described a periodic pattern in the properties of the elements that he referred to as the Law of Octaves. This anticipated later developments in our understanding of the periodic law. Between 1869 and 1871, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev systematically arranged 60 elements based on increasing atomic weight. Mendeleevs table became widely accepted, primarily because he predicted the characteristics and placement of elements which were yet to be discovered. One of the major developments that allowed for what became known as the periodic table was the idea of atomic mass, which is attributed to John Dalton. Characteristic properties of the elements could be related to atomic mass and atomic number. Ordering the elements by atomic number instead of atomic mass cleared up some of the discrepancies found in older periodic tables and provided the basis for our current table of the elements.

Introduction 	  The development of the periodic table was largely based on elements that display similar chemical behavior. In the modern table, these elements are found in vertical columns called groups. In this lesson, you will see how the form of the periodic table is related to electron configurations, which in turn influences chemical reactivity. We will first start with the following introductory video: URL (3:51). 
Periods and  Blocks 	  There are seven horizontal rows, or periods, on the periodic table. The length of each period is determined by electron capacity of the sublevels that fill during that period, as seen in Table 6.2. 
Sublevels in  Order of  Filling 	  Recall that the four different sublevels (s, p, d, and f) each consist of a different number of orbitals. The s sublevel has one orbital, the p sublevel has three orbitals, the d sublevel has five orbitals, and the f sublevel has seven orbitals. In the first period, only the 1s sublevel is being filled. Since all orbitals can hold two electrons, the entire first period consists of just two elements. In the second period, the 2s sublevel, with two electrons, and the 2p sublevel, with six electrons, are being filled. Consequently, the second period contains eight elements. The third period is similar to the second, except the 3s and 3p sublevels are being filled. Because the 3d sublevel does not fill until after the 4s sublevel, the fourth period contains 18 elements, due to the 10 additional electrons that can be accommodated by the 3d orbitals. The fifth period is similar to the fourth. After the 6s sublevel fills, the 4f sublevel is populated with up to 14 electrons. This is followed by the 5d and the 6p sublevels. The total number of elements in the sixth period is 32. The seventh period also contains 32 elements, most of which are too unstable to be found in nature. All 32 have been detected or synthesized, although for some of the later elements in this period, only a handful of atoms have ever been made. The period to which a given element belongs can easily be determined from its electron configuration. As an example, consider the element nickel (Ni). Its electron configuration is [Ar]3d84s2. The highest occupied principal energy level is the fourth, as indicated by the 4 in the 4s2 portion of the configuration. Therefore, nickel can be found in the fourth period of the periodic table. Figure 6.3 shows a version of the periodic table that includes abbreviated electron configurations. Based on electron configurations, the periodic table can be divided into blocks denoting which sublevel is in the process of being filled. The s, p, d, and f blocks are illustrated in Figure 6.4. occurs. In other words, the 3d sublevels fills during the fourth period. The f sublevel is always two levels behind. The 4f sublevel belongs to the sixth period. 
Numbering the  Periodic  Groups 	  The vertical columns, or groups, of the periodic table contain elements that exhibit similar properties. Two different ways of numbering the groups are commonly in use. The currently preferred convention is to number each column of the periodic table from 1-18. Group 1 includes hydrogen, lithium and sodium, and group 18 includes helium, neon, argon, and krypton. An older method is to skip the d and f blocks and utilize Roman numerals from IA to VIIIA. The letter A differentiates these groups from the d block groups, which are numbered using the letter B (from IB to VIIIB). For example, the element carbon could be described as being part of group 14 or group IVA, while scandium is in group 3 or group IIIB. 
Valence  Electrons 	  Because they are held more loosely to the nucleus than the inner electrons, it is the outermost electrons that dictate the chemical behavior of a given element. Specifically, much can be predicted about the chemical reactivity of a given element based solely on the number of electrons in its highest occupied principal energy level (n). These electrons are referred to as valence electrons. The remaining electrons, which are closer to the nucleus and less available for interaction with other atoms, are referred to as core electrons. Consider the element magnesium, which has 12 electrons in a configuration of 1s22s22p63s2. The highest occupied principal energy level is 3, so all electrons with a quantum number of n = 3 are valence electrons. Thus, magnesium has two valence electrons. The other 10 electrons (in the n = 1 and n = 2 levels) are its core electrons. 
Representative  Elements 	  We will now examine each block of the periodic table in more detail. The s and p sublevels for a given principal energy level are filled during the correspondingly numbered period. For example, the 2s and 2p sublevels fill during the second period. The s-block elements and the p-block elements are together called the representative or maingroup elements. 
The s-block 	  The s-block consists of the elements in Group 1 and Group 2, which are primarily composed of highly reactive metals. The elements in Group 1 (lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium) are called the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single s electron in their valence energy level. The general form for the electron configuration of each alkali metal is ns1, where the n refers to the highest occupied principal energy level. For example, the electron configuration of lithium (Li), the alkali metal of Period 2, is 1s22s1. This single valence electron is what gives the alkali metals their extreme reactivity. Figure 6.5 shows the alkali metal element sodium. Like all alkali metals, sodium is very soft. A fresh surface, which can be exposed by cutting the sample, exhibits a luster that is quickly lost as the sodium reacts with air. All alkali metals are very soft and can be cut easily with a knife. Due to their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent them from reacting with oxygen or water vapor in the air. The reactions between alkali metals and water are particularly vigorous and include the rapid production of large quantities of hydrogen gas. Alkali metals also react easily with most nonmetals. All of the alkali metals are far too reactive to be found in nature in their pure elemental form. For example, all naturally occurring sodium exists as a compound, such as sodium chloride (table salt). The elements in Group 2 (beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium) are called the alkaline earth metals (see Figure 6.6). These elements have two valence electrons, both of which reside in the outermost s sublevel. The general electron configuration of all alkaline earth metals is ns2. The alkaline earth metals are still too reactive to exist in nature as free elements, but they are less reactive than the alkali metals. They tend to be harder, stronger, and denser than the alkali metals, and they also form numerous compounds with nonmetals. 
Hydrogen and  Helium 	  Looking at the block diagram ( Figure 6.4), you may be wondering why hydrogen and helium were not included in our discussion of the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal groups. Though hydrogen, with its 1s1 configuration, appears as though it should be similar to the rest of Group 1, it does not share the properties of that group. Hydrogen is a unique element that cannot be reasonably included in any single group of the periodic table. Some periodic tables even separate hydrogens square from the rest of Group 1 to indicate its solitary status. The alkaline earth metals include beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium. Strontium and barium react with air and must be stored in oil. Helium has a configuration of 1s2, which would seem to place it with the alkaline earth metals. However, it is instead placed in Group 18 at the far right of the periodic table. The elements in this group, called the noble gases, are very unreactive because their outermost s and p sublevels are completely filled. Since it is part of the first period, helium does not have a p sublevel. Its filled 1s sublevel makes it very similar to the other members of Group 18. 
The p-block 	  The p-block consists of the elements in groups 13-18. The p sublevel always fills after the s sublevel of a given principal energy level. Therefore, the general electron configuration for an element in the p-block is ns2np1?6. For example, the electron configuration of elements in Group 13 is ns2np1, the configuration of elements in Group 15 is ns2np3, and so on. The elements of Group 18 (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon) are called the noble gases. They are an especially important group of the periodic table because they are almost completely unreactive, due to their completely filled outermost s and p sublevels. As noted above, helium might at first seem to be out of place, because it has a configuration of 1s2 instead of the ns2np6 configuration that is characteristic of the other noble gases. However, because there are no 1p orbitals, helium also has a completely filled outermost energy level, which leads to the various chemical properties exhibited by the other noble gases. Note that the noble gases were not a part of Mendeleevs periodic table because they had not yet been discovered. In 1894, English physicist Lord Rayleigh and Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay detected argon as a small percentage of the atmosphere. Discovery of the other noble gases soon followed. The group was originally called the inert gases because they were believed to be completely unreactive and unable form compounds. However, beginning in the early 1960s, several compounds of xenon were synthesized by treating it with highly reactive fluorine gas. The name of the group was later changed to noble gases. The number of valence electrons in elements of the p-block is equal to the group number minus 10. As an example, sulfur is located in Group 16, so it has 16 10 = 6 valence electrons. Since sulfur is located in period 3, its outer electron configuration is 3s23p4. In the older system of labeling groups, the representative elements are designated IA through VIIIA. Using this system, the number of valence electrons is equal to the number preceding the letter A. Using the same example, sulfur is a member of Group VIA, so it has 6 valence electrons. The elements of Group 17 (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine) are called the halogens. The halogens all have the general electron configuration ns2np5, giving them seven valence electrons. They are one electron short of having full outer s and p sublevels, which makes them very reactive. They undergo especially vigorous reactions with the reactive alkali metals. In their pure elemental forms, chlorine and fluorine are gases at room temperature, bromine is a dark orange liquid, and iodine is a dark purple-gray solid. Astatine is so rare that its properties are mostly unknown. 
Transition  Elements 	  Transition elements are the elements that are found in Groups 3-12 on the periodic table. The d sublevel, which becomes increasingly filled from left to right across the period, is in a lower principal energy level than the s sublevel filled before it. For example, the electron configuration of scandium, the first transition element, is [Ar]3d14s2. Remember that the configuration is not written in the same order as the sublevels are filled; the 4s sublevel gets filled before electrons are placed into 3d orbitals. Because they are all metals, the transition elements are often called the transition metals ( Figure 6.7). As a group, they display typical metallic properties but are less reactive than the metals in Groups 1 and 2. Some of the more familiar transition metals are unreactive enough to be found in nature as pure elements, such as platinum, gold, and silver. Silver (left) and chromium (right) are two typical transition metals. Many transition elements make compounds that are distinctive for being vividly colored. Electron transitions that occur within the d sublevel absorb some of the wavelengths present in white light, and the wavelengths that are not absorbed are perceived by observers as the color of the compound ( Figure 6.8). Transition metal compounds dissolved in water exhibit a wide variety of bright colors. From left to right are shown solutions of cobalt(II) nitrate, potassium dichromate, potassium chromate, nickel(II) chloride, copper(II) sulfate, and potassium permanganate. 
The d-block 	  The transition elements found in Groups 3-12 are also referred to as the d-block, since the d sublevel is in the process of being filled across the d-block from left to right. Since there are five d orbitals, each of which can accommodate two electrons, there are ten elements in each period of the d-block. The general electron configuration for elements in the d-block is (n 1)d1?10ns2. The d sublevel being filled belongs to a principal energy level that is one lower than the s sublevel that has just been filled. For example, the configuration of zirconium (Zr) is [Kr]4d25s2. The group number can easily be determined from the combined number of electrons in the s and d sublevels. Zirconium is in Period 5 and Group 4. Because electrons in the d sublevel do not belong to the outermost principal energy level, they are not valence electrons. Most d-block elements have two valence electrons, which are the two electrons from the outermost s sublevel. 
The f-block 	  The first of the f sublevels is the 4f sublevel. It fills after the 6s sublevel, meaning that f sublevels are two principal energy levels behind. The general electron configuration for elements in the f-block is (n 2)f1?14ns2. The seven orbitals of the f sublevel can each accommodate two electrons, so the f-block is 14 elements in length. It is usually shown pulled out of the main body of the periodic table and is placed at the very bottom. Because of that, the elements of the f-block do not belong to any of the numbered groups; they are wedged in between Groups 3 and 4. The lanthanides are the 14 elements from cerium (atomic number 58) to lutetium (atomic number 71). Most lanthanides have a partially filled 4f sublevel. They are all metals and are similar in reactivity to the Group 2 alkaline earth metals. The actinides are the 14 elements from thorium (atomic number 90) to lawrencium (atomic number 103). Most actinides have a partially filled 5f sublevel. The actinides are all radioactive elements, and only the first four have been found to occur naturally on Earth. All of the others have only been artificially made in the laboratory. 
Lesson  Summary 	  An elements placement in the periodic table is determined by its electron configuration. Valence electrons (those in the outermost principal energy level) dictate the chemical behavior of each element. Their relatively large distance from the nucleus makes them more available to interact with other atoms. Core electrons are the electrons that are closer to the nucleus and therefore do not participate in bonding. The periodic table is divided into 4 blocks (s, p, d, and f) based on which sublevel is in the process of being filled. Alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, halogens, and noble gases are the common names of groups 1, 2, 17, and 18. Transition elements are members of the d-block, while the f-block consists of the lanthanides and the actinides.

Introduction 	  In the last section, we studied the relationship between an elements behavior and its location on the periodic table. The characteristics of an element are largely described by the configuration of its valence electrons. In this section, we are going to look at specific properties that can be predicted by an elements position on the periodic table. Additionally, we will look at the formation of ions, including how to predict which ions are likely to form and which are not. 
Atomic  Radius 	  One important characteristic that determines the way in which elements behave is the total size of each atom. Free atoms are spherical in shape, so the relative sizes of the elements can be compared by looking at each atoms atomic radius, which is the distance from an atoms nucleus to the electrons in the outermost orbitals. You might expect atoms to generally grow larger as they go up in atomic number (which is equal to the total number of electrons in the neutral atom). Indeed, if you look at a single group of the periodic table, this trend holds true. Iodine is larger than bromine, which is in turn larger than chlorine and fluorine. In the case of a single group, each successive row places electrons in a higher principal energy level. Since higher energy levels are farther from the nucleus on average, this results in a larger total volume occupied by the atom. However, when going across a period from left to right, the atomic radius actually tends to decrease. Why is this so? Each successive electron is going into the same principal energy level as the previous one, so the total amount of occupied space does not really go up significantly. Additionally, because protons are also added to the nucleus as you go across the row, the pull of the positively charged nucleus on the negatively charged electrons increases. This tighter pull leads to a slight decrease in atomic radius. As a result, the atomic radii of the elements exhibit a periodic trend, gradually tends to downward, but with a sharp spike up whenever electrons are added to a new principal energy level ( Figure 6.9). 
Forming  Ions 	  An ion is an atom or group of bonded atoms that has a positive or negative charge. Ions are formed when an atom gains or loses electrons from its valence shell ( Figure 6.10). This process causes an imbalance between the number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons, so the overall ion will carry a net positive or negative charge. When an atom loses one or more electrons, it becomes positively charged, because it now has more protons than electrons. A positively charged ion is called a cation. The charge for a cation is written as a numerical superscript after the chemical symbol, followed by a plus sign. If the ion carries a single unit of charge, the number 1 is assumed and is not written. For example, a sodium atom that loses one electron becomes a sodium ion, which is written as Na+. A magnesium atom that loses two electrons becomes a magnesium ion, which is written as Mg2+. This magnesium ion carries a 2+ charge because it now has two more protons than electrons. When an atom gains one or more electrons, it becomes negatively charged, because it now has more electrons than protons. A negatively charged ion is called an anion. The charge of an anion is written in the same way as the charge of a cation, except a minus sign is used instead of a plus sign. A chlorine atom that gains one electron becomes Cl?, and a sulfur atom that gains two electrons becomes S2?. It is important to realize that atoms become ions only when the number of electrons increases or decreases. The number of protons and neutrons is not changing. Therefore the reactivity of the element may change as the valence shell configuration is changing, but the element itself remains the same. 
Noble  Gas  Configurations 	  How can we predict the number of electrons that an element is likely to gain or lose in order to form a stable ion? To answer that, we look to the noble gases. Certain physical and chemical properties were found to repeat themselves in a regular pattern when the elements are arranged by their atomic number. For example, the elements on the far left of the periodic table (groups 1 and 2) tend to be quite reactive in their pure form, whereas the elements in group 18 (the noble gases) are almost completely unreactive. Because they are so unlikely to react with other chemical substances, most of them were discovered quite a bit later than the elements just before and after them on the periodic table. This lack of reactivity can largely be explained by electron configurations. The configurations of the noble gas elements are shown in Table 6.3. 
E 6.3:  Electron  Configurations of the  Noble  Gases 	  Element (Symbol) 
Electron configuration 	  helium (He) neon (Ne) argon (Ar) krypton (Kr) xenon (Xe) radon (Rn) Except for helium, each of these elements has a configuration of ns2np6 in its highest occupied principal energy level. In other words, each noble gas has 8 valence electrons, sometimes referred to as a complete octet. Having completely filled s and p orbitals in the outermost energy level represents an especially stable configuration, so noble gases have very little driving force to react any further. Conversely, other elements will readily gain, lose, or share electrons in order to achieve a stable octet of valence electrons. The number of electrons that needs to be lost or gained in order for this to occur helps us to predict the charges of ions formed by the main group elements. Helium may seem to be an exception, since it has only two valence electrons. This has to do with the fact that the n = 1 energy level has one s orbital and no p orbitals. As a result, the first energy level can be completely filled by just two electrons. It is the presence of a filled valence shell that gives noble gases their unusual stability, not anything intrinsic about the number 8. In addition to helium, the first few elements such as lithium, beryllium, and boron, have a particularly stable configuration with a pair of valence electrons rather that an octet. 
Ionization  Energy 	  To make an electron jump from a lower energy level to a higher energy level, there must be an input of energy. Removing the electron from the atom entirely requires even more energy. This is called an ionization process. Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom (X ? X+ + e?). An equation can be written to illustrate this process for a sodium atom. Na+energy ? Na+ +e? The equation shows that energy added to a sodium atom results in a sodium ion plus the removed electron (e?). The lost electron is always a valence electron. This is because the electrons in the outermost principal energy level are furthest from the nucleus and are therefore the easiest to remove. The ionization energies of various elements ( Figure 6.11) are influenced by the size of the atom, the nuclear charge, and the electron energy levels. Ionization energies are measured in units of kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol). As can be seen from Figures 6.11 and 6.12, the ionization energy of atoms generally increases from left to right across each row of the periodic table. The reason for this increase in ionization energy is the increase in nuclear charge. A nucleus containing more protons has a larger total positive charge, which results in a greater attractive force being applied to each electron. If the valence electrons are held more tightly to the nucleus by this stronger force, they are more difficult to remove, and more ionization energy is required. However, there are periodic drops in ionization energy that correspond to electrons being added into a new, higher principal energy level. This is due to a concept called electron shielding. Outer electrons are partially shielded from the attractive force of the protons in the nucleus on inner electrons ( Figure 6.13). To explain how shielding works, consider a lithium atom, which has three protons and three electrons. Two of its electrons are in the first principal energy level, and its valence electron is in the second. The valence electron is partially shielded from the attractive force of the nucleus by the two inner electrons. Removing that valence electron is easier because of this shielding effect. Graph of first ionization energy plotted against atomic number. The interior electron cloud (in green) shields the outer electrons from the full attractive force of the nucleus. A larger shielding effect results in a decrease in ionization energy. The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons. 
Multiple  Ionizations 	  So far, we have described first ionization energy and its trends for various atoms. However, in many cases, multiple electrons can be removed from an atom. If an atom loses two electrons, it acquires a 2+ charge. If an atom loses three electrons, it acquires a 3+ charge, and so on. The energies required for subsequent ionizations are called the second ionization energy (IE2), the third ionization energy (IE3), and so on. The first six ionization energies are shown for the elements of the first three periods in Table 6.4. 
Ar 	  Notice that the second ionization energy of an element is always higher than the first, the third is always higher than the second, and so on. This is because after one ionization, a positively charged ion is formed. At this point, there is a greater overall attractive force on the remaining electrons, because the protons now outnumber the electrons. Removing a second electron is therefore more difficult. The first ionization energies for the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar) are higher than those of any other element within that period. The noble gases have full outer s and p sublevels, which gives them extra stability and makes them mostly unreactive. As we discussed above, the stability of the noble gas electron configuration applies to other elements as well. Consider the element lithium, which has a configuration of 1s22s1. As an alkali metal, its first ionization energy is very low. After it loses its valence electron (the 2s electron), it becomes a lithium ion, Li+, which has an electron configuration of 1s2. This is the electron configuration of the noble gas helium. We say that the Li+ ion and the helium atom are isoelectronic, indicating that they have the same electron configuration. The second ionization energy of lithium (bold in the Table 6.4) shows an extremely large jump compared to the first because the removal of a second electron requires breaking apart the noble gas electron configuration. The pattern continues across each period of the table. Beryllium shows a large jump after IE2, boron after IE3, and so on. 
Electron  Affinity 	  Electron affinity is the amount of energy required for an electron to be added to a neutral atom in gas form. In most cases, the formation of an anion by the addition of an electron to a neutral atom releases energy. This can be shown for chloride ion formation below: 
Cl+e? ?  Cl? +energy 	  When energy is released in a chemical reaction or process, that energy is expressed as a negative number. Figure 6.14 shows electron affinities in kJ/mol for the main group elements. Electron affinities (in kJ/mol) for representative elements in the first five periods. Electron affinities are written as negative numbers because energy is being released. The elements of the halogen group (Group 17) gain electrons most readily, as can be seen from their large negative electron affinities. This means that more energy is released in the formation of a halide ion than for the anions of any other elements. Considering electron configuration, it is easy to see why. The outer configuration of all halogens is ns2np5. The addition of one more electron gives the halide ions the same electron configuration as a noble gas, which we have seen is particularly stable. Period and group trends for electron affinities are not nearly as regular as those for ionization energy. In general, electron affinities increase (become more negative) from left to right across a period and decrease (become less negative) from top to bottom down a group. However, there are many exceptions. 
Ionic  Radius 	  The ionic radius is helpful in comparing the size of an ion to the size of its parent atom. Figure 6.15 compares the radii of commonly formed ions to the sizes of their parent atoms for Groups 1, 2, 13, 16 and 17. The atoms are shown in gray. Groups 1, 2, and 13 are metals that lose electrons to form cations, which are shown in green. Groups 16 and 17 are nonmetals that gain electrons to form anions, which are shown in purple. The removal of electrons always results in a cation that is smaller than the parent atom. This is true for any cation because the remaining electrons are drawn closer to the nucleus, now that the protons outnumber the electrons. Additionally, if all of the valence electrons from a given atom are removed, the resulting ion has one fewer occupied principal energy levels, so the electron cloud that remains is considerably smaller. The addition of electrons always results in an anion that is larger than the parent atom.	More electrons results Atomic and ionic radii of the first five elements in Groups 1, 2, 13, 16, and 17. Atoms are shown in gray. The most common ion for each element is shown in either green (for cations) or purple (for anions). in greater electron-electron repulsions, and without any additional protons to cancel this effect, the electron cloud spreads out over a larger volume to minimize repulsive interactions. 
Electronegativity 	  Valence electrons of both atoms are always involved when those two atoms come together to form a chemical bond. Chemical bonds are the basis for how elements combine with one another to form compounds. When these chemical bonds form, atoms of some elements have a greater ability to attract the valence electrons involved in the bond than other elements. Electronegativity is a measure of the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons when the atom is part of a compound. Electronegativity differs from electron affinity because electron affinity is a measure of the actual energy released when an atom gains an electron. In contrast, electronegativity is a relative scale, so it is not measured in units of energy. All elements are compared to one another, and the most electronegative element, fluorine, is assigned an electronegativity value of 3.98. Fluorine attracts shared electrons better than any other element. Figure 6.16 shows the electronegativity values of most elements. Since metals have few valence electrons, they tend to increase their stability by losing electrons to become cations. Consequently, the electronegativities of metals are generally low. Nonmetals have more valence electrons and increase their stability by gaining electrons to become anions. The electronegativities of nonmetals are generally high. Electronegativities generally increase from left to right across a period. This is due to an increase in nuclear charge because of the greater number of protons in the nucleus. Alkali metals have the lowest electronegativities, while halogens have the highest. Because most noble gases do not form compounds, they are generally not assigned electronegativity values. Note that there is little variation among the transition metals. Electronegativities generally decrease from top to bottom within a group due to the larger atomic size. The electronegativity scale was developed by Nobel Prize winning American chemist Linus Pauling. The largest electronegativity (3.98) is assigned to fluorine, and all other electronegativity measurements are made relative to that value. 
Physical  Properties 	  Elements can be classified in a number of different ways. Classifying by period and/or group is useful because it is based on electron configuration. Another way is to classify elements based on physical properties. Three broad classes of elements that are categorized in this way include metals, nonmetals, and metalloids. A metal is an element that is a good conductor of heat and electricity. Metals are also malleable, which means that they can be hammered into very thin sheets without breaking, and ductile, which means that they can be drawn into wires. When a fresh surface of any metal is exposed, it will be very shiny, because it reflects light well. This property is referred to as luster. All metals are solid at room temperature except mercury (Hg), which is a liquid. The melting points of different metals vary widely. Mercury has the lowest melting point of all pure metals (?39C), and tungsten (W) has the highest (3422C). On the periodic table in Figure 6.16, the metals are shaded blue and are located to the left of the bold stair-step line. About 80 percent of the elements are metals (see examples in Figure 
Properties of  Metals 	  shiny metallic appearance solids at room temperature (except mercury) high melting points high densities The elements mercury, gold, and copper display properties that are common of metals. Mercury (left) is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature. Even in its liquid form, it still has a high luster. Gold (middle) is malleable and can be formed into very thin sheets called gold leaf. Because copper (right) is ductile, inexpensive, and a good conductor, it is used extensively in electrical wiring. large atomic radii low ionization energies low electronegativities generally high deformation malleable (can easily be hammered out without breaking) ductile (can be draw out into thin wire) thermal conductors (transfer heat well) electrical conductors (transfer electricity well) A nonmetal is an element that is generally a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Many properties of nonmetals are the opposite of those seen in metals. There is a wider variation in properties among the nonmetals than among the metals, as seen in Figure 6.18. Nonmetals exist in all three states of matter at room temperature. The majority are gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen. Bromine is a liquid, and a few are solids, such as carbon and sulfur. In the solid state, nonmetals are brittle, meaning that they will shatter if struck with a hammer. The solids are not lustrous, and their melting points are generally much lower than those of metals. On the periodic table in the Figure 6.16, the nonmetals are shaded green and appear to the right of the stair-step line. Nonmetals have properties that are unlike those of metals. Sulfur (left) is brittle, and its distinctive yellow color lacks luster. Bromine (center) is the only liquid nonmetal and must be carefully handled due to its toxicity. Helium (right), a colorless and unreactive gas, is lighter than air and thus is used in blimps. 
Properties of  Nonmetals 	  typically good oxidizing agents form acidic oxides have higher electronegativities non-lustrous non-conductors non-ductile (few exceptions) A metalloid is an element with properties that are intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals. Silicon is a typical metalloid ( Figure 6.19). It has luster like a metal, but is brittle like a nonmetal. Silicon is used extensively in computer chips and other electronics because its electrical conductivity is in between that of a metal and a nonmetal. Metalloids can also be called semimetals. On the periodic table in the Figure 6.16, the elements that are shaded orange are considered to be metalloids, and they include most of the elements that border the stair-step line. Notice that aluminum also borders the line, but it is considered to be a metal because its properties most closely resemble those of metals. 
Properties of  Metalloids 	  electronegativities between those of metals and nonmetals ionization energies between those of metals and nonmetals possess some characteristics of metals and some of nonmetals reactivity depends on properties of other components of the particular reaction often make good semiconductors 
Periodic  Trends in  Metallic  Character 	  Pure elements with a high metallic character, meaning those that have chemical properties most similar to properties of metals, are generally very reactive. Metals tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions, as indicated by their low ionization energies. Within a compound, metal atoms have a relatively low attraction to shared electrons, as indicated by their low electronegativity values. By following the trend summary in Figure 6.20, you can see that the most reactive metals would reside in the lower left portion of the periodic table. The most reactive metal that occurs naturally in reasonable quantities is cesium, which is always found in nature as a compound, never as a free element. It reacts explosively with water and will ignite spontaneously in air. Francium is below cesium in the alkali metal group, but it is so rare that many of its properties have never even been observed. Nonmetals tend to gain electrons in chemical reactions and have a high attraction to electrons within a compound. The most reactive nonmetals reside in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Since the noble gases are an unusually unreactive group, the element fluorine is the most reactive nonmetal. It is also not found in nature as a free element. Fluorine gas reacts explosively with many other elements and compounds and is considered to be one of the most dangerous known substances. Summary of periodic trends within periods and groups. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The chemical behavior of elements can largely be explained by electron configurations. The elements on the far left of the periodic table (groups 1 and 2) are very reactive as pure metals, while the noble gases (group 18) are almost totally unreactive. Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from a specific atom. Ionization energy generally increases as you move left to right across the table or from bottom to top. Electron affinity is the energy required for an electron to be added to a neutral atom in its gaseous form. Because most atoms release energy when an electron is added, most electron affinity values are negative. These values generally become more negative (more energy is released) as you move left to right across the table or from bottom to top. Ionic radius helps to indicate the size of an ion as compared to its parent atom. Cations always have a smaller atomic radius than the parent atom; anions always have a larger atomic radius than the parent atom. When an atom gains an electron, its radius increases. Conversely, when an atom loses an electron, its radius decreases. The radius of an anion is larger than the radius of a neutral isoelectronic atom because there are fewer protons available to attract the same number of electrons. The reverse is true for cations. Electronegativity is a measure of the relative tendency of an atom to attract electrons to itself when chemically combined with another atom. In general, electronegativity increases as you move left to right across the table and from bottom to top. Periodic trends in metallic and nonmetallic characteristics mirror those of the other properties that we have discussed; the most metallic elements are at the lower left of the table, and the most nonmetallic elements are at the upper right.

Chapter  Outline 	  The opening image shows crystals of the mineral cinnabar, which is the most common mercury-containing ore. It is primarily composed of the compound mercuric sulfide, HgS. Cinnabar has been mined since the Stone Age for its uses as a pigment and as a source of pure mercury. Mercury can be easily harvested from cinnabar by roasting cinnabar powder (vermillion), which actually vaporizes the mercury metal. The hot mercury vapor can then be recondensed to yield pure liquid mercury. Cinnabar is one of thousands of minerals that occur naturally on earth. Some minerals are common (like cinnabar) while others are rarer (like ores of gold and silver). Another less common mercury-containing mineral is montroydite, which is composed primarily of mercuric oxide (HgO). The composition of mercuric oxide was first determined in 1774 by the English chemist Joseph Priestley. Priestley showed that heating montroydite powder produced mercury metal and a gas, which he called phlogiston-free air. The gas was later determined to be oxygen. The revised name, based on information gained from experiments, allowed chemists to have a better understanding of chemical composition and chemical reactions. Clear unambiguous naming makes communication much easier and more reliable. Parent Gry. commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cinabre_macl%C3%A9_%28Chine%29_.jpg. Public Domain.

Introduction 	  As we saw in the previous chapter, ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons. If an atom loses one or more electrons, the resulting ion has a positive charge (more protons are present than electrons). If the atom gains one or more electrons, the resulting ion has a negative charge (more electrons are present than protons). Positive ions are called cations, and negative ions are called anions. Because opposite charges attract one another, cations and anions are held together by strong electromagnetic forces. An ionic compound consists of a large three-dimensional array of alternating cations and anions. For example, sodium chloride (NaCl) is composed of Na+ and Cl? ions arranged into a structure like the one shown in Figure 7.1. The most straightforward way to describe this structure with a chemical formula is to give the lowest whole-number ratio between the two ions, which is known as an empirical formula. In the case of NaCl, there are equal numbers of sodium ions and chloride ions in the salt crystal. In contrast, a crystal of magnesium chloride has twice as many chloride ions as magnesium ions, so it has a formula of MgCl2. 
Naming  Ionic  Compounds 	  Ionic compounds are composed of one type of cation and one type of anion. The name of an ionic compound can be formed by writing the name of the cation followed by the name of the anion. For example, NaCl is composed A crystal of table salt, sodium chloride, is a large array of alternating positive and negative ions. The purple spheres represent the Na+ ions, while the green spheres represent the Cl? ions. of sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl?), so its name is sodium chloride. Ionic compounds like NaCl that are composed of only two elements are referred to as binary ionic compounds. Similarly, KOH is composed of potassium ions (K+) and hydroxide ions (OH?), so its name is potassium hydroxide. Ionic compounds like KOH that are composed of more than two elements are referred to as ternary ionic compounds. To learn how to name various ionic compounds, we simply need to learn the names of individual ions. 
Monatomic  Ions 	  Monatomic ions form when a single atom gains or loses electrons. For the main group elements, cations are generally formed by removing all of the valence electrons from the atom. Since the numbers of valence electrons for the representative elements are constant within a particular group, all we need is the group number of a given element to know its charge when it becomes a cation. Group 1 elements form ions with a 1+ charge, Group 2 metal ions have a 2+ charge, and the ions of Group 13 elements tend to have a 3+ charge. Heavier p-block metals such as tin and lead are special cases and will be discussed with the transition metal ions. The name of a monatomic cation is the same as the name of the neutral element. For example, the sodium atom (Na) loses a single electron to form the sodium ion (Na+), while Al3+ is an aluminum ion. Anions form when an atom gains electrons. Nonmetallic atoms typically gain enough electrons to obtain the same electron configuration as the nearest noble gas. All the elements in Group 17 have seven valence electrons, which are arranged into an outer configuration of ns2np5. To achieve a noble gas configuration (ns2np6), each of these elements needs to gain just one electron, resulting in an anion with a 1? charge. Similarly, Group 16 elements can obtain an ns2np6 valence configuration by forming ions with a 2? charge, and the Group 15 nonmetals will form ions with a 3? charge. Naming anions is slightly different than naming cations. The end of the elements name is dropped and replaced with the ide suffix. For example, when the chlorine atom (Cl) gains one electron, it becomes the chloride ion (Cl?). This structure has the same electron configuration as the noble gas argon. Similarly, sulfur can gain two electrons to become the sulfide ion (S2?), which also has a noble gas configuration. Most main group elements, particularly those in groups 1, 2, 16, and 17, gain or lose enough electrons to form ions that have the same electron configuration as that of the nearest noble gas. Table 7.1 shows the names and charges for common monatomic ions of the representative elements:

Transition  Metal  Ions 	  Most transition metals differ from the metals of Groups 1, 2, and 13 in that they are capable of forming more than one type of stable cation. For example, iron sometimes loses two electrons to form the Fe2+ ion, but it is also common for iron to lose three electrons to form the Fe3+ ion. Although they are members of the p block and not the d block, tin and lead also form more than one type of ion. Because the charges of these ions cannot simply determined by looking at the periodic table, they must have names that also indicate their charge. The Stock system, proposed by Alfred Stock (1876-1946), denotes the charge of these ions by using a Roman numeral in parentheses after the name of the ion. For example, the previously mentioned iron ions are named the iron (II) ion and the iron (III) ion. When said out loud, iron (II) ion should be read, iron two ion. Table 7.2 lists the names and formulas of some of the more common transition metal ions: 
E 7.2:  Common  Transition  Metal  Ions 	  copper (I), Cu+ cadmium, Cd2+ chromium (III), Cr3+ lead (IV), Pb4+ gold (I), Au+ chromium (II), Cr2+ cobalt (III), Co3+ tin (IV), Sn4+ silver, Ag+ cobalt (II), Co2+ gold (III), Au3+ copper (II), Cu2+ iron (III), Fe3+ iron (II), Fe2+ lead (II), Pb2+ manganese (II), Mn2+ mercury (II), Hg2+ nickel (II), Ni2+ platinum (II), Pt2+ tin (II), Sn2+ zinc, Zn2+ Notice in Table 7.2 that there are three cations whose names do not include a Roman numeral. Silver, cadmium, and zinc only form one common type of ion, so the charges on ions of these elements are considered to be implied by the name (1+ for silver, and 2+ for zinc and cadmium). By convention, the Stock system is not used for these elements, and their cations are named in the same way as those of the representative elements. There is also an older system for naming some of these cations that is still occasionally used. The Latin root of the metal name is written with one of two suffixes: (1) ic for the ion with a higher charge, and (2) ous for the ion with a lower charge. For example, the Latin name for iron is ferrum, so the Fe3+ ion is called the ferric ion, and the Fe2+ ion is called the ferrous ion. The primary disadvantage of this system is that the suffixes do not tell you exactly what the charge is for a given ion. For copper, the two most common charges are 1+ and 2+, so Cu2+ is called the cupric ion and Cu+ is the cuprous ion. The Stock system is a much more informative system and will be used as the primary method for naming transition metal compounds throughout this book. 
Example 7.1 	  What are the names of the following compounds? In the above example, we gave you the charges of the cations, but what if all you had was the formula? Ionic compounds must be electrically neutral, so if the charge on the anion is known, the charge of the cation can be determined from the ratio given by the formula. For example, we know that chlorine forms an ion with a charge of -1. If we see the formula CuCl, we know that copper must have a charge of +1, because in order for the charges to cancel, we would need to combine these ions in a 1:1 ratio. Similarly, the formula CuCl2, we would know that copper has a charge of +2, because two Cl? ions are required to balance out the charge of each Cu2+ ion. In general, the charge on the anion can be determined from inspection, and the charge on the cation can be indirectly determined from the ratio by which the cation and anion combined. 
Polyatomic  Ions 	  A polyatomic ion is an ion composed of more than one atom. For example, the ammonium ion consists of one nitrogen atom and four hydrogen atoms. Together, they comprise a single ion with a 1+ charge and a formula of NH4+. The carbonate ion consists of one carbon atom and three oxygen atoms, and it carries an overall charge of 2?. The formula of the carbonate ion is CO32?. The atoms of a polyatomic ion are tightly bonded together, so the entire ion behaves as a single unit. Figure 7.2 shows several models, and Table 7.3 lists many of the most common polyatomic ions. (A) The ammonium ion (NH4+) is a nitrogen atom (blue) bonded to four hydrogen atoms (white). (B) The hydroxide ion (OH?) is an oxygen atom (red) bonded to a hydrogen atom. (C) The carbonate ion (CO32?) is a carbon atom (black) bonded to three oxygen atoms. 
E 7.3:  Common  Polyatomic  Ions 	  acetate, CH3COO? carbonate, CO32? arsenate, AsO33? ammonium, NH4+ bromate, BrO3? chromate, CrO42? phosphite, PO33? chlorate, ClO3? dichromate, Cr2O72? phosphate, PO43?

Oxoanions 	  Note that the vast majority of polyatomic ions are anions, many of which end in ate or ite. In some cases, such as nitrate (NO3?) and nitrite (NO2?), there are multiple anions that consist of the same two elements. This is particularly common for oxoanions, which are anions in which one or more oxygen atoms are all bonded to a central atom of some other element. A given element may form several oxoanions that all have the same charge but differ in the number of oxygen atoms present. When there are two common oxoanions for a particular element, the one with the greater number of oxygen atoms gets an ate suffix, while the one with the lower number of oxygen atoms gets an ite suffix. Some elements form more than two common oxoanions, such as chlorine: 
Cl O4?, perchlorate 	  For larger families of oxoanions, the ion with one more oxygen atom than the ate anion is given a perprefix, and the ion with one fewer oxygen atom than the ite anion is given a hypoprefix. Organizing oxoanions in the following format (in Table 7.9) may help with memorization: 
Root 	  normal 
Chlorine 	  chlor- 
Bromine 	  bromBrO4? BrO3? BrO2? BrO? 
Iodine 	  iodIO4? IO3? 
Sulfur 	  sulfSO52? SO42? SO32? SO22? 
Nitrogen 	  nitrNO3? NO2? 
Phosphorus 	  phosphPO43? PO33? PO23? 
Carbon 	  carbonCO32? 
Binary  Ionic  Compounds 	  If you know the name of a binary ionic compound, you can write its formula. Start by writing the metal ion and its charge, followed by the nonmetal ion with its charge. The overall compound must be electrically neutral, so the ions must combine in a ratio that allows the positive and negative charges to cancel each other out. Consider the compound aluminum nitride. The charges on each of these ions can be determined by looking at the groups in which aluminum and nitrogen are found. The ions are: Al3+	N3? Since the ions have charges that are equal in magnitude, 1:1 is the lowest ratio of ions that will produce a neutral compound. As a result, the formula of aluminum nitride is AlN. Another compound, lithium oxide, contains the following ions: Li+	O2? In this case, two lithium ions are required to balance out the charge of each oxide ion. The formula of lithium oxide is Li2O. For compounds in which the ratio of ions is not as obvious, an alternative way to determine the correct formula is to use the crisscross method. In this method, the numerical value of each charge crosses over to become the subscript of the opposite ion. The signs of the charges are dropped. The crisscross method is demonstrated below for aluminum oxide. The red arrows indicate that the 3 from the 3+ charge will cross over to become the subscript for O, while the 2 from the 2? charge will cross over to become the subscript for Al. The formula for aluminum oxide is Al2O3. For aluminum oxide, the crisscross method directly produces the correct formula, but in some cases, another step is required. Because ionic compounds are always described by their empirical formulas, they must be written as the lowest whole-number ratio of the ions. In the case of aluminum nitride, the crisscross method would yield a formula of Al3N3, which is not correct. A second step must be performed in which the subscripts are reduced but the ratio is kept the same. Al3N3 can be reduced to AlN, because both formulas describe a 1:1 ratio of aluminum ions to nitride ions. Following the crisscross method to write the formula for lead(IV) oxide would involve the following steps: The crisscross method first yields Pb2O4 for the formula, but that must be reduced to PbO2, which is the correct formula. 
Ternary  Ionic  Compounds 	  Writing a formula for a ternary ionic compound involves the same steps as for a binary ionic compound. Write the symbol and charge of the cation followed by the symbol and charge of the anion. Use the crisscross method to ensure that the final formula is neutral. For example, calcium nitrate is composed of calcium cations and nitrate anions. The charge is balanced by the presence of two nitrate ions and one calcium ion. Parentheses are used around the nitrate ion because more than one of the polyatomic ion is needed. If only one polyatomic ion is present in a formula, parentheses are not used. For example, the formula for calcium carbonate is CaCO3. The carbonate ion carries a 2? charge, so it exactly balances the 2+ charge of the calcium ion. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Ionic compounds are composed of cations and anions, which combine in a ratio that makes the overall compound electrically neutral. Ionic compounds are named by writing the name of the cation followed by the name of the anion. Monatomic cations have the same name as their parent element, whereas monatomic anions end in -ide. For main group elements, the charges of monatomic cations and anions can be determined by looking at which group the element belongs to on the periodic table. Cations that can possess more than one possible charge are named by the Stock system, in which the charge is indicated in the name with Roman numerals. Polyatomic ions consist of more than one atom and act as a single unit. Their names and charges must be memorized.

Introduction 	  So far we have looked at ionic compounds, in which atoms of various elements gain or lose electrons to produce ions. The resulting ions are held together by strong attractions between oppositely charged particles. However, this only works for bonds between atoms in which one partner (the metal) has a tendency to lose electrons, and the other (the nonmetal) has a tendency to gain them. Then how might two nonmetals, such as nitrogen and oxygen, form chemical bonds? Neither is likely to lose electrons and become a cation, but both require more electrons to reach a noble gas configuration. Instead of a complete transfer of electrons, these atoms can bond by sharing electrons, producing what is called a covalent bond. When a group of atoms are joined together by covalent bonds, the resulting structure is called a molecule. Molecules are generally much smaller than the extended three-dimensional networks of ions that are seen in ionic compounds. We will look much more at covalent bonding and molecules in future chapters, but for now, we will focus on the ways in which molecules are named. 
Naming  Binary  Molecular  Compounds 	  A binary molecular compound is a molecular compound that is composed of two elements. In general, the elements that combine to form binary molecular compounds are both nonmetals. This contrasts with ionic compounds, which usually involve bonds between metal ions and nonmetal ions. Because ionic charges cannot be used to name these compounds or to write their formulas, a different naming system must be used for molecular compounds. Another difference between ionic and molecular compounds is that two nonmetal atoms will frequently combine with one another in a variety of ratios. For example, nitrogen and oxygen combine to make several binary compounds, including NO, NO2, and N2O. Obviously they cant all be called nitrogen oxide! How would someone know which one you were talking about? Each of the three compounds has very different properties and reactivity. A system to distinguish between compounds such as these is necessary. Prefixes are used in the names of binary molecular compounds to identify the number of atoms of each element. Table 7.5 shows the prefixes for one to ten atoms: 
Prefix 	  monoditritetrapentahexaheptaoctanonadecaThe rules for using the prefix system of nomenclature of binary molecular compounds can be summarized as follows: Some examples of molecular compounds are listed in Table 7.6.

S2 Cl2 	  disulfur dichloride 
Cl2 O7 	  dichlorine heptoxide Notice that the monoprefix is not used with the nitrogen in the first compound, but is used with the oxygen in both of the first two examples. Also, the o of monoand the a of heptaare dropped from the name when paired with oxide. The example S2Cl2 emphasizes another difference between ionic and molecular substances. Because ionic substances exist as extended networks, we simply give the lowest whole-number ratio of cations to anions, which is the empirical formula. A molecular formula is not simply a ratio. Rather, the molecular formula designates how many of each atom are in a single molecule of that substance. S2Cl2 cannot be reduced to SCl, because each molecule of disulfur dichloride contains two sulfur atoms and two chlorine atoms. 
Example 7.2 	  Name the following binary compounds. 
Writing  Formulas for  Binary  Molecular  Compounds 	  When you know the name of a molecular compound, the prefixes directly tell you which subscript to place with that element in the formula. If there is no prefix, only one atom of that element is present and no subscript is used. For example, if given the name diboron hexahydride, you would realize that the molecule must contain two atoms of boron and six atoms of hydrogen. Its formula is B2H6. Notice that metalloids like boron generally form molecular compounds instead of ionic compounds. 
Common  Names 	  Some compounds (generally very common ones) are better known by names that are different than the "official" names, which are designated by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). A few examples can be found in the following Table 7.7. 
 	  nitric oxide nitrogen monoxide 
N2 	  nitrous oxide (laughing gas) dinitrogen monoxide

H2 	  water dinitrogen monoxide 
H3 	  ammonia nitrogen trihydride 
H3 	  phosphine phosphorus trihydride 
H2 	  hydrogen sulfide dihydrogen monosulfide 
H2 O2 	  hydrogen peroxide dihydrogen dioxide 
Nomenclature for  Organic  Molecules 	  Carbon has a unique ability to form an extremely large variety of molecules with just a few other common elements. In fact, most of the molecules that make up living beings are composed of just carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (with a little sulfur and phosphorus as well). Knowing only the molecular formula for an organic molecule is not enough to identify it; we also need to indicate how the atoms are arranged within the molecule. For example, dimethyl ether and ethanol are two molecules with very different properties that both have the molecular formula C2H6O. One is an extremely flammable gas, and the other is the intoxicating liquid found in alcoholic beverages. As a result, most carbon-based molecules have a separate, more complex system of naming that we will cover in another chapter. However, the formulas for a few common organic compounds can be found in the Table 7.8.

Lesson  Summary 	  Molecular compounds are formed when atoms are held together by covalent bonds, which involve sharing electrons rather than transferring them. The formula of a binary molecular compound shows how many of each atom are present in the molecule. The less electronegative element is generally written first. Prefixes are used in the names of molecular compounds to designate how many of each atom are in the molecule.

Introduction 	  In this chapter, we first looked at the naming conventions for ionic compounds, which exist as extended networks of cations and anions. For most of the compounds that we considered, the cation was a monatomic metal (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, Fe3+), and the anion was a monatomic nonmetal (e.g., Cl?, O2?, N3?) or a polyatomic ion, which often contains multiple oxygen atoms (e.g., SO). We then looked at molecular compounds, in which atoms are held together into individual molecules by covalent bonds. Now we are going to consider acids and bases, which share characteristics with both ionic and molecular compounds. 
Acids 	  There are multiple ways to define what an acid is, but for the purposes of this book, we will define an acid as any compound that produces hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water. Based on this definition, all acids contain at least one hydrogen atom, but not all hydrogen-containing compounds are acids. When isolated as a pure material, most acids exist as molecular substances. However, when dissolved in water, one or more of the hydrogen atoms acts as an H+ ion that transfers to water, leaving behind the remainder of the molecule as an anion. This reaction with water can be represented by the following generic equation, where HA represents an acid: 
 	  As you can see, the acid reacts with a molecule of water to produce a hydronium ion (H3O+) and the A? anion. (Note: The H+ ion is sometimes referred to as a proton. This makes sense when you consider that the most common form of the hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron. When the single electron is removed to make a cation, only a proton is left behind. As a result, the above reaction is sometimes referred to as a proton transfer.) A specific example of this process can be seen in the following animation: URL In this animation, hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacts with water to produce the hydronium ion and the chloride ion. Even though HCl exists as a molecular gas in the absence of water, it produces ions when water is present. Acids have some unique properties and reactivity patterns that we will discuss in future chapters. For now, we will focus on the ways in which they are named. 
Binary  Acids 	  Binary acids are acids in which one or more acidic hydrogen atoms are bound directly to a single atom. As a result, the anion left behind when a binary acid is dissolved in water is a monatomic anion. Examples include hydrogen chloride (HCl(g) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S(g)). Both of these substances are molecular gases in their pure form, but change their properties and their names when dissolved in water. To name a binary acid, start with the name of the anion left behind after the acidic hydrogens have been removed. Then, add the prefix hydroand replace the suffix -ide with -ic acid. For example, HCl produces Cl? ions when dissolved in water, so it would therefore be named hydrochloric acid. Some other common binary acids are shown in the following Table 7.9. 
Name 	  HF(aq) hydrofluoric acid F? fluoride HCl(aq) hydrochloric acid Cl? chloride HBr(aq) hydrobromic acid Br? bromide HI(aq) hydriodic acid I? iodide H2S(aq) hydrosulfuric acid S2? sulfide Most of the binary acids listed here are monoprotic, because they have only one acidic hydrogen. Hydrosulfuric acid, on the other hand is diprotic. Its hydrogen ions are transferred to two water molecules in two subsequent reactions. 
Oxoacids 	  So far we have looked at acids that leave behind monatomic anions. However, many strong acids leave behind polyatomic anions as well. In particular, many of the oxoanions we looked at earlier can combine with one or more hydrogen ions (enough to make a neutral molecule) to produce strong acids called oxoacids. A common example of an oxoacid is nitric acid (HNO3), which can be thought of as a hydrogen ion (H+) combining with a nitrate ion (NO3?). If we simply named this as an ionic compound, we could name the compound hydrogen nitrate. However, because nitric acid exists as individual molecules and not an ionic structure, we use a different convention. To name an oxoacid, look at the anion that will be left behind when all acidic hydrogens have been removed. If it ends in -ate, replace that suffix with -ic acid. If it ends in -ite, replace that suffix with -ous acid. The following Table 7.10 lists some common oxoacids and their formulas: 
Cl O4 	  perchloric acid ClO4? perchlorate 
Cl O3 	  chloric acid ClO3? chlorate 
Cl O2 	  chlorous acid ClO2? chlorite

 	  sulfite 
H2 O3 	  carbonic acid 
 	  carbonate 
H3 O4 	  phosphoric acid 
 	  phosphate 
Example 7.3 	  Name the following compounds: 
Bases 	  Bases can also be defined in multiple ways, but for now, we will define a base as a compound that produces the hydroxide (OH?) ion when dissolved in water. Most of the common strong bases that you will need to deal with are simply ionic compounds in which a metal cation is combined with the hydroxide anion. These bases are named in the same way as any other ionic compound. For example, NaOH would be named sodium hydroxide, and Ca(OH)2 is calcium hydroxide. Some common bases are listed in the Table 7.11. 
Na 	  sodium hydroxide 
Ca( H)2 	  calcium hydroxide 
H4 	  ammonium hydroxide 
Lesson  Summary 	  Acids are molecular compounds that dissolve in water to produce hydronium ions and an anion. 
 	  The naming rules for acids are based on the suffix of the anion. Formulas for acids are written by balancing out the charge of the anion with the appropriate number of hydrogen ions. Bases are ionic compounds consisting of hydroxide ions and a cation. Naming and formula writing for bases follows the same guidelines as for other ionic compounds.

Chapter  Outline 	  The image above shows the largest gold nugget ever discovered in California, weighing 156 ounces. Gold is widely used for money, decorative purposes, and various practical applications in fields such as dentistry, electronics, and medicine. Its high malleability, ductility, ability to conduct electricity, and resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions make it a highly desirable material in things like electric wiring, colored-glass production, and corrosion-resistant jewelry and dishes. Gold is also one of the few metals that occurs naturally in its pure form. Due to their tendency to form cations, most naturally occurring metals are found as part of ionic compounds. For example, aluminum is the most abundant metal on earth, but it is rarely found in its elemental form. Instead, it is found as the mineral bauxite, an ionic substance composed of aluminum cations and oxygen anions. Pure aluminum must be extracted from minerals like bauxite through chemical means. Pure metals have very different properties than the ionic compounds that they can form with various nonmetals. Additionally, metals can be mixed together to make alloys that have different properties than either parent metal. In this chapter, we will investigate and compare some of these different types of substances. Chris Ralph (User:Reno Chris/Wikipedia). commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stringer156_nugget.jpg.

How do ions differ from atoms?	What types of elements form cations, and what types of elements form anions? 
Introduction 	  As we studied in our chapter on the periodic table, we saw that elements share a number of important properties with other elements found in the same group. The chemical behavior of a given element is largely dictated by the configuration of its valence electrons. Many elements have a tendency to gain or lose electrons in order to achieve a more stable configuration. When a neutral atom gains or loses electrons, it becomes an ion. In this lesson, we will look at ways to predict what type of ion a given element is likely to form. 
Octet  Rule 	  The noble gases are unreactive because of their electron configurations. American chemist Gilbert Lewis (18751946) used this observation to explain the types of ions and molecules that are formed by other elements. He called his explanation the octet rule. The octet rule states that elements tend to form compounds in ways that give each atom eight valence electrons. An exception to this rule is the elements in the first period, which are particularly stable when they have two valence electrons. A broader statement that encompasses both the octet rule and this exception is that atoms react in order to achieve the same valence electron configuration as that of the nearest noble gas. Most noble gases have eight valence electrons, but because the first principal energy level can hold a maximum of two electrons, the first noble gas (helium) needs only two valence electrons to fill its outermost energy level. As a result, the nearby elements hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium tend to form stable compounds by achieving a total of two valence electrons. There are two ways in which atoms can satisfy the octet rule. One way is by sharing their valence electrons with other atoms, which will be covered in the next chapter. The second way is by transferring valence electrons from one atom to another. Atoms of metallic elements tend to lose all of their valence electrons, which leaves them with an octet from the next lowest principal energy level. Atoms of nonmetallic elements tend to gain electrons in order to fill their outermost principal energy level with an octet. 
Electron  Dot  Diagrams 	  A common way to keep track of valence electrons is with Lewis electron dot structures. In an electron dot structure, each atom is represented by its chemical symbol, and each valence electron is represented by a single dot. Note that only valence electrons are shown explicitly in these diagrams. For the main group elements, the number of valence electrons for a neutral atom can be determined by looking at which group the element belongs to. In the s block, Group 1 elements have one valence electron, while Group 2 elements have two valence electrons. In the p block, the number of valence electrons is equal to the group number minus ten. Group 13 elements have three valence electrons, Group 14 elements have four, and so on. The noble gases in Group 18 have eight valence electrons, and the full outer s and p sublevels are what give these elements their special stability. Representative dot diagrams are shown in the Figure 8.1: The image shown here displays dots circling each elemental symbol. Elements will typically gain, lose or share electrons to achieve an octet. Only one group of elements (the noble gases) has a complete octet as neutral atoms. 
Cations and  Anions 	  Metals will typically lose electrons to achieve stability, while non-metals typically gain electrons to achieve stability. Two atoms or ions with the same number of electrons are referred to as isoelectronic. 
Cations 	  A positively charged ion is called a cation. Main group metals will typically form ions by losing enough electrons to become isoelectronic with the nearest noble gas. For example, lithium, whose configuration is [1s22s1], will typically lose one electron to become isoelectronic with helium, which has a configuration of [1s2] (see Figure 8.1). Li	? Li+ +e? [He]2s1	[He] Similarly, beryllium has 4 electrons (with the configuration [1s22s2]), so it prefers to lose two electrons, in order to become isoelectronic with helium (again, [1s2]). Be ? Be2+ +2e? [He]2s2	[He] 
Transition  Metal  Cations 	  As we saw in our chapter on the periodic table, the valence electrons for transition metals are variable, and electrons in the highest occupied d orbitals (which are not part of the valence shell) may or may not be lost in the formation of a transition metal cation. As a result, many transition metals commonly form more than one type of cation, depending on how many d electrons are lost. Figure 8.3 depicts some of the typical electron arrangements for the transition elements. 
Anions 	  A negatively charged ion is called an anion. Nonmetals will typically form ions by gaining enough electrons to become isoelectronic with the nearest noble gas. For example, fluorine has 7 valence electrons and is one electron away from being isoelectronic with neon, which has a stable noble gas electron configuration (see Figure 8.1). F	+e? ?	F? [He]2s22p5	[He]2s22p6 or[Ne] Oxygen has 6 valence electrons in its ground state. Remember that ground state refers to the neutral atom in which the electrons occupy the lowest possible energy positions. Oxygen is two electrons away from being isoelectronic This image shows the arrangement of electrons in their native, chemically neutral state. Notice that chromium and manganese have a half-filled d shell. Copper and zinc have fully filled d shells. with the nearest noble gas. Oxygen will therefore form ions by gaining two electrons to become isoelectronic with neon, as shown below: O	+2e? ?	O2? [He]2s22p4	[He]2s22p6 or[Ne] Similarly, nitrogen has five valence electrons in it ground state, which is three electrons away from the nearest noble gas. Nitrogen can gain three electrons to become isoelectronic with neon: N	+3e? ?	N3? [He]2s22p3	[He]2s22p6 or[Ne] 
Example 8.1 	  Write the ground state configuration for the nonmetal sulfur, and predict the ion it must form to be isoelectronic with the nearest noble gas. Answer: The ground state configuration for the nonmetal sulfur is written as: 1s22s22p63s23p4. Sulfur has 16 electrons. The nearest noble gas to sulfur is argon, which has an electron configuration of: 1s22s22p63s23p6. To be isoelectronic with argon, which has 18 electrons, sulfur must gain two electrons. Therefore sulfur will form a 2ion, becoming S2?. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Atoms or groups of atoms that carry an overall electrical charge are referred to as ions. Cations can be formed when a neutral species loses electrons, while anions are formed when a neutral species gains electrons. Particularly for main group elements, the number of electrons a given element has in its outer (valence) shell largely determines the chemical behavior of that element. The octet rule states that atoms will lose, gain, or share electrons to achieve the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas (8 valence electrons, except for helium, which has 2). Electron dot diagrams are used to help us visualize the arrangement of valence electrons in a given chemical species. When an element loses one or more electrons, a cation is formed. Metals typically become cations when they interact with other chemical species. Some transition metals can produce ions with multiple different charges due to the optional participation of d electrons. When an element gains one or more electrons, an anion is formed. Nonmetals typically become anions when they interact with other chemical species.

Introduction 	  In the last section, we saw that elements may lose or gain electrons to become isoelectronic with the nearest noble gas. Where do the electrons go when an element loses them to become a cation? Where do electrons come from when an element gains them to become an anion? For an atom to gain or lose electrons, there must be an interaction between two different chemical species. If electrons are fully exchanged, then we consider this interaction to be ionic. The resulting attractions between the positively charged cations and the negatively charged anions are referred to as ionic bonds. 
Ionic  Bonds 	  As we saw in earlier chapters, the electrons in the outermost (valence) shell of an atom are largely responsible for the ways in which that atom will interact with other elements. For example, Figure 8.4 shows the electron configurations of sodium (11 e?, 1 valence e?), neon (10 e?, 8 valence e?), and fluorine (9 e?, 7 valence e?). This image shows the arrangement of electrons in their ground states for sodium, neon, and fluorine. Our model of ionic bonding and chemical reactivity states that sodium and fluorine have a strong driving force to become isoelectronic with the nearest noble gas, neon. Because sodium needs to lose one electron and fluorine needs to gain one for this to occur, one atom of sodium can give up its valence electron to a fluorine atom, resulting in two ions with noble gas configurations matching that of neon ( Figure 8.5). The positive and negative ion are held tightly together by electrostatic forces, which are strong forces between oppositely charged particles. When large groups of sodium and fluorine atoms react in this way, the result is the ionic compound, sodium fluoride. 
Crystal  Lattices 	  Any ionic compound is composed of extremely large numbers of cations and anions. Each cation is attracted by all of the anions but repelled by all the other cations, and vice versa. In order to maximize the number of attractive interactions while minimizing the repulsive ones, the ions form a three-dimensional structure known as a crystal lattice. There are a variety of lattice forms that ionic compounds can exhibit, but all of them involve a regular, repeating pattern in which cations and anions are held rigidly in place by various neighboring ions. For example, sodium fluoride takes the form of a cubic lattice, shown here ( Figure 8.6): Some properties of the crystal form that are exhibited at the atomic level can also be seen at the macroscopic level. Due to the cubic arrangement of ions in sodium fluoride, a single pure crystal of this compound will tend to have smooth faces at right angles to one another ( Figure 8.7). Crystals of Villiaumite, a rare mineral composed of sodium fluoride. 
Lattice  Energy 	  There are a number of different ways to measure the strength of a given crystal lattice. One way would be to measure the amount of energy needed to completely pull apart an ionic substance into isolated ions. This value, known as the lattice energy, cannot be measured directly, but it can be calculated based on measured energy changes for other more feasible processes. The lattice energy of an ionic solid provides us with one way to measure the relative strength of the ionic bonds in that compound. Table 8.1 shows the lattice energies for various ionic substances: 
Compound 	  Lattice Energy (kJ/mol) 
Compound 	  Lattice Energy (kJ/mol) 
Properties of  Ionic  Compounds 	  Ionic compounds exhibit certain properties, some of which are listed below: All ionic compounds form crystals. Ionic compounds tend to have high melting points and boiling points. Ionic compounds are very hard and very brittle. Ionic compounds conduct electricity when dissolved in water. The last property above requires some additional explanation. We are all familiar with the process of dissolution on a large scale. If you stir a spoonful of salt into a glass of water, the salt crystals are broken down and seem to disappear into the water. On the atomic level, the dissolution of an ionic compound occurs when water interacts with the ions in the crystal lattice, causing the lattice to break apart ( Figure 8.8): Once the ions are dissolved, the presence of charged particles distributed throughout the liquid allows the solution to conduct electricity ( Figure 8.9). The more ions that are freed from the lattice, the more conductive the solution will be. Below is a summary of some common ionic compounds and their practical applications ( Table 8.2):

Lesson  Summary 	  Ionic bonds are electrostatic attractions between two oppositely charged ions. Ions can be formed and then bonded when metal atoms donate their valence electrons to nonmetal atoms. The ions in ionic compounds are arranged in rigid three-dimensional patterns called crystal lattices. The crystal lattice that is formed is a characteristic property of a given compound. We can indirectly measure the energy necessary to break apart a given lattice into its isolated ions. We call this value the lattice energy, and it gives us one way to measure the strength of the ionic bonds in that compound. Ionic compounds have the following properties: (1) they form crystals; (2) they have high melting/boiling points; (3) they are hard and brittle; (4) they can conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Dissolution is a process in which water interacts with the ions in a crystal lattice, causing the lattice to break apart. 
Animation of  Sodium chloride dissolution: http://www.mhhe.com/physsci/chemistry/essentialchemistry/fla sh/molvie1.swf 	  We have generally assumed that ionic compounds are composed of metal cations and nonmetal anions. While this is common, there are ionic compounds in which no metal is involved. For example, the ammonium cation is positively charged but does not involve any metal atoms. Similarly, some polyatomic anions are not solely comprised of nonmetallic atoms. What are some examples of these anions? Describe the general properties of metals compared to other element types.

Introduction 	  Metals represent approximately 25% of the elemental makeup of the Earths crust. The bulk of these metals, primarily aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium, are typically found in combined form. The most abundant metal is aluminum, which occurs almost exclusively as the ionic mineral bauxite. The other most common metals, including iron, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, are also found primarily as the cationic portion of an ionic compound. Very few metals actually occur naturally as pure substances. The ones that do are often referred to as precious or semi-precious metals. As pure substances, metals are tough, yet malleable. They are strong, and some of them are quite resistant to corrosion. They are also good conductors of electricity and heat. Due to these and other useful properties, pure metals have been valued for millennia. In this lesson, we are going to investigate a few properties of metals and the chemical reasons behind some of these characteristics. 
Physical  Properties 	  Most pure metals share a number of physical properties. Metals are good conductors of electricity and heat. They are also malleable, which means that they can be stamped, pressed, or rolled into thin sheets. For example, aluminum foil can be made into sheets that are only 13 m thick, and gold (the most malleable pure metal) can be hammered so thin that it is practically transparent. Metals also tend to be ductile, which means that they can be stretched, bent, or twisted without breaking. The copper wire shown in Figure 8.10 is an example of this. Both of these properties are facets of toughness, which is a term that describes the ability of a material to withstand shock and to be deformed without rupturing. This image shows a variety of different copper wires. Copper is a commonly used substance for wire because it is highly conductive and ductile but also very abundant (and therefore inexpensive). Pure metals tend to be shiny in appearance; this property is referred to as luster. Due to our everyday experiences, we may think of metals as being mostly dull gray in color. However, this is due not to the pure metal but to a surface layer in which the pure metal has formed an ionic compound, usually with oxygen atoms from either air or water. Most pure metals are silver-white, but some of the heavier ones (most notably, gold) take on a yellowish hue. 
Chemical  Properties 	  We have already discussed some of the chemical properties of pure metals. They have just a few valence electrons (generally 1-3), which tend to be fairly easy to remove due to metals low ionization energy and electronegativity values. As a result, they frequently form ionic compounds by transferring their valence electrons to nonmetallic atoms, which use these extra electrons to complete their valence shells and achieve noble gas configurations. The driving force to combine with nonmetals to create ionic compounds varies quite a bit between different metals. Some pure metals, like cesium and potassium, are so eager to react that they must be stored under oil to avoid an immediate reaction with the oxygen present in air. Others, like platinum and gold, are stable enough that they can be found in nature as pure metals rather than as the cationic portion of an ionic compound. Gradual degradation of a material due to its exposure to the environment is known as corrosion. Metals like gold and platinum are unusually resistant to corrosion, which makes them especially valuable for both structural and decorative purposes. Metals have a wide range of melting points, but most are quite high. Only one metal (mercury) melts below room temperature. Others (such as gallium) are solid at room temperature but would melt at body temperature, so they can be melted simply by holding them in your hand. On the other end of the spectrum, tungsten has a melting point of 3422C. Figure 8.11 shows the melting points of various elements in their most common pure form. 
Melting  Points of the  Metallic  Elements 	  The "Sea of Electrons" The reason metals behave the way they do can largely be explained by the ways that metal atoms bond together to make a solid material. Pure metals are crystalline solids, but unlike ionic compounds, every point in the crystal lattice is occupied by an identical atom. The electrons in the outer energy levels of a metal are mobile and capable of drifting from one metal atom to another. This means that the metal is more properly viewed as an array of positive ions surrounded by a "sea" of mobile valence electrons ( Figure 8.12). Electrons that are capable of moving freely throughout the empty valence orbitals of the metallic crystal are said to be delocalized. A metallic bond is the attraction of the stationary metal cations to the surrounding mobile electrons. This model for metallic bonding explains some of the physical properties of metals. Metals conduct electricity and heat very well because of their free-flowing electrons. As electrons enter one end of a piece of metal, an equal number of electrons flow outward from the other end, allowing an electrical current to pass through the material with minimal resistance. Additionally, because the electron "glue" that holds the metal atoms together is very easy to deform and reshape, bulk metals can be easily hammered, bent, and pulled without breaking apart. 
Precious  Metals 	  A number of relatively rare metals are quite resistant to corrosion. These metals are sometimes referred to as precious metals due to their scarcity and their ability to remain pure over time. The exact list varies, but metals that are usually classified as precious include gold, silver, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum. Some precious metals are shown in ( Figure 8.13). Compared to other metals, precious metals tend to have relatively high ionization energies and electronegativity values. 
Rare  Earth  Metals 	  The rare earth metals are a set of seventeen chemical elements (the lanthanide series plus scandium and yttrium) that have particular importance for a variety of industrial processes and are used frequently in modern technology. Despite their name, rare earth metals are actually relatively abundant in the earths crust. However, the extraction of many of these metals is quite difficult and has made their supply somewhat limited. They are highly sought after for this reason. Figure 8.14 shows the rare earth metals. 
Alloys 	  In addition to being used in their pure elemental forms, metals can be melted down and combined with other metals (and sometimes small amounts of nonmetals) to form mixtures known as alloys. The properties of alloys are often quite different than the properties of the base elements from which they formed. For example, iron is often mixed with small amounts of carbon or other metals to create steels. By modifying the relative amounts of the added components, properties like hardness, flexibility, and corrosion resistance can be fine-tuned so that the material is suitable for a particular application. For example, elemental iron corrodes readily in air and water (see Figure 8.15), but stainless steel (which is still mostly iron, but contains about 10-12% chromium by mass) resists corrosion to a large extent. It is used as an exterior building material for extravagant buildings such as that shown in Figure 8.16. Alloys that are mostly composed of mercury are known as amalgams. Amalgams often have special properties that stem from the fact that mercury exists as a liquid at room temperature. As a result, metal amalgams are used for a variety of purposes, including dentistry and the extraction of other pure metals such as gold. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Physical properties that are common to metals include malleability, ductility, toughness, and luster. Chemical properties of metals include the abilities to conduct heat and electricity. Many of the properties of metals are due to the presence of metallic bonds, in which metal atoms are held together by a mutually shared "sea" of valence electrons. Metal atoms lose electrons readily to other chemical species, forming cations that can participate in ionic Most of the exterior of the Walt Disney Concert Hall pictured here is stainless steel. bonds. Precious metals are relatively rare and often can be found naturally as a pure metal rather than as part of an ionic compound. Rare earth metals are an important set of metals because of their use in a variety of modern industrial applications. Alloys are solid mixtures of two or more metals (sometimes with small amounts of a nonmetal, such as carbon). The properties of alloys may be quite different than the properties of the pure elements from which they are formed.

Even to this day, it is still debated as to exactly how Damascus steel was made. 
 	  Water and diamonds two very different materials. Water can be found almost everywhere. It is in lakes, creeks, rivers, and oceans. We get water from the sky when it rains. Diamonds, on the other hand, are very rare. They are only found in a few locations on the earth and must be mined to become available. Major diamond mines are located in various African countries, Australia, and Russia. The United States has several underground sources of diamonds in Alaska, Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, and Wyoming, but the only active U.S. mine is the Crater of Diamonds mine in a state park near Murfreesboro, Arkansas. For a small fee, visitors can dig for diamonds. You wont get rich by visiting, though only a few hundred carats of low-grade diamonds are found each year. The two materials do have at least one thing in common. The atoms in the materials are held together by covalent bonds. These bonds consist of electrons shared between two or more atoms. Unlike ionic bonds, where electrons are either lost or gained by an atom to form charged ions, electrons in covalent compounds are shared between the two atoms, giving rise to properties that are quite different from those seen in ionic materials.

Introduction 	  Ionic substances are completely held together by ionic bonds. The full charges of the ions (for example, Na+ and Cl? in sodium chloride) cause electrostatic interactions that result in a stable crystal lattice. We saw in the previous chapter that most ionic compounds have high melting points, are brittle, are often soluble in water, and conduct electricity when melted or dissolved in water. Ionic compounds exist as extended, orderly arrangements of ions. As we will see, this is quite different from the structure of molecular substances, which take the form of collections of individual molecules. The atoms within a molecule are held very strongly together, but the interactions between different molecules are significantly weaker. Ionic bonds are possible because the elements involved have either donated or accepted one or more electrons. Sodium chloride is formed when each sodium atom donates its single valence electron to a chlorine atom. As a result, both ions have a noble gas configuration, and an attraction is formed between the positive sodium ions and the negative chloride ions. Another type of bond is also found in numerous compounds. A covalent bond forms when two or more elements share electrons. The electrons that form a covalent bond are not fully possessed by a single atom (as the electrons in an ion would be) but are shared between the two atoms involved in the bond. The concept of the covalent bond was first proposed in 1916 by the American chemist G.N. Lewis (1875-1946), who suggested that sharing electrons was one way that atoms could attain a complete octet of valence electrons. This idea was expanded upon by Linus Pauling (1901-1994), who eventually won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954 for his work on chemical bonding. 
Single  Covalent  Bonds 	  Covalent bonding involves sharing of electrons in s and p orbitals. The simplest covalent bond is formed between two hydrogen atoms. Each hydrogen atom has a single 1s electron, and each needs two electrons for a full outer shell. The hydrogen molecule, H2, consists of two hydrogen atoms sharing their two valence electrons. Hydrogen can also form covalent bonds with other atoms. For example, hydrogen and chlorine each need one more electron to achieve a noble gas configuration. By sharing valence electrons (each atom donates one), the stable HCl molecule is formed. Later in this chapter, we will learn how to draw covalent bonds using orbitals, but a simplified representation of covalent bonds can be drawn using Lewis structures, which were developed by G.N. Lewis in 1916. These drawings are also known by various other names, including Lewis dot structures or electron dot structures, as we introduced in the previous chapter. Each dot in the structure represents one valence electron in the compound. For example, H2 could be drawn as H:H. Each dot represents one valence electron, and the fact that they are placed between the two atoms means that they are being shared as a covalent bond. For larger molecules, it can become cumbersome to draw out all of the valence electrons, so a bonding pair of electrons can also be drawn as a straight line. Thus, H2 can also be represented as H-H. If we wanted to show the Lewis structure of HCl, we would draw the following: We can see that the covalent bond consists of two electrons between the H and the Cl. The H has a full outer shell of two electrons and the chlorine has a full outer shell of eight electrons. Covalent bonds with other halogens can be written the same way. Similar types of Lewis structures can be written for other molecules that form covalent bonds. Many compounds that contain O, N, C, S, and P are held together by covalent bonds. The number of covalent bonds an atom will form can generally be predicted by the number of electrons an atom requires to fill its valence shell. For example, oxygen has 6 electrons in its outer shell and needs two more to fill this shell, so it will only form two covalent bonds with other atoms. If we look at the water molecule (H2O) (see Figure 9.1), we see that the oxygen atom makes two total bonds (one with each hydrogen atom): As you can see, there are two pairs of electrons not involved in covalent bonding. These unbonded pairs of electrons are known as lone pairs and contribute to the overall shape of the molecule. Similarly, nitrogen needs three electrons to complete its valence shell, so it tends to make three covalent bonds, with one lone pair of non-bonding electrons left over: Again, each of the lines stands for a pair of bonding electrons (a single bond), and the lone pair on nitrogen is drawn as two dots. 
Double and  Triple  Bonds 	  So far we have considered only single bonds, formed by the sharing of one electron from each atom. Many molecules contain double bonds, in which each atom shares two electrons, or triple bonds, in which each atom shares three electrons. These are represented by drawing two or three lines in between the bonded atoms. For example, a carboncarbon double bond can be written as C::C or C=C. A carbon-carbon triple bond is shown as C:::C or with three lines between the two carbon atoms, as seen in the structure of an organic molecule called acetylene (shown in Figure 
Lesson  Summary 	  Covalent bonds are formed between atoms sharing electrons. Lewis structures are a simple way of representing covalent bonds. The shared valence electrons can be drawn using dots to represent individual valence electrons, or lines to represent shared electron pairs. A pair of valence electrons in a bonded atom that does not participate in bonding is called a lone pair. Lone pair electrons contribute to molecular shape. Atoms can form double or triple covalent bonds as well, in which each atom shares two valence electrons (double bond) or three valence electrons (triple bond).

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  How are Lewis electron dot structures determined? What are bonding pairs of electrons and what are lone pairs? 
Introduction 	  Molecular geometry is the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The molecular geometry, or shape, of a molecule is an important factor that affects the physical and chemical properties of a compound. Those properties include melting and boiling points, solubility, density, and the types of chemical reactions that a compound undergoes. In this lesson, you will learn a technique to predict molecular geometry based on a molecules Lewis electron dot structure. 
R  Theory 	  The valence shell is the outermost occupied shell of electrons in an atom. This shell holds the valence electrons, which are the electrons that are involved in bonding and shown in a Lewis structure. Valence-shell electron pair repulsion theory, or VSEPR theory, states that a molecule will adjust its shape so that the valence electron pairs stay as far apart from each other as possible. This makes sense, based on the fact that negatively charged electrons repel one another. We will systematically classify molecules according to the number of bonding pairs of electrons and the number of nonbonding or lone pairs around the central atom. For the purposes of the VSEPR model, a double or triple bond is no different in terms of repulsion than a single bond. We will begin by examining molecules in which the central atom does not have any lone pairs. 
Central  Atom with  No  Lone  Pairs 	  In order to easily understand the types of molecules possible, we will use a simple system to identify the parts of any molecule. 
B = atoms surrounding the central atom 	  Subscripts after the B will denote the number of B atoms that are bonded to the central A atom. For example, AB4 is a molecule with a central atom surrounded by four covalently bonded atoms. Again, it does not matter if those bonds are single, double, or triple bonds. 
B2 	  Beryllium hydride (BeH2) consists of a central beryllium atom with two single bonds to hydrogen atoms. Note that it violates the octet rule, because the central atom has only 4 valence electrons. This is acceptable because beryllium only has two valence electrons to begin with, so it is not possible for it to create more than two covalent bonds with hydrogen atoms. According to the requirement that electron pairs maximize their distance from one another, the two bonding pairs in the BeH2 molecules will arrange themselves on directly opposite sides of the central Be atom. The resulting geometry is a linear molecule, shown in a ball and stick model in Figure 9.3: The H-Be-H bond angle is 180 because of its linear geometry. Carbon dioxide is another example of a molecule which falls under the AB2 category. Its Lewis structure consists of double bonds between the central carbon atom and each oxygen atom. The repulsion between the two double bonds on either side of the carbon atom is no different than the repulsion between the two single bonds on either side of the beryllium in the previous example. Therefore carbon dioxide is also linear, as this achieves the maximum distance between the electron pair bonds. 
B3 	  Boron trifluoride (BF3) consists of a central boron atom with three single bonds to fluorine atoms. The boron atom is an exception to the octet rule, and generally only needs 6 atoms to be stable in a bonded molecule. The geometry of the BF3 molecule is called trigonal planar. The fluorine atoms are positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The F-B-F angle is 120, and all four atoms lie in the same plane. 
B4 	  Methane (CH4) is an organic compound that is the primary component of natural gas. Its structure consists of a central carbon atom with four single bonds to hydrogen atoms. In order to maximize their distance from one another, the four groups of bonding electrons do not lie in the same plane. Instead, each of the hydrogen atoms lies at the corners of a geometrical shape called a tetrahedron. The carbon atom is at the center of the tetrahedron. Each face of a tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle. (left) Tetrahedron. (right) Ball and stick model of methane. The molecular geometry of the methane molecule is referred to as tetrahedral. The H-C-H bond angles are 109.5, which is larger than the 90 that they would be if the molecule was planar. This way, the bonds are as far apart as possible to minimize electron repulsion. When drawing a structural formula for a molecule such as methane, it is advantageous to be able to indicate the three-dimensional character of its shape. The structural formula in the Figure 9.7 is called a perspective drawing. The dotted line bond should be visualized as going back into the page, while the solid triangle bond should be visualized as coming out of the page. 
B5 	  The central phosphorus atom in a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) has ten electrons surrounding it, exceeding the octet rule. This is allowed because phosphorus is a third period element and has access to d orbitals, which will be discussed later on. Unlike the other basic shapes, the five chlorine atoms in this arrangement are not equivalent with respect to their geometric relationship to the phosphorus atom. Three of the chlorine atoms lie in a plane, with Cl-P-Cl bond angles of 120. This portion of the molecule is essentially the same as a trigonal planar arrangement. These chlorine atoms are referred to as the equatorial atoms because they are arranged around the center of the molecule. The other two chlorine atoms are oriented exactly perpendicular to the plane formed by the phosphorus atom and the equatorial chlorine atoms. These are called the axial chlorine atoms. (left) Trigonal bipyramidal. (right) Ball and stick model of phosphorus pentachloride. In the Figure 9.8, the axial chlorine atoms form a vertical axis with the central phosphorus atom. There is a 90 angle between P-Claxial bonds and P-Clequitorial bonds. The molecular geometry of PCl5 is called trigonal bipyramidal. A surface covering the molecule would take the shape of two three-sided pyramids pointing in opposite directions. 
B6 	  The sulfur atom in sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) also exceeds the octet rule. Unlike the trigonal bipyramidal structure, all of the fluorine atoms in SF6 are equivalent. The molecular geometry is called octahedral, because a surface covering the molecule would have eight sides. All of the F-S-F angles are 90 in an octahedral molecule, with the exception of the fluorine atoms that are directly opposite one another which have a 180 bond angle. 
Central  Atom with  One or  More  Lone  Pairs 	  The molecular geometries of molecules change when the central atom has one or more lone pairs of electrons. The number bonds to the central atom plus the number of lone pairs on the central atom gives us what is called the electron domain geometry. Electron domain geometries refer to the five molecular shapes learned so far: linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, or octahedral. However, if one or more of the bonding pairs of electrons is replaced with a lone pair, the shape of the molecules is altered. This can apply to any of the geometries discussed above, but for now we will focus on the tetrahedral electron domain geometry. 
Ammonia 	  The ammonia molecule contains three single bonds and one lone pair on the central nitrogen atom. The domain geometry for a molecule with four electron pairs is tetrahedral, as was seen with CH4. In the ammonia molecule, one of the electron pairs is a lone pair rather than a bonding pair. The molecular geometry of NH3 is called trigonal pyramidal. Recall that the bond angles in the tetrahedral CH4 molecule are all equal to 109.5. One might expect the H-N-H bond angles in ammonia to be 109.5 as well, but slight adjustments need to be made for the presence of lone pairs. Within the context of the VSEPR model, lone pairs of electrons are considered to be slightly more repulsive than bonding pairs of electrons, due to their closer proximity to the central atom. In other words, lone pairs take up more space. Therefore the H-N-H angle is slightly less than 109.5. Its actual value is approximately 107. 
Water 	  A water molecule consists of two bonding pairs and two lone pairs. The water molecule, like the ammonia and methane molecules, has a tetrahedral domain geometry. In the water molecule, two of the electron pairs are lone pairs rather than bonding pairs. The molecular geometry of the water molecule is referred to as bent. The H-O-H bond angle is 104.5, which is smaller than the bond angle in NH3. 
Summary of  	  The VSEPR model can be applied to predict the molecular geometry of a given molecular compound. There are a number of additional shapes that can be constructed starting from other electron domain geometries and replacing one or more atoms with lone pairs. We will not go over each individual case in this book, but the names for various shapes are provided in the tables below as a reference. To determine the shape of a given molecule, use the following steps: Draw the Lewis electron dot structure for the molecule. Count the total number of electron pairs around the central atom. This is referred to as the electron domain geometry. If there are no lone pairs around the central atom, refer to Table 9.1, to determine the molecular geometry, which is the same as the electron domain geometry. If there are one or more lone pairs on the central atom, the molecular geometry (the actual shape of the molecule) will not be the same as the electron domain geometry. Refer to Table 9.2. In predicting bond angles, remember that a lone pair takes up more space than a bonding pair or pairs of electrons. TABLE 9.1: Geometries of Molecules in Which the Central Atom Has No Lone Pairs

Lesson  Summary 	  Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory is a technique for predicting the molecular geometry of a molecule. A molecules shape provides important information that can be used to understand its chemical and physical properties. According to VSEPR, covalent bonds and lone pairs distribute themselves around a central atom in such a way as to maximize their distance from each other. Electron domain geometries are based on the total number of bonds and lone pairs, while molecular geometries look only at the arrangements of atoms and bonding pairs.

Understand the concept of polarity. Define electronegativity. Determine the polarity of a chemical bond using the electronegativity chart. Distinguish between nonpolar covalent, polar covalent, and ionic bonds in terms of electron sharing. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  polarity: A property of molecules in which one or more atoms possess either a partial positive or a partial negative charge. electronegativity: The ability to attract shared electrons. nonpolar covalent bond: Exists only between two identical atoms. polar covalent bond: Exists when the electrons are still shared (the bond is covalent), but the bond is significantly polarized. 
Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  What are covalent bonds? 
Introduction 	  We have learned that covalently bonded molecules share valence electrons in order for atoms to fill their valence shells. However, sometimes one of the atoms has a greater attraction for electrons than another, resulting in an unequal sharing of electrons. This results in molecular polarity. 
Electronegativity 	  When two atoms of different elements come together to form a bond, the atoms generally do not attract the shared electrons with the same amount of pull. The ability to attract shared electrons is a property known as electronegativity. The higher the electronegativity value, the more pull is exerted by that element. Electronegativity values for various elements are found in Figure 9.12. Electronegativities of the elements. The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson "Trends in the Periodic Table," electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. 
Polar  Bonds 	  If there is a difference between the electronegativity values of the two atoms involved in a covalent bond, the bond is said to be polar. In this situation, the more electronegative atom has a stronger tendency to attract the shared electrons toward itself. For example, in the water molecule, oxygen has an electronegativity value of 3.5, while hydrogen has a value of 2.1. Since O has a higher electronegativity value, the electrons in each covalent bond will be pulled closer to the oxygen atom. Because the negatively charged electrons are spending more time near the oxygen atom and less time near the hydrogen atoms, each atom appears to have a partial electric charge when averaged over time. The Greek letter ? (delta) is used to designate a partial charge. As we see in the illustration, oxygen has a partial negative charge, and the hydrogens each have a partial positive change. These charges are fractional charges, less than the full +1 or -1 charge that we might see for a sodium or chloride ion. A similar situation occurs in the hydrogen fluoride molecule. The difference in electronegativity between fluorine (4.0) and hydrogen (2.1) is quite high, so the shared electrons spend much more time in the vicinity of the fluorine atom. As a result, fluorine carries a partial negative charge in this molecule, whereas hydrogen carries a partial positive charge. The hydrogen fluoride molecule. The blue region represents an area of partial positive charge, the white area is electrically neutral, and the pink area is a zone of partial negative charge. 
Classifying  Chemical  Bonds 	  How do we know if a specific pair of electrons will form a covalent bond or an ionic one? Electronegativity data turns out to be a fairly useful tool to make these predictions. Although there is no clear line between a polar covalent bond and an ionic one, we can define some general guidelines: 
Lesson  Summary 	  Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to draw shared electrons towards itself. Polar bonds contain atoms that possess either a partial positive or a partial negative charge. Electronegativity differences can be used to predict the extent to which a particular chemical bond is polarized.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  What is electronegativity? How does electronegativity influence the charge distribution within a molecule? 
Introduction 	  In some ways, a collection of gas molecules represents the simplest form of matter. Because the individual molecules are so far apart, they have only fleeting interactions with one another. In contrast, molecules that have clustered together to form a liquid or solid are constantly exerting forces on each other. In fact, it is only because of these attractive forces that molecular solids and liquids exist at all. In this lesson, we will look at some of the ways in which molecules and ions attract one another to form solids and liquids. 
Ion- Ion  Interactions 	  Ion-ion interactions have already been considered in a previous chapter, so we will simply do a short review. These interactions are most significant in the solid state. When dissolved in water, ions are shielded from one another by water molecules, making ion-ion interactions less prevalent. In the solid state, ions interact by forming lattices in which oppositely charged ions arrange themselves in a regular fashion. In the Figure 9.15, the small purple Na ions interlock with the larger green chlorine ions in a pattern defined by the relative sizes and charges of the two ions. Because each ion has a full positive or negative charge, the forces holding two ions together are relatively strong. Ion-ion interaction to form a lattice. More complex polyatomic ions can also participate in these types of interactions. Sodium acetate ( Figure 9.16) is one such material. 
Dipole- Dipole  Interactions 	  A dipole occurs when two opposite charges are separated by some amount of distance. We have already seen dipoles in the form of polar bonds. For example, each O-H bond in water is an example of a dipole; the partial positive charge on hydrogen is separated from the partial negative charge on oxygen by the length of the bond. A molecular dipole is the geometric sum of all the individual bond dipoles in a molecule. In order for a molecule to have a dipole, it must have at least one polar bond. However, not all molecules with polar bonds have an overall molecular dipole. Sometimes the dipoles within a molecule will effectively cancel each other out, giving a zero net molecular dipole. This is often seen in symmetrical molecules. A dipole-dipole force can be seen when two polar molecules interact with one another. The partial positive region of one molecule will be attracted to the partial negative region of an adjacent one. Because both charges are partial (less than a full charge), these interactions are weaker than those involving ions. An example of a dipole-dipole interaction between two molecules of HCl is shown in the Figure 9.17. 
Ion- Dipole  Interactions 	  An ion-dipole interaction involves the attraction between a fully charged entity and a polar molecule. Both cations and anions can participate in this type of bonding. A cation will be attracted to the partial negative portion of the polar molecule, while an anion will interact with the partial positive region. The interaction of sodium and chloride ions with water is one example of an ion-dipole interaction: The positive sodium ions are attracted to the partial negative portion of the water molecule (the red oxygen atoms), while the negative chloride ions interact with the partial positive hydrogen portion (the blue atoms). Because one of the bonding partners has only a partial positive or negative charge, these forces are somewhat weaker than ion-ion interactions. ions with polar water Interactions	of molecules. 
Dispersion  Forces 	  Somewhat more challenging to visualize are dispersion forces. These interactions are defined as attractive forces that arise as a result of temporary dipoles induced in atoms or molecules. They are often referred to as London dispersion forces due to the work done by the German-American physicist Fritz London (1900-1954). Two things need to be kept in mind with regard to these forces: they are relatively weak, and they do not require any permanent polarity. Induced dipoles are caused by local and temporary changes in the environment immediately around a molecule. Brief distortions in the electron cloud cause temporary dipoles to come and go, and these provide a way for even completely nonpolar molecules to attract one another. Although these may seem almost insignificant compared to the stronger forces discussed above, nonpolar substances would have no way to form solids or liquids without them. Note that all molecular substances experience dispersion forces, but for small polar molecules, dipoledipole interactions will be the dominant attractive force. 
The  Hydrogen  Bond 	  A special case of dipole-dipole interactions is referred to as the hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonding occurs only in molecules where hydrogen is covalently bonded to one of three elements: fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen. These three elements are so electronegative that they withdraw the majority of the electron density from the covalent bond with hydrogen, leaving the H atom very electron-deficient. Because the hydrogen atom does not have any electrons other than the ones in the covalent bond, its positively charged nucleus is almost completely exposed, allowing strong attractions to other nearby lone pairs. These lone pairs are generally on atoms with partial negative charges in adjacent molecules, although hydrogen bonds within a single molecule can also occur if the structure of the molecule is appropriate. A particularly important example of hydrogen bonding occurs between water molecules. Because water has two O-H bonds and two lone pairs on each oxygen atom, extensive networks of hydrogen bonds can form, allowing ice and liquid water to exist. Quite often, the partial charges are not explicitly written when drawing hydrogen bonds, but they are always there. Illustrated in the Figure 9.21 are a few more examples of hydrogen bonding in molecules. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A variety of interactions can occur between molecules that involve attractions between full or partial charges. Molecules that have a partial positive region and a partial negative region are said to possess a molecular dipole. The interactions between these dipoles are what allow molecules to condense into the liquid or solid states. Even completely nonpolar molecules can attract each other due to dispersion forces. The hydrogen bond is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction that is seen in a variety of molecular compounds.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  How are electrons arranged in atomic orbitals? What is the difference between the electron domain geometry of a molecule and its molecular geometry? Earlier in this chapter, you learned how to draw Lewis electron-dot structures for molecules and predict their shapes using VSEPR theory. In this lesson, we will see how these concepts relate to the way in which electrons behave in their atomic orbitals when a covalent bond forms. 
Introduction 	  Atoms form covalent bonds by sharing valence electrons. The valence electrons are located in atomic orbitals. However, when a bond forms, the structure of the atomic orbitals changes. In this lesson, we will see how the atomic orbitals interact to share valence electrons and form different types of covalent bonds. 
Valence  Bond  Theory 	  Covalent bonds form when the electron clouds of two atoms overlap with each other. In a simple H2 molecule, the single electron in each atom becomes attracted to the nucleus of the other atom in the molecule as the atoms come closer together. Other covalent bonds form in the same way as unpaired electrons from two atoms match up to form the bond. In a fluorine atom, there is an unpaired electron in one of the 2p orbitals. When a F2 molecule forms, the 2p orbitals from each of the two atoms overlap to produce the F?F covalent bond. The overlapping orbitals do not have to be of the same type to form a covalent bond. For example, in a molecule of HF, the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atom overlaps with the 2p orbital of the fluorine atom ( Figure 9.22): In a molecule of hydrogen fluoride (HF), the covalent bond occurs due to an overlap between the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atom and the 2p orbital of the fluorine atom. In essence, any covalent bond results from a combination of atomic orbitals. This idea forms the basis for a quantum mechanical theory called valence bond (VB) theory. Valence bond theory states that covalent bonds are formed by the overlap of partially filled atomic orbitals. 
Hybrid  Orbitals 	  The bonding scheme described by valence bond theory must account for molecular geometries as predicted by VSEPR theory. To do that, we must introduce a concept called hybrid orbitals. sp3 Hybridization Unfortunately, overlap of existing atomic orbitals (s, p, etc.) is not sufficient to explain some of the bonding and molecular geometries that are observed. Consider the carbon atom in the methane (CH4) molecule. An isolated carbon atom has an electron configuration of 1s22s22p2, meaning that it has two unpaired electrons in its 2p orbitals, as shown below. According to the description of valence bond theory so far, carbon would be expected to form only two bonds, corresponding to its two unpaired electrons. However, methane is a common and stable molecule that contains four equivalent C?H bonds. One way to account for this might be to promote one of the 2s electrons to the empty 2p orbital. Now, four bonds are possible. The promotion of the electron costs a small amount of energy, but recall that the process of bond formation is accompanied by a decrease in energy. The two extra bonds that can now be formed result in a lower overall energy, and thus a greater stability, for the CH4 molecule. Carbon normally forms four bonds in most of its compounds. The number of bonds is now correct, but the geometry is wrong. The three p orbitals (px, py, pz) are oriented at 90 angles relative to one another. However, as we saw in our discussion of VSEPR theory, the observed H?C?H bond angle in the tetrahedral CH4 molecule is actually 109.5. Therefore, the methane molecule cannot be adequately represented by simple overlap of the 2s and 2p orbitals of carbon with the 1s orbitals of each hydrogen atom. To explain the bonding in methane, it is necessary to introduce the concept of hybridization and hybrid atomic orbitals. Hybridization is the mixing of the atomic orbitals in an atom to produce a set of hybrid orbitals. When hybridization occurs, it must do so as a result of the mixing of nonequivalent orbitals. For example, s and p orbitals can hybridize, but p orbitals cannot hybridize only with other p orbitals. Hybrid orbitals are the atomic orbitals obtained when two or more nonequivalent orbitals from the same atom combine in preparation for bond formation. In the current case of carbon, the single 2s orbital hybridizes with the three 2p orbitals to form a set of four hybrid orbitals, called sp3 hybrids. The sp3 hybrids are all equivalent to one another. Spatially, the hybrid orbitals point towards the four corners of a tetrahedron ( Figure 9.23): The large lobe from each of the sp3 hybrid orbitals then overlaps with normal unhybridized 1s orbitals on each hydrogen atom to form the tetrahedral methane molecule. Another example of sp3 hybridization occurs in the ammonia (NH3) molecule. The electron domain geometry of ammonia is also tetrahedral, meaning that there are four groups of electrons around the central nitrogen atom. Unlike methane, however, one of those electron groups is a lone pair. The resulting molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal. Just as in the carbon atom, the hybridization process starts as a promotion of a 2s electron to a 2p orbital, followed by hybridization to form a set of four sp3 hybrids. In this case, one of the hybrid orbitals already contains a pair of electrons, leaving only three half-filled orbitals available to form covalent bonds with three hydrogen atoms. The process of sp3 hybridization is the mixing of an s orbital with a set of three p orbitals to form a set of four sp3 hybrid orbitals. Each large lobe of the hybrid orbitals points to one corner of a tetrahedron. The methane and ammonia examples illustrate the connection between orbital hybridization and the VSEPR model. The electron domain geometry predicted by VSEPR leads directly to the type of hybrid orbitals that must be formed to accommodate that geometry. Both methane and ammonia have tetrahedral electron domain geometries and thus both undergo sp3 hybridization. Likewise, the bent-shaped water molecule (H2O) also involves the formation of sp3 hybrids on the oxygen atom. In this case, however, there are two hybrid orbitals which have lone pairs and two which bond to the hydrogen atoms. Because the electron domain geometry for H2O is tetrahedral, the hybridization is sp3. The trigonal pyramidal ammonia molecule also results from sp3 hybridization of the central (nitrogen) atom. Of the four groups of electrons surrounding the nitrogen atom, three form single covalent bonds to hydrogen atoms, while one group is a lone pair. sp2 Hybridization Boron trifluoride (BF3) is predicted to have a trigonal planar geometry by VSEPR. First, a paired 2s electron is promoted to an empty 2p orbital. This is followed by hybridization of the three occupied orbitals to form a set of three sp2 hybrids, leaving the 2pz orbital unhybridized. The choice of which p orbital to leave unhybridized is arbitrary, but 2pz is conventionally chosen in the case of sp2 hybrids. The geometry of the sp2 hybrid orbitals is trigonal planar, with the large lobe of each orbital pointing towards one corner of an equilateral triangle ( Figure 9.25). The angle between any two of the hybrid orbital lobes is 120. Each can bond with a 2p orbital from a fluorine atom to form the trigonal planar BF3 molecule. Other molecules with a trigonal planar electron domain geometry also form sp2 hybrid orbitals. For example, the electron domain geometry of ozone (O3) is trigonal planar, although the presence of a lone pair on the central oxygen atom makes the molecular geometry bent. The hybridization of the central O atom of ozone is sp2. sp Hybridization A beryllium hydride (BeH2) molecule is predicted to be linear by VSEPR. The beryllium atom contains only paired electrons, so it must also undergo hybridization. One of the 2s electrons is first promoted to an empty 2p orbital. The process of sp2 hybridization involves the mixing of one s orbital with a set of two p orbitals (px and py) to form a set of three sp2 hybrid orbitals. Each large lobe of the hybrid orbitals points to one corner of a triangle. The occupied orbitals are then hybridized, and the result is a pair of sp hybrid orbitals. The two remaining p orbitals (arbitrarily chosen to be py and pz) do not hybridize and remain unoccupied. The geometry of the sp hybrid orbitals is linear, with the large lobes of the two orbitals pointing in opposite directions along one axis, arbitrarily defined as the x-axis ( Figure 9.26). Each can bond with a 1s orbital from a hydrogen atom to form the linear BeH2 molecule. Other molecules whose electron domain geometry is linear and for whom hybridization is necessary also form sp hybrid orbitals. Examples include CO2 and C2H2, which will be discussed further in the next section on hybridization and multiple bonds. It should be noted that molecules with trigonal bipyramidal or octahedral electron geometries form different types of hybrids that also involve the participation of one or more d orbitals. However, we will not consider these types of hybrid orbitals here. The process of sp hybridization involves the mixing of an s orbital with a single p orbital (conventionally the px orbital), to form a set of two sp hybrids. The two lobes of the sp hybrids point in opposite directions to produce a linear molecule. 
Hybridization in  Molecules with  Double or  Triple  Bonds 	  The hybridization model helps explain molecules with double or triple bonds. Consider the ethene molecule (C2H4), which contains a double covalent bond between the two carbon atoms and single bonds between the carbon atoms and the hydrogen atoms. The entire molecule is planar. As can be seen in Figure 9.27, the electron domain geometry around each carbon atom is trigonal planar, which corresponds to sp2 hybridization. Previously, we saw carbon undergo sp3 hybridization in a CH4 molecule, so how does it work in this case? As seen below, the electron promotion is the same, but the hybridization occurs only between the single s orbital and two of the three p orbitals. This generates a set of three sp2 hybrids along with an unhybridized 2pz orbital. Each orbital contains one electron and is capable of forming a covalent bond. The three sp2 hybrid orbitals lie in one plane, while the unhybridized 2pz orbital is oriented perpendicular to that plane. The bonding in C2H4 is explained as follows. One of the three sp2 hybrids forms a bond by overlapping with the identical hybrid orbital on the other carbon atom. The remaining two hybrid orbitals from bonds by overlapping with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen atom. Finally, the 2pz orbitals on each carbon atom form another bond by overlapping with one another sideways. It is necessary to distinguish between the two types of covalent bonds in a C2H4 molecule. A sigma bond (? bond) is a bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in an end-to-end fashion, with the electron density concentrated between the nuclei of the bonding atoms. A pi bond (? bond) is a bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in a side-by-side fashion, with the electron density concentrated above and below the plane of the nuclei of the bonding atoms. Figure 9.28 shows the two types of bonding in C2H4. The sp2 hybrid orbitals are orange and the pz orbital is green. Three sigma bonds are formed by each carbon atom with its hybrid orbitals. The pi bond is the second bond of the double bond between the carbon atoms and is shown as an elongated blue lobe that extends both above and below the plane of the molecule, which contains the six atoms and all of the sigma bonds. In a conventional Lewis electron-dot structure, a double bond is shown as two lines between the atoms, as in C=C. It is important to realize, however, that the two bonds are different; one is a sigma bond, while the other is a pi bond. Ethyne (C2H2) is a linear molecule with a triple bond between the two carbon atoms. Since each carbon atom is bonded to two other atoms and has no lone pairs, the hybridization of each carbon is sp. Again, the promotion of an electron in the carbon atom occurs in the same way. However, the hybridization now involves only the 2s orbital and the 2px orbital, leaving the 2py and the 2pz orbitals unhybridized. The sigma bond between the two carbon atoms is formed from sp hybrid orbitals, and the remaining hybrid orbitals form sigma bonds to the two hydrogen atoms. Both the py and the pz orbitals on each carbon atom form pi bonds with each other. As with ethene, these side-to-side overlaps are not directly on the line between the two bonded atoms. Additionally, these two pi bonds are perpendicular to one another ( Figure 9.29); one pi bond is above and below the line of the molecule, while the other is in front of and behind the page. The C2H2 molecule contains a triple bond between the two carbon atoms, one of which is a sigma bond, and two of which are pi bonds. The pi bonds come from overlap between the py and the pz orbitals on each carbon. In general, single bonds between atoms are always sigma bonds. Double bonds are comprised of one sigma and one pi bond. Triple bonds are comprised of one sigma bond and two pi bonds. 
Molecular  Orbitals 	  In most of the above illustrations, bonds are depicted as two overlapping atomic orbitals that still retain their original shapes. However, a more accurate way to show the electron density after the bond has formed is shown in Figures 9.29 and 9.28. When atomic orbitals combine to make covalent bonds, the results are new orbitals known as molecular orbitals. Molecular orbital theory plays an important role in our understanding of various molecular properties. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Valence bond theory describes the formation of covalent bonds in terms of the overlap of singly occupied atomic orbitals. The hybridization of nonequivalent atomic orbitals is necessary to correctly predict the bonding and molecular geometries of many molecules. The types of hybrid orbitals that form on the central atom are dictated by the electron domain geometry. Sigma bonds are formed by the end-to-end overlap of bonding orbitals. Pi bonds are formed by the side-toside overlap of p orbitals. Single bonds are normally sigma bonds. A double or triple bond consists of one sigma bond and either one or two pi bonds. Atomic orbitals from different atoms overlap to form molecular orbitals.

The  Mole 	  Humans have long been interested in how much of something they have. Ancient commerce was often conducted by trading goods for a certain weight of gold or silver. Both religious and civil statutes forbade the use of false weights in conducting business. In chemistry, we routinely weigh materials to determine how much of a chemical we are adding to a reaction. The amount of product is often weighed to determine reaction yield. Chemical solutions are prepared by weighing a specified amount of material and dissolving it in a defined volume of solvent. Weight and volume are two different ways to measure how much of a substance is present. In this chapter, we will explore how to express amounts of materials in a way that indicates the number of atoms or molecules contained in a given sample. User:Thelmadatter/Wikimedia Commons. commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BalanceMineralPachuca.JPG. Public Domain. Describe three methods of measuring matter. Define Avogadros number. Define mole.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  mole: The name given to a group of 6.022  1023 items. Avogadros number: 6.022  1023. representative particle: The smallest unit of a substance that retains its chemical identity. molar mass: The mass of one mole of representative particles of a substance. What units are used to describe the atomic mass (or weight) of an element? 
Introduction 	  As you have learned, matter comprises most everything around us. The atoms and molecules that make up this matter are so tiny that you cannot see them with the naked eye. Imagine you had a bag of apples. You could measure, rather easily, the weight of the apples, the volume of the apples, and the number of apples in your bag. But what if you wanted to know the number of atoms that were in those apples? How could you possibly count something you cannot even see? In this lesson you will learn about the mole concept, which enables scientist to quantify things as tiny as atoms. 
Determining by  Weight 	  One common method of seeing how much material is present is to weigh it. This practice goes back many centuries. The Code of Hammurabi (established around 1760 B.C.) spelled out methods for assuring fair weights in business and trade dealings. Many societies had harsh penalties for using false weights. Today we have state and federal agencies that make sure the scales used for business are accurate. Shopping in a grocery store provides many opportunities for purchases by weight. Most fresh meat and fresh vegetables are marketed by weight, as are flour, sugar, and many other packaged goods. 
Determining by  Volume 	  Volume is another way of measuring material. Gases cannot be easily weighed, but their volume can be determined quickly and accurately. Liquid chemicals as well as foods and beverages are also sold by volume. Gasoline for our cars and trucks is sold by the gallon. At the grocery store, we can buy a gallon of milk or a two-liter bottle of soda pop. 
Determining by  Counting 	  The third way to indicate how much of something is present is to count the objects. At the grocery store, we could buy a dozen eggs, six donuts, or two loaves of bread. We might buy movie tickets or t-shirts, based on price per item. The weight or volume for many of items could be determined, but counting is generally faster for small numbers of objects and does not require any additional measurement tools. 
Converting between  Different  Measurements 	  Sometimes one method of measurement is easiest but does not provide us with the information that we need. For example, say you had a huge sack of pennies and wanted to know how much it was worth. You could count them, but it might be much faster to weigh the sack. Say you find out that you have 4.801 pounds (2177.5 grams) of pennies. If you know that each penny weighs 2.5 grams (on average), then you could divide 2177.5 by 2.5, and you would know that you have about 871 pennies, or $8.71. Such conversions become even more important when dealing with much more miniscule objects, such as atoms or molecules. Because the numbers involved when talking about amounts of atoms are so large, a new unit was developed to make discussing such amounts easier. This unit is referred to as the mole. 
The  Mole 	  As we will see in the chapter on gases, the Italian scientist Amadeo Avogadro (1776-1856) proposed that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of atoms or molecules in a given sample. Due to the vast quantities of atoms and molecules in an easily observable sample of any material, chemists needed a name that can stand for a very large number of items. A mole (abbreviated "mol") is the name given to a group of 6.022  1023 items. This value is named Avogadros number as a tribute to his influential work. The word "mole" is analogous to the word "dozen", in that it is a name that stands for a number. A dozen donuts is simply another way of saying 12 donuts. Similarly, a mole of donuts would be another way of saying 6.022  1023 donuts. Obviously, this would be an excessive amount of donuts. However, it becomes a more useful quantity when talking about objects like molecules. One mole of water molecules is equivalent to 6.022  1023 molecules of water. This amount of liquid water has a volume of a little over one tablespoon, which is a very normal amount to be dealing with. Technically speaking, the mole is defined as the amount of carbon atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12 (the isotope of carbon that contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons). This value cannot be determined by literally counting atoms, but it has been calculated in a variety of ways. When written out to 8 significant figures, the currently accepted value is 6.0221413  1023. However, because we dont usually deal with other measurements that are this precise, the rounded value of 6.022  1023 is sufficient for any situations that you are likely to encounter. The mole is such an important parameter in chemistry that Mole Day was established in the U.S. on October 23, where it is celebrated from 6:02 AM to 6:02 PM. The day was originally established to generate interest in chemistry. The scale of Avogadros number is nearly incomprehensible in terms of everyday objects. This can be illustrated with examples like the following problem, in which we use the dimensional analysis technique from the chapter Measurement to convert between units. 
Example 10.1 	  If you were given one million dollars every second, how long would it take to accumulate a mole of dollars? Answer: Even at this very fast rate, it would take over 19 billion years to obtain a mole of dollars. To put this into perspective, the universe is believed to be about 14 billion years old, and our Sun will run out of fuel and burn out about 6 billion years from now. 
Representative  Particles 	  When we talk about one mole of a particular chemical substance, it is important to know exactly how much material is being referenced. For example, the phrase "a mole of water molecules" is often shortened to "a mole of water." When we talk about moles of a molecular substance, it is assumed that we are referring to moles of molecules. Similarly, the phrase "five moles of carbon dioxide" would refer to five moles of CO2 molecules. In these cases, the molecule is sometimes called a representative particle, which is simply the smallest unit of a substance that retains its chemical identity. What about when we are discussing non-molecular substances? Recall that an ionic compound does not exist as discrete molecules, but rather as an extended three-dimensional network of ions called a crystal lattice. The empirical formula of an ionic compound tells us the ratio of the ions in the crystal. In these cases, one mole of the substance is assumed to mean one mole of each ion in the empirical formula. For example, one mole of sodium oxide (Na2O) refers to two moles of sodium ions (Na+) and one mole of oxide ions (O2?). The empirical formula gives you the representative particle for ionic substances. Unlike molecules, these representative particles do not exist as isolated units (sodium oxide does not exist as small clusters of three atoms each). In the case of pure metals, the representative particle is simply the atom. One mole of zinc refers to a mole of Zn atoms. 
Example 10.2 	  Calculate the number of moles of iron atoms that are present in 2 moles of Fe2O3. 
Example 10.3 	  Calculate the number of atoms that must be present in 3.05 moles of Pb. 
Molar  Mass 	  Because we are not able to count individual atoms, it is important to have a way to convert between amounts, which are expressed in moles, and a unit of quantity that we can more easily measure, such as mass. We begin by looking at the periodic table, which tells us the relative masses of various elements. 
Molar  Masses of the  Elements 	  As you learned previously, the average atomic masses found on the periodic table are in atomic mass units (amu). For example, one atom of the most abundant isotope of hydrogen has a mass of approximately 1 amu, and one atom of helium has a mass of about 4 amu. Atomic masses are relative masses; they are based on the definition that one amu is equal to 1/12th of the mass of a single atom of carbon-12. Therefore, one atom of carbon-12 has a mass of 12 amu, which is three times heavier than an atom of helium. This ratio would hold for any number of carbon and helium atoms. One hundred carbon-12 atoms would have three times the mass of one hundred helium atoms. By extension, 12.00 g of carbon-12 would contain the same number of atoms as 4.00 g of helium. The relative scale of atomic masses in amu is also a relative scale of masses in grams. We said before that the mole is officially equal to the number of carbon atoms in exactly 12 g of carbon-12. In other words, one carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12 amu, and one mole of carbon atoms has a mass of exactly 12 grams. This relationship is true for all substances. If one atom of helium has a mass of 4.00 amu, one mole of helium atoms has a mass of 4.00 g. One molecule of water has a mass of 18.0 amu, so one mole of water molecules has a mass of 18.0 grams. Molar mass is defined as the mass of one mole of representative particles of a substance. It is expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol). The values on the periodic table can be read either as average atomic masses or as molar masses. For example, the mass associated with chlorine is 35.45, even though no atoms of chlorine actually have a mass of 35.45 amu. However, in naturally occurring samples of chlorine atoms, about 75% will be chlorine-35 atoms (which have a mass of 35.0 amu), and about 25% will be chlorine-37 atoms (which have a mass of 37.0 amu). Since any usable quantity of chlorine contains a very, very large number of atoms, one mole of chlorine atoms will contain a mixture of these two isotopes in this ratio, resulting in a sample with a mass of 35.45 grams. Therefore chlorine has a molar mass of 
Molar  Masses of  Compounds 	  The molecular formula of carbon dioxide is CO2. One molecule of carbon dioxide consists of 1 atom of carbon and 2 atoms of oxygen. We can calculate the molar mass of carbon dioxide by adding together the molar masses of each atom present in the compound. One mole of carbon dioxide molecules would have a mass of 44.01 grams. What about for an ionic compound? The molar mass of sodium sulfide (Na2S) can be calculated as follows: Because Na2S is the empirical formula for this substance, the representative particle consists of two sodium atoms and one sulfur atom. 
Example 10.4 	  What is the molar mass of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Answer: 
Example 10.5 	  How many moles of carbon are present in a 10.00 gram sample? Answer: 
Lesson  Summary 	  One mole of any chemical substance contains 6.022 x 1023 representative particles. The masses on the periodic table can be read as average atomic masses or as molar masses. Molar mass is the mass of one mole of any given substance.

Introduction 	  As we discussed in the previous lesson, there are many different ways to measure how much of something you have. Usually, there is a particular unit of measurement that is easiest to use, depending on what you are trying to quantify. In this lesson you will learn the significance of using moles in converting between measurements and in understanding how much of something you have. 
Mass and  Moles 	  When we need materials for a chemical reaction, counting out a certain number of atoms or molecules is obviously impractical, so we weigh out a certain mass of each substance instead. As we will see in a later chapter, chemical equations tell us the molar ratios in which chemicals react with one another. This information can be used to determine how much of one chemical is needed to fully react with a set amount of another substance. 
Example 10.6 	  In a certain reaction, we want to use two moles of silver nitrate, AgNO3. We need to know how many grams of silver nitrate will be needed. First, we determine the molecular weight of the chemical: 
Ag O3 - 169.9 g/mol 	  Because 169.9 grams of AgNO3 is equivalent to one mole of AgNO3, we can use that as a conversion factor. We start with the amount that we need (2.0 moles), and convert to the desired units (grams of AgNO3): The units of moles cancel, and we are left with grams. 
Example 10.7 	  In another reaction, we determine that we need 0.45 moles of NaBr. We check our chemical supplies and find we have 37.2 grams NaBr on hand. Do we have enough for this reaction? 
Na Br - 102.9 g/mol 	  We need 0.45 moles, which our calculation tells us is equivalent to 46.3 grams. We only have 37.2 grams available, so we do not have enough for this experiment. 
Example 10.8 	  We run an experiment that gives us 65.4 grams of Rb2O as a product. How many moles did we obtain? First, we need to calculate the molar mass of the compound: 
Rb2 O - 187.0 g/mol 	  We obtained 0.350 moles of Rb2O. Note that the conversion factor of molar mass (187.0 grams Rb2O = 1 mole Rb2O) was written "upside-down," with the grams on the bottom and the moles on top. This is so that the unwanted units (grams) cancel, leaving only the desired units (moles) in our final answer. Whenever we have this type of conversion factor, the choice of which quantity to put in the numerator and denominator depends on the units that we wish to cancel. 
Avogadros  Hypothesis 	  Avogadro proposed that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of particles, and therefore the same combining ratios. This means that at a given temperature and pressure, one mole of any gas will take up the same volume, regardless of its identity. This is very different than the case for solids and liquids. For example, a mole of water takes up significantly more space than a mole of gold, which is quite dense. Because different gases have different molar masses, the mass contained in a set volume of gas will depend on the identity of the gas. For example, at a certain temperature and pressure, one liter of hydrogen gas has a mass of 0.0899 grams, while a liter of oxygen gas has a mass of 1.43 grams. This ratio is approximately equal to 1:16, which is the ratio of the molar masses for these two elements. The Figure 10.2 shows the amount of mass contained in a given volume of various gases. The implications of Avogadros work were extensive and helped in developing the kinetic theory of gases in the last half of the 19th century. They also were useful as practical guidelines for how to run reactions with gases. For example, water has a formula of H2O, which means that for each mole of oxygen atoms, there are two moles of hydrogen atoms. A complete reaction can occur with no leftover hydrogen or oxygen only if the volume of hydrogen used is twice the volume of oxygen used. Because the volume of a gas is easier to measure than its mass, this is a useful experimental tool. Example 10.9 Lets say you have three balloons. One is filled with hydrogen gas, one with oxygen gas, and one with nitrogen gas. The molar masses of these gases are 2 g/mol for H2, 32 g/mol for O2, and 28 g/mol for N2. If all three balloons are the same volume, which contains the most mass, and which contains the least? Answer: Based on their molar masses, hydrogen is the lightest molecule, and oxygen is the heaviest. Because all three volumes are the same, each balloon contains the same number of gas molecules. Therefore, the hydrogen balloon will have the lowest mass, and the oxygen balloon will have the highest. 
Calculations  Involving  Gases 	  Because the volume of a gas is dependent on the pressure and temperature, scientists found it useful to collect data at fixed pressures and temperatures so that they could be compared between different gases. A pressure of one atmosphere and a temperature of 0C is known as standard temperature and pressure (STP). Under these conditions, one mole of any gas takes up a volume of 22.4 liters. This information allows us to convert between liters and moles for gases at STP. 
Example 10.10 	  At STP, we have 46.2 liters of helium. How many moles of helium do we have? (46.2 L He)(	06 mol He 
Example 10.11 	  What volume does 4.96 moles of O2 occupy at STP? (4.96 mol O2)(	111 L O2 If we know the volume of a gas at STP, we can combine this information with its molar mass to determine how much mass is present in the sample. 
Example 10.12 	  What is the mass of 86.7 liters of N2 at STP? The molar mass of N2 is 28.0 grams/mole, and because one mole of a gas at STP takes up 22.4 L of space, we can perform the following calculation. (86.7 L N2)(221 .mol N4 L N22 )(281 mol N.0 g N22 ) = 108 g N2 The conversion factors are arranged so that all units cancel except for grams, which are the units of our final answer. When studying chemical reactions, we frequently need to convert back and forth between mass, volume, moles, and number of particles. This will be expanded upon in our chapter on stoichiometry. Figure 10.3 summarizes the relationships that we have studies so far between these different quantities. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Molar masses can be used to determine the mass of a given quantity of material. At standard temperature and pressure (1 atmosphere of pressure and 0C), one mole of a gas occupies 22.4 liters. The mass of a sample can be calculated for a given volume of a known gas at STP using Avogadros number. 
Lesson  Review  Questions 	  Calculate the number of moles you have, and determine if this is enough to run the experiment.

Introduction 	  Packaged foods that you eat typically have nutritional information provided on the label. The label of a popular brand of peanut butter ( Figure 10.4) reveals that one serving size is considered to be 32 g. The label also gives the masses of various types of compounds that are present in each serving. One serving contains 7 g of protein, 15 g of fat, and 3 g of sugar. This information can be used to determine the composition of the peanut butter on a percent by mass basis. For example, to calculate the percent of protein in the peanut butter, we could perform the following calculation: In a similar way, chemists often need to know what elements are present in a compound and in what percentages. The percent composition is the percent by mass of each element in a compound. It is calculated in a way that is similar to what we just saw for the peanut butter. 
Determining  Percent  Composition from  Mass  Data 	  We can calculate percent composition based on the following formula: % by mass	100% The example below shows how the percent composition of a compound can be calculated based on mass data: 
Example 10.13 	  A certain newly synthesized compound is known to contain the elements zinc and oxygen. When a 20.00 g sample of the compound is decomposed, 16.07 g of pure zinc remains. Determine the percent composition of the compound. Answer: If the compound contained only zinc and oxygen, and 16.07 grams was due to the zinc, we can subtract to determine the mass of oxygen in the original sample: Mass of oxygen = 20.00 g 16.07 g = 3.93 g O Then, we divide the individual masses of each element by the total mass of the sample to determine the percent (by mass) of each element in the compound: % Zn =100% = 80.35% Zn % O =	100% = 19.65% O The calculations make sense because the sum of the two percentages adds up to 100%. By mass, the compound is mostly zinc. 
Determining  Masses from  Percent  Composition  Data 	  We can also perform the reverse calculation, determining the mass of an element in a given sample, if we know the total mass of the sample and its percent composition. 
Example 10.14 	  You have a 10.0 g sample of a metal alloy that contains only aluminum and zinc. If the sample is 36% aluminum by mass, what masses of Al and Zn are present? Answer: We are told that the sample is 36% aluminum by mass. Because the only other component is zinc, it must make up the remaining 64% of the mass. We can multiply each of these percentages by 10.0 grams to find the masses of each element. 
Empirical  Formulas 	  Recall that an empirical formula is one that shows the lowest whole-number ratio of the elements in a compound. Because the structure of ionic compounds is an extended three-dimensional network of positive and negative ions, only empirical formulas are used to describe ionic compounds. However, we can also consider the empirical formula of a molecular compound. Ethene is a small hydrocarbon compound with the formula C2H4 ( Figure 10.5). While C2H4 is its molecular formula and represents its true molecular structure, it has an empirical formula of CH2. The simplest ratio of carbon to hydrogen in ethene is 1:2. In each molecule of ethene, there is 1 carbon atom for every 2 atoms of hydrogen. Similarly, we can also say that in one mole of ethene, there is 1 mole of carbon for every 2 moles of hydrogen. The subscripts in a formula represent the molar ratio of the elements in that compound. 
Determining  Percent  Composition from a  Chemical  Formula 	  The percent composition of a compound can also be determined from its chemical formula. The subscripts in the formula are first used to calculate the mass of each element found in one mole of the compound. That value is then divided by the molar mass of the compound and multiplied by 100%. mass of element in 1 mol of compound % by mass =	 100% molar mass of compound The percent composition of a given compound is always the same as long as the compound is pure. 
Example 10.15 	  Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is a highly reactive compound used in some synthesis reactions. Calculate the percent composition of dichlorine heptoxide. Answer: Determine the mass of each element in one mole of the compound, and find the total molar mass of the compound: mass of Cl in 1 mol Cl2O7 = 2 x molar mass of Cl = 70.90 g mass of O in 1 mol Cl2O7 = 7 x molar mass of O = 112.00 g molar mass of Cl2O7 = 70.90 g/mol + 112.00 g/mol = 182.90 g/mol Now, calculate the percent by mass of each element by dividing the mass of that element in 1 mole of the compound by the molar mass of the compound and multiplying by 100%. % Cl =100% = 38.76% Cl % O =100% = 61.24% O As expected, the percentages add up to 100%. 
Determining  Empirical  Formulas from  Percent  Composition 	  A procedure called elemental analysis allows us to determine the empirical formula of an unknown compound. Percent composition data can be directly obtained with this technique, and these values can be used to find the molar ratios of the elements, which gives us the empirical formula. The steps to be taken are outlined below. 
Example 10.16 	  A compound of iron and oxygen is analyzed and found to contain 69.94% iron and 30.06% oxygen by mass. Find the empirical formula of the compound. Answer: Follow the steps outlined in the text. The empirical formula of the compound is Fe2O3. 
Molecular  Formulas 	  Molecular formulas tell us how many atoms of each element are present in one molecule of a molecular compound. In many cases, the molecular formula is the same as the empirical formula. For example, the molecular formula of methane is CH4, and because 1:4 is the smallest whole-number ratio that can be written for this compound, that is also its empirical formula. Sometimes, however, the molecular formula is a simple whole-number multiple of the empirical formula. Acetic acid is an organic acid that gives vinegar its distinctive taste and smell. Its molecular formula is C2H4O2. Glucose is a simple sugar that cells use as their primary source of energy. Its molecular formula is C6H12O6. The structures of both molecules are shown in Figure 10.6. They are very different compounds, yet both have the same empirical formula, CH2O. The following Table 10.1 shows a few other compounds with their empirical and molecular formulas: 
Molecular  Formula 	  water 
H2 	  hydrogen peroxide 
H2 O2 	  methane 
H4 	  butane 
C4 H10 	  Acetic acid (left) has a molecular formula of C2H4O2, while glucose (right) has a molecular formula of C6H12O6. Both have the empirical formula CH2O. Empirical formulas can be determined from the percent composition of a compound. In order to determine its molecular formula, it is necessary to also know the molar mass of the compound. Chemists have various methods to determine the molar mass of an unknown compound. In order to go from the empirical formula to the molecular formula, follow these steps: 
Example 10.17 	  The empirical formula of a compound that contains boron and hydrogen is BH3.	Its molar mass is 27.7 g/mol. Determine the molecular formula of the compound. Answer: Follow the steps outlined above. 
M	13.84 	  The molecular formula of the compound is B2H6. The molar mass of the molecular formula matches the molar mass of the compound.

Lesson  Summary 	  The percent composition of a compound is the percent by mass of each of the elements in the compound. It can be calculated from mass data or from the chemical formula. Percent composition data can be used to determine a compounds empirical formula, which is the molar ratio between the elements in the compound. The empirical formula and the molar mass of a substance can be used to determine its molecular formula, which is the number of each kind of atom in a single molecule of the compound.

Chemical  Reactions 	  For millennia, humans have been fascinated with the composition of things and the workings of the chemical world. Over time we have come to understand that all matter is comprised of indivisible particles called atoms. Our understanding of how matter works has been a long pursuit. It started with figuring out how to make things burn. Humans have been fascinated with chemical reactions that burn, explode, produce loud bangs, and have brilliant colors. Early alchemists learned that throwing certain salts on a fire would produce different magical colors. Chinese alchemists created human kinds first explosion with the invention of gunpowder. This chemical recipe was eventually shared across the medieval globe. Historically, humans have been fascinated with coaxing nature into doing things, like burning. This fascination, coupled with our ability to observe, record, and share, has led us to our current understanding of matter. Our understanding of chemical reactions and the equations that describe them are based on many years of trial and error. The image above is an example of this. It is a star shell bursting over the night sky. The technology of pyrotechnics, like composition of the propellant, the explosive charge, the colors, and the shapes of the burst, is a result of hundreds of years of intensive study of chemical reactions and chemical equations. We are going to study chemical reactions and chemical equations in this chapter. Jon Sullivan. commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Firework.jpg. Public Domain.

Introduction 	  Ever since the 9th century, humans have been fascinated with the nature of explosions. Whether to scare away evil spirits, to light up the night sky in celebration, or to be used in warfare, our understanding of gunpowder is based on our understanding of chemical recipes. Our ability to modify, share, and replicate them has allowed us to develop new recipes and to refine existing ones. Chemical reactions can be described in terms of chemical equations. They are the foundation of our modern day chemical recipes. 
Origins of  Chemical  Recipes:  Gunpowder 	  The first people to discover gunpowder were 9th century Chinese alchemists. This discovery was made by accident while they were creating various chemical mixtures in pursuit of an elixir that would make them immortal. The first formulation of gunpowder was a thick toffee made from honey, saltpeter (a mixture composed primarily of potassium nitrate), and sulfur. They hoped that eating it would help them live forever. In reality, it burst into flames and burnt down their homes. Over time, Chinese alchemists refined the recipe and began to develop early pyrotechnic technology to help scare away evil spirits. A more fully developed, and more explosive, formula called for 75 percent potassium nitrate, 15 percent charcoal, and 10 percent sulfur. 
Medieval  Europe 	  This recipe made its way to Europe in medieval times. A Franciscan friar named Roger Bacon was particularly fascinated by the properties of gunpowder. He discovered that a key factor in the energetics of the mixture was the purity of the saltpeter. Bacon was responsible for developing early crystallization techniques to purify the mixture. He also discovered that the more tightly packed the powder, the larger the explosion. Bacon feared that bad things could happen if the mixture ended up in the wrong hands. He encoded the recipe in an anagram, which read (when translated from the original Latin) And so thou wilt call up thunder and destruction if thou know the art. The secret recipe, however, did not stay secret for long. Pyrotechnics, or fireworks, used in events recorded in 14th century Italy show that the recipe was no longer a secret. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Italians continued refining the art of pyrotechnics. Then, in 1830, a major leap forward in gunpowder technology occurred. It was discovered that replacing potassium nitrate with potassium chlorate resulted in a more energetic mixture, and so the recipe was revised once again. The modern day formulation of gun powder is called black powder. It is still commonly used today. Its formulation is still quite similar to what was used in 9th century China. Black powder is considered a low explosive. It is a mixture that burns quickly, but the resulting shock wave travels at subsonic speeds. The speed at which it burns is dependent on the accessibility of oxygen atoms to the carbon source. In contrast, high explosives like nitroglycerin detonate instead of burning, creating shock waves that are supersonic (faster than the speed of sound). 
The  Chemical  Equation 	  Chemical equations describe the changes in composition that take place during a chemical reaction. Along with the identities of the starting reactants and the final products, chemical equations show the ratios in which these substances are consumed and produced. The reaction of iron with oxygen to form iron(III) oxide is shown in the Figure 11.5. The sparks from a steel grinder are molten iron. The iron reacts with oxygen to form iron(III) oxide. We can describe this reaction with a chemical equation: This equation is said to be balanced, because the amount of each element expressed on the reactants side is equal to the amounts expressed on the products side. This is shown more explicitly in the following Table 11.1. 
 	  Often times, the processes described by chemical equations do not represent a single reaction. For example, the following equation shows the starting materials and the products for photosynthesis: light This process does not occur in a single step. A sequence of many individual reactions is required to make glucose and oxygen gas out of carbon dioxide and water. Chemical equations can be used to represent individual reactions or the net change that occurs after multiple sequential chemical processes. 
The  Balanced  Chemical  Equation 	  We can describe chemical reactions in terms of generic expressions like the following equation: aA+bB ? cC+dD where A and B are reactants, and C and D are products. The letters a, b, c, and d represent stoichiometric coefficients, or the relative amount of each substance that is involved in the reaction. In this particular reaction, there are two reactants and two products, but others might have more or less. For example, the equation describing the rusting of iron had two reactants (Fe and O2) and one product (Fe2O3). In a balanced chemical equation, the number of atoms of each element on the reactant side is equal to the number of atoms on the product side. This is necessary for all chemical equations, due to the law of conservation of mass. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction, only rearranged. Here are some examples of general expressions that will be applied to specific reactions in the next section. 
Example 11.1 	  Substance A reacts with substance B to form substance AB. Write the balanced chemical equation for this process. Answer: Write the general expression. 
A+ B ?  	  Balance (it already is). 
Example 11.2 	  Substance A reacts with substance B2 to form substance AB. Write the balanced chemical equation for this process. Answer: Write the general expression. 
A+ B2 ?  	  Balance. 
Example 11.3 	  Substance A2 reacts with substance B2 to form substance AB3. Write the balanced chemical equation for this process. Answer: Write the general expression. 
A2 + B2 ?  B3 	  Balance. 
Balancing  Chemical  Equations for  Real  Reactions 	  Now that we have studied the general process for describing and balancing chemical equations, we are going to apply this approach to examples that include actual chemicals. As we present the following reactions, we are going to focus only on the changes in composition from reactants to products. In later chapters, we will look at other reaction properties, such as states of matter, temperature, and the energy lost or gained by a given reaction. In the following lesson, we will look at ways to classify different types of reactions. This knowledge will allow us to make reasonable predictions about the products that might be generated from a given set of reactants. 
Tips for  Balancing  Equations 	  Before we get started with balancing chemical equations, here are some simple tips to consider: 
Example 11.4 	  Liquid mercury is heated in the presence of oxygen to produce mercury(II) oxide. Write the balanced chemical equation for this process. Answer: Start by writing the general expression. Hg(l)+O2(g) ? HgO(s) Then, alter the coefficients to balance each element. 
 	  Notice that in this example, the formula for oxygen is the diatomic form O2. Many pure nonmetallic elements are unstable as individual atoms and combine readily to make diatomic molecules. Hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and the halogens (F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2) exist as diatomic molecules when in their pure elemental forms. Example 11.5 Hydrogen gas and fluorine gas react to form hydrogen fluoride gas. Write the balanced chemical equation for this process. Answer: Start by writing the general expression. H2(g)+F2(g) ? HF(g) Then balance each element. 
 	  Again, pure hydrogen and fluorine exist as diatomic gases. 
Example 11.6 	  Ammonium nitrate decomposes to form nitrogen gas, water, and oxygen gas. Write the balanced chemical equation for this process. Answer: Write the general expression. NH4NO3(s) ? N2(g)+H2O(l)+O2(g) Balance. Because this equation involves more than two elements, it is slightly less straightforward to balance. Since nitrogen and oxygen both occur in their pure elemental forms, we start by balancing hydrogen: NH4NO3(s) ? N2(g)+2H2O(l)+O2(g) Hydrogen and nitrogen are now balanced, but oxygen is not. This can be fixed by changing the coefficient on its pure elemental form: 
H4 	  The atoms are now balanced, but to avoid having fractional coefficients, we must multiply all coefficients in the equation by 2: We can confirm that this equation is balanced by writing the following Table 11.7. 
Example 11.7 	  Lead(II) nitrate reacts with sodium chloride to form lead(II) chloride and sodium nitrate. Write the balanced chemical equation for this process. Answer: Write the general expression. 
Pb( O3)2 + Na Cl ?  Pb Cl2 + Na O3 	  Balance. 
Cl 	  By keeping the polyatomic nitrate ion intact as a single unit, balancing this equation becomes somewhat simpler. This was done because the ion exists unchanged on both sides of the equation. Note that this is in contrast to the previous example, in which the nitrate ion decomposed to form other substances. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The composition of gunpowder gradually changed as alchemists and scientists experimented with ways to make it even more explosive. Chemical reactions are described using chemical equations. Stoichiometric coefficients are used in chemical equations to indicate the amounts of reactants and products. Because of the law of conservation of mass (matter can neither be created nor destroyed through chemical reactions), chemical equations must have equal amounts of each specific atom on both sides of the equation.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  combination reaction: A reaction where two or more chemical species combine to produce a single new compound. decomposition reaction: A reaction where a single chemical species breaks down to produce two or more new chemical species. single replacement reaction: Occurs when one chemical species (often a single element) replaces a portion of another compound to produce two new products. double replacement reaction: Occurs when the cations from the original two ionic compounds trade anions to make two new ionic compounds. molecular equation: An equation that shows all ionic components as neutral compounds, but the ones that are dissolved in water are denoted with "(aq)." ionic equation: A chemical equation in which the various reaction components are represented as they actually exist in the reaction, for example, as individual ions. spectator ion: Ions that are present in solution but do not participate in the overall reaction. net ionic equation: The simplified ionic equation in which all of the spectator ions are cancelled out. combustion: Occurs when a hydrocarbon reacts in the presence of oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide. Study the Figure 11.6, which depicts the mass change that occurs when steel wool burns in air. 
Introduction 	  The video above at URL (1:12) shows the decomposition of mercury(II) oxide into liquid mercury and oxygen gas. This reaction was an important one in the history of chemistry, because it helped early chemists to understand the relationship between reactants and products. In the last lesson, we began investigating how a chemical equation can represent a given chemical reaction. In this lesson, we are going to study the ways in which chemical reactions are classified. There are literally thousands of chemical reactions that take place every day in our lives. Some reactions take place in the atmosphere, such as the combustion of fossil fuels. Others occur in solution, like the reactions responsible for photosynthesis or the reactions that break down our food to give us energy. Chemical reactions can take place in a variety of environments. Reactions happen on the sea floor, in our cells, and in the upper atmosphere. As we look at chemical reactions, we notice some commonalities and trends. When we studied the elements, we saw characteristics that allowed us to categorize them by family. There are also various ways to categorize chemical reactions. Some reactions produce heat, while others consume it. Some reactions are spontaneous, while others are not. Some reactions happen in nanoseconds, while others happen over longer spans of time. Some produce electricity, some emit light, and some release gaseous products. The products of chemical reactions tell us a lot about the chemistry of the process. In the above video, we see mercury(II) oxide decomposing into elemental mercury and oxygen gas. Decomposition was one of the first reaction types to be identified by chemists. Decomposition is one type of reaction youll learn about in this lesson. 
Combination  Reactions 	  The first type of reaction that we will investigate is the combination reaction, which is sometimes also referred to as a synthesis reaction. In combination reactions, two or more chemical species combine to produce a single new compound. A generic combination reaction might have the following form: 
A+ B ? 	  Substances in all states of matter can participate in combination reactions. For example, oxygen in the air can react with iron to produce rust. Rusting is a common occurrence, especially in regions of the world where precipitation is relatively high. Although rust tends to be a mixture of compounds, its primary component is iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). Rusting is generally a very slow process, but when the iron has a very high surface area, as in the case of steel wool, it can happen at a much faster rate, as shown in the following video: URL The balanced chemical equation for this process is shown below: 
Decomposition  Reactions 	  A decomposition reaction is the exact opposite of a combination reaction. In decomposition reactions, a single chemical species breaks down to produce two or more new chemical species. A generic decomposition reaction might take the following form: 
C ?  A+ 	  Again, substances in all states of matter commonly participate in decomposition reactions. For example, hydrogen peroxide will decompose over time to produce water and oxygen gas according to the following equation: Another common type of decomposition reaction involves the process of electrolysis, in which an electrical current is passed through a substance to break apart a compound. One example of a decomposition reaction requiring the use of electrolysis is the decomposition of molten sodium chloride, as shown by the following equation: 
Single  Replacement  Reactions 	  A single replacement reaction (sometimes called a single displacement reaction) occurs when one chemical species (often a single element) replaces a portion of another compound to produce two new products. The general form of a single replacement reaction is shown below: 
B+ C ?  C+ 	  Two common types of single replacement reactions involve pure metals reaction with aqueous solutions of either an acid or an ionic compound. When a reactive metal is placed in an acid solution, the following reaction is likely to occur: 
Metal + acid ? ionic solution + hydrogen gas 	  An example of this would be the reaction between zinc and hydrochloric acid, which produces zinc chloride and hydrogen gas. Here is an image of this reaction: 
Zinc metal reacting with a solution of hydrochloric acid 	  The balanced chemical equation for this single replacement reaction is shown below: Zn(s)+2HCl(aq) ? ZnCl2(aq)+H2(g) Another type of single replacement reaction involves a solid metal replacing the metal cation in an ionic compound that has been dissolved in water. If the solid metal is more reactive than the dissolved metal cations, the following type of reaction can occur: Metal + ionic solution ? different metal + different ionic solution A common example of this reaction is when iron is replaced by the more reactive zinc metal. The balanced chemical equation for this process is shown below. Zn(s)+FeSO4(aq) ? Fe(s)+ZnSO4(aq) 
Double  Replacement  Reactions 	  Double replacement reactions typically include two water-soluble salts that react with one another in solution. The general form of a double replacement reaction would look something like the following: 
B+ D ?  D+ 	  In double replacement reactions, the cations from the original two ionic compounds trade anions to make two new ionic compounds. In general, at least one of the new compounds must precipitate (form an insoluble solid) for us to conclude that a reaction has occurred. An example of such a process is shown below with the double replacement reaction between solutions of potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate. At the molecular level, our model for the way in which a precipitate forms can be described in an animation: A double replacement reaction is used to form lead(II) iodide. The reactants shown here are colorless solutions of potassium iodide and potassium nitrate. When combined, these produce a yellow precipitate of lead(II) iodide. URL 
Representing  Ionic  Reactions as  Chemical  Equations 	  For reactions that involve ions dissolved in water, there are several different ways to express the overall process as a chemical equation. For example, the overall molecular equation shows all ionic components as neutral compounds, but the ones that are dissolved in water are denoted with "(aq)." Note that the ionic substances do not exist as molecules, but we write them out as though they were. In the following example, two water-soluble compounds trade partners to produce one dissolved ionic compound and one solid precipitate: AB(aq)+CD(aq) ? AD(aq)+CB(s) In reality, the aqueous substances do not exist as molecules or ionic crystal lattices. Instead, the individual ions are dissolved and distributed throughout the solution. If the reaction above were written as an ionic equation, it would look something like the following: A+(aq)+B?(aq)+C+(aq)+D?(aq) ? A+(aq)+D?(aq)+CB(s) In this example, the various reaction components are presented in a form that is closer to the way they actually exist during the reaction. The aqueous components are separated into ions, and the precipitate is found as a combined solid. We are assuming in this example that A and C form cations with a charge of 1+, while B and D form anions with a charge of 1-. In real examples, we would look at which group each element is found in on the periodic table to determine its likely charge. Notice that in the ionic equation, A+ and D? were unchanged over the course of the reaction; they exist as aqueous ions on both the reactant and product sides. In other words, these species did not experience any net change. Ions that are present in solution but do not participate in the overall reaction are known as spectator ions. The ionic equation can be simplified to the net ionic equation by canceling out all the spectator ions. 
 	  B?(aq)+C+(aq) ?CB(s) Lets look at these three types of equations again using a real example. If we were to mix aqueous solutions of potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate, lead(II) iodide would precipitate as a solid, and potassium nitrate would remain dissolved. This can be represented by any of the three following equations: 
Net  Ionic  Equation 	  Pb2+(aq)+2I?(aq) ? PbI2(s) 
Predicting  Solubility of  Ionic  Compounds 	  How do we determine which ions are likely to form an insoluble precipitate and which will remain dissolved in water? By combining various ionic solutions, chemists have come up with some general guidelines for whether a given cation-anion pairing is likely to be soluble or insoluble in water. It should be noted that such an approach is an oversimplification. Each compound has its own solubility value, so two "soluble" compounds might have very different abilities to dissolve in water. Additionally, even "insoluble" salts can dissolve in water to a very limited extent. We will take a more quantitative approach to solubility in the chapter on solutions. However, qualitative rules like the ones in the Table 11.9 are useful for predicting whether a precipitate is likely to form when combining moderate amounts of specific cations and anions.

Combustion 	  Combustion occurs when a hydrocarbon reacts in the presence of oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide. These reactions are very exothermic, which means that they produce a large amount of heat. Combustion reactions are quite common in our everyday lives, such as the burning of gasoline to fuel a car. The chemical equation for a combustion reaction has the following generic form: 
Cx Hy + O2 ?  H2 O+ O2 	  Combustion reaction of a marshmallow (sucrose) and wood (cellulose). The process of cellular respiration can be thought of as a highly controlled version of a combustion reaction. We do not literally burn hydrocarbons in our body, but the overall reactants and products are the same. Hydrocarbons, such as sucrose (C12H22O11), are combined with oxygen in a series of enzymatic steps to product water, carbon dioxide, and energy, which is stored in the form of reactive molecules. The unbalanced chemical equation for this overall process is shown below: 
Lesson  Summary 	  Combination reactions occur when two or more reactants combine to produce a single compound. Decomposition reactions involve one compound decomposing into two or more products. Single replacement reactions occur when one reactant replaces part of another compound to form new substances. A common type of double replacement reaction occurs when two ionic reactants exchange anions, making two new ionic compounds. The precipitation of a solid is a common result for this type of reaction. Combustion reactions involve the reaction of a hydrocarbon with oxygen gas to produce water and carbon dioxide.

Stoichiometry 	  In the last chapter, we saw how gunpowder stimulated interest in understanding the composition of matter. The mixture of sulfur, charcoal and saltpeter (potassium nitrate) was refined until an optimal (maximally explosive) mixture was obtained. The effectiveness of the mixture was also affected by the purity of the ingredients. The ability to refine and reproduce such mixtures was dependent on an understanding of relative mass and ratios between the different mixture components. Alchemists and early scientists understood appropriate ratios for ingredients in a mixture, but determining the ratios of elements that are required to produce a given compound was sometimes a more difficult task. In fact, a systematic understanding of relative masses present in compounds and chemical reactions has only been developed over the last 300 years. Our modern periodic table is based on this knowledge. Using our current understanding of molar mass, we can now relate the amount of a substance (numbers of atoms or molecules) to its mass. In this chapter, we want use these ideas to explore quantitative issues in chemical reactions. Specifically, we are going to study how the relations between mass, moles, and numbers of particles can be applied to chemical reactions. This topic is referred to as stoichiometry, a term derived from the Greek words stoicheion (element) and metron (to measure). Understanding the chemical world in terms of stoichiometry allows us to describe and predict the ratios in which reactants combine to generate products in a given chemical process. An understanding of stoichiometry was an important step in developing the capacity to manipulate, create, and replicate new chemical formulations. This knowledge is required for any practical fields in which new chemical substances are created, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostic medicine, agricultural chemistry, and even cosmetics.

Introduction 	  When making a batch of chocolate chip cookies, a baker must pay careful attention to the amounts of ingredients he uses. The flour, sugar, butter, and chocolate chips must be measured and used in the correct ratios in order for the cookies to bake well. If the baker only has a certain amount of flour, only a certain amount of cookies can be made. Similarly, in chemical reactions, the resulting product is based on the initial moles of reactants present. In this lesson, you will learn how to calculate and account for the amounts of reactants and products in a given chemical reaction. 
Mole  Ratios:  Equating  Changes in  Amount 	  We previously saw that mass is conserved for any chemical reaction. Atoms present during the beginning of a chemical reaction must be present at the end as well, even though they may be arranged in different ways. Consider the reaction between iron and oxygen to produce iron(III) oxide: According to this equation 4 moles of iron will react with 3 moles of oxygen gas (O2) to produce 2 moles of iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3, as a product. Of course, we do not need exactly 4 moles of iron or 3 moles of oxygen for this reaction to occur. Rather, this equation tells us the ratio in which these reactants combine to make a particular product. When we express the relative amounts of two reaction components as a ratio, we refer to this as a mole ratio or a stoichiometric ratio. Mole ratios can be made between two reactants, two products, or one of each. For example, the following mole ratios can be obtained by looking at the balanced equation shown above: Stoichiometry refers to the calculations involving mole ratios to determine the relative amounts of reactants needed to produce a given amount of product. Consider the reaction of sodium chloride with silver nitrate: AgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) ? AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq) Silver chloride is an important compound that is commonly used in the production of photographic film. It also has many other uses, such as an antidote for mercury poisoning, a component of pottery glazes, and a reference standard for electrochemistry setups. It can be produced according to the reaction shown above. Now we will practice use of mole ratios and stoichiometry to determine the amounts of products and reactants necessary in our reaction. 
Example 12.1 	  How many moles of each reactant are needed to produce 0.5 mol of silver chloride? Answer: For this problem, we need to relate moles of each reactant to moles of the product silver chloride. The mole ratio of silver nitrate to silver chloride is constructed as follows: As shown above, we would need 0.5 mol of silver nitrate to produce 0.5 mol of silver chloride. We could also express the moles of silver chloride in terms of sodium chloride, our other reactant. Here is how we would do this: Therefore, we would also need 0.5 mol of sodium chloride in order to produce 0.5 mol of silver chloride. Notice that in each case, we use the mole ratio to relate moles of reactants to moles of products. Not all reactions have 1:1 ratios between reactants and products. For instance, the reaction between lead(II) nitrate and sodium chloride produces the precipitate lead(II) chloride and aqueous sodium nitrate: Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2NaCl(aq) ? PbCl2(s) + 2 NaNO3(aq) Lead(II) chloride is commonly used in the production of decorative glass, called Aurene. It also has many other uses. For example, it is used in the production of paints and in industrial processes that remove unwanted metals. 
Example 12.2 	  If we wanted to make 0.5 mol of lead(II) chloride, how many moles of each reactant would be needed? Answer: First, we will relate moles of the reactant sodium chloride to the desired product. The mole ratio between these two substances can be used as a conversion factor as follows: In order to produce 0.5 mol of lead(II) chloride, we would need 1 mol of sodium chloride. The necessary amount of the other reactant can be calculated in the same way: We can use mole ratios to determine the amounts of reactants needed to produce a given amount of product. As we will see in the next lesson, we can also convert these amounts into masses using our understanding of molar mass. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Mole ratios can be derived from a balanced chemical equation. These ratios can then be used to determine the amounts of each substance involved in a given chemical reaction. Stoichiometry refers to calculations involving the relative amounts of various reactants and products that participate in a chemical reaction. 
Lesson  Review  Questions 	  Practice using mole ratios: URL  Review of what stoichiometry is: URL If you know how many moles of product a reaction yielded, can you find the mass of reactants used in the initial reaction? Based on the balanced chemical equation, be able to calculate the masses of reactants or products generated in a given reaction. Based on the balanced chemical equation, be able to calculate the moles of reactants or products generated in a given reaction. Understand how to convert between masses and moles in a chemical reaction using mole ratios and molar masses. 
Mole  Ratios,  Molar  Masses, and  Chemical  Equations 	  How can we measure out a known amount of a reactant, since actually counting atoms and molecules is not a practical approach? How can we tell what amount of product was generated in a reaction? In most cases, the mass of a reactant or product is a relatively easy quantity to measure. Recall that the molar mass of a given chemical species can be determined by referencing the periodic table. If we know the identity of the substance we wish to measure, molar mass can be used as a conversion factor between mass and amount (in moles). For any given chemical reaction, we can describe the following relationships in the Figure 12.2. 
Example 12.3 	  AgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) ? AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq) How many grams of each reactant are needed to produce 0.500 mol of silver chloride? Answer: First, we need to relate the mass of silver nitrate to the amount in moles of the product silver chloride. This can be accomplished by using a series of conversion factors in which all units cancel except for those of the desired answer (grams of silver nitrate). To do this, we will need the mole ratio between these two reaction components and the molar mass of silver nitrate. Then, we can perform the following calculation: In order to produce 0.500 moles of AgCl, we would need to start with 84.9 g of silver nitrate. A similar calculation can be performed to determine the necessary mass of sodium chloride. This image depicts how moles, mass, and mole ratios are related for a given chemical equation. 
Mass  Reactants? Moles  Reactants? Moles  Products? Mass  Products 	  In the chemistry lab, we frequently need to calculate the relationship between two reactants or products in a chemical reaction. For example, we may know the mass of one reactant and want to know how much of a given product will be generated if the reactant is fully consumed. We may also wish to know how much of a second reactant is required to fully react with the first reactant. These types of questions can be answered by using molar masses and mole ratios as conversion factors. We will illustrate this process with an example. 
Example 12.4 	  How many grams of lead(II) chloride would be produced if 1.67 g of lead(II) nitrate is allowed to react completely in the presence of a sodium chloride solution? How many grams of sodium chloride would be consumed in the process? Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2 NaCl(aq) ? PbCl2(s) + 2 NaNO3(aq) Answer: First, we need to relate grams of lead(II) chloride to grams of lead(II) nitrate. We can set up the following expression, using the molar masses of each component and their mole ratio, obtained from the balanced equation: Therefore, 1.40 g of lead(II) chloride would be produced if 1.67 g of lead(II) nitrate is fully consumed. The amount of NaCl that would be used in this process can be calculated as follows: In order to fully consume 1.67 g of lead(II) nitrate, we would need at least 0.589 g of NaCl. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Using molar masses and mole ratios, we can find the relationships between the masses of various reaction components for a given reaction. 
Lesson  Review  Questions 	  a. URL b. URL c. URL Our study of masses and amounts, as described by a given chemical equation, has assumed that mass is conserved for all chemical processes. How might you determine experimentally that this is the case for a given chemical reaction? So far, we have assumed that all of the reactants are utilized in the formation of products during each reaction. Can you think of a case in which one or more reactants would not be completely consumed? Define limiting reagent, theoretical yield, and percent yield. Calculate theoretical yield for a given chemical process. Be able to determine which reactant is the limiting reactant, calculate the amount of product formed, and determine the percent yield. Use reaction tables to describe mass and mole changes for a given chemical reaction. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  actual yield: The amount of product that is actually produced. theoretical yield: The maximum amount of product that can be generated from the given amounts of reactants. percent yield: Tells us what percentage of the possible amount of product (the theoretical yield) was actually obtained (the actual yield). excess reactant (excess reagent): When there is more reactant available than is required to react with the other available reactants. Some amount of reactant will be leftover at the end of the reaction. limiting reactant (limiting reagent): The reactant that is completely consumed in a reaction. Write the balanced chemical equations for the following reactions: 
Introduction 	  In the last lesson, we learned how to perform stoichiometry calculations, which relate masses and moles of reactants and products for a given chemical process. In this lesson, we are going to compare theoretical yield (the maximum amount that could be produced in a reaction) to actual yield (the amount that is actually produced). We will also investigate what happens when one reactant runs out before the other reactants are fully consumed. Finally, we will study how to express changes in masses and moles for a given chemical process using the reaction table method. 
Actual vs.  Theoretical  Yield 	  The yield of a chemical reaction is the amount of certain product that is produced from given amounts of each reactant. The actual yield is the amount of product that is actually produced. This value is generally not exactly equal to the theoretical yield, which represents the maximum amount that could be generated from the given amounts of reactants. For example, say we performed the copper cycle as described in the introduction by starting with 1.00 grams of copper. Theoretically, the final reaction should give us back 1.00 grams of copper; this is our theoretical yield. However, we may find that only 0.86 grams of Cu is produced; this would be our actual yield. When we perform stoichiometric calculations, we are attempting to determine the theoretical yield based on the amounts of reactants available. Actual yields can only be determined by performing the experiment and measuring the final mass of product. 
Percent  Yield 	  A common way to express the yield of a reaction is as a percentage. The percent yield of a reaction tells us what percentage of the possible amount of product (the theoretical yield) was actually obtained (the actual yield). Percent yield can be calculated using the following expression: 
Example 12.6 	  You calculate that 1.00 grams of copper should be produced (theoretical yield) from a given chemical process. After you run the experiment, you find that 0.860 grams of copper is obtained. Calculate the percent yield for this process. Answer: 
The  Reaction  Table  Method 	  A reaction table can be used to keep track of the masses and moles of each reaction component over the course of a chemical reaction. For the generic reaction shown below, we can set up the following Table 12.1. aA + bB ? cC + dD 
Change in  Moles 	  -ax -bx +cx +dx 
Final  Mass 	  Note: The change in the number of moles for each reactant and product must be consistent with the mole ratios in the balanced chemical equation. This is designated by the factor of "x" in the Change in Moles row of the reaction table. Also recall that as a chemical reaction takes place, the reactants are being used up (indicating a negative change in moles) and the products are being created (indicating a positive change in moles). 
Steps to  Solving  Chemical  Reaction  Problems 	  This process is easiest to explain in the form of an example problem. 
Example 12.7 	  Magnesium metal is heated in the presence of oxygen gas to produce magnesium oxide. If 1.00 grams of Mg react completely with excess oxygen, how many grams of magnesium oxide will be produced? How many grams of oxygen will be used? Answer: First, write the balanced reaction, and then draw a blank reaction table. The changes in moles of each component can be written in terms of a variable x, which we will solve for. The relative number of moles added to or subtracted from each amount is based on the coefficients from the balanced equation. 
Change in  Moles 	  -2x -x +2x 
Final  Mass 	  Now, fill in the known values. We are told that the initial mass of magnesium is 1.00 grams. We are also told that our magnesium sample reacts completely, so the final mass of magnesium (and the final moles) will be 0. We do not know exactly how much oxygen gas is present, but it is an excess reactant (sometimes called an excess reagent), which means that there is more than enough oxygen to react with the other available reactants. We can simply write "excess" in both the initial and final masses/moles for this reactant. Unless told otherwise, assume that there is no initial product (the initial mass and moles of MgO would be 0). Additionally, we can calculate the molar masses for each reactant and product by looking at the periodic table: 
Initial  Mass 	  excess 
Initial  Moles 	  excess 
Change in  Moles 	  -2x -x +2x 
Final  Moles 	  excess 
Final  Mass 	  excess Now, fill in the remaining values by performing calculations. We can use molar masses to convert between grams and moles for any known amount. Once we know the difference between the initial and final moles for any of the reaction components, we can calculate the value of x. Over the course of the reaction, 0.0411 moles of Mg are used up, so ?2x = ?0.0411 mol x = 0.0206 mol Using this information, we can fill in more of the table: 
Initial  Mass 	  excess 
Initial  Moles 	  excess 
Change in  Moles 	  -0.0411 mol -0.0206 mol +0.0411 mol 
Final  Moles 	  excess 
Final  Mass 	  excess Using our value for x, we can now perform simple addition to determine the final moles of MgO. This can then be converted to grams using the molar mass. 
Initial  Mass 	  excess 
Initial  Moles 	  excess 
Change in  Moles 	  -0.0411 mol -0.0206 mol +0.0411 mol 
Final  Moles 	  excess 
Final  Mass 	  excess Now that the table is complete, we can answer the original questions. We can see directly from the table that 1.66 grams of MgO could be produced from this reaction. We do not yet know the mass of oxygen that is used up, but we do know that 0.0206 moles are consumed. Converting this to grams using the molar mass of O2 gives us the following: 
Limiting  Reactant 	  So far, we have either assumed that all reactants will be completely consumed in a chemical reaction, or we have been told that one reactant is present in excess. In the previous example, 1 gram of magnesium reacted in the presence of excess oxygen. However, we may sometimes be presented with initial amounts of multiple reactants without being told which one will run out first. In such a scenario, the limiting reactant (sometimes called a limiting reagent) will be the reactant that is completely consumed. After the limiting reactant runs out, there may still be some of the excess reactants left over, but the reaction can no longer proceed, because one of the ingredients is missing. To determine which reactant is limiting in a chemical reaction, we need to look at how many moles of each are present. These values must then be compared to the coefficients in the balanced equation, which tell us the ratios in which various reactants combine. Before working with chemical reactions, it may help to explain the concept of limiting reactants in a more familiar context. For example, lets say that you want to make as many cheese sandwiches as possible with the bread and cheese that is available. 
Example 12.8 	  You have 16 slices of bread and 10 slices of cheese. If each sandwich requires two slices of bread and one slice of cheese, how many sandwiches can you make, and what ingredients will be left over? For this "reaction," which reactant is limiting, and which one is present in excess? Answer: For this example, we could simply start subtracting bread and cheese as each sandwich is made. After making 8 sandwiches, we would find that we have run out of bread, but there are two slices of cheese left over. Thus, bread is the limiting reactant, and cheese is present in excess. Notice that we actually have more slices of bread than of cheese, but because it gets used up twice as fast, bread runs out first (it is limiting). An alternative way to look at this problem would be to write this "reaction" out as a chemical equation. We cannot directly compare the amounts of bread and cheese, because they are not used in a 1:1 ratio. However, if we divide each amount by the coefficient from the balanced equation, we get the following: = 8 = 10 These values can be directly compared. After dividing each amount by its coefficient from the balanced equation, the smallest number corresponds to the ingredient that will run out first. In this case, the limiting reactant is bread, because 8 <10. To determine how much of the excess reactant is left over, we need to determine how much will be used up by the limiting reactant. In order to use up all of the limiting reactant (16 slices of bread), we would need: After using 8 slices of cheese, all the bread will be used up, and the "reaction" stops. Subtracting this amount from our original 10 slices of cheese, we can see that there will be two slices left over. Here is an interactive simulation to help you visualize reactions involving limiting reactants: URL .edu/en/simulation/reactants-products-and-leftovers . 
Limiting  Reactants and  Reaction  Tables 	  Filling out a reaction table will help to double-check that you have found the correct limiting reactant, and it will give you information about theoretical yields and the amounts that will be left over for any excess reactants. 
Example 12.9 	  Answer: First, write the balanced equation for this reaction and set up a reaction table. Fill in the amounts given in the problem, and calculate the molar masses of each reaction component. Recall that the "change in moles" line is based on the coefficients from the balanced equation: N2(g) + 3 H2(g) ? 2NH3(g) 
Change in  Moles 	  -x -3x +2x 
Final  Mass 	  Next, use molar masses to convert the known masses to moles: .68 mol H2 Now that we have the moles of each reactant, we can divide by the coefficients from the balanced equation to determine which will run out first. = 0.256 = 0.560 3 Because the number for N2 is lower, N2 is the limiting reactant. Since this reaction is run until a reactant runs out, we now know that the final mass of N2 will be 0 grams. Putting this new information into the table, we get the following: 
Change in  Moles 	  -x -3x +2x 
Final  Mass 	  Looking at the difference between the initial and final moles for N2, it is clear that x must have a value of 0.256 moles. Using this value, we can replace the "Change in Moles" line with specific values, and the "Final Moles" line can be filled in by simple addition or subtraction. 
Change in  Moles 	  -0.256 mol -0.768 mol +0.512 mol 
Final  Mass 	  Finally, we can convert moles to grams using the molar masses of each reaction component: 
Change in  Moles 	  -0.256 mol -0.768 mol +0.512 mol 
Final  Mass 	  Note that if we calculate the total mass of all components, it is the same before and after the reaction (10.56 g total). This is consistent with the law of conservation of mass. Now, we can answer specific questions about this reaction. The limiting reactant is N2, because it is completely used up before any of the other reactants. We would know that we chose the wrong limiting reactant if any of the other final amounts turned out to be negative numbers. The theoretical yield of ammonia is 8.72 g, and there is 1.84 g of H2 left over after the reaction is complete. If the yield is 87.5%, we can perform the following calculation: 
Percent  Yield 	  Actual Yield = (Theoretical Yield)(	) Actual Yield = (8.62 g)(	) 
Lesson  Summary 	  Chemical reactions can be studied in terms of the amounts of reactants that are present and the amount of products that are formed. The balanced chemical equation describes the relative amounts of reactants and products that are consumed and generated by a given chemical process. Reactants combine in fixed mole ratios. The amount of each reactant needed to generate a certain amount of product can be determined with stoichiometric calculations. In cases where one reactant is used up before the others, we can describe the reaction in terms of a limiting reactant and one or more excess reactants. The actual and theoretical yields for a given reaction are often related by calculating a percent yield. The reaction table method provides a way to organize the information needed to perform stoichiometry calculations and to answer quantitative questions about various chemical reactions.

Chapter  Outline 	  So far, much of our study of the chemical world has focused on investigating elements, compounds, and reactions. We have assessed the characteristics of elements and studied how they combine through chemical reactions to produce new compounds. Now, we are going to shift our attention away from compounds and reactions and look at what happens to matter when it changes state. We are going to study why substances exist as solids, liquids, or gases. We are also going to look at what takes place on the molecular level when matter changes state from one form to another. As you might already imagine, some substances exist as solids at room temperature, others exist as liquids, and still others exist as gases. Life as we know it would be much different, for instance, if water was solid at room temperature, or if oxygen and carbon dioxide were liquid.

What are the similarities and differences between different states of matter? 
Introduction 	  Ice, water, and steam appear quite differently to the eye. If you were to look at these three states of matter on the molecular level, you would see that the arrangement of molecules is very different here as well. However, solids and liquids have definite volumes, unlike gases which tend to take on the shape of their container. In this lesson, you will learn about the unique behavior of gas particles on a molecular level and the basis for kinetic molecular theory. 
States of  Matter -  A  Microscopic  View 	  If we see matter at the macroscopic level, we can easily tell whether it is solid, liquid, or gas. In Figure 13.1, we see a green chlorine gas-liquid equilibrium. The various states of matter can largely be explained by studying interactions between particles that occur at the microscopic level. Figure 13.2 shows how the three states of matter differ on the molecular level. In this image, we see how atoms of argon interact in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. As we saw in our chapter on the mole, matter is ultimately composed of particles. We cannot "see" individual molecules, but we can see the effects exerted by the structure of each molecule on the behavior of the bulk material. What accounts for the very different properties exhibited by the same substance when it exists in different phases of matter? The sizes and properties of individual atoms and molecules do not change when a substance changes phase. Rather, it is the interactions between particles that are changing. 
Liquids and  Solids 	  As shown in Figure 13.2, each state of matter looks quite different at the molecular level. In the case of liquids and solids, the distances between particles are negligible relative to the size of each particle; they are essentially in direct contact with one another. In liquids, particles are free to move and exchange neighbors, resulting in the properties of a fluid. In solids, they are rigidly fixed in space and held tightly to neighboring particles. 
Gases 	  The story is quite different for gases. Gases take the shape of their container, and they are relatively easy to compress. There are fewer gas particles per unit volume than for the same substance in the liquid or solid form. In fact, the liquid form of a given material is generally several hundred times more dense than the gas form at normal pressures. Despite the large amounts of empty space, a sample of a gas contains many particles moving around, colliding and imparting force on their surroundings. For example, in a one mole sample of gas at 0C and 1 atm of pressure, each cubic centimeter contains roughly 2.7  1019 molecules. Each molecule participates in several billion collisions every second, moving only about 10-100 nanometers between collisions. Additionally, these gas particles move at very high speeds. For example, at 25C, the average speed of hydrogen molecules in a sample of hydrogen gas is 1960 m/s. These are just some of the differences we see when we look at the molecular level and study the different states for a particular chemical species. The following simulation illustrates how particles behave over time in the liquid, solid, and gas states: URL . In this simulation, you can watch different types of molecules form a solid, liquid, or gas. Add or remove heat to watch the phase change. Change the temperature or volume of a container and see a pressure-temperature diagram respond in real time. One of the concepts shown by this animation is that particles are constantly moving and vibrating. This is an important assumption that we make when we study matter at the molecular level. Anything that is moving and has mass also possesses some amount of kinetic energy, or the energy of motion. Kinetic energy increases as the molecular mass increases and as the velocity of the particle increases. Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision, momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form. 
The  Kinetic- Molecular  Theory of  Gases 	  Some of the observations and assumptions we just made about particle behavior at the molecular level were proposed in independent works by August Kroning (1856) and Rudolf Clausiuss 1857 work titled "the theory of moving molecules." This work became the foundation of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases. The kinetic-molecular theory of gases makes the following assumptions: By applying these principles to gases, it is possible to show that the properties of gases on the macroscopic level are a direct result of the behavior of molecules on the microscopic level. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Differences between solids, liquids, and gases depend upon the interactions between the individual particles. Kinetic energy is directly proportional to the mass and velocity of a particle; that is, as mass and/or velocity increase, so does the kinetic energy. The kinetic-molecular theory describes the behavior of an ideal gas. Assumptions of the kinetic-molecular theory include the following: Gas particles are in constant, random motion. The volume of gas particles is negligible in comparison to the volume of the container. There are no attractive forces between gas particles. Collisions of gas particles are elastic, so no energy is lost. The speed of a gas particle is directly proportional to the temperature of the system.

Introduction 	  You encounter solids and liquids in many forms in your everyday life. Solids, unlike liquids, hold a definite shape. Both solids and liquids hold a definite volume. However, on a molecular level, these two states of matter are quite different. In this lesson we will introduce some of the properties of liquids and solids that affect your interactions with the substances all around you. 
Liquids 	  Liquids have a definite volume, but no definite shape. A gallon of milk will keep the same volume whether it is stored in a one-gallon milk jug or a ten-gallon barrel. The volume is the same, but the fluid will either fill the jug or In this image, you see small pools of elemental mercury. The Latin name for mercury is hydrargyrum, a compound word meaning water-silver (hydr= water, argyros = silver), since it is liquid like water but shiny like silver. Mercury is the only pure metal that exists as a liquid at room temperature. spread out over the bottom of the barrel. 
Intermolecular  Forces in  Liquids 	  Molecules in the liquid state are held in close proximity to one another by intermolecular forces. Any molecule containing an OH group (such as water and the various alcohols) will form hydrogen bonds with adjacent molecules, causing a group of molecules to take on the liquid state. A polar molecule like CH2Cl2 cannot form hydrogen bonds, but molecules are held together in the liquid state by dipole-dipole interactions. Br2 is not polar, but interactions with other Br2 molecules through dispersion forces cause Br2 to be a liquid at room temperature as well. Intermolecular forces are also responsible for various properties of liquids, such as viscosity, surface tension, and vapor pressure. 
Viscosity 	  Viscosity measures a fluids resistance to flow the higher the viscosity, the slower the flow of the material. One factor that affects viscosity is the strength of the intermolecular forces in the material. Molecules that exhibit higher intermolecular forces tend to have higher viscosities. Temperature also influences viscosity. A higher temperature results in a decrease in viscosity, since molecules are moving faster and the intermolecular forces are more easily disrupted. Most cooking oils are more viscous than water, but when heated, the viscosity decreases and the oil spreads more easily. Motor oils are ranked by viscosity. Lower viscosity oils provide less drag on the engine, but they are also used up faster than a higher-viscosity material. 
Surface  Tension 	  Surface tension is a physical property of liquids that is caused by the attraction of liquid molecules due to various intermolecular forces. This property is allows the surface of a liquid to resist an external force, and is a measure of the amount of energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid. Surface tension is basically a measure of the pull of surface molecules on one another. Intermolecular forces on a molecule in the interior of a liquid are exerted in all directions. The forces on a surface molecule are more directional, causing the molecule to be pulled toward other surface molecules and down toward the interior of the liquid. This property has consequences both for the behavior of the liquid in contact with solids and the influence of temperature on the liquid. A liquid that can interact with glass displays the property of adhesion. The attraction of the glass to the molecules is stronger than the attraction of the liquid molecules to each other. The liquid molecules are pulled up due to their stronger attraction to the glass. Water is one liquid that displays this property. Some liquids, such as mercury, display more attraction between the liquid particles than attraction between the liquid and the glass. This is known as cohesion. The pull between the liquid particles is stronger, so the liquid pulls away from the glass. 
Vapor  Pressure 	  Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases. This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. 
Solids 	  Solids are materials that have both a defined shape and a defined volume. They do not take on the shape of their container, as liquids and gases do. Solids can be either amorphous or crystalline. Amorphous solids (such as glass) do not have a well organized three-dimensional arrangement of molecules or atoms, so they lack a high level of order. On the other hand, crystalline solids display a highly ordered and predictable three-dimensional structure. In this section we will discuss the different types of crystalline solids. 
Types of  Solids 	  Solids can be categorized by the forces holding the individual atoms, ions, or molecules together. The Table 13.1 summarizes the properties of different solids: 
Examples 	  ionic ionic bonds brittle, high melting points, poor conductors 
Na Cl,  Li Br 	  molecular intermolecular forces soft, low melting points, poor conductors water, glucose 
Examples 	  covalent covalent bonds hard, high melting points, poor conductors diamond, quartz metallic metallic bonds variable hardness and melting points, good conductors 
Cu,  Fe, other metals 	  Ionic crystals have very strong interactions between individual particles, due to the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. This is reflected in the very high melting points of most ionic solids. The shape of the solid depends upon the relative sizes of the ions and the ratio of cations to anions. Although ionic substances are poor conductors in the solid state, the ions become mobile upon melting, and the resulting liquid is a very good conductor of electricity. Molecular solids are held together by weak dispersion forces or other polar interactions. Because these are based on attractions between partial charges, they are not as strong as ionic forces. Due to the weaker forces involved, this class of solids will melt at much lower temperatures than ionic crystals. Covalent solids are composed of atoms connected by covalent bonds in a three-dimensional network. This extensive series of strong connections produces a very stable structure that is not affected much by changes in temperature. The hardness and stability of diamond is a reflection of the many strong carbon-carbon bonds that form its covalent network. Metallic solids are composed entirely of metallic atoms. In other solid structures, the electrons involved in bonding tend to be localized, or fixed in place in the covalent bonds. However, the electrons in metallic bonds are delocalized over the entire crystal. The fact that the electrons are free to move between different atoms causes metallic solids to be very good conductors of electricity. Crystalline solids can also be characterized by their shape. The Table 13.2 illustrates some of the common crystal forms. The crystal shapes are determined by the type and arrangement of the individual atoms, ions, or molecules from which they are constructed.

Lesson  Summary 	  At the molecular level, the major difference between solids and liquids is based on how freely the particles can move within the substance. Viscosity measures a liquids resistance to flow. Surface tension results from the directional pull on surface molecules towards the interior of a liquid. Adhesion and cohesion are demonstrated by liquids as they interact with the surface of a container. Vapor pressure is the pressure resulting from the gas molecules above a liquid in a closed container at equilibrium. Ionic, molecular, covalent, and metallic solids are characterized by the types of bonds holding the substances particles together in the solid form. 
Adhesion and cohesion, in space!: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o Y3y Sf-24 	  In this lesson, we studied the differences between liquids and solids at the molecular level. As we will see, these differences can be accounted for by looking at the amount of energy within a given system. How do you suppose pressure might affect particles at the molecular level in terms of the phase that a given substance exhibits? Describe how the phase of a material is affected by changes in the temperature. Describe how the phase of a material is affected by changes in pressure. Draw phase diagrams to relate the pressure, temperature, and the phase of a substance. Describe the energy changes associated with changes of state. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  heating curve: A curve where supplying heat to a solid substance will gradually raise its temperature, and eventually, it will melt. melting point: The temperature of a point where heat is used to break up the attractive forces holding them rigidly in place. boiling point: The temperature of a point where particles start to enter the gas phase. phase diagram: A plot of temperature vs. pressure that indicates the states of matter present at each point. triple point: A point where all three states can exist simultaneously. a. Solids and liquids are virtually incompressible; their volume is constant. b. Solids are typically more dense than liquids. c. All liquids have the same density. 
Introduction 	  In the last lesson, we studied the characteristics of liquids and solids at a macroscopic level and at the molecular level. Increasing the temperature of a solid transforms the particles from a rigid arrangement to a fluid (a liquid or gas). Conversely, decreasing the temperature of a liquid or gas slows the particles down, going back from free movement to a fixed arrangement. In this section, we will further explore how temperature and pressure affect the characteristics and behavior of matter. Pressure has a larger effect on gases, which are very compressible, than liquids and solids. However, changes in pressure are still relevant to solids and liquids. For example, Figure 13.7 shows ice skates on ice. Because your entire weight is all concentrated on a thin blade, ice skates exert quite a bit of pressure on the ice below them. An interesting property of water is that increasing the pressure on its solid form (ice) will eventually convert it to liquid water. The pressure exerted by ice skates makes small amounts of liquid water on the surface, allowing the skates to glide smoothly. 
Heating  Curves 	  Supplying heat to a solid substance will gradually raise its temperature, and eventually, it will melt. Heating the resulting liquid will cause a further increase in temperature until the liquid begins to boil. If we were to graph the temperature of a substance against the amount of heat added, it would look something like the Figure 13.8. Heating curve depicting phase changes between the solid, liquid, and gas forms of a given substance. The Figure 13.8 is referred to as a heating curve. The most notable feature is that the temperature rise is not steady; there are plateaus during which heat is being added, but the temperature is not increasing. What is happening here? Lets start with the first slope on the left. At this point, the substance is in its solid form. Adding heat causes the particles to move faster. Faster particles means more kinetic energy, which also means a higher temperature. At the first plateau, the vibrations of the particles become energetic enough to break free of the rigid solid form, and the substance converts to a liquid. Heat continues to be added, but instead of increasing the kinetic energy of the particles, it is used to break up the attractive forces holding them rigidly in place. This process is known as melting, and the temperature at which it occurs is the melting point. Because the added heat is used to break up attractive forces instead of adding to the kinetic energy of the particles, the temperature of the material stays constant until the phase change is completed. Further heating then adds energy to the liquid particles, increasing their speed, kinetic energy, and temperature. This is the second slope on the curve. Once the particles are energetic enough to completely break free of each other, they start to enter the gas phase. Boiling occurs at the second plateau of this curve, and the temperature at this point is referred to as the boiling point. Again, the added heat is being used to break up the interactions between particles instead of increasing their kinetic energy, so no temperature increase is observed until all particles are in the gas phase. Finally, adding even more energy will further speed up the gas particles, increasing the kinetic energy and temperature of the substance. The reverse process can also be diagrammed, where we start with a gas and gradually remove heat until it condenses to a liquid and then freezes into a solid. For a given amount of a certain substance at a given pressure, heating and cooling curves should be mirror images. The melting point will be equal to the freezing point, and the boiling point will be equal to the condensation point. Additionally, the amount of heat added to completely melt the sample is the same as the amount that must be removed to completely freeze it. Two other changes of state can occur under at appropriate pressures. The direct conversion of a solid to a gas without becoming a liquid is called sublimation. The reverse process (gas to solid) is known as deposition. Depositions of hot metal vapors are often used in the electronics industry to produce thin films of metal on solid bases. Most substances require reduced pressures (less than one atmosphere) for these processes to occur. At higher pressures, substances would transition through the liquid phase. However, some materials, such as carbon dioxide, will sublime even at standard pressure. Iodine and naphthalene (found in mothballs) are other substances that can sublime at only slightly reduced pressures. The Figure 13.9 summarizes the different processes involved in phase changes. 
Phase  Diagrams 	  Both temperature and pressure have an effect on the phase in which a given substance exists. A plot of temperature vs. pressure that indicates the states of matter present at each point is known as a phase diagram. Figure 13.10 shows the phase diagram for water. The lines on this diagram show the boundaries between the three states of matter for water. Notice that there is one point where all three states can exist simultaneously; this is called the triple point. Also look at the slope of the solid-liquid boundary. For most substances, this line has a positive slope, which means that increasing the pressure of a liquid will eventually form a solid. Water is unusual in that it has a negative slope for this boundary. This has to do with the fact that the liquid form of water is more dense than the solid form (ice). As a result, putting large amounts of pressure on ice at a given temperature will cause it to melt. We already discussed this phenomenon at the beginning of the lesson in the context of ice skating. The phase diagram gives us a more detailed way to look at this occurrence. 
Example 13.1 	  A pressure cooker operates by keeping water in its liquid form at temperatures above its normal boiling point. Can you use the phase diagram to explain this behavior? Answer: The pressure cooker maintains a pressure that is above one atmosphere. At this higher pressure, the boundary between the liquid and gaseous forms of water occurs at a higher temperature. If we look at the phase diagram for carbon dioxide, we can see that its triple point occurs at approximately 5 atm and -56C. Below this pressure, liquid CO2 cannot exist. At one atmosphere of pressure, only the solid and gas forms are possible, which explains why solid CO2 sublimes instead of melting at standard pressures. Also note that the solid-liquid boundary has a positive slope, which is normal for most substances. 
Example 13.2 	  Why solid CO2 is called dry ice? Use the phase diagram to explain. Answer: Solid CO2 exists at temperatures below -78C at the standard pressure of 1 atm. When solid CO2 is allowed to warm to room temperature at this pressure, the solid changes to a gas without going through the liquid form. Because it does not become a liquid, it is considered "dry." 
Lesson  Summary 	  Phase transitions occur as heat is added or removed from a substance. The solid to liquid transition is called melting. The liquid to gas transition is called boiling. Sublimation and deposition involve direct transitions between solid and gas without going through the liquid state. A phase diagram gives information about the conditions under which a material can exist as a solid, a liquid, or a gas.

The  Properties of  Gases 	  When the weather is right, you might see a brightly colored balloon floating far above you. The technology that goes into a hot air balloon is one that we may not pay much attention to these days. It works by trapping hot gases in a container that remains upright over time. It is the oldest human-carrying flight technology and is still used today for many important applications, such as weather monitoring. In this chapter, we are going to study the properties of gases and the effects that altering one of these properties has on various others. Flickr:ricketyus. URL CC BY 2.0.

Introduction 	  Nitrogen has a melting point of -210C and a boiling point of -196C. It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and fairly unreactive at normal temperatures and pressures. It exists as N2 molecules, in which two nitrogen atoms are held together by a strong triple covalent bond. Its lack of reactivity is derived from the large amount of energy that would be required to break this bond. Nitrogen is an example of a diatomic gas, which refers to any two-atom molecules that exist in the gas phase around room temperature. In this lesson, we are going to study some properties exhibited by gases, with a special focus on the pressure they exert and how pressure is measured. 
Physical  Characteristics of  Gases 	  All matter, under the right conditions, can exist in a gaseous state. Some substances, such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen, exist as gases at room temperature under standard atmospheric pressure. Gases have the following characteristics: The following simulation demonstrates the properties of gases listed above: URL tates-of-matter . 
Pressure 	  According to the kinetic-molecular theory, momentum is conserved in collisions between particles at the molecular level. The same can be assumed to be true for collisions between gaseous particles and the wall of their container In the chapter opener, we saw a hot air balloon traveling through the air. The walls of the balloon are pushed outward by the hot air inside. On the molecular level, this outward force is due to countless tiny collisions between gas molecules and the walls of the balloon. Pressure is a measure of the total amount of force divided by the surface area over which it is exerted. If the total force of the collisions inside the balloon is greater than the force of collisions exerted by the atmosphere on the outer surface of the balloon, it will expand. Equivalently, if the pressure inside the balloon is higher than the pressure outside, the balloon will expand. Pressure can be measured with an instrument called a barometer ( Figure 14.2). The word barometer comes from the Greek roots baro, meaning pressure, and meter, meaning to measure. Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647) is credited with inventing the barometer in 1644. The invention consisted of a mercuryfilled container attached to a glass tube into which mercury flowed. As shown in Figure 14.2, atmospheric gases exert a downward force on the fluid reservoir, and the fluid rises in the tube. The height of the fluid is one way to measure atmospheric pressure. If the tube is connected to an enclosed sample of gas instead of open to the atmosphere, the fluid will change height to a different level that is proportional to the pressure of the sample. Because this was one of the first standardized ways to measure pressure, millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is actually a common unit of pressure. This unit is also sometimes referred to as a torr, short for Torricelli. Standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm) is defined as 760 mm Hg, which is approximately equal to the average atmospheric pressure at sea level. The SI unit for pressure is the Pascal, where (1 Pascal = 1 newton/m2). Because this is such a small unit, kilopascals (kPa) are also commonly used. The relationships between various units of pressure are shown below: 
Example 14.1 	  The pressure in a bicycle tire is measured to be 46 psi at room temperature. What is this pressure in atm? = 3.1 atm 
Atmospheric  Pressure 	  Atmospheric pressure can be thought of as the force exerted by a hypothetical column of gas that stretches from sea level to the outer reaches of the atmosphere. If we divide the total weight of the air in the column (the force) by the area that it is pressing down on, we get a pressure of about 1 atm. Figure 14.3 illustrates this type of calculation. If we go up in altitude, there is less air in between the ground and the edge of the atmosphere. The smaller amount of force means that atmospheric pressure is lower at higher altitudes (see Figure 14.4). As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. Youve probably noticed this effect in highmountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath. 
Example 14.2 	  If you were to ascend from sea level to the top of a 10,000-foot high mountain (about 2 miles), what would the atmospheric pressure be? What percent of standard atmospheric pressure is this value? This is a pressure vs. altitude curve that displays altitude in kilometers on the left axis and miles on the right. Pressure is reported in millibars (mb) on the bottom or inches of mercury (in Hg) on the top. Answer: Looking at the altitude-pressure curve above, we can see that the pressure would be approximately 500 mb. Since the pressure at sea level is 1000 mb, the new atmospheric pressure would be 500/1000  100% = 50% of the standard atmospheric pressure. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Gases assume the shape of their container. Gases are compressible. Gas particles demonstrate elastic collisions between themselves and with container walls. Pressure is equal to force/area. Atmospheric pressure can be measured with a barometer. Atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 psi (1 atm) at 25C. Atmospheric pressure decreases as the altitude increases.

What do you suppose the relationship is between pressure and volume as shown here? 
Introduction 	  In the last lesson, we studied the properties and characteristics of gases. Many of these properties can be explained by the fact that gases are mostly empty space but contain large numbers of particles with certain masses and velocities. Now we are going to study how gases behave when exposed to changes in temperature, pressure, and volume. We will also see how the development of instruments that measure pressure and temperature led to new discoveries in our understanding of gases. The origins of the absolute temperature scale will be discussed, and we will examine the empirical relationships between volume, temperature, pressure, and amount that were discovered by early chemists. 
Boyles  Law:  Pressure vs.  Volume 	  With the development of the barometer in 1644 came a series of experiments and investigations aimed at understanding the nature of gases. Robert Boyle (1627-1691) was particularly interested in the relationships between the volume occupied by a sample of gas and the pressure it exerted on its container. He invented one of the earliest air pumps, which allowed him to create low-pressure environments. Boyle devised experiments to study the pressurevolume relationship. For example, he observed that reducing the volume of a balloon by half doubles its volume. In other words, volume is inversely proportional to pressure (V ? 1/P). For a fixed amount of gas at a constant temperature, the volume occupied is inversely proportional to its pressure. Stated mathematically, the product of the pressure and volume is equal to a constant: 
V = k 	  where k is a constant that depends on the temperature and amount of the gas in a given sample. This observation was published in 1662 and is now known as Boyles Law. This equation can be used to quantitatively predict how changes in pressure will affect the volume of a sample, and vice versa. Lets assume that a sample of gas undergoes a change to one of these variables while the temperature and amount are held constant. The initial pressure (P1) and the initial volume (V1) can be related to the final pressure (P2) and the final volume (P2) as follows: 
P2  V2 = k 	  Therefore, 
Example 14.3 	  A sample of oxygen gas has a volume of 150. mL when its pressure is 0.647 atm. What will the volume of the gas be at a pressure of 0.987 atm if the temperature remains constant? Answer 
P1  V1 =  P2  V2 	  V1 = 150. mL, V2 =? 
P1  V1 	  V2 = 
P2 	  (0.647 atm)(150. mL) V2 = 
Temperature 	  The thermometer was developed a short time after the barometer made it possible to study pressure in a quantitative manner. Although crude thermometers had been available for quite some time, Daniel Fahrenheit constructed a more accurate thermometer in 1724 using mercury in glass. Because the height of the mercury in the thermometer was a relative measure, certain fixed points needed to be defined. Originally, Fahrenheit defined a 1:1:1 mixture of ice, salt, and ammonium chloride as 0F, and the freezing/melting point of ice as 32F. On this scale, the normal temperature of the human body is 96F, and the boiling point of water is 212C. The modern Fahrenheit scale is defined in terms of the normal freezing and boiling points of water. Anders Celsius (1736) devised a slightly different scale, which also had two fixed values based on the freezing and boiling points of water. Originally, he suggested a value of 0C for the boiling point and 100C for the freezing point. Shortly after his death, the scale was reversed, resulting in the form that is used today. The Celsius scale is the standard way to measure temperature in most parts of the world. Figure 14.6 compares these two different scales. 
Absolute  Zero 	  The ideas of absolute zero and absolute temperature were conceived in 1848 by Lord Kelvin. Kelvin had observed that for every 1C drop in temperature, a sample of gas contracted by a uniform amount, specifically, 1/273th of its volume at 0C. If this data is extrapolated, or projected, to the point where the gas would reach a volume of zero, we reach a lower limit for possible temperatures. Kelvin interpreted this to mean that -273C is the lowest achievable temperature. In contrast to other scales, where the temperature can be below zero, the value of zero Kelvin represented an absolute zero. Figure 14.7 shows Kelvins extrapolation. The Kelvin scale is used for all gas law calculations. 
Charless  Law 	  Various studies were done on the effects of temperature changes on both pressure and volume by two prominent French scientists, Jacques Charles (1746-1823) and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850). In 1802, Charles and Gay-Lussac both proposed that for a fixed amount of gas at a constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its absolute temperature (V ? T). Figure 14.8 illustrates the volume-temperature relationship. This relationship between volume and pressure is commonly known as Charless Law. It can be expressed mathematically as follows: 
T = k 	  where k is a constant that depends on the pressure and amount of the gas sample. As in the case of Boyles Law, this can also be used to generate a way of comparing two different states for a given sample at constant pressure: 
Example 14.4 	  A sample of neon gas occupies a volume of 752 mL at 25C. What volume will the gas occupy at 50C if the pressure remains constant? Before you begin, think about whether or not the volume should go up or down. Answer: Dont forget that all temperatures must be converted to absolute temperature (Kelvin). 
Gay- Lussacs  Law 	  Gay-Lussacs Law describes the relationship between pressure and absolute temperature: 
T1 	  Gay-Lussacs law says that at a constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. This relationship is also sometimes attributed to Guillaume Amontons (16631705). Although his work predated that of Gay-Lussac by over a century, the data on which he based his ideas were considerably less precise, due to the cruder instrumentation available at the time. 
Example 14.5 	  The gas in an aerosol can exerts a pressure of 3.00 atm at 25C. Directions on the can warn the user not to keep the can in a place where the temperature exceeds 52C. What would the gas pressure in the can be at 52C? Before you begin, do you think the pressure should go up, down or stay the same? Answer: Again, dont forget that all temperatures must be converted to absolute temperature (Kelvin). 
P2 = 3.27 atm 	  Note that the pressure increases, which would be expected if the temperature were to go up. 
Combined  Gas  Law 	  We can combine the relationships described in Boyles law, Charless law, and Gay-Lussacs law to create a combined gas law that relates pressure, volume, and temperature. 
P1 V1 =  T2 V22  T1 	  We can use this expression to predict changes to these variables for a given chemical system. 
Example 14.6 	  A helium-filled balloon has a volume of 50.0 L at 25C and 1.08 atm. What volume will it have at 0.855 atm and 10C? P1 = 1.08 atm, P2 = 0.855 atm V1 = 50.0 L, V2 =? T1 = 25?C+273 = 298 K, T2 = 10?C+273 = 283 K 
P1 T2 V1 	  V2 = 
P2 T1 	  (1.08 atm)(283 K)(50.0 L) 
V2 == 60.0  	  (0.855 atm)(298 K) 
Avogadros  Law 	  In 1811, shortly after the work of Charles and Gay-Lussac, Amadeo Avogadro (1776-1856) was also studying the relationships between pressure, volume, and temperature. He postulated that if you compare two samples of an ideal gas at the same temperature, pressure, and volume, they contain the same number of molecules. This became known as Avogadros Law. This means that at a given pressure and temperature, the volume of a sample is directly proportional to the number of molecules present. 
 	  n = k Where: 
V is the volume of the gas 	  n is the amount of gas particles (generally measured in moles) k is a proportionality constant 
Ideal  Gas  Law 	  If we add Avogadros Law into the combined gas law, we get the following equation: 
Tn = constant 	  Unlike the constants for the other gas laws, this constant is given a special name. The ideal gas constant (R) has the same value for any sample of any ideal gas. A more common way to write the ideal gas law is the following: 
V = n 	  Recall that 1 mol of an ideal gas at 1 atm of pressure and 0C (standard temperature and pressure) occupies a volume of 22.4 L. We can use this information to calculate the value of R: 
R =  Vn = ((1273atm K)()(122mol.4  L)) = 0.0821  Latm K?1 mol?1 	  Using more precise measurements, the ideal gas constant is found to have a value of 0.08206 LatmK?1mol?1. 
Example 14.7 	  Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a colorless, odorless, and very unreactive gas. Calculate the pressure (in atm) exerted by 1.82 moles of the gas at 69.5C when confined to a rigid steel vessel with a volume of 5.43 L. Answer: 
T1 = 69.5? C+273 = 342.5  	  nRT P = 
 	  (1.82 mol)(0.08206 LatmK?1 mol?1)(342.5 K) P = Note that, in order for all of the units to cancel correctly, the pressure must be expressed in atmospheres, the volume must be in liters, the amount must be in moles, and the temperature must be in Kelvin. If different units were used, the ideal gas constant would have a different value. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Pressure and volume are inversely proportional at a constant temperature. Volume and temperature are directly proportional at a constant pressure. Pressure and temperature are directly proportional at a constant volume. Pressure, volume, and temperature are related by the combined gas law. The volume occupied by a gas at a given temperature and pressure is proportional to the number of gas molecules present. For any ideal gas, PV=nRT, where R is a constant with a value of 0.08206 LatmK?1mol?1.

The fuel mixture initially exerts a pressure of 1.00 atm. Calculate the pressure of the compressed fuel-air mixture (assuming temperature and the amount of gas remain constant). As we studied gases in this lesson, we assumed that all gases exhibit ideal behavior (collisions between particles are completely elastic, the particles do not attract or repel one another, and the volume of the gas particles is negligible compared to the volume they occupy). If some of these assumptions were not quite true, how would it affect the observed gas laws? What properties of gases are affected by the speeds of the individual particles? Define partial pressure.

Introduction 	  In our previous lesson, we studied the relationships that exist between pressure, temperature, volume, and amount for gases. One assumption we made was that the gases behave ideally, which means that the collisions between gas particles are completely elastic, the particles do not attract or repel one another, and the particle volumes are negligible compared to the overall volume that they occupy. Many properties of ideal gases do not depend on the identity of the gas. For example, we know that one mole of any ideal gas takes up 22.4 L at STP, regardless of the chemical makeup of the individual particles. However, not all properties are like this. For example, the particles of different gases have different average speeds, even if the samples are kept at the same temperature. In this lesson, we will examine how molecular speed is determined for a given sample and use this information to investigate what happens to gas behavior when molecular speeds vary. 
Gas  Mixtures 	  Gases are frequently encountered as mixtures. For example, the air we breathe is a mixture of several gases. It is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, but water vapor, argon, carbon dioxide, and various other gases are also present in small amounts. Suppose we place a sample of air in a rigid container. If we were to visualize what is happening at the molecular level, we would see various gas particles mixed together in a homogeneous fashion. Each gas is evenly distributed throughout the entire container, just as they would be if there were no other substances present. The following simulation will help us visualize this setup: URL . Based on your observations of the above simulation, would you say the mixture of heavy and light gases was homogeneous or heterogeneous? Were the collisions elastic? What are the similarities and differences between the heavy gas particles and light gas particles? 
Daltons  Law of  Partial  Pressures 	  In our hypothetical gas mixture, we could measure the total pressure exerted by the mixture using a barometer or other instruments. However, we cannot directly measure the pressure exerted by each individual component. How can we determine this information? The concept of partial pressures was first described in 1801 by John Dalton (1777-1844). Daltons law of partial pressures states that if two or more gases are mixed in a container, each one will exert the same amount of pressure as it would if it were by itself in a container of the same size. As a result, the total pressure of the mixture will be the sum of the partial pressures. For example, here is an image that shows what happens at the molecular level when two different gases are mixed. The partial pressure is the pressure that each individual gas exerts. If we assume that a certain sample of air contains only nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, we could express the total pressure of the mixture as a sum of three partial pressures: 
Ar=partial pressure of  Ar 	  The percentage of the total pressure that is due to one gas in a mixture is proportional to its mole fraction. A mole fraction expresses what fraction or percentage the moles of a particular substance contribute to the total number of moles present. It can be calculated as follows: 
Example 14.8 	  If you had a gas mixture that contained 3.0 moles of argon gas and 6.0 moles of oxygen gas, what is the mole fraction of the argon? If the total pressure is 760 mm Hg, what is the partial pressure of argon? Answer: First, calculate the mole fraction of argon: moles Ar XAr = total moles 
Ar == 0.33 	  Partial Pressure: PAr = (XAr)(Pt) 
Partial  Pressures and the  Ideal  Gas  Law 	  We could also determine partial pressure by solving for P in PV = nRT, by using a value for n that only accounts for one of the gases present. 
Example 14.9 	  A gaseous mixture consists of 380 g of F2 and 100 g of Ne. If the volume of the container is 112 L and the temperature is 273 K, calculate: a. The moles of each gas. b. Total moles of all gases. c. Mole fraction of each gas. d. Total pressure of mixture. e. Partial pressure of each gas. Answer: a. Moles of each gas: b. Total moles of all gases: nt = nF2 +nNe nt = 10+5 = 15 c. Mole fraction of each gas: 
Ne == 0.33 	  d. Total pressure of the mixture: nRT	(15 mol)(0.08206 LatmK?1 mol?1)(273 K) 
Pt = 3.0 atm 	  e. Partial pressure of each gas: 
Diffusion and  Effusion 	  Gas molecules are always in motion. We can measure the movement of gases in various ways. We have already seen that the temperature is related to the average speed of the gas particles. Because individual particles are all moving in random directions, the sample as a whole does not move this fast from place to place. However, we can also look at the speed at which an entire gas sample moves. What if a gas is transferred to a larger container? Eventually, the random motions of the gas particles will result in an even distribution throughout all the available space. This process is referred to as diffusion. Another related process is effusion. Effusion is the process of a confined gas escaping through a tiny hole in its container. Effusion can be observed by the fact that a helium-filled balloon will stop floating and sink to the floor after a day or so. This is because the helium gas effuses through tiny pores in the balloon. Both diffusion and effusion are related to the speed at which various gas molecules move. Gases that have a lower molar mass effuse and diffuse at a faster rate than gases that have a higher molar mass. While they are similar processes, there is a key difference between diffusion and effusion. Diffusion describes the process of a gas spreading out at a constant pressure, such as throughout a room. Effusion, on the other hand, describes the process of a gas spreading out from a high pressure surroundings to lower pressure surroundings. Scottish chemist Thomas Graham (1805-1869) studied the rates of effusion and diffusion for various gases. Grahams Law of Effusion states that the rate of effusion or diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass of the gas. 
 	  Relative rates of effusion for gases of different molecular masses can be studied by looking at the time needed for a given gas to effuse through a pinhole in a vacuum ( Figure 14.10). The lighter the gas molecules are, the smaller the number in the denominator, and the faster the gas effuses and diffuses. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Daltons law of partial pressures states that the total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas component. Mole fractions describe the fraction or percentage of a mixture that is made up of a particular substance. The rates of diffusion and effusion for a gas are inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass.

Introduction 	  Water is truly an amazing substance. It can exist in all three states under normal pressures and temperatures. At room temperature, it is a tasteless, odorless, colorless liquid, although it exhibits a blue hue when present in large volumes. Approximately 70% of the Earths surface is covered in water. For a small molecule, water molecules are highly attracted to one another, due to particularly strong hydrogen bonds. This leads to a number of properties, such as a relatively high surface tension. Unlike most other substances, water expands when it freezes. Water is also able to absorb relatively large amounts of heat with only minimal changes in temperature. This can be seen on a small scale, such as the coolant in your car, or on a larger scale, such as the more moderate climates in coastal areas. The water in the oceans acts as a tremendous heat sink, which influences global weather patterns. The clouds that form above lakes and oceans originate from the evaporation of lake and ocean water. They are byproducts of waters thermal regulating capacity. Additionally, water is not only found here on Earth; scientists have found evidence of water on a number of extraterrestrial planets. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at this unique and important substance. 
Water,  Ice and  Steam 	  As we saw in the States of Matter chapter, all substances can transform from one state to another, depending on the temperature and pressure of the environment. The solid, liquid, and gaseous forms of water all play an important part in our everyday lives. 
Example 15.1 	  Which of the processes in Figure 15.1 require the absorption of heat? Which release heat? Answer: Melting, sublimation, and evaporation absorb heat from their surroundings. Freezing, deposition, and condensation release heat. 
Ice -  	  Water in its solid form is generally referred to as ice. Other common terms for solid water include snow, sleet, hail, or frost. The use of a different term generally depends on how and where the water was frozen. Ice plays a major role in activities as diverse as skiing and skating, rain making, polar marine transportation, and offshore drilling. It also plays an important role in the degradation of concrete and other porous materials. Liquid water gets into the cracks of such materials, which can then fracture if the water freezes and expands. Icing on airplanes and electrical transmission lines can also interfere with their functioning. Water can freeze into both crystalline and non-crystalline (amorphous) forms. Crystalline solids refer to solids in which the atoms or molecules are packed in a precisely arranged order. The environmental conditions under which the transition occurs dictate whether this phase change produces regular crystals or not. In its crystalline form, water molecules are generally arranged in a hexagonal array, as shown in Figure 15.2. Ice on Earth generally forms when liquid water freezes. However, it can also be produced by the deposition of water vapor (i.e., H2O(g) ? H2O(s)). When this is the case, the ice is often referred to as frost ( Figure 15.3). When water freezes in a non-crystalline, amorphous form as frost, the water molecules are fixed in place, but not in a regular, repeating pattern. Frost and other amorphous solids are characterized by their unorganized and unpredictable structure. Because ice comes in both amorphous and crystalline forms, there are differences in the physical properties of ice such as its hardness and density. 
Example 15.2 	  Can you think of another substance that has an amorphous geometry? Can you think of another substance that has a crystalline geometry? Answer: Some types of candy, such as gummi bears or taffy, are amorphous solids. Table salt has a crystalline geometry. 
Liquid  Water  	  Liquid water is formed when water vapor condenses (i.e., H2O(g) ? H2O(l) or when ice melts (i.e., H2O(s) ? H2O(l)). Because water is a molecular substance, it is a poor conductor of electricity in its pure form. However, as we will see later, its conductivity can be improved by the addition of certain substances. Water molecules are polar, and this overall polarity gives rise to many of the properties of water. For example, an interesting effect is seen when water is placed in a static electric field, as shown in the Figure 15.4 and the video below. This phenomenon can be explained in terms of the polarity of water molecules. 
Density 	  The molecular structures of solid and liquid water are shown in Figure 15.5. Molecular arrangement of H2O molecules in	the	solid	(right)	and	liquid	(left) phases. Interestingly, due to the "open" nature of the rigid solid form, the density of liquid water is actually higher than that of solid ice. As a result, ice floats on water. This is relatively rare; most other substances are more dense in their solid form. The density of water as a function of temperature can be graphed, as shown in Figure 15.6. Density vs. temperature curve for water. 
Surface  Tension 	  As we saw in our chapter on Covalent Bonding, water molecules attract each other through dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds. An example of a favorable arrangement is shown in Figure 15.7. between water Hydrogen	bonding molecules. Molecules within a liquid are pulled equally in all directions by intermolecular forces. However, molecules at the surface are pulled downwards and sideways by other liquid molecules, but not upwards away from the surface. The overall effect is that the surface molecules are pulled into the liquid, creating a surface that is tightened like a film. This phenomenon is referred to as surface tension. Liquids that have strong intermolecular forces, like the hydrogen bonding in water, exhibit the greatest surface tension. Table 15.1 shows surface tension values for various common liquids. 
Fluid 	  Surface Tension (N/m) benzene diethyl ether carbon tetrachloride chloroform ethanol ethylene glycol glycerol mercury methanol propanol toluene water at 20C The surface tension of water is illustrated by a number of common occurrences. For example, water spiders are able to walk across bodies of water because of surface tension. Even though the spiders are denser than water, they do not sink, because the small amount of weight pressing down on the surface is not enough to break the strong hydrogen bonds that hold the surface together. 
Heat  Capacity 	  The heat capacity of a substance measures how much heat it needs to absorb to cause a certain increase in temperature. Substances with high heat capacities can absorb large amounts of heat with only a minimal temperature increase. Compared to other common liquids, water has a relatively high heat capacity. The heat capacities of some common substances are listed in Table 15.2. 
Material 	  Heat capacity (caloriesg?1C?1) 
Example 15.3 	  How much heat must be absorbed by 1 gram of water to raise its temperature by 5C? Answer: Water has a heat capacity of 1.00 caloriesg?1C?1. Raising the temperature of 1 gram of water by 5C would require the absorption of 5 calories of energy. 
Steam  	  Water vapor, or steam, can be produced either through the vaporization of liquid water (i.e., H2O(l) ? H2O(g) or the sublimation of solid water (i.e., H2O(s) ? H2O(g)). When water changes from a liquid to a gas at normal temperatures and pressures, we refer to the process as evaporation. When we sweat, we take advantage of this process. Vaporization requires an input of energy, so when our sweat evaporates, it absorbs some of the energy from our bodies, thus cooling us. When water is vaporized by heating it to its boiling point, we generally refer to it as boiling instead. Steam is a very useful form of water that can be used to do mechanical work, like powering steam engines and turbines. Such devices are important for the generation of electricity. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Water can exist in all three states under normal pressures and temperatures. It is tasteless, odorless, and exists as a liquid at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure. In its solid form, water is frequently referred to as ice. The terms snow, sleet, hail, or frost may also be used, depending on the conditions under which the water solidified. Ice can exist as an amorphous solid or as a crystalline solid. In its pure liquid form, water is a poor conductor of electricity. Unlike most substances, water is more dense in its liquid state than its solid state. As a result, water expands when it freezes, and ice floats on water. Compared to other liquids, water has a relatively high surface tension and heat capacity. Both of these properties are partially a result of the strong hydrogen bonds that hold water molecules together.

Introduction 	  In our last section, we took a detailed look at water and its physical properties and characteristics. We examined properties like surface tension, heat capacity, and density that are significantly higher for water than for many other liquids. In this lesson, we are going to study waters ability to act as a solvent. Water is particularly good at dissolving ionic compounds and very polar molecular substances. By looking at the properties of a given substance, it is often possible to predict whether it will dissolve in water. This type of analysis is aided by understanding the dissolution process on a molecular level. 
Aqueous  Solutions 	  An aqueous solution is a homogeneous mixture in which the most abundant component is water. The other substance(s) are typically introduced in a solid or liquid form and mixed into the water until they are evenly distributed. For example, if we placed a sample of ethanol in water and mixed it homogeneously, we would have a solution. Table salt mixed with water is another example of a solution. More generally, a solution is a homogeneous mixture. The solution component that is present in the largest amount is called the solvent, and all other substances are referred to as solutes. In aqueous solutions, water is always the solvent. 
Experiments 	  We are going to visualize some simple experiments to explain how an aqueous solution is created. This involves placing various common substances in water and seeing what happens. The substances we will consider are (1) table salt (NaCl); (2) cane sugar (C12H22O11), and (3) sand (SiO2) ( Figure 15.10). 
Scenario 1  Salt  Added to  Water 	  What will happen when we add table salt to water? At the macroscopic level? At the molecular level? If we add a spoonful of table salt to a glass of water, we will notice that the salt crystals immediately begin to disappear. We can also stir the solution to speed up the process. Over time, the crystals get smaller and smaller, and eventually, we will be left with a transparent solution, assuming we have enough water to dissolve all of the salt. This process is called dissolution. Because dissolution occurs, we say that salt is soluble in water. Any substance that is able to dissolve in water is described as being water soluble. Where did the salt go? If we were to measure the mass of the salt and the mass of the water before mixing them, we would find that the mass of the solution is simply the sum of its two parts, as expected by the law of conservation of mass. The salt is still there, it is just no longer visible. (Interestingly, volume is not additive in the same way, because the density of the solution is different than the densities of the two starting materials.) Recall that salt is an ionic substance comprised of cations and anions bonded tightly together in a crystal lattice. Because water molecules are polar, they are capable of stabilizing isolated ions by surrounding each one with the appropriate partial charges. The process of separating ions from one another is known as dissociation. After the sodium and chloride ions that make up salt have separated from each other, the compound is said to have dissociated. Here is a video clip of what dissociation looks like: URL . Although they appear identical, a solution of sodium chloride has properties that are significantly different than those of pure water. For example, pure water is a poor conductor. However, if we pass electricity through a solution of sodium chloride, we find that it is quite conductive (see Figure 15.11). In Figure 15.11, the bulb on the right is fully illuminated. Electricity is able to flow through the circuit because the salt solution is a good conductor. In contrast, the bulb on the left is not lit, because the poorly conductive beaker of water provides too much resistance to the complete electric circuit. Why does this difference occur? In order to conduct electricity, a substance needs to have charge carriers (either ions or electrons) that are able to move freely. In pure water, there are essentially no ions, and all electrons are tightly associated with their corresponding molecules. However, in the salt solution, plenty of positively and negatively charged sodium and chloride ions are available to conduct an electric current. Because this test tells us the relative number of free ions that are in solution, it can be used to determine whether a given substance dissociates into separate ions when dissolved in water. 
Scenario 2  Sucrose  Added to  Water 	  In our second scenario, we are going to add cane sugar to water. Again, the solid will gradually disappear over time, and assuming there is enough water to dissolve all of the sugar, we will eventually be left with a clear solution. What would happen if we tested this solution for conductivity? It turns out that the solution of sugar has a conductivity similar to that of pure water. Why is this different than when we dissolved salt? The difference is that sugar is a molecular substance, not an ionic substance. In general, molecular substances do not dissociate when dissolved in water, so no ions are formed that can be used to conduct electricity. (There are some exceptions to this rule. In particular, strong acids, such as HCl, are often molecular substances that dissociate into ions when dissolved in water.) The difference between the dissolution of sodium chloride and sucrose in water is illustrated in the Figure 15.12. Again, notice that all of the sucrose molecules remain completely intact. No covalent bonds are broken during the dissolution of a non-acidic molecular substance, only the intermolecular interactions that hold individual molecules together are disrupted. 
Scenario 3  Sand  Added to  Water 	  If we were to mix sand and water, no solution would form. No matter how long we stirred this mixture, the sand would still settle out to the bottom. Sand and water combine to make a heterogeneous mixture. The Figure 15.13 shows this on a large scale. In order to create a homogeneous aqueous solution, we need the solute to be soluble in water. Sand is insoluble in water, and we can easily see that the two substances remain separate when mixed. The conductivity of this system would also be similar to that of pure water, because neither component is conductive on its own, and no real change occurs when they are mixed together. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Water is a versatile solvent that can dissolve many ionic and polar molecular solutes to make aqueous solutions. The ability of water to dissolve polar and ionic substances is due to its own polarity, which provides partial positive and negative charges to stabilize isolated ions and molecules. A homogeneous solution is created when a solute dissolves completely into a solvent. In a solution, we cannot visually distinguish between the solute and solvent. Ionic substances dissociate into ions when they dissolve in water, but most molecular substances do not. Not all substances are soluble in water.

Introduction 	  In the previous lesson, we studied how aqueous solutions are formed. Our focus was on solid or liquid solutes being dissolved by liquid water, and we assumed that the solutes were either completely soluble or completely insoluble, producing either homogeneous or heterogeneous mixtures, respectively. However, there are other situations that are not as easy to classify. For example, in Figure 15.14, we see a small bowl of mayonnaise. Mayonnaise is a colloid a mixture that is not totally homogeneous nor totally heterogeneous. In this lesson, we are going to expand our study of mixtures to show that solids and gases can also act as solvents. Additionally, we will look at situations in which a solute breaks down into particles that are larger than individual molecules and ions but smaller than, say, a fully intact grain of sand. 
Colloids and  Suspensions 	  Solutions are comprised of a solvent and a solute, mixed homogeneously to produce a transparent fluid. However, there are also mixtures in which the solute is evenly dispersed, but each solute particle is still a cluster of more fundamental particles like molecules or ions. The particle sizes in such mixtures are generally larger than 1  10?9 meters. Such a mixture cannot easily be classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous. In such systems, we often use the terms dispersed phase and continuous phase (or dispersion medium) in place of solute and solvent. Each of these phases can consist of a solid, liquid, or gas. Table 15.3 shows various combinations of dispersed and continuous phases. 
Continuous  Gas  Phase 	  none gases are miscible liquid aerosol fog, mist solid aerosol smoke 
Continuous  Liquid  Phase 	  foam whipped cream emulsion salad dressing suspension or sol paint, ink 
Continuous  Solid  Phase 	  solid foam styrofoam gel jelly solid sol glass A mixture of two gases will always be homogeneous. It can be referred to as a solution, but it is often simply called a gas mixture. When a gaseous solute is dispersed within a liquid phase (e.g., whipped cream) or a solid phase (e.g., styrofoam), the result is generally referred to as a foam. A mixture in which liquid particles are dispersed in a gas are called aerosols; examples include fog or hair spray. Liquid particles dispersed into a liquid (e.g., mayonnaise) or solid (e.g., jelly) are called emulsions and gels, respectively. A solid dispersed into a gas, such as smoke, is referred to as a solid aerosol. Solid particles dispersed into liquids (e.g., paint) or solids (e.g., opaque glass) are called sols and solid sols, respectively. We can further differentiate between different mixtures by looking at the particle size of the dispersed substance ( Figure 15.15). 
Particle  Size and  Solution  Type 	  True solutions generally have particle sizes that are smaller than one nanometer. The particles in these solutions do not settle over time and cannot be separated by filters or semi-permeable membranes. The dispersed particles in colloids usually range in size from 10?9 to 10?7 meters. These solutions are somewhat transparent, and their particles do not settle out over time. However, with fine enough semi-permeable membranes, the dispersed particles in a colloid can be separated from the bulk solvent. Suspensions have the largest particles sizes, on the order of 10?7 meters or larger. These mixtures are opaque, and the particles can be separated by filtration. Additionally, the particles in a suspension separate over time into different layers based on the relative densities of the dispersed and continuous phases. 
Visible  Effects of  Particle  Size 	  On the macroscopic scale, variations in particle size can be detected by the effect they have on light that passes through the mixture. For example, true solutions are transparent. Some solutions are colored, which means that certain wavelengths of light are absorbed by molecules within the mixture. However, the remaining light is transmitted freely through the mixture. In contrast, the dispersed particles in a colloid scatter light, resulting in an opaque mixture. The difference can be seen in Figure 15.16. The phenomenon in which light is scattered by very small particles in its path is known as the Tyndall effect. 
Light passing through a true solution and a colloidal solution 	  A suspension scatters light even more effectively than a colloid. Depending on the thickness of the mixture, little to no light will generally make it all the way through a suspension. Suspensions have a very opaque appearance. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The dispersed and continuous phases within a mixture can each be in any state of matter (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas). Mixtures are often classified differently based on the combinations of states (solid, liquid, or gas) represented by the dispersed phase and the continuous phase. Homogeneous mixtures with particle sizes smaller than 1 nanometer are categorized as true solutions. They are transparent. Mixtures with particle sizes ranging from 10?9 to 10?7 meters are colloidal mixtures. They are partially transparent but exhibit a noticeable Tyndall effect. Mixtures in which the particle sizes are larger than 10?7 meters are called suspensions. These mixtures are completely opaque.

Solutions 	  Solubility describes the extent to which one substance will dissolve in another. We are going to study factors that affect the solubility of solids, liquids, and gases in various liquid solvents, particularly water. In the opening image, we see crystals forming in a solution, which can occur when the solubility of a given solute-solvent pairing is exceeded. Our understanding of intermolecular forces will help us to explain the extent to which substances are soluble in water by looking at interactions on the molecular level. Jon Sullivan. Public Domain.

Introduction 	  Have you ever wondered why it is easier to stir sugar into hot tea rather than into ice tea? Or, why no matter how much you shake a jar of oil and vinegar, it always seems to separate? These observations can be explained by a property of solutions known as solubility. In this section, youll learn how molecular structure and binding forces contribute to the solubility properties of various solutions and mixtures. 
Solubility 	  Solubility is the degree to which a given solute dissolves in a particular solvent. It depends on various factors, including temperature and pressure. A common way to express the solubility of a given solute-solvent pair is to state the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved by 100 grams of the solvent. The temperature dependence of the solubilities for various compounds in water is shown in Figure 16.1. The aqueous solubility of a given substance is determined experimentally by dissolving increasing amounts into a known mass of water at a specific temperature until no more solid dissolves. A solution that cannot hold any more of a given solute is said to be saturated. For example, in Figure 16.1 we see that the solubility of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) is approximately 90 g per 100 g of H2O at 20C. At this temperature, a 100 gram sample of H2O in which 90 grams of sodium nitrate is dissolved would be saturated, and a solution in which less sodium nitrate is dissolved would be unsaturated. Note that this ratio also holds for samples in which the solvent is present in different amounts; 50 grams of water would hold 45 grams of sodium nitrate at 20C, and 300 grams of water would hold 270 g of NaNO3. Notice that even relative solubilities of various compounds are temperature dependent. For example, at 20C, KCl has a higher solubility than NaCl, but at 50C, this relationship is reversed. Solutions can also become supersaturated, where the amount of solute dissolved exceeds its solubility. Supersaturation most commonly occurs when a saturated solution is slowly cooled. They occur frequently in geological and meteorological processes. Supersaturated systems are unstable, and eventually, the solute will precipitate until a saturated solution is regenerated. We can quantify supersaturation by looking at solubility curves. If the ratio of solute to solvent is above the saturation curve at the given temperature, the solution is supersaturated. If it is on the curve, the solution is saturated, and if it is below the curve, the solution is unsaturated. Solubility can be described for any solute-solvent pairing, but because water is such a fundamentally important solvent, we are mainly focusing on aqueous solutions. 
Example 16.1 	  You dissolve 40 g of KCl in 100 g of water at 40C. You then cool the solution to 20C, during which you notice solid KCl precipitating. How many grams of KCl would you expect to precipitate? Answer: Consult Figure 16.1 to find the solubility of KCl at 20C (approximately 32 g KCl/100 g H2O). Therefore, we would expect approximately 8 g KCl to precipitate out (40 g 32 g = 8 g). 
Factors  Affecting  Solubility 	  There are three main factors that control solubility. 
Solute and  Solvent 	  Ultimately, the ability of a solute to dissolve in a particular solvent will be dictated by the relative favorability of solute-solvent interactions compared to solute-solute and solvent-solvent interaction. In particular, the polarity of these two substances has a major effect on whether a significant amount of solute is able to dissolve. Polar solutes are typically quite soluble in polar solvents (e.g., ethanol in water), and nonpolar solutes generally dissolve well in nonpolar solvents (e.g., grease in gasoline). Conversely, polar solutes will have low solubilities in nonpolar solvents (e.g., NaCl in CCl4), and solubilities will be low for nonpolar solutes in polar solvents (e.g., oil in vinegar). 
Temperature 	  As you can see in Figure 16.1, solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases. This is true for solvents other than water as well. This effect varies quite a bit by substance. For example, the solubility of KNO3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson. 
Pressure 	  Higher pressures increase the solubility of gases. You are probably familiar with this concept as it relates to carbonated beverages. Before opening the container, the inside is pressurized, so a large amount of CO2 is dissolved in the liquid. After opening, the pressure decreases (to the ambient pressure), so the solubility of CO2 drops, causing it to bubble out of solution. Because they are not compressible like gases, solid and liquid solutes do not have noticeable changes in solubility at different external pressures. 
A  Review of  Intermolecular  Forces 	  Our understanding of the behavior of solutes and solvents can be largely explained at the molecular level using our model of intermolecular forces. Some substances will mix freely while others barely mix at all. This is due to the interactions between particles of the solvent and solute. Recall that nonpolar molecular substances are held together in the solid and liquid phases by relatively weak London dispersion forces, in which induced dipoles line up into a favorable arrangement. An example of this is the interactions found between molecules of iodine (I2). In contrast, polar molecules are held together by stronger dipole-dipole interactions. Additionally, molecules that contain N-H, O-H, or F-H bonds exhibit a special dipole-dipole interaction called hydrogen bonding, which is unusually strong even for a polar interaction. Ammonia (NH3) and water are examples of small molecules that exhibit hydrogen bonding. The cations and anions in an ionic compound are held together by very strong ionic bonds, but ion-dipole interactions are nearly as strong. Ion-dipole interactions would be found, for example, when an ionic substance like NaCl is dissolved in water. Each ion is attracted to the appropriate end of the dipole on surrounding molecules of water. 
Liquid  Solutes 	  When combining two liquids, we can generally predict whether they will mix to form a homogeneous solution or not by looking at the relative polarity of each substance. We will consider three scenarios: the combination of two polar liquids, the combination of one polar and one nonpolar liquid, and the mixing of two nonpolar liquids. 
Polar- Polar  Interactions 	  Polar-polar interactions occur when two or more polar liquids are mixed. An example of this is when methanol mixes with water. Both of these are small polar molecules containing O-H bonds, which means that they can both participate in hydrogen bonding. Figure 16.3 shows molecules of methanol and water connected by hydrogen bonds. Because of these strong interactions, the two substances mix freely to form a homogeneous mixture; they are miscible. One way to remember this interaction is the phrase "like dissolves like." In this case, a polar solvent dissolves polar solutes. 
Nonpolar- Polar  Interactions 	  Toluene (C6H5CH3 is an organic compound that is often used as a solvent in paint thinners. Toluene is a nonpolar compound. When mixed with water, the two substances will separate into two layers rather than forming a homogeneous solution; these two liquids are immiscible. Toluene is a nonpolar chain that cannot form hydrogen bonds with water. Dissolving this chain in water would break up the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules and replace them with weaker dispersion forces. This is generally not energetically favorable, so the liquids tend to separate themselves to maximize the number of strong attractive interactions. 
Example 16.2 	  Can you think of two other liquids that are immiscible and form a heterogeneous mixture? Answer: Another familiar example is the mixing of vinegar and olive oil. Olive oil is a nonpolar substance, while vinegar (which is mostly water and acetic acid) is polar. The result is a heterogeneous mixture that exhibits a bilayer. 
Nonpolar- Nonpolar  Interactions 	  Nonpolar-nonpolar interactions occur when two nonpolar liquids are mixed. An example of this is the interaction between toluene and octane (see Figures 16.4 and 16.5). The interactions between a molecule of toluene and a molecule of octane are relatively weak, but so are the toluene-toluene and octane-octane interactions. Because no strong intermolecular forces (like those between water molecules) need to be broken for mixing to occur, no strong interactions need to be formed in order for mixing to be a favorable process. Toluene and octane will form a homogeneous mixture. The phrase "like dissolves like" applies to these mixtures as well. In this case, nonpolar dissolves nonpolar. 
Example 16.3 	  Can you think of another example of a nonpolar-nonpolar interaction between two different liquids that form a homogeneous mixture? Answer: Another example of a nonpolar-nonpolar interaction between two different liquids would be the mixing of motor oil and gasoline. Both of these substances are nonpolar, so they are miscible and form a homogeneous mixture when combined. 
Solid  Solutes 	  Solutions can also be comprised of a solid solute and a liquid solvent. These interactions are governed by the same three interactions we discussed earlier: polar-polar, nonpolar-polar, and nonpolar-nonpolar. The Table 16.1 describes these interactions. 
E 16.1:  Solution  Interactions 	  Solid (solute) Liquid (solvent) 
Result 	  polar polar 
Homogeneous solution 	  nonpolar polar 
Heterogeneous mixture 	  polar nonpolar 
Heterogeneous mixture 	  nonpolar nonpolar 
Example 16.4 	  Using the data in the Table 16.1, could you replace the solute or the solvent in the heterogeneous mixtures with another material to make them homogeneous? Answer: There are several combinations that could be described. For instance, in the polar-nonpolar mixture between NaCl and toluene, the NaCl could be replaced with a nonpolar solid, like I2, or the toluene could be replaced with a polar substance, like water. 
Ionic  Solids in  Water 	  When placed in water, ionic solids dissolve to varying degrees. Some ionic solids have a high solubility in water (e.g., NaCl), while others barely dissolve at all (e.g., AgCl). Still others are moderately soluble (e.g., Ag2CO3). The solubility rules we studied in the chapter on Chemical Reactions provide guidelines for predicting the relative solubility of a given ionic compound in water. In this chapter, we will focus primarily on water-soluble ionic solids. When a soluble ionic solid is added to water, it interacts with water molecules and dissociates into isolated ions that diffuse out into the solution. These charged particles become solvated by surrounding water molecules ( Figure 16.6). Although the strong ionic bonds in the solid are broken up, they are replaced by numerous favorable interactions between the charged ions and the partial charges on the appropriate ends of the polar water molecules. Notice that for each unit of NaCl that dissolves, two particles are freed into solution, the Na+ cation and the Cl? anion. This means that if one mole of NaCl is dissolved, 2 moles of solute particles are found in the homogeneous solution (one mole of each ion). This dissociation is quantified by something called the vant Hoff factor. The vant Hoff factor (i) describes the number of moles of solute particles that are found in a solution when one mole of a substance is completely dissolved. The vant Hoff factor for NaCl would be expressed as i = 2. 
Example 16.5 	  If one mole of magnesium fluoride (MgF2) is added to water and fully dissociates, how many moles of particles will be formed? Answer: We can describe the dissociation of magnesium fluoride as follows: MgF2 ? Mg2+ + 2 F? Each unit of magnesium fluoride contains three ions (one Mg2+ ion and two F? ions). Using the vant Hoff factor to describe this dissociation, we would say that i = 3, because three moles of ions are produced from the dissociation of one mole of the ionic solid. 
Gas  Solutes 	  Gases are also capable of dissolving in liquids. There are many examples of this in our everyday lives. For example, carbonated beverages contain dissolved carbon dioxide. We notice this when bubbles come out of solution when the beverage is opened. Another example is when oxygen from the air we breathe dissolves in our blood, where it is transported throughout the body. Fish and other aquatic organisms use gills to capture dissolved oxygen from their environments. Because determining the mass of a gaseous sample is generally less convenient than determining how many moles are present, solubilities for gases are often expressed as concentrations instead of as the mass that can be dissolved in a specified amount of solvent. A solution in which one mole of a gas is dissolved in one liter of solution has a concentration of 1 molar (1 M). Because the solubility of most gases is much less than that, the molar solubility is often given in millimolar (mM). A one millimolar solution contains 1/1000 mol of solute per liter of solution. Other methods of expressing concentration, such as parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb), will be discussed in the following lesson. 
Example 16.6 	  What does it mean if the molar solubility of a gas is 2.0 mM? Answer: Each liter of solution can hold a maximum of 2.0 millimoles of that particular gas at the indicated temperature and pressure. 
Temperature  Effects 	  As with all substances, the solubility of gases is temperature dependent. However, in contrast to the situation for most solids and liquids, higher temperatures will decrease the solubility of a gaseous solute. Figure 16.7 shows this relationship with several common gases. Solubility-temperature curves for various common gases. This inverse relationship between solubility and temperature can be understood by looking at a molecular model. Recall that higher temperatures are associated with faster particles. Gas particles are held in solution by attractive interactions with the solvent molecules. If the particles are moving slowly, these attractive forces will pull back any particles that try to escape the surface of the solution and re-enter the gas phase. However, if the gas particles are moving fast enough, these interactions will not be sufficiently strong to prevent this process from occurring. As a result, more particles are able to escape, and the amount of dissolved solute is less than it would be at a lower temperature. 
Pressure  Effects 	  At a constant temperature, the amount a given gas that dissolves in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in the area immediately adjacent to the solution. This principle is called Henrys Law and is illustrated in Figure 16.8. Mathematically, Henrys Law is expressed as follows: ? = kHc where ? is the partial pressure of the gas, c is its molar solubility at the given temperature and pressure, and kH is a constant that depends on the temperature and the identities of both the solute and solvent. Some kH values for various gases dissolved in water at 298 K are presented in the Table 16.2. TABLE 16.2: kH Values for Various Gases Dissolved in Water at 298 K 
Gas 	  Constant (Pamol?1L) Constant (atmmol?1L) 
N2 	  TABLE 16.2: (continued) 
Gas 	  Constant (Pamol?1L) Constant (atmmol?1L) 
H3 	  If we solve the Henrys Law equation for the molar solubility, we get the following useful relationship: c = k?H 
Example 16.7 	  What are the molar solubilities of oxygen gas and nitrogen gas in pure water at 298 K and 1 atm of pressure? Which gas is more soluble under these conditions? c	2 =	.7 atmmol?1L 
O	756 	  = 0.00132 mol/L = 1.32 mM c	2 =	. atmmol?1L 
N	1600 	  = 0.000625 mol/L = 0.625 mM Oxygen gas is more soluble under these conditions. A saturated solution of O2 would have a concentration of 1.32 mM, whereas a saturated solution of N2 would have a concentration of 0.625 mM. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Solubility describes the degree to which a solute will dissolve in a particular solvent. Water is a common solvent for dissolving various solids, liquids, and gases. The solubilities of solids and liquids are commonly expressed as grams of solute that can be dissolved by 100 g of water at a specified temperature. Solutions can be unsaturated, saturated, or supersaturated, depending on the relationship between the solubility of a substance and the amount that is actually dissolved. The solubility of gases, liquids, and solids are affected by changes in temperature. Solutes and solvents that have similar polarities (i.e., both are polar, or both are nonpolar) tend to mix well, creating homogeneous solutions. Solutes and solvents with very different polarities (i.e., one is polar, and the other is nonpolar) often do not mix well, resulting in the formation of heterogeneous mixtures. The solubilities of gases are often described as concentrations (i.e., mM or M) rather than the mass that can be dissolved by a given mass of solvent. The solubility of a gaseous solute is inversely related to the temperature of the solvent and directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas in the surrounding atmosphere. Henrys law describes the mathematical relationship between the concentration of a gaseous solute and its partial pressure in the gas above the solution.

Supersaturated solution demonstration: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v= D1 E5 Oawu 	  When you open a can of soda or sparkling water, you can usually see some gas escape or bubble out of the can. Based on the relationship between pressure and gas solubility, why might this occur? Why do you suppose it is better to wash your dishes with warm water than with cold water? Explain these effects in terms of solubility. Describe the concept of concentration as it applies to solutions, and explain how concentration can be increased or decreased. Define molarity and molality, including the most commonly used units for each measurement. Define weight percent and be able to determine the weight percent of a solute in a given solution.

The amount of solute is always less than the amount of solvent. b. Water is a common solvent. c. You can have a solution where there is zero solute. d. Polar solutes will likely dissolve in polar solvents. 
Introduction 	  A solution is comprised of at least two components the solvent and one or more solutes. Although many different substances (including solids, liquids, and gases) can act as a solvent, we are now going to focus primarily on aqueous solutions, in which water acts as the solvent. Water is the most common solvent that we encounter in our daily lives. In this section, we will explain how to determine the concentration for a given solution and how to create solutions of known concentrations. 
Solution  Concentration 	  In its most general form, concentration describes the number of items in a given area or volume. The units generally depend on the types of items being counted. For example, if we were to calculate the concentration of people that live in a city, we would divide the total number of people by the area. If we measured the area in square miles, the units of concentration for this measurement would be people per square mile. Or, we could determine the concentration of fish in a lake by dividing the total number of fish by the volume of the lake. If we measure the volume in cubic meters, the concentration would have units of fish per cubic meter. To express the concentration of a solution, we can perform a similar calculation. The amount of solute is commonly measured in terms of moles, but it can also be measured by mass or by total number of particles. We can then divide this value by either the amount of solvent or the total amount of solution. These values may have units of mass, volume, moles, or number of particles. Depending on how each component is measured, we get different ways to measure concentration. In this lesson, we will learn about four different ways to describe the concentration of a solution: Each of these ways of describing concentration will be discussed further below. 
Molarity 	  The most common way to express the concentration of a solution is by determining its molarity. The molarity of a solution tells us how many moles of solute are present in each liter of solution. It can be calculated as follows: 
Molarity = mol solute L solution 	  Molarity has units of moles per liter (mol/L). Moles per liter is also given the abbreviated name molar (M). For example, a solution that contains 2 moles of solute in each liter of solution would be a 2 molar (2 M) solution. 
Example 16.8 	  What is the molarity (M) of a 3.4 liter sample of a solution that contains 0.32 moles of NaCl? Answer: 
Na Cl = 0.323mol  Na Cl.4  L	= 0.094  	  When indicating solution concentration in molarity, a bracket notation is often used. For instance, from the previous example we could write: 
Na Cl =0.094 	  This indicates a 0.094 M solution of sodium chloride. 
Making  Solutions of a  Specific  Molarity 	  To make a solution with a particular concentration of a given solute, the following procedure can be used: 
Example 16.9 	  You want to make a 0.154 M solution of sodium chloride (the approximate concentration of a standard saline solution). Describe how you would prepare 1.00 L of this solution. Answer: 
Step 1:  Calculate 	  The molarity of our solution is going to be 0.154 M, and the total volume will be 1.00 L. Plugging these values into the definition of molarity will allow us to calculate the necessary moles of solute. mol M = 
L mol =  	  = (0.154 M)(1.00 L) = 0.154 mol NaCl Because we will be measuring out NaCl by mass, we need to determine the mass of 0.154 moles of NaCl using its molar mass (58.44 g/mol). Step 2: Weigh out 9.00 g of NaCl and place it in a 1 L volumetric flask. Step 3: Fill the flask about halfway with water, and swirl until the NaCl is completely dissolved. Step 4: Add more water until the meniscus of the solution lines up with the calibration mark. Mix well. 
Molality 	  Another way to express the concentration of a solution is by determining its molality. The molality (m) of a solution tells us how many moles of solute are combined with each kilogram of solvent. Note that there are two differences between molarity and molality. Molality uses mass instead of volume, and we are looking at the amount of solvent instead of the total amount of solution. It can be calculated as follows: molality = moles solutekg solvent Molality is primarily useful for calculating certain physical properties of solutions, such as freezing point, boiling point, and vapor pressure. These will be discussed in the next lesson. 
Example 16.10 	  What would be the molality of a sugar solution in which 4.00 g C6H12O6 was dissolved in 1.00 L of water? Water has a density of 1.00 g/mL. Answer: molality = moles solutekg solvent We need to find the amount of solute (sugar) in moles and the mass of the solvent in kilograms. moles solute = 4.00 g C6H12O6 	0117 mol C6H12O6 kg solvent = 1.00 L H2O 10001 L HmL H2O	2	00 kg H2O Substituting these values into our molality expression, we get the following: molality = 0.01171.00 kg Hmol NaCl2O	= 0.0117 m 
Weight  Percent 	  Another way to express the concentration of a solution is by its weight percent. This is commonly used to describe stock solutions of things like acids and bases. Weight percent can be calculated by dividing the mass of a solute by the mass of the entire solution: 
Weight  Percent = grams of solutiongrams of solute 100% 	  A solution in which 9.3% of the mass is due to NaCl would be referred to as a 9.3% (w/w) NaCl solution. The presence of "(w/w)" indicates that the ratio is between the weight (mass) of the solute and the weight of the total solution. Other ratios in which one or both of the components are measured in terms of volume instead of mass are also common; these percentages are labeled as either weight/volume (w/v) or volume/volume (v/v). 
Example 16.11 	  What is the weight percent of a solution that has 9.01 g of NaCl dissolved in 1000. g of water? Answer: Grams of solution = grams of NaCl + grams of water = 9.01 g NaCl + 1000 g H2O = 1009 g solution 
Weight  Percent = 10099.01g solutiong  Na Cl 100% = 0.893% 	  This mixture could be described as a 0.893% (w/w) solution of NaCl in water. 
Parts  Per  Million 	  We can also express concentrations by dividing the number of particles of a certain solute by the total number of particles in a solution. These types of values are commonly used to describe small amounts of a substance in a complex mixture. Common units for this type of concentration are parts per million (ppm) and parts per billion (ppb). Lets say we have a sample of water in which Pb2+ is present at a concentration of 20 ppm. This would mean that if we randomly took a million particles from our solution, 20 of them (on average) would be Pb2+ ions. The rest would be mostly water molecules, with a possibility of the presence of various other ions. The maximum allowable concentrations of various toxic gases in the air or heavy metal ions in drinking water are often reported in units of ppm or ppb. If given information on aqueous solution concentration by ppm, these units can be converted to molarity or molality using the following conversion factor: This conversion is derived from the fact that ppm is really just a ratio between amount of solute and amount of solution. If you had a 1 ppm solution, this would indicate 1 g of solute per 1  106 g of solution. Assuming an aqueous solution density of 1 g/mL as is standard for water, this indicates 1 g of solute per 1  106 mL of solution, or 1 mg of solute per 1 L of solution. You can use this conversion unit and a similar conversion method for converting concentration from ppm or ppb. 
Dilutions 	  Many chemicals that we use on a daily basis are transported in a concentrated form but used in a more diluted form. For example, concentrated cleaners are often diluted before they are used. To perform a dilution, pure solvent is added to a concentrated solution in order to make a less concentrated (more dilute) solution. The resultant solution will contain the same amount of solute but a greater amount of solvent. It will therefore have a lower concentration than the original solution. When performing a simple dilution, the concentration and volume of the initial solution are related to the new concentration and volume as follows: 
M2 = final molarity,  V2 = final volume 	  This relationship holds true due to the fact that the moles of solute stays constant through a dilution process. 
Example 16.12 	  Answer: Determine the values of each variable in the dilution equation above, and then solve for the unknown variable. V1 = 50.0 mL, M1 = 0.40 M, V2 = 1000.0 mL, and M2 = ? Solving the above equation for M2 gives us the following: 
M1 V1 	  M2 = 
Lesson  Summary 	  The concentration of a solution can be expressed as the amount of solute present in a given amount of solvent or solution. The most common way to express the concentration of a solution is molarity, which is equal to moles of solute per liter of solution. Another way to express concentration is molality, which is equal to moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The ratio of solute mass to solution mass, when expressed as a percentage, is known as weight percent. The ratio of solute particles to the total number of particles in a solution can be expressed in units of parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). Concentrated solutions can be diluted by adding pure solvent. The concentration and volume of the initial solution are related to the new concentration and new volume by the equation M1V1 = M2V2.

Introduction 	  When a solute is dissolved in a liquid solvent to form a homogeneous solution, the behavior of the solution will often be different from that of the pure solvent. For example, the boiling point, freezing point, and vapor pressure of the solution will be different from that of the original solvent. The freezing point of salt water is lower than the freezing point of pure water, and the boiling point of a sucrose solution is higher than that of pure water. In this lesson, we will look at how to calculate the magnitude of these changes based on the concentration of the solution. 
Vapor  Pressure 	  As we saw when we studied States of Matter, the driving force for particles in the liquid phase to escape into the gas phase depends on both the temperature and identity of the substance. The vapor pressure of a liquid is a measure of this ability. Specifically, vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor that is in equilibrium with its solid or liquid phase. For substances with a stronger drive to enter the gas phase, more vapor particles will be present in the same amount of space, resulting in a higher pressure. At a given temperature, the vapor pressures of various liquids depends primarily on the strength of intermolecular attractions between individual particles. Figure 16.11 shows the relative vapor pressures of several different substances. 
Vapor  Pressure  Temperature  Curve 	  Overall, molecules that can participate in hydrogen bonding, such as acetic acid, tend to have lower vapor pressures at a given temperature than similarly sized molecules without the ability to hydrogen bond, such as acetone. 
Vapor  Pressure of  Solutions 	  The vapor pressure of a solution is lower than that of the pure solvent at the same temperature. This decrease in vapor pressure is one example of a colligative property. Colligative properties are properties of solutions that depend only on the concentration of dissolved particles and not on their identity. As we see in Figure 16.12, the vapor pressure of the solution is lower than the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. This phenomenon can be understood by considering the equilibrium between the liquid and the gas phases for a given solvent. When a pure solvent reaches equilibrium with its vapor, the liquid particles are escaping into the gas phase at the same rate as the gas particles are condensing into the liquid phase. If we add a non-volatile solute (one that does not escape into the vapor phase under standard conditions), the liquid becomes a mixture of solute and solvent particles. The surface will then be composed of solute particles in addition to solvent molecules, which slows the rate at which the liquid particles can evaporate due to fewer solvent molecules in contact with the liquid/vapor interface. However, it does not slow down the rate of condensation. As a result, there is a net shift into the liquid phase. Less solvent is present in its vapor form, so the resulting vapor pressure is lower. This effect is illustrated on the molecular level in Figure 16.13. This effect is quantified by Raoults law, which states that the vapor pressure of a solution is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure solvent multiplied by its mole fraction. Raoults law can be expressed mathematically as follows: 
P = ?solvent 	  where P is the vapor pressure of the solution, ?solvent is the mole fraction of the solvent, and P is the vapor pressure 
Vapor- Pressure  Lowering in  Solution 	  of the pure solvent. 
Mole  Fraction 	  The mole fraction (?) of a component in a mixture is equal to the number of particles of the specified component divided by the total number of particles in the mixture. Alternatively, this ratio can be expressed in moles. 
A = total molmol  	  or 
A = nntotal 	  Note that we are dealing with the total number of particles (or moles of particles), so we need to take the dissociation of ionic substances into account. If we dissolve one mole of NaCl in water, we would end up with two moles of independent particles (one mole of sodium ions and one mole of chloride ions). This information needs to be included in any mole fraction calculations. 
Example 16.13 	  Answer: nA A = ntotal nH2O = 2000. g H2O	= 111.0 mol H2O ntotal = 0.606 mol+111.0 mol = 111.6 mol 
Boiling  Point  Elevation 	  Recall that boiling occurs when the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Since adding a solute lowers the vapor pressure, we would expect a higher temperature to be required before boiling can begin. This phenomenon, known as boiling point elevation, occurs whenever a solute is dissolved into a pure solvent. The boiling point of a solution can be calculated using the following expression: ?Tb = kb mi where ?Tb is the increase in boiling point compared to the pure solvent, kb is the boiling point elevation constant for the given solvent, m is the molality (not molarity) of the solution, and i is the vant Hoff factor. 
Example 16.14 	  Eugenol, the active ingredient in cloves, has the formula C10H12O2. Eugenol is a molecular substance that does not dissociate into ions when dissolved in a solvent. What is the boiling point of a solution in which 0.144 g of eugenol is dissolved in 10.0 g benzene? The kb value for benzene is 2.53 C/m, and the boiling point of pure benzene is 80.1 C. Answer: ?Tb = kb mi The vant Hoff factor (i) for a non dissociating substance is 1, and the kb value for benzene is given, so we only need to calculate the molality of the solution. To do this, we need to determine the moles of the solute and the mass of the solvent in kilograms. molesC10H12O2 = 0.144 g C10H12O2	 mol C10H12O2 mass of benzene = 10.0 g benzene	0100 kg benzene molality	0100 kg benzenemol C10H12O2 = 0.0877 m ?Tb = 2.53 ?C/m0.0877 m1 = 0.222 ?C The boiling point is increased by 0.222 C compared to the pure solvent. Because the boiling point of pure benzene is 80.1 C, the boiling point of the solution would be 80.3 C. 
Freezing  Point  Depression 	  The addition of solute to a pure solvent affects not only the boiling point of the solution, but the freezing point as well. This phenomenon is called freezing point depression, and it can be calculated in essentially the same way as boiling point elevation: ?Tf = kf mi where ?Tf is the decrease in freezing point compared to the pure solvent, kf is the freezing point depression constant for the given solvent, m is the molality (not molarity) of the solution, and i is the vant Hoff factor. 
Example 16.15 	  Calculate the freezing point of a solution in which 5.00 g of biphenyl (C12H10) and 7.50 g of naphthalene (C10H8) are dissolved in 200.0 g of benzene. None of these substances dissociate into ions. The normal freezing point of benzene is 5.5 C, and its kf value is 5.12 C/m. Answer: ?Tf = kf mi We are given kf , and i is 1 for nondissociating substances. To determine the molality of the solution, we will need to know the total moles of solute and the mass of the solvent in kilograms. Because colligative properties like freezing point depression do not depend on the identity of the solute, it does not matter that we have two different types of solute molecules. molesC12H10 = 5.00 g C12H10	0324 mol C12H10 molesC10H8 = 7.50 g C10H8	0585 mol C10H8 mass of benzene = 200.0 g benzene	2000 kg benzene molality	0585 mol C10H8 = 0.455 m ?Tf = 5.12 ?C/m0.455 m1 = 2.33 ?C The freezing point will be lowered by 2.33 C. Subtracting this from the normal freezing point of benzene (5.5 C), this solution will freeze at 3.2 C. Values of kf and kb for some other common solvents are listed in the Table 16.3.

Lesson  Summary 	  The degree to which particles of a given liquid tend to escape into the gas phase is measured by the liquids vapor pressure. The vapor pressure of a solution is a colligative property, which means that it is affected only by the concentration of solute particles and not their identity. The vapor pressure of a solution is lower than the vapor pressure of the pure solvent (P <P). Raoults Law states that the vapor pressure of a solution is equal to the product of the vapor pressure of the pure solvent and the mole fraction of the solvent (P = ?solventP). The mole fraction of a component in a mixture (?) can be calculated by dividing the number of particles (or moles) of the component by the total number of particles (or moles) in the complete mixture. Adding a solute increases the boiling point of a pure solvent. This change can be calculated using the equation ?Tb = kb mi. Similarly, adding a solute decreases the freezing point of a pure solvent. This change can be calculated using the equation ?Tf = kf mi. relationship for

Thermochemistry 	  Energy is an integral component of chemical reactions. Some reactions require an input of energy, whereas others release energy as they proceed. When we burn propane, we are oxidizing small hydrocarbons by reacting them with oxygen. This reaction produces heat, which can be used to heat a barbeque for cooking or fill a balloon with hot air so it can soar over the countryside. In this chapter, we will focus primarily on the transfer of heat and energetic changes that occur during chemical reactions.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  What are the basic types of chemical reactions? What is energy? What is the law of conservation of energy? 
Introduction 	  Just as the burning of wood releases energy in the form of heat, many other chemical reactions also release heat. There are also chemical reactions, such as photosynthesis in plants, which absorb energy in the form of heat. The study of energy changes in chemical reactions is called thermochemistry. The broader term thermodynamics also looks at how heat, work, and various forms of energy are related to one another. In this lesson, we will study the difference between reactions that absorb versus release heat as well as how to measure this change in energy. 
Chemical  Energy and  Heat 	  There are two basic types of energy in the universe: potential energy and kinetic energy. Potential energy is stored energy that is available to do work, but it has not yet been released. The wood in a fireplace possesses potential energy. It is available for producing heat, but has not yet been ignited, so it is not releasing heat into the surrounding environment. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. A waterfall is an example of kinetic energy. The moving water can erode the rocks in the stream, wearing them down into smaller particles. This same water motion can turn a turbine to generate electricity. In both cases, the movement of the material (water) causes work to be done. Chemical energy, the energy stored in molecules and atoms, is one type of potential energy. Certain reactions can cause this energy to be released as heat. Other reactions require an input of energy, in which case the products will store more potential energy than the reactants. When we studied phase changes, we saw a relationship between energy and the state of matter. To melt a solid or boil a liquid, energy needs to be added in order to break up the intermolecular forces holding particles together in more ordered states. The reverse processes, condensation and freezing, release energy, because more favorable intermolecular interactions are formed. When we consider a chemical reaction, we need to take into account both the system and the surroundings. The system includes the components involved in the chemical reaction itself. These will often take place in a flask, a beaker, a test tube, or some other container. The surroundings include everything that is not part of the system. When potassium reacts with water, part of the heat energy generated in the reaction is released into the surroundings. The boundary between system and surroundings is arbitrary, and it is generally chosen in a way that makes observations and calculations easier. Depending on the specific setup, a few different types of systems can be described. In an open system, both matter and heat can be freely exchanged between the reaction container (the system) and the surroundings. An example would be an open beaker, where any gaseous materials or vaporized molecules are free to leave the system and float off into the atmosphere. In a closed system, matter cannot enter or leave, but heat can flow between the system and surroundings. A stoppered reaction flask would be an example of a closed system. Finally, a situation in which neither matter nor heat can be exchanged between system and surroundings is referred to as an isolated system. Although truly isolated systems are not really possible, a sealed, vacuum-insulated reaction flask would come very close. Closed system. Heat can be exchanged between the system and the surrounding environment, but matter cannot move from one part of the system to another. 
Exothermic and  Endothermic  Processes 	  Heat involves the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies that are at different temperatures. If you held a flask containing a reaction that releases energy, you would be able to feel the heat being transferred from the reaction into your hand. A process in which heat is released is referred to as exothermic. Conversely, reactions that absorb energy will remove energy from the surroundings, causing the container to feel cold. For example, dissolving ammonium nitrate in water will significantly lower the water temperature. Processes that absorb energy from their surroundings are called endothermic. For example, the reaction between potassium and water is very exothermic: Another exothermic reaction involves combining elemental sodium with chlorine: Endothermic reactions are also quite common. An example would be the splitting of water by electrolysis: We will explore the details of the energy changes that take place during exothermic and endothermic reactions later in this chapter. 
Calorimetry 	  The subfield of thermochemistry studies the energy changes that occur over the course of various chemical reactions. We will first look at how these changes are measured and then go into quantitative descriptions of heat transfer. Calorimetry is a term used to describe the measurement of heat transfers, usually by monitoring changes in the temperature of an isolated system. A calorimeter is a device used to measure temperature changes during chemical processes. The simplest type of calorimeter is the constant-pressure device illustrated in Figure 17.3. A basic calorimeter includes the following components: To use a calorimeter, the components of a reaction are placed in the inner container and mixed. As the reaction proceeds, the temperature change can be measured with the thermometer. The space between the inner and outer containers provides insulation to minimize heat loss. 
Units of  Heat 	  The SI unit for heat, and for any form of energy, is the joule. Officially, one joule is the amount of energy needed to move an object by one meter while exerting a force of one newton. Although this definition is based on the concept of work, we can also talk about the amount of heat (in joules) required to change the temperature of a given material by a specific amount. A related unit is the calorie. This term arose prior to the establishment of the SI system and is now replaced by the joule in most situations. One calorie is defined as the amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of one gram of water by 1C. One calorie equals 4.184 joules. Note that this calorie is not exactly the same as the calories listed on food products. One food Calorie (usually written with a capital C) is equal to 1000 regular calories. Thus, a 140-Calorie snack can be fully digested to produce 140,000 calories of energy. We will use the SI unit joules in our discussions of heat energy. 
Heat  Capacity and  Specific  Heat 	  We mentioned earlier that 4.184 joules (1 calorie) is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of liquid water by 1C. This value is known as the specific heat of liquid water, and it has units of J/gC. Other materials have different specific heat values. The Table 17.1 lists the specific heats of several substances: TABLE 17.1: 
Material 	  Specific Heat (J/gC) aluminum gold graphite diamond copper iron water (liquid) Note that the heat capacity of a substance depends on its state of matter. Except for water, all of the values in the Table 17.1 refer to the specific heat for the solid form of that substance. Also note that water has an unusually high heat capacity. Much more heat is needed to raise the temperature of water by a given amount than to cause the same temperature increase in an equal mass of graphite, diamonds, or various metals. A related term is heat capacity, which is defined as the amount of heat need to raise the temperature of a specified amount of material by 1C. Heat capacity can be calculated using the following formula: Heat capacity = mc where m is the mass of the material and c is the specific heat of the material. Heat capacity has units of J/C. We can calculate the amount of heat required to cause a specific temperature change by using the following equation: q = mc?T where q is the amount of heat added to the system, m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat of the substance, and ?T is the change in temperature. 
Example 17.1 	  How much heat is required to increase the temperature of a 150-gram block of aluminum by 42C? Answer: q = mc?T q = 150 g0.900 J/g? C42?C q = 5670 J 
Lesson  Summary 	  Chemical reactions essentially always involve a transfer of heat energy. Exothermic reactions release heat into their surroundings. Endothermic reactions absorb heat from their surroundings. Specific heat and heat capacity measure the amount of heat energy needed to change the temperature of a material by a given amount.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  What are endothermic and exothermic reactions? How is heat transfer measured? 
Introduction 	  One of the most fundamental scientific laws is that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. The first law of thermodynamics says that energy can be converted from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. This law is very difficult to prove, since we cannot measure the energy of the entire universe. However, we can measure energy changes as various physical and chemical processes occur, and this allows us to show that the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant. Our discussion in this lesson will focus on differences in energy between one state and another. 
Enthalpy 	  In the previous lesson, we looked at how heat transfers are measured. In practice, only changes in energy and heat can be measured; we cannot measure the "energy" of a substance or system by itself. For practical reasons, most reactions are run at a constant pressure, with the reaction vessel open to the external atmosphere. Enthalpy is an energetic concept that can be thought of as the internal heat content of a substance or system that is at a constant pressure. Technically, it is defined as follows: 
H =  E + 	  where H is the enthalpy of the system, E is the internal energy, P is the pressure, and V is the volume. It can be difficult to distinguish "heat" and "enthalpy." Heat measures the transfer of thermal energy between two objects, and enthalpy measures the flow of heat. When heat flows out of a system, the change in enthalpy is negative; when heat flows into a system, the change in enthalpy is positive. Enthalpy is a useful tool for characterizing chemical reactions. 
Enthalpy of  Reaction 	  Any chemical reaction can be written in the form reactants ? products. Although the enthalpy of an isolated component cannot be directly measured, the enthalpy change over the course of a chemical reaction can be measured. We can define the enthalpy of reaction as follows: ?Hreaction = Hproducts ?Hreactants The enthalpy of reaction allows us to determine if a given reaction is exothermic or endothermic. An exothermic reaction, in which heat is released by the reaction to the surroundings, has a negative ?H value. A plot of enthalpy vs. reaction progress would take the following form for an exothermic reaction: Energy profile of an exothermic reaction. The enthalpy of the reactants is greater than the enthalpy of the products. During the course of the reaction, heat is released to the surroundings. If a net input of heat is required for the reaction to proceed, then ?H is positive, and the reaction is endothermic. In an endothermic reaction, the reactants are lower in enthalpy than the products, which is why heat must be added to the system in order for the reaction to proceed. An enthalpy vs. reaction progress plot for an endothermic reaction would have the following form: 
Standard  Enthalpy of  Formation 	  Although we cannot directly measure the enthalpy content of a single substance, we can determine the enthalpy change that would be necessary to form a compound from its elements in their standard states at 25C. This value is referred to as the standard enthalpy of formation (?Hf ). The term standard heat of formation can be used interchangeably; although, heat and enthalpy are technically not the same quantity. These values are tabulated for a large number of substances, and knowledge of the ?Hf values for each component in a reaction allows you to predict the total enthalpy change for that reaction, as we will see in the following section. The standard states for most elements can be determined just by finding out what state of matter they are in at 25C, such as Ag(s), Hg(l), or Xe(g). However, some nonmetals have more complicated standard states. In particular, seven elements exist as diatomic substances in their standard states. H2(g), N2(g), O2(g), F2(g), Cl2(g), Br2(l), and I2(s) each represent the standard forms of these elements. Because standard enthalpy of formation values represent the change from elements in their standard state to a final substance, any element that is already in its standard state has a ?Hf value of 0. 
Calculations  Using  Thermochemical  Equations 	  The total enthalpy change for a reaction can be predicted using the following equation: ?Hrxn = ?n?Hf (products)??n?Hf (reactants) Essentially, if we add together the standard enthalpy of formation values for each product (multiplied by its coefficient in the balanced equation) and then subtract the ?Hf for each reactant (again, multiplied by their coefficients), we are left with ?H for the overall reaction. When performing enthalpy calculations, a few points need to be remembered: ?Hf values are generally given in kJ/mol, so we need to multiply each value by the total number of moles of each component in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation for any element in its most stable form at 25C is zero. The state of the compound must be noted so the correct enthalpy value can be used. For example, ?Hf is -285.8 kJ/mol for liquid water and -241.8 kJ/mol for water vapor. Keep close track of the signs of each value, since many ?Hf values are negative. The easiest way to explain this process is through an example problem. Lets consider the energy changes that occur during the combustion of methane gas: 
Example 17.2 	  Calculate the enthalpy of reaction for the following process: CH4(g)+2O2(g) ? CO2(g)+2H2O(l) You will need to make use of the following data: ?Hf for CH4(g) = -74.87 kJ/mol ?Hf for CO2(g) = -393.5 kJ/mol ?Hf for H2O(l) = -285.8 kJ/mol Answer: We are given ?Hf values for every reaction component except for O2(g). Because O2(g) is the standard form of elemental oxygen, it has a ?Hf value of zero. Now use the following equation: ?Hrxn = ?n?Hf (products)??n?Hf (reactants) = (?393.5 kJ/mol+2(?285.8 kJ/mol))?(?74.87 kJ/mol+0 kJ/mol) = ?965.1 kJ/mol?(?74.87 kJ/mol) = ?965.1 kJ/mol+74.87 kJ/mol = ?890.3 kJ/mol The enthalpy change that takes course during this reaction is highly negative, indicating a strongly exothermic reaction. This is consistent with what we know about the combustion of methane, the primary component in natural gas. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The first law of thermodynamics tells us that energy can be converted from one form to another but cannot be created or destroyed. When discussing energy changes for reactions that are run at a constant pressure, it is generally simpler to measure and tabulate changes in enthalpy (H), which can be thought of as the heat content of a system at constant pressure. The standard enthalpy of formation (?Hf ) for a substance is the enthalpy change that would be necessary to form that substance from its elements in their standard states at 25C. The enthalpy of a reaction can be calculated from ?Hf values for its various components using the following equation: ?Hreaction = ?n?Hproducts ??n?Hreactants.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  What phase transitions can a substance undergo? What are the energy requirements for achieving a change of state? 
Introduction 	  When your ice cream melts on a hot day, there is a change in internal energy as well as a change in enthalpy occurring. An enthalpy change also occurs when the moisture in the air condenses onto the cold windshield of a car. These changes of state can be described by the changes in enthalpy that accompany them. In this lesson, you will learn how to calculate and quantify changes of energy as related to changes of state. 
Summary of  Phase  Transition  Processes 	  (melting, vaporization, and sublimation) require an input of energy; they are endothermic. Processes in which attractive interactions are formed (freezing, condensation, and deposition) release energy, so they are exothermic. The amount of energy necessary to melt one mole of a substance is known as the molar heat of fusion. Similarly, the amount of energy necessary to vaporize one mole of a substance is referred to as the molar heat of vaporization. The values of these parameters are given for water in the following table, along with the specific heats exhibited by water in its solid, liquid, and gaseous forms. TABLE 17.2: 
Enthalpy  Value 	  molar heat of fusion (melting) solid ? liquid +6.0 kJ/mol molar heat of vaporization liquid ? gas +40.7 kJ/mol specific heat of ice specific heat of water specific heat of steam Notice that the process of freezing is the exact reverse of the process of melting, so the enthalpy change has the same magnitude but opposite sign. The same is true for the relationship between condensation and vaporization. Also note that the specific heat of water is dependent on the state of the material. Ice, liquid water, and steam all have different specific heat values. Remember that specific heat refers to the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of liquid water by 1C. 
Energy and  Changes of  State 	  We have already learned how to use specific heat to calculate the energy needed to change a material from one temperature to another within a given state. Now lets look at the energy changes required for changes of state. 
Example 17.3 	  How much energy is needed to convert 180 grams of ice at 0C to liquid water at the same temperature? Answer: The heat of fusion for water is 6.0 kJ/mol. First, we need to convert the mass of water to moles: We now can calculate the energy needed for the conversion: ?Hfus = 6.0 kJ/mol ?H = 10 mol H2O  = 60. kJ The portions that require calculating the energy associated with temperature changes will make use of the following equation: ?H = mc?T First, calculate the energy associated with the temperature change for ice: Second, recall from the previous problem that melting 180 grams of ice requires 60 kJ (60,000 J) of energy. Third, calculate the energy needed to change the temperature of the liquid water. Again, note that ice and liquid water have different specific heat values. Finally, add all of these energetic requirements together to find the energy needed for the entire change. Make sure that all values have the same units (J or kJ, but not both). ?H = 4,514.4 J+60,000 J+18,810 J = 83,324.4 J Rounded to the correct number of significant figures, this process would require the input of 83,000 J (83 kJ) of energy. Note that the enthalpy change is positive, indicating that we need to put energy into the system in order to achieve the desired transition. When going downhill from vapor to liquid or liquid to solid, we need to remember to change the sign for ?H. If we were to do the reverse process, cooling liquid water at 25C to ice at -12C, ?H would be -83 kJ, indicating that 83 kJ of energy would be removed from the system during this transition. 
Heat of  Solution 	  If you were to prepare a large solution of sulfuric acid in water, it would be wise to cool the container in which the mixing is taking place. The addition of a strong acid to water releases a great deal of heat (which is why it is better to add the acid to the water and not the water to the acid). The heat of solution for a substance tells us how much energy is absorbed or released when one mole of the substance is fully dissolved in a specific solvent. We will only consider heat of solution values for which water is the solvent, but other solvents would have different values for a given solute. The heats of solution for several common solutes are listed in the Table 17.3. In each case, assume that the solute is added to a large excess of water, so the solute dissolves completely. TABLE 17.3: 
Material 	  Heat of Solution (kJ/mol) H2SO4(l) -96.2 MgSO4(s) -91.2 CaCl2(s) -82.9 KOH(s) -56 NaOH(s) -44.3 NaCl(s) NaHCO3(s) KNO3(s) Some materials have negative heats of solution; the dissolution of one of these solutes in water is an exothermic process. Heat is released, causing a net increase in the temperature of the solution. Conversely, other substances have positive heats of solution. For example, the dissolution of potassium nitrate in water is an endothermic process. The resulting absorption of energy causes the solution to become colder. Calculations involving heats of solutions follow the same basic approach that we have used with other enthalpy problems. 
Example 17.5 	  How much heat would be absorbed or released if we completely dissolved 0.45 moles of sulfuric acid in water? Answer: Since the heat of solution for H2SO4 is negative, heat will be released during this process. The exact amount can be calculated as follows: ?H = 0.45 mol H2SO4  1 mol H?96.2 2kJSO4 = ?43 kJ If we wanted to know the temperature change that this would cause, we would need more information. 
Example 17.6 	  If we dissolved 0.45 moles of sulfuric acid in 1.0 liter of water at 25.0C, what would be the final temperature of the solution, assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings? Assume that the specific heat of the solution is the same as the specific heat of pure water. Answer: To answer this question, we will need to make use of the following equation: ?H = mc?T Solving for the unknown variable (?T), we get the following: ?T = m?Hc We already know that 43 kJ of energy will be released into the solution. Because the specific heat is in units of joules, not kilojoules, we will want to use the value 43,000 J instead so that the units cancel out. The specific heat of the solution is assumed to be the same as that of pure water (4.18 J/gC). Now, we need to find the mass of the solution. At 25C, 1.0 L of water has a mass of 1.0 kg (1,000 g). The mass of the sulfuric acid can be calculated as follows: Therefore, the total mass of the solution would be 1,044 grams. Plugging these values into the above equation, we get the following temperature change: 
 	  The final temperature of the solution would be 34.9C, which is 9.9C higher than the initial temperature of 25.0C. These principles are applied when we use heat packs or cold packs for sore muscles. A heat pack contains water and a solid such as calcium chloride or magnesium sulfate. When the pack is activated, the two materials mix and heat is released. This is because the heats of solution are negative indicating an exothermic reaction. Some packs can get as warm as 90C. Cold packs use materials such as ammonium nitrate, which has a large positive heat of solution. The endothermic mixing process can cool the solution down to just a few degrees Celsius. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Specific heat and heat capacity provide information about enthalpy changes when the temperature of a substance is altered but no changes of state take place. Molar heats of fusion and vaporization allow calculations of energy changes involving a phase transition. Combinations of the above parameters can be used to calculate total energy changes for transitions that involve both temperature changes and changes of state. Heat of solution data provides information about enthalpy changes that occur when a solute dissolves in a solvent.

Introduction 	  If you wished to travel from Memphis, Tennessee (home of the blues) to Nashville, Tennessee (home of country music), there are several available routes. You could take Interstate 40 east to Nashville, which would be a very direct route. You might want to head north on Interstate 55 to visit Cape Girardeau, Missouri before you turn onto U.S 61, and then Interstate 24 would take you to Nashville. Or you may decide to go south to Birmingham, Alabama on Interstate 22 before turning left on Interstate 65 to head back north to Nashville. Whatever the route chosen, all the different alternatives still take you to Nashville. The amount that you have driven depends on your route, but the overall distance between your starting point and your destination is independent of the path that you took. In this lesson, you will see that the energetics of a chemical reaction can be thought of in a similar way. 
Hesss  Law 	  In the 19th century, the Swiss-born Russian chemist Germain Hess (1802-1850) developed a law of heat summation, often referred to as Hesss Law. This law states that the enthalpy change between a set of reactants and a set of products will be the same, regardless of the number of reactions or steps that take place in between the two states. In other words, the overall enthalpy change does not depend on how you got from start to finish. The specific path leading to the formation of the different B products from A reactants does not influence the overall enthalpy change. ?H1 = ?H2 + ?H3 = ?H4 + ?H5 + ?H6 
Indirect  Method for  Determining the  Standard  Heat of  Formation 	  In the previous lesson, we made use of standard heat of formation values. Although the energy changes can sometimes be measured directly when a compound is generated from its constituent elements in their standard forms, many such reactions are difficult or unfeasible. An alternative way to measure the standard heat of formation is to measure the enthalpy changes for a series of reactions that result in the same net change. The general rules for manipulating thermochemical equations are as follows: In general, we are given a set of equations with known ?Hrxn values, and by reversing or multiplying each equation by some factor, we can add them all together to give us the desired transformation. This can be shown most easily through an example. Example 17.7 We want to determine ?Hf for NO2(g), but the formation reaction shown below is difficult to measure directly: 
O ? k J/mol 	  However, we can measure the enthalpy changes for the following two reactions: 
O2(g) ?  O	? H? = 56 k J/mol 	  Use these values to determine the standard heat of formation for NO2(g). Answer: We would like to manipulate the two known reactions so that when they are added together and we cancel the common terms (the compounds that appear on both the reactant and product sides), the net result is our desired transformation. In the desired reaction, nitrogen and oxygen gases are reactants, and NO2(g) is a product. If we reverse the second known equation, NO2(g) will be a product. When reversing the direction of a chemical reaction, the magnitude of the enthalpy change stays the same, but the sign is reversed. 
O  O2(g) ? H? = ?56 k J/mol 	  Now we can add the two reactions: ?H?f = 90 kJ/mol 
O	? H? = ?56 k J/mol 	  The ?H value for this transformation is the sum of the two simpler reactions. The final equation can also be simplified. The NO cancels out, because it is on both sides of the equation, leaving only the desired transformation: 
O	34 k J/mol 	  Note that the enthalpy change for any transformation can be determined in this way; this method can be used for more than just finding heat of formation values. 
Example 17.8 	  What is ?Hrxn for the following reaction? CS2(l)+3O2(g) ? CO2(g)+2SO2(g) The following formation reactions have known ?H values: C(s)+2S(s) ? CS2(l) ?Hf = 87.9 kJ/mol C(s)+O2(g) ? CO2(g) ?Hf = ?393.5 kJ/mol S(s)+O2(g) ? SO2(g) ?Hf = ?296.8 kJ/mol Answer: Which components of the first known equation are part of the desired reaction? Carbon and sulfur are not involved in the desired transformation, but one molecule of CS2 is present as a reactant. If we reverse the first equation, we get the following: 
S2(l) ?  C(s)+2 S(s) ? H = ?87.9 k J/mol 	  Now, look at the second equation. A single molecule of CO2 is present as a product, which is what we want for our final equation. Since CO2 does not show up in any of the other equations, we can assume that this equation will be used as is: 
C(s)+ O2(g) ?  O2(g) ? H = ?393.5 k J/mol 	  Finally, look at the third known equation. It has a single molecule of SO2 as a product. However, we need two molecules of SO2 on the product side, so we multiply the entire equation, including its ?H value, by a factor of two: Now, add these three equations together: CS2(l) ? C(s)+2S(s) ?H = ?87.9 kJ/mol C(s)+O2(g) ? CO2(g) ?H = ?393.5 kJ/mol ?H = ?593.6 kJ/mol CS2(l)+1O2(g)+C(s)+2S(s) ? CO2(g)+2SO2(g)+C(s)+2S(s) ?H = ?1075.0 kJ/mol One mole of carbon and two moles of sulfur appear on both sides of the equation. Cancelling out these terms, we2are left with the desired reaction: 
Lesson  Summary 	  Hesss law states that the enthalpy change for a given transformation depends only on the initial and final states, and not on how many stages or steps are taken in between. Standard enthalpies of formation can be calculated indirectly using the ?Hrxn values for reactions that are easier to measure directly.

Chapter  Outline 	  The cars roar around the oval track at speeds up to 200 miles/hour. The victor is determined by who crosses the finish line first after a pre-determined number of laps have been driven. Speed is a major factor in winning, but there is also a heavy dose of strategy, driving skill, and some luck in avoiding crashes. Drag racing involves one basic issue: who can get to the finish line the fastest. The strip is a quarter-mile in length and is straight. Driving skill is important and luck always plays a role. In drag racing the car with the fastest acceleration has an advantage, but top speed is also important. The Top Fuel category (running on nitromethane) record is over 330 miles per hour at the finish line (thats from a standing start and a quarter-mile distance). Speed is important both on the track and in the chemistry lab. We want to know how fast a reaction occurs for several reasons. The reaction rate can give us useful information about how the reaction occurs. In a manufacturing plant, if the speed of a reaction can be increased, the chemical product can be made in less time, which often means a lower manufacturing cost.

What do energy versus reaction progress graphs look like for exothermic and endothermic reactions? 
Introduction 	  In our discussion of car racing, we talked about the speed of the vehicles. Car speed is measured in miles/hour (or kilometers/hour in countries using the metric system). A race car traveling at a speed of 200 miles/hour could go a distance of 200 miles in one hour. A rate indicates the extent of some change in relation to the amount of time that has passed. The rate of travel for a car or other object tells us what distance is traversed in a given unit of time. If we know the total distance traveled and the total time taken, we can calculate the rate as follows: 
Rate = ?distance?time 	  Rates can also be expressed for changes in variables other than physical location. In this lesson, you will learn how to use rates to describe chemical reactions. What is a Rate? When studying chemical reactions, we are interested in how quickly the amount or concentration of a given reactant or product changes over time. This is known as the reaction rate. Mathematically, the reaction rate can be expressed by either of the following equations: ?[reactant] Rate = ? ?time ?[product] Rate = ?time Because the concentrations of the reactants decrease over time, the negative sign in the first equation above means that the reaction rate will be a positive value. 
Example 18.1 	  The initial concentration of a given reactant is 0.45 M. After two minutes, its concentration is measured and found to be 0.35 M. What is the rate of this reaction? Answer: Use the appropriate rate equation and fill in the given values: ?[reactant] Rate = ? ?time c(final)?c(initial) Rate = ? t(final)?t(initial) ?0.10 M Rate = ? 
Rate = 0.05  M/min 	  The concentrations of reactants and products are always measured in moles/liter (M) when discussing reaction rates. For real reactions, we also need to consider the coefficients from the balanced equation. For example, in the reaction 2A ? B, the rate of disappearance of A is twice the rate of formation of B, as can be inferred from the stoichiometric coefficients. The rate of product formation can be expressed as follows: 
Rate = ??[ Bt ] 	  However, the rate of disappearance of reactant A is twice the rate of formation of product B. We want to end up with the same reaction rate value regardless of which reaction component is being considered. In order to achieve this, we need to write each rate with respect to the coefficient on the corresponding reaction component. In the basic reaction formula above, we have determined that the rate of disappearance of reactant A is twice the rate of formation of product B. This means that the rate expression above for the product B is equivalent to the following in terms of the reactant A: 
Rate 	  By accounting for the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation, these two rates are equal and we can also say the following: ?[B]	?[A] ?tt 
Collision  Theory 	  Collision theory states that chemical reactions occur when atoms, ions, or molecules collide. In other words, these species need to make contact with one another in order for a reaction to take place. Based on this concept, along with a couple of other key points, collision theory helps to explain why certain factors will influence the rate of a chemical reaction. We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed. However, not all collisions between reactant molecules will result in the formation of a product. The colliding particles must possess a minimum amount of energy in order for the reactant-product transition to occur. In the Thermochemistry chapter, we saw that simple exothermic reactions have an energy diagram that looks something like Figure 18.2. Although the overall process involves a release of energy (the products are lower energy than the reactants), a certain initial amount of energy needs to be present before the reaction can occur. The amount of energy required to get over the "hump" in the reaction diagram is referred to as the activation energy of the reaction. At the top of the peak, the reactants form what is known as an activated complex. The activated complex is the highest energy state that must be achieved in order for reactants to convert into products. In the Figure 18.3, the starred compound in the center represents the activated complex. For the indicated transformation, the reactant molecules must come into contact with enough energy to partially break the A-B and C-D bonds that are initially present. If the molecules are simultaneously able to partially form the A-C and B-D bonds in the product, the energetic barrier will not be quite as high, but breaking any chemical bonds requires at least an initial input of energy. 
Factors  Affecting  Reaction  Rate 	  Several factors influence the rate at which a reaction proceeds. Many of these effects can be predicted and rationalized using the basic concepts of collision theory. 
Concentration 	  Collision theory tells us that molecules need to collide in order for a reaction to take place. All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction. One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products. 
Pressure 	  If the pressure of a gaseous mixture is increased by decreasing the available volume, we are effectively pushing the same amount of material into a smaller overall volume. In other words, we are increasing the concentration of the gaseous materials. As we just discussed, an increase in concentration leads to more frequent collisions, thus increasing the rate of reaction. Note that increasing the external pressure on liquids and solids, which are relatively incompressible, has very little effect on the reaction rate. The volume will be decreased very little, if any, so no significant increase in concentration will result from the pressure change. 
Temperature 	  As the temperature of a system increases, the average speed of its particles also increases. If particles are moving faster, they cover more distance in a shorter amount of time, which increases the frequency of collisions. As a result, the rate of any potential reaction is increased. Effect of temperature on reaction rate. Additionally, there is another way in which increasing the temperature will increase the rate of a reaction. Fundamentally, the temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its individual particles. Recall that a collision will only lead to a reaction if the colliding reactants have enough energy to overcome the activation barrier. Increasing the average kinetic energy of the reactants makes it more likely that any given collision will result in a transformation from reactants to products. For example, the reaction of wood with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water is a very exothermic reaction. The excess energy is released as heat and light, which we experience as fire. However, wood can be stored in the air almost indefinitely without bursting into flames. In order for wood to burn, enough energy needs to be added to overcome the initial activation energy barrier. This can be accomplished by increasing the temperature of a small amount of the wood, often by exposing it to another source of flame or the focused rays of the sun. Once the reaction begins, the energy given off by the exothermic combustion process heats the surrounding wood, thus providing the necessary activation energy for continued burning. 
Surface  Area 	  Many reactions take place in solution or in the gas phase, where the reactants are evenly dispersed throughout a homogeneous mixture. However, for reactions in which one of the reactants is a pure solid or liquid (meaning that this reactant is not already mixed together with any other reactants), reactivity only occurs at the surface, where particles of the solid or liquid reactant come into contact with particles of the other reactants. All of the molecules or ions in the interior of the pure substance will not be colliding with the other necessary reactants, so they are not really contributing to the overall rate of the reaction. However, increasing the surface area will increase the frequency of potentially reactive collisions, because more reactant particles will be in contact with the other necessary reactants. For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur. 
Catalysts 	  A catalyst is a material that speeds up the rate of a reaction without being consumed by the reaction. For example, the following reaction is very slow, even when heated: However, adding a tiny amount of manganese dioxide (MnO2) to a solution of potassium chlorate (KClO3) results in a dramatic increase in the rate at which oxygen gas is produced. At the end of the reaction, the manganese dioxide can be recovered. This is because it is not actually used up in the reaction, but merely facilitates the reaction. A catalyst works by providing a lower energy pathway from reactants to products. The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier. Another example of a catalytic process is the reaction between an alkene (a carbon-carbon double bond) and hydrogen gas. Due to the details of how covalent bonds are broken and formed, a simple collision between these two molecules will not result in the formation of a product. In the absence of a catalyst, very high energy intermediates, which involve the complete breakage of an H-H single bond, would be required for this process to occur. Because of the very large activation energy required, this uncatalyzed reaction would only occur in extremely high temperatures. However, the addition of a metal catalyst, such as platinum, provides a lower energy pathway. The energy requirements for breaking the H-H bond are offset somewhat if each hydrogen atom can form a new bond with the metal surface. Then, collisions between the alkene and the metal-hydrogen complex result in the formation of a product. The metal surface is regenerated after the hydrogen atoms are removed, so it is not used up by the reaction, but it increases the rate by stabilizing the high energy hydrogen atoms. Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere. Because these catalysts contain expensive metals (rhodium costs about $70.00/gram, platinum about $50.00/gram, and palladium about $15.00/gram), the theft of catalytic converters is a growing problem. A stolen catalytic converter can be sold for over $100.00 at a junk yard. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The rate of a reaction tells us how quickly the reactants are transformed into products. It can be expressed as the change in the concentration of a given reactant or product over a certain length of time. Collision theory states that chemical reactions occur when reactants collide with enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. The activated complex is the highest energy state that must be passed through in order for reactants to be transformed into products. The activation energy of a reaction is the amount of energy necessary to form the activated complex from the initial reactants. Several factors affect the rate of a chemical reaction, including concentration, pressure (for gases), temperature, surface area (for solids and liquids), and the presence of a catalyst. All of these factors can be rationalized by the basic ideas of collision theory. A catalyst increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed. It accomplishes this by providing a lower energy pathway from reactants to products, thus decreasing the activation energy barrier.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  What do we mean by the rate of a reaction? How does the concentration of a reactant affect the rate of a reaction? 
Introduction 	  Imagine when you are hungry at the beginning of a meal. A large plate of food is set in front of you, and you start eating quickly. As you become full, you start eating more slowly. Or, maybe you start off eating slowly and the food is so delicious that you start eating more rapidly. The rate at which you eat may be changing throughout the meal based on your level of satisfaction. The rate of chemical reactions can be thought of in a similar way, as these rates do not necessarily stay constant over time. In this lesson, you will learn how to use initial rates and experimental data to determine rate laws. 
Initial  Rate of  Reaction 	  If we were to graph the concentration of a reactant over time in a given reaction, we might get a plot that looked something like Figure 18.9. For a given portion of the curve, the rate of disappearance is equal to the slope at that point. Because the curve is not linear, it has different slopes at different points. This means that the rate of reaction changes over the course of the reaction. As the reactant is used up, its concentration decreases, resulting in a slower rate for any subsequent reactivity. It is often difficult to monitor the exact concentrations of each reactant in the middle of an ongoing reaction. However, much more precise measurements can be made regarding the concentration of each reactant before they are mixed and the reaction is allowed to proceed. To record more reliable data about the extent to which the rate of a given reaction depends on the concentration of a specific reactant, we often look at the initial rate of reaction, which is the rate of product formation (or reactant disappearance) that occurs directly after the reactants have been mixed. In those first few seconds, we can assume that the concentrations of each reactant are essentially equivalent to the amounts that were originally added to the reaction mixture. Additionally, if the presence of the product alters the rate of reaction, this effect is minimized when there is little to no product in the mixture, further simplifying our analysis of the data. When studying the kinetics of a reaction, what do we measure? The easiest parameter to look at is product formation. If we start at a concentration of zero, we can measure the amount of product present after a short period of time, and the concentration of product divided by the time elapsed gives us the initial rate of reaction. Measuring the disappearance of a reactant is also possible. However, the change in the concentration of the product is often easier to measure, because it is a much larger change based on percentage. For example, in the generic reaction A ? B, lets say we start with 1.000 M A and 0 M B. If we allow the reaction to proceed for a very short period of time, we might have 0.998 M A and 0.002 M B. The difference between 0 M and 0.002 M is generally easier to measure accurately than the difference between 1.000 M and 0.998 M. 
Rate  Laws 	  So far, we have been assuming that most reactions occur by a very simple process, in which all the necessary reactants collide, and products are formed if the collision is sufficiently energetic. However, most reactions are much more complicated than that. Except for the most basic reactions, several simpler steps, each of which involves a single collision, are required to get from reactants to products. This sequence of steps, known as the reaction mechanism, will be covered in the next lesson. We have also assumed that increasing the concentration of any reactant will increase the overall rate of reaction. However, the extent to which this is true, and whether it is true for all reactants, depends on the reaction mechanism. What we can say is that the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to some exponent. Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows for the generic reaction A + B ? C. 
Rate ? [ A]x[ B]y 	  Alternatively, we can express this as an equation: Rate = k[A]x[B]y where k is a proportionality constant known as the rate constant. In general, a larger rate constant is indicative of a faster reaction. The exponents for an unknown reaction cannot be predicted simply by looking at the chemical equation. Instead, they must be determined experimentally by comparing initial rate data for multiple sets of initial concentrations. 
Determining  Rate  Laws  Experimentally 	  Consider the reaction between nitrogen monoxide gas and hydrogen gas to form nitrogen gas and water vapor. The rate law for this reaction will have the following form: 
Rate = k[ O]x[ H2]y 	  In order to determine the exponents in this equation, the following data were collected at a set temperature and pressure: 
Experiment 	  [NO] (M) [H2] (M) Initial Rate (M/s) Notice that the starting concentrations of NO and H2 were varied in a specific way. In order to compare the rates of reaction and determine the exponent associated with each reactant, the initial concentration of each reactant must be changed while the other is held constant. Comparing experiments 1 and 2: the concentration of NO was doubled, while the concentration of H2 was held constant. Doubling the concentration of NO quadrupled the initial reaction rate (5.00  10?5/1.25  10?5 = 4). Therefore, the exponent associated with the concentration of NO must be 2. In other words, Rate ? [NO]2. Because 22 = 4, doubling the value of [NO] increases the rate by a factor of four. Comparing experiments 2 and 3: the concentration of H2 was doubled while the concentration of NO was held constant. Doubling the concentration of H2 doubled the initial rate of the reaction (1.00  10?4/5.00  10?5 = 2). Therefore, the exponent associated with the concentration of H2 is 1 (Rate ? [H2]1). Because 21 = 2, doubling the value of [H2] also doubles the reaction rate. The overall rate law incorporates both of these results into a single equation: 
Rate = k[ O]2[ H2] 	  Note that exponents of 1 are generally not included, since [A]1 = [A]. Based on the exponents associated with each concentration, we would say that this reaction is second-order with respect to NO and first-order with respect to H2. The overall reaction order is the sum of the individual reaction orders, or the sum of all exponents in the rate law. You can see that this would be a third-order reaction overall. Additionally, now that we know the form of the rate law, we can plug in data from any of the experiments to determine the value of k for this reaction under the conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) at which the data was measured. Using the data from experiment 1: 
Rate = k[ O]2[ H2] 	  s k = 250 M2 s Lets consider another hypothetical reaction of the form A + B ? C + D. Under a certain set of conditions, the following data were collected: TABLE 18.2: 
Experiment 	  [A] (M) [B] (M) Initial Rate (M/s) Comparing experiments 1 and 2, we see that doubling the concentration of A while holding [B] constant doubles the rate. Therefore, this reaction is first-order with respect to A (Rate ? [A]1). Plugging this into our generic rate law, we get the following: 
Rate = k[ A]x[ B]y 	  Rate = k[A]1[B]y Rate = k[A][B]y Next, we can compare experiments 2 and 3, in which [A] is constant but [B] is doubled. This change does not affect the overall reaction rate. We can conclude that the rate of the reaction is independent of the concentration of reactant B. How can we express this in terms of the exponents of the rate law? Recall that any value raised to the 0th power is equal to 1 (x0 = 1). To completely remove a concentration from the rate law, we could set its exponent equal to zero: 
Rate = k[ A] 	  We say that this reaction is zero-order with respect to reactant B. Overall, this is a first-order reaction. Although other exponents are possible, most reactions are zero-, first-, or second-order with respect to each reactant. Again, the values of the exponents generally cannot be predicted and must be determined experimentally. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The initial rate of reaction is the rate at which the reaction proceeds directly after mixing the reactants. At this point, the concentrations of the reactants have not changed appreciably and the concentrations of the products are negligible. The rate law for a given reaction expresses the reaction rate as the product of a rate constant and the concentration of each reactant raised to some exponent. The exponents in a rate law, referred to as the order of each reactant, must be determined experimentally, usually by comparing initial rates for multiple combinations of starting concentrations.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  How do we measure reaction rate? What does the order of a reaction tell us? 
Elementary  Steps 	  The overall balanced equation for a chemical reaction does not always tell us how a reaction actually proceeds. In many cases, the overall reaction takes place in a series of small steps. An elementary step (or elementary reaction) is one step in a series of simple reactions that show the progress of a reaction at the molecular level. In terms of collision theory, each elementary step corresponds to a single collision. A reaction mechanism is the sequence of elementary steps that together comprise an entire chemical reaction. As an analogy, consider the route that you might take while driving to the grocery store. That route may consist of several turns, similar to the elementary steps. The overall reaction specifies only the beginning point (your house) and the final destination (the store), with no information about the specifics in between. Understanding the mechanism of a reaction can be very useful, because this knowledge often gives us insights into how to improve the reaction, get better yields, or make the reaction proceed more rapidly. Additionally, many seemingly different reactions often have very similar reaction mechanisms. Understanding the types of elementary steps that are common to many different chemical species allows us to make predictions about the reactivity patterns of unknown compounds. The reaction mechanism concept can be illustrated by the reaction between nitrogen monoxide and oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide: It may seem as though this reaction would occur as the result of a collision between two NO molecules and one O2 molecule. However, a careful analysis of the reaction has detected the presence of N2O2 during the reaction. A proposed mechanism for this reaction consists of two elementary steps: Step 1: 2NO(g)? N2O2(g) Step 2: N2O2(g)+O2(g)? 2NO2(g) In the first step, two molecules of NO collide to form a molecule of N2O2. In the second step, that molecule of N2O2 collides with a molecule of O2 to produce two molecules of NO2. The overall chemical reaction is the sum of the two elementary steps: 
N2 O2 	  The N2O2 molecule is not part of the overall reaction. It was produced in the first elementary step, then reacts in the second elementary step. An intermediate is a species that appears in the mechanism of a reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. An intermediate is always formed in an earlier step of the mechanism and then consumed in a later step. 
Molecularity 	  The molecularity of an elementary step is the total number of reactant molecules in that step. In both steps of the reaction mechanism shown above, two reactant molecules collide with one another. These are both bimolecular reactions. Notice that the colliding molecules may be the same (as in step 1 above) or different (as in step 2 above). A unimolecular reaction is one in which only one molecule is present as a reactant. If we think about this in terms of collision theory, we would expect a unimolecular reaction to take place when the reactant molecule collides with either the wall of the container or molecules of solvent. The substance with which the reactant collides does not participate in the reaction, but it provides the necessary energy to cause whatever rearrangement or bond breakage is required for the given step. A termolecular reaction involves three reacting molecules in one elementary step. Termolecular steps are relatively rare, because they require the simultaneous collision of three molecules with sufficient energy and the correct orientation to form an activated complex, which is an extremely unlikely event. When termolecular reactions do occur, they tend to be very slow. The vast majority of elementary steps are either unimolecular or bimolecular. 
Rate  Laws and  Mechanisms 	  In general, we cannot predict the rate law for a chemical reaction by looking at its balanced equation, because the rate law for a multi-step reaction depends on the reaction mechanism. In contrast, we can predict the rate law for an elementary step. Consider the following unimolecular step: 
A ? products 	  Because it occurs in a single elementary step, the rate of product formation will increase linearly with the concentration of A, making the rate of this reaction first-order with respect to A. 
Rate = k[ A] 	  A bimolecular elementary step could be one of two types. Either a molecule of A could react with a molecule of B or two molecules of A could react with each other. In either case, the rate of reaction depends on how frequently the collisions between reactant molecules occur. 
A+ B ? products 	  rate = k[A][B] rate = k[A]2 The reaction order for each reactant in an elementary step is equal to its stoichiometric coefficient in the equation for that step. In the first equation above, each coefficient is a 1, and so the reaction is first-order with respect to A and first-order with respect to B. In the second equation, the coefficient of 2 means the reaction is second-order with respect to A. 
Rate- Determining  Steps 	  The determination of a reaction mechanism can only be made in the laboratory. When a reaction occurs in a sequence of elementary steps, the overall reaction rate is governed by whichever one of those steps is the slowest. The ratedetermining step is the slowest step in the reaction mechanism. To get an idea of how one step is rate-determining, imagine driving on a one-lane road where it is not possible to pass another vehicle. The rate of flow of traffic on such a road would be dictated by whatever car is traveling at the lowest speed. Consider the reaction mechanism presented in the previous section: Step 1: 2NO(g)? N2O2(g) Step 2: N2O2(g)+O2(g)? 2NO2(g) Lets say that the first step is much slower than the second step. If this is true, the rate of the overall reaction would be completely determined by the speed at which the first elementary step proceeds. As soon as it is formed, the N2O2 intermediate would immediately be consumed by the (much faster) second step. What is the rate of the first step? Because it is an elementary step, we can predict its rate law based on the balanced equation. An elementary step in which the reactants consist of two molecules of NO(g) would have the following rate law: 
Rate = k[ O]2 	  If we have correctly identified the mechanism of this reaction and chosen the correct rate-determining step, this will also be the rate of the overall reaction: If the experimentally determined rate law for this reaction does not match the one predicted by the proposed mechanism, then the mechanism (or the choice of rate-determining step) is incorrect. However, if the two rate laws do match, we cannot necessarily say that we have found the correct mechanism, because there is always more than one mechanism that can be proposed for any given rate law. Thus, the experimentally determined rate law can invalidate or provide support for a proposed mechanism, but it cannot prove that the mechanism is correct. In general, the rate law for a mechanism can be predicted based on the form of the rate-determining step. However, the analysis gets more complicated when a step other than the first step is rate-determining. This is due to the fact that intermediates in a reaction are not directly included in the rate law. For the purposes of this book, you will not be required to predict the rate law for any multi-step reactions unless the first step is the rate-determining step. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A reaction mechanism describes the series of elementary steps by which the reactants are transformed into the products. The number of reactant molecules in an elementary step is referred to as its molecularity. The vast majority of elementary steps are unimolecular or bimolecular. Unlike the rate law for a multi-step reaction, the rate law of an elementary step can be predicted from its balanced equation. The rate-limiting step is the slowest step in a mechanism. The rate of the overall reaction is directly dependent on the speed of the rate-determining step. The experimentally determined rate law can rule out incorrect mechanisms but cannot prove that a mechanism is correct.

Chapter  Outline 	  When dissolved in water, cobalt chloride produces a reddish-pink solution. The introduction of additional chloride ions causes a shift from a fully hydrated cobalt cation ([Co(H2O)6]2+(aq)) to a new complex ([CoCl4]2? (aq)). This is accompanied by a change in color, from reddish-pink to blue. The green solution shown in the figure above is a third type of cobalt complex. The equilibrium between the two complexes is sensitive not only to the concentration of the chloride ion, but also to the temperature. Increasing the temperature causes a shift from the pink to the blue species, and lowering the temperature reverses this color change. So far, we have generally assumed that the reactants in a chemical reaction are irreversibly transformed into products. However, many chemical reactions are reversible, meaning that it is also possible for the reaction to go "backwards". When both the forward and reverse reactions can proceed at a reasonable rate, a state of equilibrium is eventually reached, in which both reactions are occurring at the same rate and no net change is made to the amounts of reactants or products. In this chapter, we will look at the factors that govern chemical equilibria. User:Chemicalinterest/Wikimedia Commons. commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cobalt_chloride_equilibrium.JPG. Public Domain.

Introduction 	  We have not always known that some chemical processes are reversible. In fact, not long ago, it was widely thought that chemical processes were irreversible. For instance, the dissolving of table salt into water was viewed as a unidirectional process; once the salt dissolved, it could not be undissolved from the solution. Dissolution reactions were therefore viewed as irreversible processes. However, in the early 1800s, the Frenchman Claude Lois Berthollet (1748-1822) observed a dissolution reaction that appeared to be reversible. Berthollet was a chemist hired by Napoleon to travel to Egypt during what later became known as the Battle of the Pyramids (1798). One day, Berthollet observed crystals of sodium carbonate (also known as trona) that had formed along one of the ponds he was visiting. Trona is a mineral composed of hydrated sodium carbonate, Na2CO310H2O, that is often found crystallized with other salts. Berthollet was struck by this occurrence, because the double displacement reaction that often occurred in the salt-rich natron ponds was expected to produce only calcium carbonate and sodium chloride, not sodium carbonate. Na2CO3(aq) +CaCl2(aq) ? CaCO3(s) +2NaCl(aq) Berthollet suggested that the presence of Na2CO3 meant that this double displacement reaction was actually reversible. Na2CO3(aq) +CaCl2(aq)  CaCO3(s) +2NaCl(aq) The reversibility of this reaction would explain how the reactants and products could all be present at the same time. 
Equilibrium in  Chemical  Reactions 	  Consider the following generic chemical equation: 
A+ B  C+ 	  At the beginning of the reaction, only the reactants A and B are present. Recall that over the course of a reaction, the reaction rate slows down. This is because the rate depends on the concentrations of one or more reactants. As the reactants are used up, their concentrations drop, thus decreasing the reaction rate. At the same time, the concentrations of the products, C and D, are increasing from their initial concentrations of zero. For the reverse reaction, C and D are the reactants, so the rate of the reverse reaction will increase as more C and D are present. As the reaction progresses, the rate of the forward reaction decreases, and the rate of the reverse reaction increases. Eventually, these two rates will be equal. In other words, the rate at which the products are formed is equal to the rate at which they are consumed, so no net change is taking place. A reaction has reached chemical equilibrium when the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction. After equilibrium has been reached, the concentrations of all reaction components will remain constant unless a change is made to the system. Because the concentrations are no longer changing, it may appear that the reaction has "stopped." This is incorrect; both the forward and reverse reactions are still going on, even at equilibrium. However, because the two reactions are proceeding at the same rate, no net change is observed. 
The  Law of  Mass  Action 	  Consider again a generic reversible reaction in which reactants A and B react to form products C and D. This equilibrium is shown below, where the lower case letters represent the coefficients of each substance. aA+bB  cC+dD Lets assume that this reaction occurs by a single elementary step. If that were the case, the rate law for the forward reaction would have the following form: 
Rateforward = kf [ A]a[ B]b 	  where the concentrations of each reactant, indicated by the square brackets around the formula, are measured in molarity units (mol/L). Similarly, the rate law for the reverse reaction can be written using the concentrations of C and D (the reactants for the reverse process): 
Ratereverse = kr[ C]c[ D]d 	  In a reaction at equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. Mathematically, this means the following: 
Rateforward =  Ratereverse kf [ A]a[ B]b = kr[ C]c[ D]d 	  kf	[C]c[D]d = kr	[A]a[B]b The ratio of the two rate constants would just be another constant. This new constant, written as Keq, Kc, or simply K, is known as the equilibrium constant for this reaction. The equilibrium constant expression has the following form: [C]c[D]d 
Keq = [ A]a[ B]b 	  We derived this expression based on reactions that occur by a single elementary step. However, it turns out that the equilibrium constant expression is valid for any reaction, even those that occur by a multi-step mechanism. For any reaction at equilibrium, the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations (along with the appropriate exponents) is equal to a constant. This is known as the law of mass action. 
Example 19.1 	  Write the equilibrium constant expression for the following reaction: Answer: The products go in the numerator, and the reactant goes in the denominator. Any component that has a coefficient in the balanced equation is raised to that power in the equilibrium constant expression. [SO2]2[O2] Keq =	[SO3]2 
Heterogeneous  Equilibria 	  So far, we have been assuming that a decrease in the amount of a reactant or product also decreases its concentration. This is true for gases, where the concentration is equal to the number of moles divided by the volume of the container. Because the container generally does not change size over the course of the reaction, fewer moles of gas means a lower concentration. This is also true for substances that are dissolved in water or another solvent. Assuming the volume of the solvent does not change appreciably during the reaction, fewer moles of solute in the same amount of solvent results in a lower concentration. However, for solid or liquid reaction components, this is not necessarily true. Consider the following reaction: NH4CO2NH2(s)  2NH3(g)+CO2(g) The "concentration" of a solid is essentially another way of measuring its density. A certain number of moles are present for a given volume of the solid, and this value does not depend on how much of the solid is present. As the reaction proceeds, the amount of solid reactant will decrease, but so will the volume it occupies. A similar argument can be made for liquids. As a result, the concentrations of solids and liquids are essentially constant over the course of a reaction. Now, lets look at the equilibrium constant expression that could be generated for this reaction. Following the rules that we have given so far, it would take the following form: [NH3]2[CO2] 
Keq = [ H4 O2 H2] 	  However, because the concentration of solid ammonium carbamate is constant during the reaction, we could potentially simplify this expression as follows: (Keq)[NH4CO2NH2] = [NH3]2[CO2] Keq0 = [NH3]2[CO2] where Keq is the product of the original equilibrium constant and the constant concentration of the solid reactant. By convention, the simpler form is used by chemists. Whenever solid or liquid reactants or products are part of a chemical reaction, their concentrations are not included in the equilibrium constant expression, and it is understood that the constant concentration of the missing reaction components is incorporated into the value of any measured equilibrium constants. 
Example 19.2 	  Write the equilibrium constant expression for the following reaction: Answer: Because both Mg and MgO are present as solids, they are not included in the equilibrium constant expression. The only remaining component is oxygen gas. Because oxygen is a reactant, it will appear in the denominator. 
Concentration vs.  Partial  Pressure 	  Lets take a look at one way in which the ideal gas law can be rearranged. We are most familiar with the following form: 
V = n 	  Dividing both sides by volume and rearranging the variables, we could also write this law as follows: P = (RT)(Vn ) What is the significance of this? Take a look at the fraction on the right. We are dividing the amount of gas (in moles) by the volume (in liters). The fraction n/V is simply the concentration of the gas. At a given temperature, the partial pressure of any gas is directly proportional to its concentration. Because of this, we can write an alternate equilibrium constant expression in which partial pressures are used in place of concentrations. The pressure-based equilibrium constant, indicated by the abbreviation Kp, can be written as follows for a generic reaction in which all components are present in the gas state: aA(g)+bB(g)  cC(g)+dD(g) (PC)c(PD)d 
Kp = ( A)a( B)b 	  For reactions that include solids or liquids in addition to gases, those components are left out of the equilibrium constant expression, just as they are for a concentration-based equilibrium constant. For reactions that include both gases and aqueous components, the Kp form of the equilibrium constant is generally not used. Example Problem 19.3 Write the pressure-based equilibrium constant expression (Kp) for the following reaction: The process here is exactly the same as for a normal equilibrium constant expression, except that we are using partial pressures instead of concentrations. Reactants go in the denominator, and products go in the numerator. Each component is raised to an exponent that is equal to its coefficient in the balanced equation. 
Converting  Between  Kc and  Kp 	  For a gaseous substance, the conversion factor between concentration and partial pressure can be derived from the ideal gas law: 
V = n 	  nA PA = (	)(RT) 
 	  PA = [A](RT) where [A] is the molar concentration of A. Lets look again at the generic expression for Kp: aA(g)+bB(g)  cC(g)+dD(g) (PC)c(PD)d 
Kp = ( A)a( B)b 	  If we substitute in concentrations for each of the partial pressures, we would get the following: ([C](RT))c([D](RT))d 
Kp = ([ A]( T))a([ B]( T))b 	  [C]c[D]d	(RT)c(RT)d 
Kp = [ A]a[ B]b  ( T)a( T)b 	  The fraction on the left is simply the generic expression for Kc. Additionally, the exponents in the fraction on the right can be manipulated as follows: Kp = Kc(RT)(c+d)?(a+b) The exponent (c+d)?(a+b) is the sum of the stoichiometric coefficients for the gaseous products minus the sum of the coefficients for the gaseous reactants. This value is sometimes abbreviated as ?n. Note that ?n can be a negative or positive number. Using this abbreviation, the conversion factor between Kp and Kc can be written as follows: 
Lesson  Summary 	  At equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction. The ratio between the concentrations of the products and the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to the appropriate exponent, is constant at a given temperature. This is referred to as the equilibrium constant. By convention, only gaseous and aqueous reaction components are included in the equilibrium constant expression, since solids and liquids do not change concentration when they are consumed or formed. The partial pressure of an ideal gas is proportional to its concentration. Kp is an alternate way to express the equilibrium of a reaction that includes gaseous components.

Introduction 	  Under normal conditions, NO2 is in equilibrium with its dimeric form, N2O4. N2O4 is also quite toxic, but it is colorless. This equilibrium can be written as the following chemical equation: Once this reaction reaches equilibrium, will the material exist mostly as NO2, mostly as N2O4, or as an approximately even mixture? To answer this question, we would need to determine the equilibrium constant for this reaction at the temperature of interest. The brown color is from nitrogen dioxide gas. Nitrogen dioxide is a byproduct from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal and gasoline. 
Calculating  Equilibrium  Constants 	  Experiments are very useful for determining equilibrium constants for various reactions. We are going to give a simple example of an experiment that could be done to determine the equilibrium constant for this reaction. The equilibrium constant expression for the reaction above has the following form: 
Kc = [[ N2 O2]42] 	  In order to calculate the value of Kc, we need to determine the concentrations of both the reactant and the product for any system that has reached equilibrium. One possible method for achieving this is as follows: First, we would put a known amount of our reactant (NO2) into a rigid container of fixed volume. Remember: The equilibrium constant expression only applies for a specific constant temperature, so we want to keep the temperature consistent throughout course of the reaction. Most equilibrium constants are given for a standard temperature of 25C. After putting our reactant into the container, we would allow the system to reach equilibrium. We know that the system is at equilibrium once the concentrations of each component are no longer changing over time. Because N2O4 is colorless but NO2 is brown, the concentration of NO2 can be determined by colorimetry, which relates the amount of visible light absorbed by a given sample to its concentration. Once at equilibrium, we will determine the concentration of the remaining NO2, and the concentration of N2O4 can be calculated by knowing the total amount of material present in our reaction vessel. Finally, these values can then be plugged into the equilibrium constant expression to determine the value of the equilibrium constant. 
Example 19.4 	  Answer: First, write the equilibrium constant expression for the given equation: 
Kc = [[ N2 O2]42] 	  We are given the equilibrium concentration of NO2, so now we need to find the concentration of N2O4. This can be accomplished by setting up a table that compares the initial and equilibrium amounts of each reaction component. This type of table is often called an ICE table, where ICE stands for initial, change, equilibrium. Start by drawing out a blank table for the given reaction: 
E 19.1:  Example 19.4  E  Table  Initial  Setup 	  N2O4(g) 
Equilibrium amount 	  Then, fill in the known information: 
E 19.2:  Example 19.4  E  Table  	  N2O4(g) 
Equilibrium amount 	  ICE tables are often written in units of concentration. The values that we are using in this table have units of moles. We are able to use moles rather than concentration because the reaction vessel is a rigid 1-L container, so the number of moles is actually equal to the concentration (0.200 mol = 0.200mol/ 1-L = 0.200 M). As long as the total volume of the container does not change over the course of the reaction, using either moles or concentration is an acceptable way to set up this type of problem. Because we are starting with no product, we know that the amount of product will increase and the amount of reactant will decrease before an equilibrium is reached. Therefore, we can add the following information: 
E 19.3:  Example 19.4  E  Table  	  N2O4(g) 
Change 	  -2x mol +x mol 
Equilibrium amount 	  x mol These numbers are related to the coefficients from the balanced equation. If the amount of N2O4 increases by x moles, the amount of NO2 must decrease by 2x moles. Because we know the initial and equilibrium amounts of NO2, we can solve for x: x = 0.0898 mol At equilibrium, our reaction mixture contains 0.0204 moles of NO2 and 0.0898 moles of N2O4. Because the reaction is taking place in a 1-L container, the concentrations of these two components will be 0.0204 M and 0.0898 M, respectively. Plugging these values into the equilibrium constant expression, we get the following: [N2O4] 
Kc = 2.16103 	  The equilibrium constant for this reaction has a value of 2.16  103 for the temperature at which these data were collected. Now we will consider a different experiment in which we start with the product of this reaction (as written above), but no reactant: 
Example 19.5 	  Again, we are given the equilibrium concentration of NO2, so now we need to find the concentration of N2O4. Start by setting up an ICE table, including any known information: 
E 19.4:  Example 19.5  E  Table  Initial  Setup 	  N2O4(g) 
Equilibrium amount 	  Because we are starting with no reactant, we know that the amount of reactant will increase and the amount of product will decrease before an equilibrium is reached. Therefore, we can add the following information: 
E 19.5:  Example 19.5  E  Table  	  N2O4(g) 
Change 	  +2x mol -x mol 
Equilibrium amount 	  Using the information given for the final amount of NO2, solve for x: Then, use the value of x to determine how much N2O4 is present at equilibrium: At equilibrium, our reaction mixture contains 0.01966 moles of NO2 and 0.83517 moles of N2O4. Because the reaction is taking place in a 1-L container, the concentrations of these two components will be 0.01966 M and 0.83517 M, respectively. Plugging these values into the equilibrium constant expression, we get the following: [N2O4] 
Kc = 2.16103 	  Again, the equilibrium constant for this reaction has a value of 2.16  103. The measured equilibrium constant for a given reaction at a set temperature is always the same, regardless of whether we start with all reactants, all products, or some combination of the two. Even though the final concentrations depend on the initial conditions (the final concentrations are different in the previous two example problems), the ratio defined by the equilibrium constant expression will have the same value once the system reaches equilibrium. This shows that the equilibrium constant is the same for any given chemical reaction at a specified temperature, regardless of the initial amounts of reactants and products. 
Interpreting the  Value of an  Equilibrium  Constant 	  What does the value of Kc tell us about the relative position of the equilibrium? Lets look at the results of the previous example problem. At equilibrium, we had a product concentration of 0.83517 M and a reactant concentration of 0.01966 M. Because there are more products than reactants at equilibrium, we say that this reaction is product-favored at the given temperature. Similarly, reactions in which the reactants are more prevalent than the products at equilibrium are said to be reactant-favored. How can we tell whether a reaction is product-favored or reactant-favored without actually calculating equilibrium amounts? Remember that in the equilibrium constant expression, the product concentrations are in the numerator, whereas the reactant concentrations are in the denominator. In a product-favored equilibrium, the value of the numerator would be much larger than the value of the denominator, so Keq >1 means that the products are favored over the reactants. Conversely, a Keq <1 would suggest that the reactants are favored over the products. Finally, a Keq value that is approximately equal to 1 means that significant amounts of both the reactants and the products are present at equilibrium. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The equilibrium constant is a ratio that describes the relative equilibrium concentrations of products and reactants for a given chemical process. An equilibrium constant can be determined from experimental data. Equilibrium constants allow us to predict the relative amounts of reactants and products for a given chemical process. The equilibrium constant depends on the temperature at which the reaction is taking place, but it does not depend on the initial (pre-equilibrium) concentrations of the reactants and products.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  Le Chteliers Principle: States that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established.

Introduction 	  So far you have learned about what chemical equilibrium means and how to calculate an equilibrium constant for a reaction based on reaction rate and reactant component concentrations. In order to establish chemical equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions change until they become equal. In this lesson, you will learn how a chemical reaction maintains equilibrium when a stress is put on the system. 
Le  Chteliers  Principle 	  Equilibrium represents a balance between the reactants and the products of a chemical reaction. Changes to the conditions of the system can disturb that equilibrium. When this occurs, the system reacts in such a way as to restore the equilibrium. However, the position of equilibrium will be changed following the disturbance. In other words, the response of the system involves a change in the amounts of the reactants and products. Some will increase and some will decrease until equilibrium is reestablished. Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Chtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Chteliers principle. This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. 
A *)  	  forward: A ? B [A] decreases; [B] increases 
A *)  	  reverse: A ? B [A] increases; [B] decreases 
Concentration 	  A change in the concentration of one of the substances in an equilibrium system typically involves either the addition or the removal of one of the reactants or products. Consider the Haber-Bosch process for the industrial production of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gases: N2(g)+3H2(g)*) 2NH3(g) If the concentration of one substance in a system is increased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that consumes that substance. When more N2 is added, the forward reaction will be favored because the forward reaction uses up N2 and converts it to NH3. Initially, the forward reaction speeds up because one of the reactants is present at a higher concentration, but the rate of the reverse reaction is unaffected. Since the two rates are no longer equal, the system is no longer at equilibrium, and there will be a net shift to the right (producing more NH3) until the two rates are once again balanced. The concentration of NH3 increases, while the concentrations of N2 and H2 decrease. After some time passes, equilibrium is reestablished with new concentrations of all three substances. As can be seen in Figure 19.5, the new concentration of NH3 is higher than it was originally, because the forward reaction became temporarily favored due to the stress. The new concentration of H2 is lower. The final concentration of N2 is higher than it was in the original equilibrium, but lower than it was immediately after the addition of N2 that disturbed the original equilibrium. By responding in this way, the value of the equilibrium constant for the reaction, Keq, does not change as a result of the stress to the system. Conversely, if more NH3 were added, the reverse reaction would be favored. This favoring of a reaction means temporarily speeding up the reaction in that direction until equilibrium is reestablished. Recall that once equilibrium is reestablished, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are again equal. The addition of NH3 would result in a net increase in the formation of the reactants, N2 and H2. An equilibrium can also be disrupted by the full or partial removal of a reactant or product. If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH3 will be produced. The concentrations of N2 and H2 decrease. Continued removal of NH3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either N2 or H2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored, and the concentration of NH3 would decrease. The effects of changes in concentration on a system at equilibrium are summarized in Table 19.7. 
Response 	  addition of reactant forward reaction favored TABLE 19.7: (continued) 
Response 	  addition of product reverse reaction favored removal of reactant reverse reaction favored removal of product forward reaction favored The Haber-Bosch process is an equilibrium between the reactants (N2 and H2) and the product (NH3). When more N2 is added, the system favors the forward reaction until equilibrium is reestablished. 
Temperature 	  Increasing or decreasing the temperature of a system at equilibrium is also a stress to the system. The equation for the Haber-Bosch process is written again below, this time as a thermochemical equation. 
N2(g)+3 H2(g) *) 2 H3(g)+91 k 	  The forward reaction is the exothermic direction; the formation of NH3 releases heat. The reverse reaction is the endothermic direction; as NH3 decomposes to N2 and H2, heat is absorbed. An increase in the temperature of a system favors the direction of the reaction that absorbs heat, or the endothermic direction. Absorption of heat in this case is a relief of the stress provided by the temperature increase. For the Haber-Bosch process, an increase in temperature favors the reverse reaction. The concentration of NH3 in the system decreases, while the concentrations of N2 and H2 increase. Conversely, a decrease in the temperature of a system favors the direction of the reaction that releases heat, or the exothermic direction. For the Haber-Bosch process, a decrease in temperature favors the forward reaction. Therefore the concentration of NH3 in the system increases, while the concentrations of N2 and H2 decrease. For changes in concentration, the system responds in such a way that the value of the equilibrium constant, Keq, is unchanged. However, a change in temperature shifts the equilibrium and changes the value of Keq. As discussed in the previous section, values of Keq are dependent on the temperature. When the temperature of the system for the Haber-Bosch process is increased, the resultant shift in equilibrium towards the reactants means that the Keq value decreases. When the temperature is decreased, the shift in equilibrium towards the products means that the Keq value increases. Le Chteliers principle as related to temperature changes can be illustrated easily by the equilibrium between dinitrogen tetroxide and nitrogen dioxide. N2O4(g)+heat *) 2NO2(g) Dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) is colorless, while nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is dark brown in color. When N2O4 breaks down into NO2, heat is absorbed according to the forward reaction above. Therefore, an increase in the temperature of the system will favor the forward reaction, while a decrease in temperature will favor the reverse reaction. By changing the temperature, the equilibrium between colorless N2O4 and brown NO2 can be manipulated, resulting in a visible color change. The video below shows three sealed glass tubes containing N2O4 and NO2. When one tube is placed in hot water, the equilibrium favors the brown NO2. When another tube is placed in ice cold water, the equilibrium lies in favor of the colorless N2O4. URL (0:55) 
Pressure 	  Changing the pressure of an equilibrium system in which gases are involved is also a stress to the system. A change in the pressure on a liquid or a solid has a negligible effect. We will return again to the equilibrium for the HaberBosch process. Imagine the gases are contained in a closed system in which the volume of the system is controlled by an adjustable piston as shown in Figure 19.6. (A) A mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia in equilibrium. (B) When the pressure is increased on the equilibrium mixture, the forward reaction is favored because that results in a reduction of the total moles of gas present. (C) Fewer moles of gas will exert a lower total pressure, so the stress is partially relieved by such a shift. On the far left, the reaction system contains primarily N2 and H2, with only one molecule of NH3 present. As the piston is pushed inwards, the pressure of the system increases according to Boyles Law. This is a stress to the equilibrium. In the middle image, the same number of molecules are now confined to a smaller space, so the pressure has increased. According to Le Chteliers principle, the system responds in order to relieve the stress. In the image on the right, the forward reaction has been favored, in which each one molecule of N2 combines with three molecules of H2 to form one molecule of NH3. The overall result is a decrease in the number of gas molecules in the entire system. This decreases the pressure and counteracts the original stress of a pressure increase. When the pressure is increased by decreasing the available volume, system responds by favoring the reaction direction that produces fewer gas molecules. In this case, it is the forward reaction that is favored. A decrease in pressure on the above system could be achieved by pulling the piston outward, increasing the container volume. The equilibrium would respond by favoring the reverse reaction, in which NH3 decomposes to N2 and H2. This is because the overall number of gas molecules would increase, and so would the pressure. When the pressure of a system at equilibrium is decreased by providing more total volume, the reaction that produces more total moles of gas becomes favored. This is summarized in the Table 19.8. 
Response 	  pressure increase reaction produces fewer gas molecules pressure decrease reaction produces more gas molecules Like changes in concentration, the Keq value for a given reaction is unchanged by a change in pressure. It is important to remember when analyzing the effect of a pressure change on equilibrium that only gases are affected. If a certain reaction involves liquids or solids, they should be ignored. Calcium carbonate decomposes according to the equilibrium reaction: CaCO3(s)*) CaO(s)+O2(g) Oxygen is the only gas in the system. An increase in the pressure of the system has no effect on the rate of decomposition of CaCO3, but it speeds the reverse reaction by forcing the oxygen molecules closer together, causing a net shift to the left. When a system contains equal moles of gas on both sides of the equation, pressure has no effect on the equilibrium position, as in the formation of HCl from H2 and Cl2. H2(g)+Cl2(g)*) 2HCl(g) It should also be noted that increasing the pressure by the addition of an inert gas (nonreactive gas) has no effect on the equilibrium. This can be thought of in terms of the pressure-dependent equilibrium constant (Kp). Unlike an increase or decrease in the volume of the container, the addition of an inert gas does not affect the partial pressures of any reaction components. Because the ratio of partial pressures is still equal to the equilibrium constant, no change is necessary to maintain equilibrium. 
Use of a  Catalyst 	  Since a catalyst speeds up the rate of a reaction, you might think that it would have an effect on the equilibrium position. However, catalysts have equal effects on the forward and reverse rates, so for a system that is already at equilibrium, these two rates remain equal. A system will reach equilibrium more quickly in the presence of a catalyst, but the equilibrium position itself is unaffected. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Le Chateliers principle describes how a chemical system responds to stresses in order to reestablish equilibrium. Changes in the concentrations of reactants or products will cause a reaction to shift left or right in order to reestablish an equilibrium position. These changes do not change the value of Keq. Changes in temperature will change the value of Keq. The direction of the change depends on whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic. When the pressure of a system is changed by changing the volume of the container, reactions in which some components are in the gas phase may shift to reestablish equilibrium. Changing the pressure by adding an inert gas does not affect a system at equilibrium. Adding a catalyst speeds up the progression of the reaction towards equilibrium, but does not change the equilibrium position itself.

Chapter  Outline 	  The two paintings above represent two distinct movements in twentieth-century abstract art. Pollock was a proponent of abstract expressionism, mainly a post-World War II development. He was well-known for his drip paintings, where paint is dripped or poured on the canvas. Mondrian was strongly influenced by the earlier Cubist movement, which was characterized by extensive use of geometric forms. We can see the high level of disorder in Pollocks work, generated by random activity. On the other hand, the paintings by Mondrian represent a high level of structure and order. The world we live in has aspects of order and disorder. We see order in the regular crystalline structure of solid sodium chloride and disorder in the random spattering of raindrops on a sidewalk. We also can observe changes in the amount of random movement exhibited by a single substance. For example, ice is highly ordered; each molecule of water is held rigidly in place by a network of hydrogen bonds. As the ice melts, the molecules gain more freedom of movement. They still cluster together into a liquid, but the individual molecules are free to move past one another and exchange hydrogen bonding partners. As the water vaporizes, its movement becomes even less restricted. No longer bound by intermolecular interactions, each molecule of water is free to move in essentially any direction. In this chapter, we will be discussing the concept of entropy, which quantifies order and disorder as pertains to chemical processes. Left: Image copyright Lauren Jade Goudie, 2014.

Introduction 	  Have you ever wondered why it is easy to let your bedroom get messy, but much more difficult to keep it neat? When your bedroom is neat and orderly, everything is in a place where it belongs. When its messy, everything seems to be out of order. Its as if youre bedroom naturally becomes messy, but you have to make an effort to keep it neat. Physical and chemical processes can be thought of in a similar way. There is a natural tendency for a physical or chemical process to progress in a certain direction. In this lesson, you will learn about the quantity used describe orderliness and how to predict the reaction direction in physical and chemical processes. What is a Spontaneous Process? Chemists want to be able to predict the outcome of reactions. They would like it to be possible to predict what will happen when reactants are added together under a given set of conditions. The conditions of a reaction might include things like temperature, pressure, and concentrations of various reaction components. If the given conditions favor the formation of products, the reaction is said to be spontaneous. It should be noted that just because a process is spontaneous does not mean that it occurs quickly. The rusting of iron is a spontaneous process that takes place over a long period of time. The combustion of gasoline in oxygen (also a spontaneous process) is extremely fast when provided with a spark, but gasoline can be stored in air for quite a while without spontaneously combusting. Thermodynamics predicts the direction in which a reaction will eventually proceed, but it does not tell us anything about the rate at which the reaction occurs. The rate of a reaction depends on many factors, including activation energy, temperature, concentration, and the presence or absence of a catalyst. Chemical kinetics focuses on the pathway between reactants and products, while thermodynamics considers only the difference between the initial and final states. We know of many examples of processes that occur spontaneously. If the temperature is below 0C, a glass of liquid water will freeze. If the temperature is above 0C, a cube of ice will melt. A hot object will gradually lose heat to its surroundings. Many chemical reactions also occur spontaneously. Two molecules of hydrogen will react with one molecule of oxygen to form water, releasing a significant amount of energy in the process. The spontaneous reaction between aluminum and bromine to form aluminum bromide also releases energy. Melting ice in the Beaufort Sea off the North Slope of Alaska. However, a process does not need to be exothermic in order to be spontaneous. For example, the melting of ice is an endothermic process, but it is still spontaneous at high enough temperatures. If we add ammonium nitrate to water, it will spontaneously dissolve, but the resulting solution will be cooler, indicating that energy in the form of heat was consumed in the process. To determine whether a process is spontaneous, we need to look not only at the change in enthalpy, but also the change in a factor called entropy. What Is Entropy? At its most basic level, entropy (S) is a measure of probability. States that have a high probability of occurring by random chance have a high entropy value, and states that are unlikely to occur by random chance have a low entropy value. There is a natural tendency for things to increase in entropy over time. An equivalent statement is that nature will spontaneously move toward the states that have the highest probability of existing. Entropy can also be thought of as the number of possible arrangements that lead to a certain state. The more ways that a given state can be achieved, the greater the probability of finding that state, and the higher its entropy value. For example, think about the objects in your bedroom. Imagine every item being randomly placed at some location within the room. Now imagine this happening again and again. How many of the resulting arrangements would lead you to classify your room as "messy?" How many would qualify as a "clean" room? In this hypothetical example, every state has an equal possibility of happening, but because there are so many more ways to arrange items to make a messy room than a clean room, the "messy" state would have a higher entropy value than the "clean" state. There are many examples in the chemical world of changes in entropy. Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid. 
The  Second  Law of  Thermodynamics 	  Recall that, according to the first law of thermodynamics, the total amount of energy in the universe is conserved for any given process. Entropy is not conserved; in fact, it is always increasing. Nature is constantly moving from less probable states to more probable ones. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of the universe will increase for any spontaneous process. To determine whether a given process is spontaneous, it is often helpful to break down the total entropy change as follows: ?Suniv = ?Ssys + ?Ssurr where ?Ssys and ?Ssurr represent the changes in entropy that occur in the system and in the surroundings, respectively. To predict whether a given reaction will be spontaneous, we need to know the sign of ?Suniv. If ?Suniv is positive, the entropy of the universe increases, and the reaction is spontaneous in the direction that it is written. If ?Suniv is negative, the reaction is spontaneous in the reverse direction. If ?Suniv is equal to zero, the system is at equilibrium. To predict whether a reaction is spontaneous, we need to determine the entropy changes in the system and in the surroundings. Entropy of a System (?Ssys) Lets consider the change of state for one mole of water from liquid to gas: H2O(l) ? H2O(g) In this case, the water is the system, and the surrounding are everything else. How does the entropy of the water change in this process? As we saw earlier, the vaporization process leads to an increase in entropy, because there are many more possible ways to arrange the individual water molecules when they are allowed to move freely about their container. The entropy of the system increases, so ?Ssys will be a positive value. Phase changes are one type of process for which we can reliably predict the sign of the change in entropy. Not all transformations are quite so obvious, but the direction of the change in entropy can be easily predicted for certain types of chemical reactions. For example, consider the following reaction: Three moles of gaseous reactants combine to make two moles of gaseous products. Therefore, we would expect this process to result in a decrease in entropy. ?Ssys will have a negative value for this reaction. For example, if we mix silver nitrate with sodium chloride, we have the following reaction: AgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) ? NaNO3(aq) + AgCl(s) The ions from the aqueous components are free to move around the entire solution, but the silver and chloride ions in the solid AgCl are all clustered together into a precipitate, ordered into a specific pattern of alternating cations and anions. Overall, this transformation represents a decrease in the entropy of the system. This makes sense when we think about the arrangements available. Consider the following reaction: C(s) + O2(g) ? CO2(g) Each side of this equation contains one mole of gas particles, so that will not be a deciding factor. However, there are more total particles on the reactants side than on the products side. Because there are more ways to arrange two moles of particles than one mole of particles, this process represents an overall decrease in entropy. So far, we have been thinking about entropy in terms of the ways in which particles can be distributed over a certain amount of space. However, other factors that are subject to random distributions also make contributions to the entropy of a system. As you know, an increase in temperature means that there is more overall kinetic energy available to the individual particles. This energy is distributed randomly through enormous amounts of collisions between particles. Having more energy available means that there are more ways that it can be distributed, so an increase in temperature also corresponds to an increase in entropy. Entropy of the Surroundings (?Ssurr) In general, the process of interest is taking place in the system, and there are no changes in the composition of the surroundings. However, the temperature of the surroundings does generally change. Entropy changes in the surroundings are determined primarily by the flow of heat into or out of the system. In an exothermic process, heat flows into the surroundings, increasing the kinetic energy of the nearby particles. For an exothermic reaction, ?Ssurr is positive. Conversely, heat flows from the surroundings into the system during an endothermic process, lowering the kinetic energy available to the surroundings and resulting in a negative value for ?Ssurr. As it turns out, the amount of entropy change for a given amount of heat transfer also depends on the absolute temperature. We will not go into the exact derivation, but it turns out that the entropy change of the surroundings can be defined in terms of the enthalpy change of the system: ?H ?Ssurr = ? Tsys where T is the temperature in Kelvin. For an exothermic reaction, ?Hsys is negative, so ?Ssurr would be a positive value. This makes sense, because heat is being released into the surroundings, increasing the amount of kinetic energy available to the surrounding particles. For an endothermic reaction, ?Hsys is positive, so ?Ssurr would be a negative value. Entropy of the Universe (?Suniv) Substituting this into our earlier equation for ?Suniv, we get the following: ?Suniv = ?Ssys +?Ssurr ?Hsys ?Suniv = ?Ssys ? 
 	  This is a particularly useful equation, because it allows us to determine whether a process is spontaneous by looking only at the system of interest. It also helps to explain why not all exothermic reactions are spontaneous, and not all reactions that increase the entropy of the system are spontaneous. The enthalpy change, entropy change, and overall temperature all factor into whether a given transformation will proceed spontaneously. 
The  Third  Law of  Thermodynamics 	  When we discussed enthalpy, we always talked about changes in enthalpy, never about the absolute enthalpy of a substance. Even the standard enthalpy of formation value (?Hf ) is a measure of the change in enthalpy between a compound and its elements in their standard states. There is no absolute zero for enthalpy, but this is not true for entropy. The third law of thermodynamics says that a perfectly regular crystal at a temperature of 0 K (absolute zero) would have an entropy value of 0. As the temperature of a perfect crystal increases, its particles start to vibrate slightly around their optimal positions, thus increasing the entropy of the system. The dependence of entropy on temperature varies by substance, so the only temperature at which all crystals have the same entropy is absolute zero. The standard entropy of a substance is a measure of its entropy at 25C and 1 atm of pressure. Like standard enthalpy of formation values, standard entropies are tabulated for a wide range of substances. However, unlike enthalpy of formation values, all standard entropy values are positive, because the absolute zero for entropy is the most ordered possible state. Additionally, this means that pure elements in their standard states do not have a standard entropy of zero. Because entropy changes are generally small compared to enthalpy changes, we generally express their units in terms of joules instead of kilojoules. Standard entropy values are most commonly given in units of J/Kmol. A few representative values are given in the following table: 
Standard  Entropy  S  J/ Kmol 	  H2O(l) H2O(g) carbon (graphite) carbon (diamond) carbon (vapor) methane CH4(g) ethane C2H6(g) propane C3H8(g) Note: When referring to standard entropy, standard enthalpy of formation, and standard heat of formation, we use the notation with the degree symbol to indicate the standard conditions of 25C and 1 atm. Without the degree symbol these values are not necessarily from the standard state. As expected, the entropy values for solids are low, the values for gases are high, and the ones for liquids are intermediate. Another observation can be made by looking at the three hydrocarbon gases at the end of the table. For similar molecules, a higher molecular weight generally leads to a larger standard entropy value. Although this is a drastic oversimplification, we can think of this in terms of the electrons that make up each molecule. A larger molecular weight generally means more protons, which also means more electrons. There are more ways to arrange a large number of electrons within a molecule than there are to arrange a smaller number. Although these arrangements are heavily constrained by the positions of the various nuclei, there is still an overall trend for larger molecules to have higher entropy values. 
Calculating ? 	  Calculations of the change in entropy for a given reaction are analogous to those used to determine ?Hrxn. The entropy change for a reaction can be calculated by taking the difference between the total of the standard entropy values of the products and those of the reactants: ?S?rxn = ?nS?(products)??nS?(reactants) As with our enthalpy calculations, each standard entropy value is multiplied by the coefficient of the corresponding substance in the balanced equation. Extensive tables of standard entropy values can be found on the internet. 
Example 20.1 	  Calculate ?Srxn for the following reaction: N2(g)+3H2(g) ? 2NH3(g) The standard entropy values for N2, H2, and NH3 are 191.6, 130.7, and 192.5 J/Kmol, respectively. Answer: Multiply the standard entropy value of each component by its coefficient from the balanced equation, and subtract the values of the reactants from those of the products. ?S?rxn = ?nS?(products)??nS?(reactants) ?S?rxn = 2S?(NH3)?[S?(N2)+3S?(H2)] ?S?rxn = 2(192.5 J/Kmol)?[191.6 J/Kmol+3(130.7 J/Kmol)] mol There is a substantial decrease in entropy over the course of this reaction. This could have been predicted simply by looking at the balanced equation. There are four moles of gaseous reactants and just two moles of gaseous products. In general, the side of the equation with more moles of gas has a higher total entropy. 
Example 20.2 	  Predict whether the change in entropy would be positive or negative for the following reaction: CaCO3(s) ? CaO(s)+CO2(g) Then, use the standard entropy values for each substance to calculate the exact change in entropy. Answer: A single solid reactant is splitting into two products, one of which is a gas. We would expect the entropy of the system to increase over the course of this reaction. The exact change can be calculated as follows: (products)??nS?(reactants) (CaO)+S?(CO2)]?S?(CaCO3) mol+213.6 J/Kmol]?92.9 J/Kmol mol As predicted, ?Srxn is a positive value, indicating that entropy increases upon going from reactants to products. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A process is spontaneous if the formation of products is favored under the given conditions. Spontaneous processes may be fast or slow. Entropy (S) measures the probability of attaining a given state. Things naturally progress towards more probable states, so entropy has a tendency to increase. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of the universe will increase during any spontaneous process. The change in the entropy of the universe can be broken down into the following components: ?Suniv = ?Ssys + ?Ssurr The sign of ?Suniv tells us whether or not a process is spontaneous in the direction that it is written. If ?Suniv is positive, then the forward reaction is spontaneous. The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at 0 K is zero. Standard entropy is the entropy of a substance at 25C and 1 atm of pressure. The entropy change for a reaction can be calculated using standard entropy values.

Define Gibbs free energy, and be able to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy for a given process when provided with the appropriate data. Use the value for Gibbs free energy to predict whether a reaction will occur spontaneously. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  Gibbs free energy: A thermodynamic quantity that combines enthalpy and entropy into a single value in order to predict whether or not a process is spontaneous. What must be true for a reaction to be considered spontaneous? 
Gibbs  Free  Energy 	  We have learned that a spontaneous reaction must increase the total entropy in the universe: ?Suniv >0. To analyze the entropic effects of a given process, we generally break this quantity down into two separate components. This is expressed with the following equation: ?Suniv = ?Ssys + ?Ssurr >0 In general, the entropy change for a chemical reaction or phase change can be easily determined from standard entropy values. Additionally, we saw in the previous lesson that the following relationship is true: ?Hsys ?Ssurr = T	. Substituting this into the above equation, we get the following: ?Hsys ?Suniv = ?Ssys T	>0 This equation can then be rearranged as follows: 
T? Suniv = - ? Hsys +  T? Ssys >0 	  T?Suniv = ?Hsys T?Ssys <0 Now we can talk about the entropy changes in the universe simply by looking at data about the system of interest. If the results of the equation are less than zero, the reaction will be spontaneous. The American physicist Josiah Gibbs took this idea and introduced a thermodynamic quantity that combines enthalpy and entropy into a single value that has been named after him. Gibbs free energy is defined by the following equation: ?G = ?Hsys T?Ssys where ?G is the change in free energy, ?H is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature (in Kelvin), and ?S is the change in entropy. As we can see by comparing this to the derived equations above, the value of ?G must be less than zero for a spontaneous process. Stated another way, systems have a natural tendency to move towards a minimum amount of free energy. Gibbs postulated that a system progressed towards the equilibrium direction which exhibited the highest entropy. 
Standard  Free  Energy  Change 	  Much like the corresponding equations for ?Hrxn and ?Srxn, ?Grxn for a given reaction can be calculated from the corresponding ?Gf values, which are tabulated for a wide variety of substances. ?Grxn = ?n?Gf (products) ?n?Gf (reactants) As with the standard enthalpy of formation values, there is no absolute zero for Gibbs free energy, so each ?Gf value is the change in free energy for a compound when prepared from its constituent elements in their standard states. Also like the enthalpy of formation values, ?Gf for any element in its most stable form at 25C is zero. 
Example 20.3 	  Calculate the value of ?Grxn for the combustion of methane: CH4(g) + 2O2(g) ? CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) ?Gf values can be found at the following website: URL he-Free-Energy-629.html Answer: Multiply each ?Gf value by the coefficient from the balanced equation, and subtract the free energy of the reactants from that of the products. Note that water is present as a liquid, so make sure to use the ?Gf value for the correct state. Because O2(g) is the standard form of oxygen, it has a ?Gf value of zero. ?Grxn = ?n?Gf (products) ?n?Gf (reactants) ?Grxn = [(-394.36 kJ/mol) + 2(-237.13 kJ/mol)] [(-50.72 kJ/mol + 2(0 kJ/mol)] ?Grxn = -868.62 kJ/mol (-50.72 kJ/mol) ?Grxn = -817.90 kJ/mol The large negative value for ?Grxn indicates that the forward reaction is heavily favored under standard conditions. This reaction proceeds spontaneously in the forward direction. 
Gibbs  Free  Energy and  Non- Standard  Conditions 	  The sign of ?G predicts the behavior of a chemical reaction at the standard conditions of 25C and 1 atm of pressure. If ?G is negative, the reaction will proceed spontaneously, if ?G is zero, the reaction is at equilibrium, and if ?G is positive, the reaction will proceed spontaneously in the reverse direction. However, this does not tell us what will happen with a given reaction under non-standard conditions. Consider the following reaction between ammonia and hydrogen chloride gas: NH3(g) + HCl(g) ? NH4Cl(s) We could calculate ?Grxn for this reaction using ?Gf values, as we did in the previous example problem, but that would only tell us the value of ?G at 25C. Alternatively, we could calculate ?G at other temperatures using the following equation: ?Grxn = ?Hrxn T?Srxn Unlike ?G, ?H and ?S do not vary much with changes in temperature. For simplicity, we will assume that for a specified reaction the ?Hrxn and ?Srxn values are the same at any temperature. By calculating ?Hrxn and ?Srxn from the relevant standard enthalpy and entropy values, we can calculate the value of ?G at any temperature. Lets start by finding ?Hrxn: ?Hrxn = ?n?Hf (products) ?n?Hf (reactants) ?Hrxn = -315.39 kJ/mol [(-46.3 kJ/mol) + (-92.3 kJ/mol)] ?Hrxn = -176.70 kJ/mol The large negative value indicates that this is a highly exothermic reaction. Then, find ?Srxn: ?Srxn = ?nSf (products) ?nSf (reactants) ?Srxn = 94.6 J/Kmol [193.0 J/Kmol + 187.0 J/Kmol] ?Srxn = -285.4 J/Kmol A negative value here indicates a decrease in entropy over the course of the reaction. This is consistent with what we might expect for a reaction in which two gases combine to make a single solid product. Now, lets calculate the value of ?Grxn for this reaction at a couple of different temperatures. First, lets look at what we would get using the standard temperature of 25C (298 K). Before plugging any values into our equation, we first need to make sure that our units match. Our enthalpy value is written in terms of kilojoules (kJ), but the value for entropy is written in terms of joules. One of these must be changed in order to add the two quantities together. Because free energy changes are usually written in units of kJ/mol, like enthalpy changes, we should convert the value of ?Srxn from -285.4 J/Kmol to -0.2854 kJ/Kmol by dividing by 1,000. Now, we can plug values into the following equation: ?Grxn = ?Hrxn T?Srxn ?Grxn = -176.70 kJ/mol (298 K)(-0.2854 kJ/Kmol) ?Grxn = -176.70 kJ/mol (-85.05 kJ/mol) ?Grxn = -91.65 kJ/mol ?Grxn <0, so this reaction would proceed spontaneously at a temperature of 25C. It should also be noted that, because we are using the standard temperature at which thermodynamic data is generally measured, this would be the approximate value obtained if we had calculated ?Grxn using ?Gf values. What if we increase the reaction temperature to 500C (773 K)? The same calculation can be performed at the new temperature: ?Grxn = ?Hrxn T?Srxn ?Grxn = -176.70 kJ/mol (773 K)(-0.2854 kJ/Kmol) ?Grxn = -176.70 kJ/mol (-220.61 kJ/mol) ?Grxn = 43.91 kJ/mol At this temperature, the reaction would not be spontaneous in the forward direction. However, the reverse reaction in which ?Grxn = -43.91 kJ/mol would be spontaneous at 500C. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Gibbs free energy combines enthalpy and entropy into a single thermodynamic variable that can be used to predict whether a given reaction will occur spontaneously. The sign of ?G predicts the behavior of a chemical reaction at a constant temperature and pressure. If ?G is negative, the forward reaction will proceed spontaneously, if ?G is zero, the reaction is at equilibrium, and if ?G is positive, the reverse reaction will be spontaneous. ?Grxn can be calculated at 25C using ?Gf values. ?Grxn can be calculated at other temperatures from the values of ?Hrxn and ?Srxn.

Gibbs free energy: http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch21/gibbs.php 	  ?G values: URL How does the equilibrium of a reaction affect the free energy? Can we use free energy calculations to determine equilibrium constants? Can we use equilibrium constants to determine free energy changes? Use the reaction quotient to determine which direction a reaction must run in order to reach equilibrium. Use the equilibrium constant of a reaction to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy. Use changes in Gibbs free energy to calculate equilibrium constants. Predict whether the reactants or products of a reaction are favored under a given set of conditions by looking at either the equilibrium constant or the change in Gibbs free energy. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  reaction quotient (Q): The ratio of the reactant and product concentrations in their non-equilibrium states, raised to their respective exponents. What data is needed to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy for a reaction? What information is needed to calculate an equilibrium constant? 
The  Reaction  Quotient 	  In the previous chapter, we learned how to set up an equilibrium constant expression. For the generic reaction shown below, the equilibrium constant expression is constructed as follows: aA+bB  cC+dD [C]c[D]d 
Keq = [ A]a[ B]b 	  It should be emphasized that the equation above is only true when the reaction is at equilibrium. Given enough time, the indicated ratio of concentrations will eventually converge on the equilibrium constant, but for any reaction in which net changes are still occurring, this equation is not true. For a reaction that is still in progress, it is often useful to calculate the same ratio of concentrations, but in a non-equilibrium state. This value is called the reaction quotient (Q), and comparing the value of Q to the value of Keq tells us which direction the reaction needs to shift in order to reach equilibrium. Keq = [[CA]]ca[[DB]]bd (Only if the reaction is at equilibrium) Q = [[CA]]ca[[DB]]bd (Always) If Q >Keq, then the concentrations of the products (in the numerator) are too large compared to the concentrations of the reactants. Therefore, the reverse reaction must be favored (reducing the products and generating more reactants) in order for the reaction to achieve equilibrium. If Q <Keq, the situation is reversed. There are too many reactants and not enough products, so the reaction quotient is a small number compared to Keq, and the forward reaction will be favored until equilibrium is reached. When Q = Keq, the reaction is at equilibrium. 
Free  Energy at  Non- Standard  Concentrations 	  In the previous section, we looked at values for ?G, which tells us the free energy change for a reaction being run at standard conditions. In addition to the requirements for temperature and pressure (25C and 1 atm), standard conditions also specify the concentrations of each reaction component. Under standard conditions, the concentration of each reaction component in the aqueous or gaseous states is exactly 1 M. Plugging a value of 1 M in for every concentration in the reaction quotient expression will give us a value of Q = 1. Unless Keq happens to be exactly 1, reaction mixtures are not at equilibrium under standard conditions. However, we can calculate the value of ?G for any combination of concentrations if we know the values of ?G and Q. The following equation (which we will not derive) shows the relationships between these quantities: ?G = ?G + RT ln Q ?G = free energy change of the reaction under existing conditions ?G = free energy change of the reaction under standard-state conditions R = universal gas constant (8.314 J/Kmol) T = absolute temperature (in Kelvin) 
Q = reaction quotient 	  Although ?G is going to be a fixed value for a given temperature, ?G will vary depending on the value of RT ln Q. 
Free  Energy and the  Equilibrium  Constant 	  At equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions proceed at equal rates. The driving force in each direction is equal, because the free energy of the reactants and products under equilibrium conditions is equivalent (?G = 0). We also know that, at equilibrium, Q = Keq. For a reaction that has reached equilibrium, the equation above becomes the following: ?G = ?G + RT ln Q ?G = RT ln K This equation provides us with a way to convert between ?G and the equilibrium constant for a given reaction. Knowing either ?G or Keq tells us whether the reactants or products are favored at equilibrium. This relationship is summarized in the following table: 
 	  ln K ?G 
Comments 	  TABLE 20.2: (continued) 
 	  ln K ?G 
Comments 	  <1 negative positive reactants favored over products at equilibrium equilibrium situation; products and reactants equally favored >1 positive negative products favored over reactants at equilibrium 
Example 20.4 	  The standard free energy of formation (?Gf ) for ammonia is -16.6 kJ/mol. Calculate the equilibrium constant for the following reaction at 25C (298 K): N2(g) + 3H2(g)  2NH3(g) Answer: If we know the value of ?G for this reaction, we can calculate the equilibrium constant using the equation above. ?G can be calculated from ?Gf values using the following equation: ?Grxn = ?n?Gf (products) ?n?Gf (reactants) Because nitrogen and hydrogen are both in their standard elemental states, they have ?Gf values of zero. ?Grxn = ?n?Gf (products) ?n?Gf (reactants) ?Grxn = 2(-16.6 kJ/mol) [(0 kJ/mol) + 3(0 kJ/mol)] ?Grxn = -33.2 kJ/mol Then solve ?G = RT ln Keq for Keq: ?G? = ?RT ln Keq = ??RTG? ln Keq Keq = e??RTG? Before plugging values into this equation, note that we are using a value of 8.314 J/Kmol for R, but our value for ?G is -33.2 kJ/mol. In order for our units to cancel correctly, we need to convert -33.2 kJ/mol to -33,200 J/mol. Then, Keq can be calculated as follows: ??RTG? 
Keq = e 	  ?33,200 J/mol ?(8.314 J/Kmol)(298 K) 
Keq = 6.6105 	  Keq is very large, indicating that the products are heavily favored at 25C. Looking at the equation above, we see that increasing the temperature for any reaction makes the fraction in the exponent smaller, thus moving the equilibrium constant closer to 1. If we were to run the ammonia formation reaction above, known as the Haber process, at a higher temperature, the equilibrium constant would be smaller, and the desired products would be less favored. However, the industrial manufacture of ammonia uses this reaction at temperatures of 400-450C. Why are elevated temperatures used? Knowing whether reactants or products are energetically favored is one important factor for optimizing production of a desired product, but it is not the only relevant variable. As it turns out, this reaction is quite slow, so even if the products are heavily favored at equilibrium, it takes a long time to reach that equilibrium. Increasing the temperature speeds up the reaction, and this advantage makes up for the slightly less favorable equilibrium constant. 
Example 20.5 	  The equilibrium constant for the following reaction is 1.6  10?10 at 25C: AgCl(s)  Ag+(aq) + Cl?(aq) Calculate ?G. Answer: Simply plug the relevant values into the following equation: ?G? = ?RT ln Keq ?G? = ?(8.314 J/Kmol)(298 K) ln (1.610?10) ?G? = ?55,884 J/mol Note that the answer will be in J/mol (not kJ/mol) if we cancel the units correctly. Rounding the correct number of significant figures and converting to the usual units for free energy values, ?G = 56 kJ/mol for this reaction. This is a very large number, indicating that the reactants are highly favored, as would be expected for a relatively insoluble ionic compound. One type of equilibrium that we will be studying extensively in the following chapter is the ionization of an acid in water: HA(aq)+H2O(l)  A?(aq)+H3O+(aq) where HA is a generic acid, and A? is its conjugate base. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The reaction quotient can be compared to the equilibrium constant to determine which direction a reaction will shift in order to reach equilibrium. Gibbs free energy values can be used to determine equilibrium constants. Equilibrium constants can be used to calculate changes in Gibbs free energy. Equilibrium constants and Gibbs free energy values allow us to predict the extent to which reactants or products will be favored once a reaction reaches equilibrium.

 	  Aqua regia, a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, is one of the few materials that will dissolve gold. This material, translated to "royal water" in English, was named so because it could dissolve the royal metal gold. First noted in the fourteenth century, aqua regia could be used to help ascertain whether a particular material was actually gold or was some trickery of the alchemist. Nitric acid by itself will not dissolve gold, but will in combination with hydrochloric acid. The chemistry of the process is rather complex, with both acids reacting with the metal to form soluble gold compounds. The gold can be recovered from the solution, making the process useful for purification purposes. Acids and bases have had many uses throughout history. In this chapter we want to explore the properties of acids and bases and the reactions in which they take part. User:Yugo312/Wikimedia Commons. commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%E7%8E%8B%E6%B0%B4.JPG. Public Domain. List some common properties of acids and bases. Describe how acids and bases are defined based on the Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry, and Lewis definitions. Understand the differences between these three systems. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  Arrhenius acid: A compound that releases H+ ions when dissolved in water. Arrhenius base: A compound that generates hydroxide ions (OH?) when dissolved in water. Brnsted-Lowry acid: A compound that can donate a proton (an H+ ion) to an appropriate acceptor. Brnsted-Lowry base: A compound that can remove a proton from a relatively strong Brnsted-Lowry acid. Lewis acid: A chemical species that accepts a pair of electrons. Lewis base: A chemical species that donates a pair of electrons. monoprotic acid: A compound with only one acidic hydrogen atom that can be transferred to a strong base. polyprotic acid: A compound with two or more acidic hydrogen atoms that can be transferred to a strong base. What comes to mind when you think of acids? How does a base differ from an acid? 
Introduction 	  When you think of acids, "sour" is likely to come to mind. For the ancient Greeks, "sour-tasting" is in fact what defined a category of substances which later became known as acids. Bases were first categorized by their uses in soaps, as well as their ability to counteract properties of acids. In this lesson, you will learn about a few definitions for acids and bases as well as some of their properties. 
Properties of  Acids and  Bases 	  Acids and bases are versatile and useful materials in many chemical reactions. Some properties that are common to aqueous solutions of acids and bases are listed in Table 21.1. 
Bases 	  conduct electricity in solution conduct electricity in solution turn blue litmus paper red turn red litmus paper blue have a sour taste have a slippery feeling react with bases to create a neutral solution react with acids to create a neutral solution react with active metals to produce hydrogen gas Note: Litmus paper is a type of treated paper that changes color based on the acidity of the solution it comes in contact with. 
Defining  Acids and  Bases 	  An early way of classifying acids and bases was proposed by Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist, in 1894. An Arrhenius acid is any compound that releases H+ ions when dissolved in water. An Arrhenius base is a compound that generates hydroxide ions (OH?) when dissolved in water. Some representative examples are given in the Table 21.2. 
Bases 	  hydrochloric acid: HCl ? H+ + Cl? sodium hydroxide: NaOH ? Na+ + OH? nitric acid: HNO3 ? H+ + NO3? potassium hydroxide: KOH ? K+ + OH? hydrobromic acid: HBr ? H+ + Br? calcium hydroxide: Ca(OH)2 ? Ca2+ + 2 OH? Many strong acids and bases can be identified based on the Arrhenius model. However, there are many compounds that share a number of common characteristics with acids and bases but do not fit the Arrhenius definitions. In the early 1920s, the Danish scientist Johannes Brnsted and the English researcher Thomas Lowry each published ideas that expanded the Arrhenius concept. According to this newer definition, a Brnsted-Lowry acid is any compound that can donate a proton (an H+ ion) to an appropriate acceptor. A Brnsted-Lowry base is a compound that can remove (or accept) a proton from a relatively Brnsted-Lowry acid. Overall, the Brnsted-Lowry model suggested that any acid-base reaction could be reduced to the transfer of a proton from an acid to a base. For example, the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) involves the transfer of an H+ ion from the acid (HCl) to the base (the bicarbonate ion). The resulting carbonic acid (H2CO3) is unstable and breaks down to form carbon dioxide and water: Another more general definition of acids and bases was offered by the American chemist G.N. Lewis. A Lewis acid is any chemical species that accepts a pair of electrons, and a Lewis base is a chemical species that donates a pair of electrons. This is the broadest most commonly used definition, and all compounds that qualify as an acid or base under the previous definitions are also Lewis acids and bases. In the diagram above, we see the same process illustrated multiple times, highlighting the ways in which the compounds are acting as an acid or a base according to each definition. According to the Brnsted-Lowry model, the protonated water molecule (the acid) is donating a proton to the OH? ion (the base). According to the Lewis model, the hydroxide ion has a pair of electrons (indicated by the black bar) that it donates to the protonated water molecule. "Pronated" refers to the extra hydrogen atom in the molecule, which increases its charge from neutral to +1. In both instances, the hydroxide ion serves as a base and the protonated water molecule is the acid. An example of a Lewis acid-base reaction that would not fit the other definitions of acid and base is the formation of an adduct between boron trifluoride and ammonia: The ammonia serves as a Lewis base by donating its lone pair of electrons to make a new bond with boron (the Lewis acid), which has an empty orbital (indicated by ?) that can accept two electrons. Unless otherwise indicated, we will be using the Brnsted-Lowry model of acids and bases for the remainder of the chapter. 
Monoprotic and  Polyprotic  Acids 	  Acids can further be categorized based on how many acidic hydrogen atoms they contain. Acidic hydrogen atoms are those which will be transferred to a base. A monoprotic acid has only one acidic hydrogen that would be transferred to a strong base, whereas a polyprotic acid has two or more. Common monoprotic acids include HCl, HBr, and HNO3. A common diprotic acid is sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) provides an example of a triprotic acid. In each case, all hydrogens are available to participate in acid-base reactions. However, that is not the case for all acidic molecules. For example, in acetic acid (CH3COOH), only the hydrogen bonded to the oxygen atom is acidic. The other three hydrogens are covalently bonded to carbon and cannot be removed by any of the bases that we will consider in this chapter.

Lesson  Summary 	  Acids and bases were originally identified based on their physical and chemical properties. According to the Arrhenius model, acids and bases are compounds that release H+ or OH? ions when dissolved in water. In the Brnsted-Lowry model, an acid is a compound that can donate a proton (H+ ion), and a base is a compound that can accept a proton. A Lewis base is an electron-pair donor, whereas a Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor. This is the broadest of the three definitions. Acids can be classified as monoprotic or polyprotic based on the number of acidic hydrogens they contain.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  amphoteric: A substance that can act as both an acid and a base. neutral solution: An aqueous solution in which [H3O+] = [OH?]. acidic solution: An aqueous solution in which [H3O+] >[OH?]. basic solution: An aqueous solution in which [H3O+] <[OH?]. pH: A measure of the concentration of hydrogen atoms in solution; pH = ?log[H+]. acid-base indicator: A substance which changes color based on the relative acidity of the solution. Based on what you know about acids and bases, would you expect an acidic solution to have a high or low concentration of H+ ions? 
Self- Ionization of  Water 	  Water is an example of what is known as an amphoteric substance, which means that it can act as both an acid and a base. In the presence of a strong acid, water can be a proton acceptor (a base), producing the hydronium ion (H3O+): HCl(aq)+H2O(l) ?Cl?(aq)+H3O+(aq) However, water can also donate a proton (acting as an acid) when combined with a strong enough base, producing the hydroxide ion (OH?): CH3O?(aq)+H2O(l) CH3OH(aq)+OH?(aq) Overall, water is a weak acid and a weak base. Because it has both of these properties, any sample of liquid water undergoes the following acid-based reaction in which both hydronium and hydroxide ions are produced to a very small extent: H2O(l)+H2O(l)  H3O+(aq)+OH?(aq) Because the reactants are in the liquid phase, they are not included in the equilibrium constant expression. As a result, the value of Keq for this reaction can be calculated as follows: 
Keq = [ H3 O+][ H?] 	  Waters ability to act as an acid or a base is relatively weak, so we would expect the reactants to be heavily favored in this equilibrium. Indeed, at 25C, this equilibrium constant has a value of only 1.0  10?14. However, despite the minimal extent of self-ionization, this is a fundamentally important equilibrium for any reactions that take place in water, which includes essentially all biochemical reactions that occur inside any living organism. Because of its particular importance, this equilibrium constant is given the special symbol Kw. In a pure sample of water, there are no external sources of H3O+ or OH? (no additional acids or bases), so for each H3O+ ion that is formed by the self-ionization of water, an OH? ion will be formed as well. As a result, [H3O+] = [OH?] in pure water. Because both of these concentrations are the same, we can solve for the equilibrium concentrations using the value of Kw. Let x be the concentration of H3O+ (and therefore also the concentration of OH?): 
Kw = [ H3 O+][ H?] 	  At equilibrium, [H3O+] = [OH?] = 1.0  10?7 in a sample of pure water. An aqueous solution in which [H3O+] = [OH?] is referred to as a neutral solution. However, the addition of an external acid or base will shift the relative amounts of these two ions. Adding an acid will increase the amount of H3O+. As a consequence, the amount of OH? will need to decrease in order to reestablish equilibrium (at which point the equilibrium expression for Kw will once again have the correct value). In an acidic solution, [H3O+] >[OH?]. Similarly, in a basic solution, the amount of OH? will increase and the amount of H3O+ will decrease, so [H3O+] <[OH?]. 
Shorthand  Notation for  Aqueous  Acids 	  It is very common for chemists to write H+ instead of H3O+ when talking about aqueous solutions of acids and bases. However, H+ will not exist as an isolated ion if dissolved in water. Instead, it will be closely associated with (at least) one molecule of the solvent. It is generally acceptable to use H+, but it should be understood that this is just a shorthand notation for H3O+. Consequently, the expression for Kw is often written as follows: 
Kw = [ H+][ H?] 	  Acid-base reactions are also sometimes written in a way that makes use of this shorthand. For example, you might see the following acid-dissociation reaction: 
O3(aq) ?  H+(aq)+ 	  However, a better description of this process would be the following: 
O3(aq)+ H2 O(l) ?  H3 O+(aq)+ 	  H+ is not just "falling off" of nitric acid. Instead, it is being pulled off by water, which is a better base than the resulting nitrate anion. Again, the shorthand version is acceptable to use, but keep in mind that a more accurate description would include water as a base whenever "H+" is being generated in an aqueous solution. pH of Aqueous Solutions Because we are dealing with such small concentrations of H+ and OH?, a system was invented in order to talk about the acidity or basicity of a solution that uses more manageable numbers. The Danish chemist Sren Srenson proposed a new quantity that he called pH, which is defined as follows: pH = ?log[H+] One of the confusing consequences of pH values as defined by this equation is that the higher the hydrogen ion concentration, the lower the pH. A solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of 1  10?3 would have a pH of 3, and a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of 1  10?5 would have a pH value of 5. 
Example 21.1 	  What is the pH of a neutral solution (at 25C)? Answer: As we saw in the previous section, a neutral solution has a hydrogen ion concentration of 1.0  10?7. pH = ?log[H+] pH = ?log[1.010?7] pH = 7.00 A neutral solution has a pH of 7. Acidic solutions have higher concentrations of H+, so they have pH values that are less than 7. Conversely, basic solutions have lower concentrations of H+ and pH values greater than 7. Here is a list of the pH values for some common acidic and basic solutions: 
Example 21.2 	  What is the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution that has a pH value of 4.67? Answer: Start with the definition of pH and plug in the known value: pH = ?log[H+] The logarithm function can be inverted as follows: ?log[H+] = 4.67 log[H+] = ?4.67 log[H+] ?4.67 
H^+ 	  = 10?4.67 
H^+ 	  = 2.110?5 The hydrogen ion concentration in this solution is 2.1  10?5 M. 
How to  Measure p 	  There are two common ways to measure pH. When only an approximate pH value is needed, an inexpensive test involves the use of acid-base indicators, which change color based on the relative acidity of the solution. One type of common indicator is litmus paper. For example, if a piece of litmus paper is dipped into an acidic solution (pH below ~4.5), it will turn red, and dipping it into a basic solution (pH above ~8.5) will turn it blue. Solutions of intermediate pH will result in various shades of purple. Because different indicators change color at different pH values, the use of multiple indicators can generally narrow down the possible pH of a solution to a range of about More precise measurements can be obtained by using a digital pH meter, which can detect the concentration of H+ based on small changes in electrical potential. Although a bit more expensive and cumbersome to use, such a device is essential for determining the exact pH of a solution. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Water can react with itself to produce H3O+ and OH?. The equilibrium constant for this reaction (Kw) is equal to 1.0  10?14 at 25C. When talking about acids in an aqueous solution, H+ is often used as a shorthand for H3O+. pH provides a way to talk about the acidity of a solution (the relative concentration of H+) using more manageable numbers. It is defined by the equation pH = -log [H+]. A neutral solution has a pH value of 7 ([H+] = 1.0  10?7). Acidic solutions have lower pH values (higher concentrations of H+), and basic solutions have higher pH values (lower concentrations of H+). The pH of a solution can be approximated by using indicators or measured more precisely by using a pH meter.

For a given concentration of acid, would you expect the pH to be lower for a strong acid or a weak acid? How can the relative strengths of various acids be quantified? Explain the difference between a strong acid and a weak acid. Explain the difference between a strong base and a weak base. Calculate the pH values of acidic or basic solutions based on the original concentration of the acid or base. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  strong acid: An acid which when dissolved in water will completely transfer its proton to the solvent. weak acid: An acid whose dissociation favors the reactants at equilibrium; only a small number of the acidic molecules dissociate to form H+. strong base: A base whose dissociation favors the products at equilibrium; most molecules do remove a proton from water. weak base: A base whose dissociation favors the reactants at equilibrium; most molecules do not remove a proton from water. How are equilibrium constants calculated from data about the concentrations of each reacting species? 
Strong vs.  Weak  Acids 	  So far, we have primarily been defining acids by their ability to donate an H+ ion and bases by their ability to accept an H+ ion. However, acids and bases vary in their relative ability to undergo these processes. In general, acids can be classified as strong or weak based on the extent to which they produce H3O+ when dissolved in water. For a generic acid, we can write the following equilibrium reaction: HA(aq)+H2O(l)  H3O+(aq)+A?(aq) Using the usual shorthand notation, this equation can also be written as follows: HA(aq)  H+(aq)+A?(aq) This type of equilibrium, in which a proton is being transferred to water, is often indicated by writing the equilibrium constant as Ka. The relative position of this equilibrium for a given acid determines whether it will be considered strong or weak. When dissolved in water, a strong acid will completely transfer its proton to the solvent. In terms of the equilibrium above, the products will be heavily favored (Ka 1). In fact, the products are so heavily favored that the reverse reaction is often not even considered, and the proton transfer is written as unidirectional. For example, the strong acid HCl can dissociate in water according to the following reaction: HCl(aq)+H2O(l) ? H3O+(aq)+Cl?(aq) (HCl(aq) ? H+(aq)+Cl?(aq)) At equilibrium, essentially no intact HCl molecules are still present in solution. In contrast, the equilibrium for a weak acid favors the reactants. A particularly common type of weak acid is an organic molecule that contains a carboxyl group (CO2H, sometimes written as COOH). For example, acetic acid (the acidic component of vinegar) has the formula CH3CO2H. Its dissociation equation can be written as follows: 
H3 O2 H(aq)+ H2 O(l)   	  (CH3CO2H(aq)  H Because we are dealing with a weak acid, Ka for this equilibrium is much less than 1. At equilibrium, most of the acetic acid molecules are still intact, and only a small percentage have transferred their protons to the solvent. The Ka values for some weak acids are listed in the Table 21.6. 
Ka 	  In more advanced textbooks, you can learn how to tell whether a particular acid is strong or weak. For now, be able to recognize the following as strong acids: HCl, HBr, HI, HNO3, H2SO4, and HClO4. All of these strong acids ionize completely when dissolved in water. Most other acids that you encounter in general chemistry courses are weak acids. 
Strong vs.  Weak  Bases 	  Analogous to the acid dissociation reaction from the previous section, we can write the reaction between a generic base and water as follows: B(aq)+H2O(l)  BH+(aq)+OH?(aq) The equilibrium constant for a reaction in which a base is deprotonating water (taking waters hydrogen atom) is often given the symbol Kb. Strong bases and weak bases can then be defined based on the position of this equilibrium. A weak base would have a very small Kb value (much less than 1), indicating that most molecules of the base do not remove a proton from water. Conversely, a strong base would have a Kb value greater than or equal to 1. Nitrogen-containing compounds are a common type of weak base. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom can accept a proton from water as follows: NH3(aq)+H2O(l)  NH+4 (aq)+OH?(aq) The equilibrium constant for this reaction is quite low, so most of the NH3 molecules will not remove a proton from water. Kb values for a few nitrogen-containing bases are listed in the Table 21.7. 
Kb 	  ethylamine (CH3CH2NH2) methylamine (CH3NH2) ammonia (NH3) The only strong bases that are commonly used in general chemistry courses are ionic compounds composed of metal cations and hydroxide anions, such as NaOH, KOH, or Ba(OH)2. 
Strong  Acids and  Bases 	  In the case of strong acids and bases, the pH for a solution of known concentration is relatively easy to calculate. For example, the strong acid HCl will dissociate completely, so we assume that the amount of acid added to the solution is equal to the amount of H+ present at equilibrium. 
Example 21.3 	  What is the pH of a 0.150 M aqueous solution of HCl? Answer: Because HCl is a strong acid, we can assume that all of its acidic hydrogens are transferred to the solvent molecules. Therefore, [H+] = 0.150 M, so pH can be calculated as follows: pH = log [H+] pH = log [0.150] pH =0.82 As expected for an acidic solution, the pH is much lower than 7. Because the strong bases that you will encounter are all ionic compounds that contain the hydroxide anion, you can assume complete dissociation in water, which would tell you the concentration of hydroxide. Then, the concentration of H+ can be calculated using the expression for Kw. 
Example 21.4 	  What is the pH of a 0.245 M aqueous solution of NaOH? Answer: Because NaOH is a soluble ionic compound, we can assume that it fully dissociates in water. After dissociation, [OH?] = 0.245 M. We can then use the value of Kw to determine [H+]. 
Kw = [ H+][ H?] 	  [H+] = 4.0810?14 Then, use the definition of pH to determine the pH of this solution: pH = log [H+] pH = log [4.08  10^{-14}] pH =13.39 As expected for a basic solution, this value is significantly larger than 7. 
Weak  Acids and  Bases 	  Because only a small portion of any available weak acid or base molecules undergo a proton transfer to form either H+ or OH? ions, calculating the pH of one of these solutions is slightly more complicated. The following example problem outlines the general strategy for answering this type of question. 
Example  Problem 21.5 	  The Ka of acetic acid (CH3CO2H) is 1.8  10?5. Calculate the pH of a 0.50 M solution of acetic acid. Answer: First, set up an ICE table for the acid dissociation equation. Before any proton transfers occur, we have acetic acid at a concentration of 0.50 M, no acetate anion, and an H+ concentration of 1.0  10?7 M. Once the reaction begins, some of the acetic acid will be converted to acetate as it transfers an H+ ion to the solvent. The amount of acetic acid that dissociates in order to reach equilibrium (the quantity you are trying to find) is represented by x. A corresponding increase then occurs in the concentrations of the products. The equilibrium concentrations of each species can then be written in terms of x. 
H+ 	  + CH3CO2? 
Initial concentration 	  (M) Change (M) -x +x +x 
At	equilibrium 	  (M) x Then, write the equilibrium constant expression and plug in the equilibrium values from the ICE table. [H+][CH3CO 
Ka =	[ H3 O2 H] 	  Solving this equation by hand would be quite difficult. Fortunately, for essentially all of the weak acid problems that you will be expected to solve, we can make two simplifying assumptions. First, we assume that only a very small percentage of the acetic acid molecules will be ionized, which means that the drop in concentration (x) is much smaller than the original concentration (0.50 M). This is reasonable based on the small value of Ka. Mathematically, this assumption means that (0.50 x) is approximately equal to 0.50. For example, say we found that x had a value of 0.0012. If we subtract this value from 0.50, we get 0.4988, and rounding to the correct number of significant figures would give us 0.50. Based on this assumption, we can simplify the above equation as follows: The second assumption is that the amount of H+ produced by this reaction is much larger than the amount already present. This is reasonable because even a weak acid tends to be much more acidic than pure water (unless it is present in extremely low concentrations). Mathematically, this means that we can ignore the 1.0  10?7 M H+ already present. For example, if x has a value of 0.0012, the quantity (1.0  10?7 + x) is equal to x after rounding to the correct number of significant figures. This second assumption further simplifies the equation above, and we can now solve for x: x = 0.0030 The concentration of H+ at equilibrium is equal to 1.0  10?7 + 0.0030 M, which after rounding is simply 0.0030 M. Then, find the pH as usual: pH = ?log[H+] pH = ?log[0.0030] pH = 2.52 A 0.50 M solution of acetic acid would have a pH of 2.52. As long as we can make the two simplifying assumptions shown above, determining the pH of a weak acid solution becomes much simpler. As we saw in the example problem, [x]2 
Ka = [ C] 	  where x is the equilibrium concentration of H+ and C is the original concentration of the weak acid. Overall, this reduces to a much simpler expression for finding [H+]: [H+] = pCKa Calculations involving weak bases can be carried out in the same fashion. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Strong acids completely transfer their acidic protons to the solvent when dissolved in water. When a weak acid is dissolved in water, most of the molecules will retain their acidic protons, and only a small percentage will dissociate. Strong bases completely dissociate in water, releasing all hydroxide anions into the solution. The most common strong bases are soluble metal hydroxides. Weak bases partially deprotonate water to form small amounts of hydroxide and the protonated base. The pH of an acidic solution can be calculated from the original concentration of the acid and the value of Ka. Only the original concentration is required for strong acids. The pH of a basic solution can be calculated from the original concentration of the base and the value of Kb. Only the original concentration is required for strong bases.

Introduction 	  If you have ever been stung by a bee, youve likely experienced the painful burning sensation left by the stinger. This burning or stinging is caused by an acid in the bees stinger. One way to relieve this discomfort is to apply a paste made of baking soda to the sting. Baking soda contains a weak base called sodium hydrogen carbonate which reacts with the acid and helps relieve the sting. In this lesson you will learn about various acid-base reactions and how they work. 
The  Neutralization  Reaction 	  So far, we have been looking at the interaction between acids and water (in which water acts as a very weak base) or bases and water (in which water acts as a very weak acid). However, acids and bases can react directly with each other as well. A typical acid-base reaction would have the following form: acid + base ? salt + water where the term salt can refer to essentially any ionic compound. An example would be the reaction between hydrochloric acid and potassium hydroxide: HCl(aq) + KOH(aq) ? KCl(aq) + H2O(l) Recall from the chapter Chemical Reactions that there are several different ways to write reactions between ionic substances that take place in water. The equation above is the molecular equation for this reaction. We can also write the ionic equation as follows: H+(aq) + Cl?(aq) + K+(aq) + OH?(aq) ? K+(aq) + Cl?(aq) + H2O(l) Removing the spectator ions, which do not change over the course of the reaction, we get the following net ionic equation: H+(aq) + OH?(aq) ? H2O(l) The reaction between an acid and a base is referred to as a neutralization reaction, since the more reactive H+ and OH? ions combine to produce neutral water. When equal amounts of a strong acid and a strong base are combined, we are left with a neutral solution (pH = 7). 
How  Antacids  Work 	  Have you ever experienced heartburn? Heartburn is actually a condition caused by stomach acid, rather something in your heart. The stomach produces HCl, which is a necessary component of digestion. However, excessive amounts of stomach acid can cause a great deal of discomfort. Various factors can cause the overproduction of acid, mostly related to the types (and amounts) of food and beverages that are being consumed. Caffeine and other oils in coffee (even decaf) will increase HCl production in the stomach. Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol also increase the formation of stomach acid. To relieve the discomfort associated with excess stomach acid, many people turn to antacids. Antacids are essentially just bases that react with some of the unwanted HCl via a neutralization reaction. Strong bases like NaOH are far too harsh to ingest, but some less soluble hydroxide bases can be consumed as suspensions. For example, milk of magnesia is a suspension of Mg(OH)2. Al(OH)3 is also available as a safe formulation. Both of these compounds will remain largely undissolved until they reach the stomach, where they will react with the excess acid without subjecting other parts of the body to strongly basic conditions. However, these can lead to other types of issues with continued use, such as constipation, kidney damage, and possibly even bone depletion. These days, the most common antacids use weak bases, such as carbonate or bicarbonate ions, to neutralize the HCl. The resulting carbonic acid can then decompose into water and carbon dioxide. For example, drinking a solution of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) will result in the following reactions: Many antacid tablets use calcium carbonate as an active ingredient. HCl(aq) + NaHCO3(aq) ? NaCl(aq) + H2CO3(aq) H2CO3(aq) ? H2O(l) + CO2(g) It should be noted that a newer class of antacids does not work by directly neutralizing stomach acid. Instead, they act to inhibit the proton pumps that generate the acid in the first place. Proton pump inhibitors decrease the activity of these pumps and lower the amount of acid produced by the stomach, but they do not neutralize the acid already present. 
Acid- Base  Titrations 	  A titration is a laboratory technique that very accurately measures the concentration of a solution of acid or base. It makes use of a neutralization reaction and the fact that pH changes very rapidly for neutral (and nearly neutral) solutions. The following is a typical procedure for titration of a strong acid with a strong base: Lets say you have a solution of HCl, but the concentration is not known. First, a known volume of the acid is placed in a flask, and a few drops of an acid-base indicator, such as phenolphthalein, are added. Because this solution is acidic, and phenolphthalein is colorless at low pH values, the solution remains clear. Next, a solution of a strong base, such as NaOH is placed into a piece of glassware called a buret ( Figure 21.6). This solution, which has a known concentration, is referred to as the titrant. Then, the titrant is added drop by drop to the acid while swirling the flask. Because phenolphthalein turns pink when exposed to base, the drops of the titrant may initially appear pink when they hit the acid, but after swirling, the base is neutralized by the HCl, and the pink color fades. Once the pink color no longer fades after swirling, the solution in the flask is basic (pH >7), which means all of the HCl has been neutralized by the NaOH titrant. The volume of the titrant that was added to the acid can be measured by looking at the initial and final levels of the solution in the buret. At this point, called the equivalence point, the moles of acid that were initially present in the flask are equal to the number of moles of base that were added via the buret. Remember that to calculate the number of moles of solute, we multiply the concentration of the solution (in mol/L) by the volume of the solution (in L). At the equivalence point: moles acid = moles base 
Macid  Vacid =  Mbase  Vbase 	  where M and V are the concentration and volume, respectively, of the two solutions. After performing the titration above, we know the volume of the initial acid in the flask, the concentration of the base, and the volume of the titrant that was required to reach the equivalence point. We can therefore solve for the concentration of the HCl solution. 
Example 21.6 	  A 25.0 mL sample of an HCl solution is titrated with 0.050 M NaOH. The equivalence point is reached after the addition of 46.7 mL of the NaOH solution. What is the concentration of the HCl solution? Answer: Simply plug these values into the equation above: 
Macid  Vacid =  Mbase  Vbase 	  Macid 25.0 mL = 0.050 M46.7 mL Macid = 0.093 M 
Titration  Curves 	  If the pH of a solution is tracked with a pH meter over the course of the titration, we can get even more useful information about what is occurring in solution. A titration curve is a plot of pH vs. the amount of titrant added. The shape and position of the curve can be used not just to determine the equivalence point, but also to determine whether the acid is strong or weak and the Ka value (for weak acids). The graph on the right shows a titration of a strong base with a strong acid. Although the pH is decreasing rather than increasing, the principle is the same. At the equivalence point, the moles of added acid are equal to the moles of base that were initially present, so the same equation can be used to determine the unknown concentration. This approach can also be used to titrate a weak acid. In Figure 21.8, we see a comparison between the titration curves obtained for HCl and for acetic acid (a weak acid). There are a couple of noteworthy differences. First, the curve for the weak acid has a small plateau about halfway to the equivalence point. We will not go into the details, but as it turns out, the pH at the flattest point of this plateau can be used to determine the Ka of the acid according to the following equation: pH = log(Ka) Additionally, the pH at the equivalence point is higher than 7 when titrating a weak acid. This is because the anion from the weak acid (acetate) is slightly basic, whereas the anion from the strong acid (chloride) is an extremely poor base. Polyprotic acids have distinctive titration curves. These acids have multiple dissociation constants, one for each acidic proton. For example, phosphoric acid has three acidic hydrogens: 
Ka1	 Ka2	 Ka3 	  H3PO4 H+ + H2PO4? H+ + HPO42? H+ + PO43? 
Ka1 = 7.5x10?3  Ka2 = 6.2x10?8  Ka3 = 4.8x10?13 	  On the titration curve for phosphoric acid, we can see three vertical inflection points corresponding to the equivalence points for each acidic proton. (The third one is not very clear, because HPO is not much more acidic than water.) As in the case of a monoprotic weak acid, the plateaus in the curve above can be used to determine the Ka values for each acidic hydrogen in phosphoric acid. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Combining an acid and a base results in a neutralization reaction. For strong acids and bases, the net ionic equation is simply H+ + OH? ? H2O. Weak bases or poorly soluble strong bases can be ingested to neutralize excess stomach acid. The concentration of an acid or base can be determined by titration. A pH meter allows the construction of a titration curve. The data from a titration curve can be used to determine the equivalence point, the type of acid or base (strong vs. weak), and the Ka or Kb value of the acid or base being titrated.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  conjugate base: The deprotonated form (A?) from a given acid acid (HA). conjugate acid: The resulting molecule after the base accepts a proton. buffer: Solutions which resist small changes in pH when an acid or a base is added to the system. pKa: The negative logarithm of the Ka; a lower pKa indicates a more acidic compound. How do you calculate the concentrations of various reaction components at equilibrium? 
Introduction 	  Neutralization reactions between an acid and a base yield a salt and water. In some cases, this results in a completely neutral solution. However, some salts are weakly acidic or basic. How can we tell whether a given salt will act as an acid or base? Looking at the relative strengths of the acid and base that were used to form the salt can give us information on the acid-base properties of the resulting solution. 
Salts  Forming  Neutral  Solutions 	  The simplest situation is a salt formed by combining a strong acid and a strong base. These salts are neither acidic nor basic, so they do not affect the pH of the solution when dissolved in water. For example, the ionic compound NaNO3 could be prepared by combining the strong acid HNO3 and the strong base NaOH. If we were to dissolve NaNO3 in water, it would dissociate into Na+ and NO3? ions. Neither ion is a strong enough acid or base to cause any noticeable proton transfers, so the pH of the pure water is not altered. 
Salts  Forming  Basic  Solutions 	  A salt formed from a weak acid and a strong base will form a solution that has a pH greater than 7. For example, sodium acetate could be formed by neutralizing acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. Dissolving sodium acetate in water will produce sodium ions and acetate ions. The Na+ ion is not a strong enough acid or base to donate or accept any protons, but the acetate ion is a weak base: CH3COO? + H2O  CH3COOH + OH? Although this equilibrium favors the reactants (acetate is still a weak base), there will still be some additional hydroxide produced, skewing the H+ / OH? balance and increasing the pH of the solution. The equilibrium constant for this reaction can be written as follows: 
Salts  Forming  Acidic  Solutions 	  A salt formed from a strong acid and a weak base will give an acidic solution when dissolved in water. For example, NH4Cl, which is formed by neutralizing the weak base ammonia with HCl, would dissociate into the following ions: NH4Cl H?2O NH4+ + Cl? The ammonium ion then acts as a weak acid, while the chloride ion is not a strong enough base to affect the pH of the solution. 
H4+  H3 +  H+ 	  Calculations involving acidic and basic salts are carried out in the same way as other acid-base equilibrium calculations. Depending upon the data available, we can calculate equilibrium constants or the pH of a solution with a known concentration. 
Buffer  Solutions 	  Consider the generic equilibrium for the dissociation of an acid: HA  H+ + A? In the reverse direction, the anion A? is acting as a base by accepting a proton. For a given acid (HA), its deprotonated form (A?) is referred to as its conjugate base. The conjugate base of a strong acid is an extremely poor base, which is why the reverse reaction essentially does not proceed. For example, HCl dissociates completely in water, and the chloride ion (its conjugate base) is not really thought of as a base. In contrast, the conjugate base of a weak acid is a weak base. For example, the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid, is slightly basic. A similar terminology is used when dissolving bases in water. After the base accepts a proton, the resulting molecule or ion is referred to as its conjugate acid. For example, the ammonium ion (NH4+) is the conjugate acid of ammonia (NH3). We can take advantage of the properties of conjugate acids and bases to make buffer solutions, which resist small changes in pH when an acid or a base is added to the system. Biological buffers play important roles in maintaining a constant pH in cells and tissues, which is required in order for many biochemical reactions to proceed efficiently. Buffers can be generated in the laboratory by making a mixture of both a weak acid and its conjugate base. Consider the following equilibrium between acetic acid and the acetate ion: CH3COOH  H+ + CH3COO? If we dissolved both acetic acid and some source of acetate anion (such as sodium acetate) in water, the resulting solution would be set up to absorb small amounts of added acid or base without major changes to the concentration of H+. For example, if a strong acid was added, most of the resulting H+ ions would combine with acetate ions to make molecules of acetic acid. The addition of a strong base would cause mostly deprotonation of the acetic acid, and very little increase in the concentration of the hydroxide ion. If we know the concentration of both the acid and its conjugate base, we can calculate the pH of the buffer based on the ratio between these two components. For example, say we made a solution that contained 0.10 M acetic acid and 0.20 M sodium acetate. The equilibrium expression for this reaction has the following form: 
Ka	 H3 H] 	  Plugging in the known concentrations, along with the Ka of acetic acid (1.74  10?5) allows us to solve for the concentration of H+: [H+] = 8.7010?6 M Then, we can calculate the pH as usual: pH = ?log[H+] pH = ?log[8.7010?6] pH = 5.06 This buffer would have a pH of 5.06. We can tailor the buffer to a specific pH by changing the ratio of acid to salt in the mixture. Note that if we have equal concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base, the equilibrium constant expression can be simplified as follows: 
Ka = [ H+] 	  This also means that the pH can be determined directly from the Ka: pH = ?log[H+] pH = ?log(Ka) The negative logarithm of the Ka is known as the pKa of an acid. Tables of acid strengths often list pKa values instead of Ka values so that exponents are not required. As with pH, a lower pKa indicates a more acidic compound. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A salt formed from a weak acid and a strong base will form a basic solution (pH >7), because the anion acts as a weak base. A salt formed from a strong acid and a weak base will form an acidic solution (pH <7), because the cation acts as a weak acid. A salt formed from a strong acid and a strong base will form a neutral solution (pH = 7), because neither the cation nor the anion is a sufficiently strong acid or base. The deprotonated form of an acid is referred to as its conjugate base. Similarly, the protonated form of a base is referred to as its conjugate acid. A mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base (or a weak base and its conjugate acid) produces a buffer, which is resistant to large changes in pH even when additional acid or base is added.

Chapter  Outline 	  Have you ever seen someone breathe into a device like this? This person is breathing into a breathalyzer, a device used to detect the presence of ethanol (an alcohol) in a persons breath. One version of the breathalyzer works by measuring the color change of a solution of the dichromate ion. In the presence of ethanol, the solution changes from orange to green as the dichromate ion is converted to a chromium(III) ion. The extent of the color change is then related to actual blood-alcohol content. The device is very accurate, because the chemical reaction on which the device is based is very predictable. This is an example of an oxidation-reduction reaction. Courtesy of Senior Airman Natasha Stannard, US Air Force. commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Breathalyzer_study.jpg. Public Domain.

Introduction 	  What do the rusting of a nail, the tarnishing of silverware, and the burning of propane gas all have in common? As you have seen, there are many types of chemical reactions that occur depending on the combination of reactants and the conditions under which the reactants are placed. The processes we have just mentioned are all classified as oxidation-reduction reactions. In this lesson you will learn some possible ways to classify oxidation-reduction reactions based on certain characteristics. 
Identifying  Oxidation and  Reduction 	  If an iron nail is exposed to the elements for a long enough period of time, it will eventually rust. This process is due to the following reaction between metallic iron and molecular oxygen: The rusting process is often accelerated when the metal comes into contact with electrolytes, such as the salts used to melt ice on streets in the winter. Similarly, silverware will tarnish when exposed to some sulfur-containing compounds. The layer of black tarnish (Ag2S) can easily be removed by cleaning the silverware with a mixture of aluminum and baking soda: 3 Ag2S(s) + 2 Al(s) ? 6 Ag(s) + Al2S3(s) Tarnished silver. The object on the left has tarnished. The plate on the right and the object being held have both been polished. Many homes are heated by burning propane gas, which combusts in the presence of oxygen: 
H3 H2 H3 + 5  O2 ? 3  O2 + 4  H2 	  Some fireplaces use propane gas rather than wood as fuel. All of these seemingly disparate processes are examples of oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. In a redox reaction, one substance is undergoing an oxidation and another is undergoing a reduction. The ways in which these terms are defined have varied over the years. The broadest definitions of oxidation and reduction are related to oxidation numbers, which will be discussed in the following lesson. However, many redox reactions can be identified on the basis of earlier definitions. Three general types of oxidation processes are listed below: Fe2O3(s) + 3 CO(g) ? 2 Fe(s) + 3 CO2(g) The carbon monoxide molecule is being oxidized; it gains an oxygen atom to form carbon dioxide. CH3CH2OH (ethanol) ? CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) In this process, ethanol is being oxidized to form acetaldehyde. The other components of the reaction are not shown, in order to highlight the oxidation. It should be noted that not all losses of hydrogen are oxidations. For example, in the previous chapter on Acids and Bases, we saw many reactions in which a hydrogen ion is transferred from an acid to a base. However, because H+ is being transferred but all of the electrons remain with their original compounds, this is actually not an oxidation process. This distinction will become clearer in the next lesson when we introduce the concept of oxidation numbers. Over the course of this reaction, neutral sodium atoms are being converted to sodium cations (Na+). This net loss of an electron is a common type of oxidation. The opposite of each of these criteria generally indicates that a reduction is occurring. Fe2O3(s) + 3 CO(g) ? 2 Fe(s) + 3 CO2(g) Oxygen atoms are being removed from the iron oxide, so that component is being reduced. The term reduction originated from this type of process, where a metal oxide is reduced to its pure metal form by treating it with the appropriate chemicals. CH3CHO(l) + H2(g) ? CH3CH2OH(l) In this reaction, acetaldehyde is being reduced. On the reactant side, we see two neutral chlorine atoms covalently bonded into a chlorine molecule. On the product side, each chlorine atom has gained an electron to become Cl? ions. Chlorine is being reduced in this reaction. Two things should be emphasized at this point. First, not all processes that involve the gain or loss of oxygen or hydrogen are redox reactions. Although those definitions often work well with organic (carbon-based) compounds, there are many situations in inorganic chemistry for which they are insufficient. Second, oxidation and reduction must always take place together. In order for one compound to be oxidized, another must be reduced, and vice versa. For example, based on the electron-transfer definition, one compound must lose electrons (be oxidized) in order for another compound to gain electrons (be reduced). 
Oxidizing and  Reducing  Agents 	  If a species is oxidized, there must be something present to make that process happen. This something is known as an oxidizing agent. When something is reduced, a reducing agent is necessary to for the reaction to occur. In every oxidation-reduction reaction, there is an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent. You cannot have an oxidationreduction reaction without both being present. Look again at the following reaction: 
Fe2 O3 + 3  O ? 2  Fe + 3  O2 	  In this process, carbon monoxide is being oxidized (oxygen is added), and iron oxide is being reduced (oxygen is lost). Because the added oxygen is provided by the iron oxide, Fe2O3 is the oxidizing agent in this reaction. Similarly, because CO is required to remove oxygen from the iron oxide, carbon monoxide is the reducing agent. We can also identify oxidizing and reducing agents in terms of which species are undergoing each type of transformation. In a redox reaction, the substance that is oxidized causes the other substance to be reduced; it is therefore the reducing agent. The substance that is reduced causes the other substance to be oxidized; it is therefore the oxidizing agent. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Oxidation often involves the loss of hydrogen, the gain of oxygen, or the loss of electrons. Reduction often involves the gain of hydrogen, the loss of oxygen, or the gain of electrons. An oxidizing agent causes the oxidation of another species in the reaction. A reducing agent causes the reduction of another species in the reaction. Oxidations and reductions always take place together; you cannot have a complete reaction in which only one of the two processes is occurring.

What types of reactions are redox reactions? Be able to assign an oxidation number to each atom in a compound based on the given set of guidelines. Determine whether an atom is oxidized or reduced based on changes in oxidation number over the course of a chemical reaction. Give examples of typical oxidation-reduction reactions. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  oxidation number: The charge that an atom would have if all polar covalent and ionic bonds resulted in a complete transfer of electrons from the less electronegative atom to the more electronegative one. Also referred to as oxidation state. 
Introduction 	  In the previous lesson, we looked at the rusting of iron as an example of an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction. The formation of rust is summarized by the following chemical equation: Based on the definition of a redox reaction as an electron-transfer process, we can easily see that rusting is a redox reaction. Metallic iron is losing electrons (being oxidized), and nonmetallic oxygen is gaining electrons (being reduced). The result is an ionic compound composed of metal cations and nonmetal anions. There are many other examples of redox reactions between metals and nonmetals to make ionic compounds. However, not all redox reactions are so obvious. For example, consider the following reaction: An ancient cannon covered in rust. Is this a redox reaction? If so, what is being oxidized, and what is being reduced? As it turns out, this is a redox reaction. In order to determine whether electron transfers are occurring, chemists have developed a system of assigning electrons to various atoms. By assigning each valence electron in a compound to a particular atom, each atom can be given an oxidation number. In this lesson, we will learn how to determine the oxidation numbers for atoms in various compounds and how to use that information to identify whether a given reaction is a redox process. 
Rules for  Assigning  Oxidation  Numbers 	  Overall, the oxidation number (or oxidation state) of an atom is the charge that the atom would have if all polar covalent and ionic bonds resulted in a complete transfer of electrons from the less electronegative atom to the more electronegative one. Oxidation numbers can be assigned by looking at the Lewis structure for a given substance, but for many simpler compounds, they can also be assigned using the set of rules outlined below. First, the oxidation numbers for the atoms in any substance or compound must add up to the overall charge of that species. As a result: Additionally, many elements take on the same oxidation number in most or all of their compounds. a. Alkali metals have an oxidation state of +1 in their compounds. Although neutral alkali metals still have an oxidation state of zero, as soon as they react with other elements, alkali metals tend to give up their single valence electron, resulting in a charge of +1. b. Alkaline earth metals have an oxidation state of +2 in their compounds. The reasoning is the same as for the Group 1 metals. c. Aluminum tends to have an oxidation state of +3 in its compounds. However, this is not always the case for some of the more electronegative members of Group 13. a. Fluorine has an oxidation state of -1 in all of its compounds. Because fluorine is the most electronegative element, it is assigned any shared electrons. The only way for fluorine to have a stable octet without an oxidation state of -1 is for it to be bonded to another fluorine atom. (The oxidation state of fluorine in F2 is zero.) b. Oxygen has an oxidation state of -2 in most of its compounds. Oxygen is the second most electronegative element, so it also tends to be assigned all shared electrons. Exceptions include O2 (oxidation state = 0), peroxides, in which two oxygen atoms are connected by a single bond (oxidation state usually = -1), and any compound in which oxygen is bonded to fluorine (pretty rare and reactive). c. Other halides often have an oxidation state of -1, but this trend breaks down when they are bonded to more electronegative atoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. a. As with other pure elements, hydrogen has an oxidation state of zero in H2. b. When bonded to other nonmetals, which are nearly all more electronegative than hydrogen, hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1. c. When bonded to metals, which are nearly all less electronegative than hydrogen, hydrogen has an oxidation state of -1. Other elements also have preferred oxidation numbers when forming compounds, but we must look at the additional elements in the compound to know which of these states is present. Some preferred oxidation states for various transition metals are shown in Table 22.1.

Hg 	  This table shows some of the possible oxidation states found in compounds of the transition metals. A solid circle represents a common oxidation state, and a ring represents a less common (energetically less favorable) oxidation state. For many compounds, all of the atoms can be assigned an oxidation state based on the rules above. Sometimes, there will be one atom in a compound whose oxidation state is not as easy to predict as the others. When this is the case, we can make use of the fact that the sum of the oxidation states must equal the overall charge of the compound. Lets take a look at how this might work: 
Example 22.1 	  Assign oxidation numbers to each atom in the compound KMnO4. Answer: Potassium is an alkali metal, so we would expect it to have an oxidation state of +1, and we can assume that oxygen has an oxidation state of -2. Overall, this is a neutral compound, so the sum of all the oxidation states must equal zero. Therefore: 
K +  Mn + 4( O) = 0 	  +1 + Mn + 4(-2) = 0 
Mn = +7 	  In this compound, manganese has an oxidation state of +7. Note that we must include an oxidation state of -2 for each of the four oxygen atoms. Lets look at another example. 
Example 22.2 	  What is the oxidation state of iron in Fe2O3? Does it have a different oxidation state in FeCl? Answer: In the first compound, we can assume that oxygen has an oxidation state of -2, since it is bonded to a metal, which would be significantly less electronegative. In iron(III) oxide, iron has an oxidation state of +3. Note that this is the same as its charge when we dissociate this compound into its ions. Because the polyatomic ion has an overall charge, the oxidation states in FeCl will add up to -2, not zero. We can assume that chlorine has an oxidation state of -1, because it is bonded to a metal and not a very electronegative nonmetal. 
Fe = +2 	  In this ion, iron has an oxidation state of +2. Both of these are common oxidation states for iron, so we must look at the surrounding atoms to determine which is present in a given compound. 
Identifying and  Analyzing  Redox  Reactions 	  The system of assigning oxidation numbers allows for a more general definition of redox reactions. A redox process is one in which the oxidation numbers of one or more atoms change over the course of the reaction. Any atom whose oxidation number becomes more positive (or less negative) is being oxidized, and an atom whose oxidation number becomes more negative (or less positive) is being reduced. By assigning oxidation numbers to each atom in a reaction, we can determine whether or not it is a redox reaction. In our previous chapter on Chemical Reactions, we talked about various different ways that reactions could be classified. Some of the reaction types we studied included combination (synthesis), decomposition, single and double replacement, and combustion. Any of these general reaction types may also be a redox reaction. In this section, we will look at examples of redox reactions that fall into each of these categories. 
Combination  Reactions 	  In combination or synthesis reactions, two chemical species combine to produce a new compound. The general expression for a combination reaction is: 
A +  B ?  	  One example of this type of reaction is the rusting of iron, which we have already looked at extensively in this chapter: Here is a short video showing the oxidation of iron. We saw in example problem 22.2 that the oxidation states of the atoms in iron (III) oxide are +3 for iron and -2 for oxygen. The atoms in the reactants are all pure elemental substances, so they have oxidation numbers of zero. Over the course of this reaction, iron is being oxidized (from 0 to +3), and oxygen is being reduced (from 0 to -2). There are many other examples of redox reactions in which two neutral elements combine to make a compound. These often take the form of a metal being oxidized and a nonmetal being reduced, resulting in an ionic compound. Two nonmetallic elements can also undergo a redox reaction of this type, in which the less electronegative element is oxidized and the more electronegative element is reduced. 
Decomposition  Reactions 	  A decomposition process is the exact opposite of a combination process; one reactant compound breaks down into two or more products: 
C ?  A +  	  For example, hydrogen peroxide will decompose over time to produce water and oxygen gas. The equation is written below, along with the oxidation numbers for each atom: +1 ?1	+1 ?2	0 In this reaction, some atoms of oxygen are being reduced to water (from -1 to -2), while others are being oxidized to molecular oxygen (from -1 to 0). For a redox decomposition reaction, the single reactant must act as both the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent. This is one type of reaction that is very difficult to recognize as a redox reaction by any of the previous definitions of oxidation and reduction; oxidation numbers must be assigned in order to see that changes in oxidation state are occurring. 
Single  Replacement  Reactions 	  Single replacement reactions are quite common and often include a pure metal reacting with an aqueous solution of an acid or a salt. They have the following generic form: 
A +  C ?  C +  	  When a reactive enough pure metal is placed in an acidic solution, the following reaction often takes place: 
Metal + acid ? metal salt + hydrogen gas 	  For example, if a piece of solid zinc is added to a solution of HCl, hydrogen bubbles will immediately start to form on the surface of the zinc: Zinc metal reacting with a solution of hydrochloric acid. Notice the hydrogen bubbles surrounding the zinc metal. At the same time, some of the zinc atoms are released into the solution as Zn2+ cations. The balanced chemical equation for this single displacement reaction is shown below. 
Zn+2 Cl ?  Zn Cl2 + H2 	  Notice how the oxidation states change for the elements involved in this process. One pure element (with an oxidation state of 0) is being oxidized (in this case, to an oxidation state of +2), and a cationic species (H+, which has an oxidation state of +1) is being reduced to a neutral element (H2, which has an oxidation state of 0). In this reaction, the chloride anion is acting as a spectator ion, so its form (and its oxidation state) does not change. Another example of a single displacement reaction is when a solid metal is placed in a solution containing cations of a less reactive metal. The metal in the solid phase will dissolve into solution as a cation, and the metal cations in solution will precipitate out of solution as a solid metal. For example, if we were to place a piece of zinc in a solution of an iron salt, the following process would take place: 
Zn+ Fe  S  O4 ?  Fe+ Zn  S  O4 	  Notice that the oxidation states only change for the two metal species. Zinc is oxidized from 0 to +2 and Fe is reduced from +2 to 0. The oxidation states of the elements in the spectator ion (SO) do not change. 
Combustion  Reactions 	  In a combustion reaction, a hydrocarbon reacts with molecular oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. The molecular oxygen (oxidation state = 0) is reduced (oxidation state = -2 in both CO2 and H2O), while the carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon are oxidized (to +4 in carbon dioxide). A familiar combustion reaction involves the burning of fossil fuels to produce heat or electricity, or to power a motor vehicle or other machine. The process of cellular respiration, in which our bodies break down sugar molecules into water and carbon dioxide in order to harness the resulting release of energy, can also be thought of as a form of combustion, albeit a relatively slow and complex one. Cellular respiration in our bodies is governed by a series of enzymatic steps, whereas burning a marshmallow in a hot fire is a fast and uncontrolled reaction. However, the gradual digestion and the fast combustion of sucrose both result in the same net reaction: C12H22O11 (sucrose) + 12 O2 ? 12 CO2 + 11 H2O Combustion reaction of a marshmallow (sucrose) and wood (cellulose). 
Lesson  Summary 	  Oxidation numbers can be defined for each atom in a compound based on a set of rules. Oxidation and reduction are currently defined according to changes in oxidation number over the course of a reaction. All elements have an oxidation number of zero in their pure form. Many elements have only one common oxidation state in chemical compounds. These can serve as guidelines for determining the oxidation states of more variable elements, using the fact that all oxidation states in a chemical species must add up to the overall charge of the atom, molecule, compound, or ion. Examples of redox reactions are found in various categories of chemical reactions, including combination, decomposition, single replacement, and combustion.

Why cant the charge of a given chemical species suffice? Be able to write half-reactions for oxidation-reduction processes. Be able to distinguish the oxidation half-reaction from the reduction half-reaction. Be able to balance redox reactions. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  half-reaction: Describes half of the redox reaction process. Study the following diagram, which depicts the mass change that occurs when steel wool burns in air. What happens to the mass of the steel wool as the reaction proceeds? Given that mass must be conserved in chemical reactions (it cannot come from nowhere), what is your explanation for the change in the mass of the steel wool? 
Introduction 	  You have already learned the basic methods for balancing chemical equations to describe chemical reactions. Sometimes complicated reactions can be identified as redox reactions, in which case a special method of balancing chemical equations can be used to simplify the process and prevent unnecessary guessing and checking. In this lesson you will learn how to use this method. 
Oxidation- Reduction  Half- Reactions 	  In some cases, it can be helpful to analyze the oxidation and reduction processes separately for a complete redox reaction. A half-reaction contains only half of the entire redox process. One half-reaction illustrates the oxidation component and is the oxidation half-reaction; the other illustrates the reduction component and is the reduction half-reaction. For example, consider the following combination reaction: ZnS(aq)+2O2(g) ? ZnSO4(aq) First, we need to assign oxidation states to each atom. Some of these compounds have multiple atoms for which the oxidation states are not easily predicted. However, if we convert this to an ionic equation, our task becomes simpler: 
Zn 	  On the reactant side, each component is a pure element, so the oxidation states are simply equal to the charge of the ion or molecule. Zinc has an oxidation state of +2, sulfur is -2, and oxygen is 0. Now look at the product side. Zinc is still a monatomic ion with a charge of +2, so nothing has changed. Zinc is a spectator ion. In the sulfate ion, we can assume that oxygen has its usual oxidation state of -2. The oxidation state of sulfur can then be calculated as follows: 
S = +6 	  Based on the changes in oxidation number, we can identify the oxidation and reduction processes separately. The oxidized element, sulfur, is losing electrons, and the reduced element, oxygen, is gaining them. The superscript of zero on the reactant oxygen atom simply indicates that it begins with an oxidation state of 0. S2? ? S6+ +8e? Oxidation Half-Reaction O0 +2e? ? O2? Reduction Half-Reaction Note that these are purely theoretical processes. Sulfur does not physically become an ion with a charge of +6, because electrons are not fully transferred from the sulfur anion to the oxygen atoms. Additionally, the oxygen atoms dont exist as neutral, isolated species; they are always covalently bonded to at least one other atom. However, being able to break a reaction down into theoretical half-reactions is a useful tool, as we will see in the next section and in the following chapter on Electrochemistry. 
Using  Half- Reactions to  Balance  Equations 	  One use for half-reactions is to help balance very complex chemical equations. We will illustrate the overall process with a simple reaction first. Lets say that we were given the unbalanced version of the combination reaction from the previous section. ZnS(aq)+O2(g) ? ZnSO4(aq) Pretend for a moment that this was not a very easy equation to balance by trial and error. We determined that this could be broken down into the following half-reactions: S2? ? S6+ +8e? O0 +2e? ? O2? In the complete reaction, both of these processes occur simultaneously. However, free electrons are not actually a reactant or product of this reaction. In order for the electrons to cancel out, we would need the number of electrons lost by oxidation to be equal to the number gained during reduction. This can be accomplished by multiplying the entire second reaction by 4: S2? ? S6+ +8e? For the electron flow in this reaction to be balanced, four oxygen atoms are reduced for each sulfur atom that is oxidized. Therefore, for each unit of ZnS (which contains one sulfur atom), we would need two molecules of O2 (four oxygen atoms total). The ratio of reactants must be the following: ZnS(aq)+2O2(g) ? We can then find the coefficient of the product (in this case, 1) by inspection: ZnS(aq)+2O2(g) ? ZnSO4(aq) Now that we have seen the basic procedure, lets try a more difficult problem. 
Example 22.3 	  Balance the following equation using the half-reaction method: KMnO4(aq)+KNO2(aq)+H2SO4(aq) ? MnSO4(aq)+H2O(l)+KNO3(aq)+K2SO4(aq) Answer: First, determine which atoms are being oxidized and which are being reduced. In order to assign oxidation numbers, we should convert this molecular equation into an ionic one (no coefficients are used, since we are not starting with a balanced equation anyway): 
K+(aq)+ Mn O	  Mn	 	  There are 6 elements in this reaction. All of the monatomic ions have oxidation numbers equal to their charges. Additionally, we can assign an oxidation state of -2 to each oxygen atom and +1 to each hydrogen atom. Now, we just need to assign the oxidation states of manganese in MnO4?, nitrogen in the nitrite and nitrate ions, and sulfur in the sulfate ion. These can be determined by choosing a value for which all of the oxidation states in the ion add up to its overall charge. For example, in the nitrite ion: 
N = +3 	  Nitrogen has an oxidation number of +3 in the nitrite ion. Similar reasoning shows us that manganese is +7 in MnO4?, nitrogen is +5 in NO3?, and sulfur is +6 in SO. The only two elements that change oxidation numbers over the course of the reaction are Mn (from +7 in MnO4? to +2 in Mn2+) and N (from +3 in NO2? to +5 in NO3?). Thus, we can write the two half-reactions as follows: N3+ ? N5+ +2e? 
Mn7+ +5e? ?  Mn2+ 	  In order to equalize the number of electrons for these two half-reactions, we need to multiply the oxidation portion by 5 and the reduction portion by 2: For every five nitrogen atoms that are oxidized, two manganese atoms are reduced. Now lets look back at the original equation: KMnO4(aq)+KNO2(aq)+H2SO4(aq) ? MnSO4(aq)+H2O(l)+KNO3(aq)+K2SO4(aq) Nitrogen and manganese are each in only one compound on each side of the equation. Start by putting the coefficients from the balanced half-reactions on their corresponding compounds: The coefficients for KMnO4, KNO2, MnSO4, and KNO3, are now set, but we can alter the coefficients on H2SO4, H2O, and K2SO4 to finish balancing the equation. In order for potassium to be balanced, the coefficient on K2SO4 must be 1. Then, H2SO4 is the last unbalanced compound that contains sulfur. In order for sulfur to be balanced (3 atoms on each side), H2SO4 must have a coefficient of 3. Finally, hydrogen and oxygen can be balanced by changing the coefficient on H2O. There are 6 hydrogen atoms on the left side, so water would need a coefficient of 3. Double-checking our oxygen atoms, we see that there are 30 on each side. This is a fully balanced equation. Of course, most of the equations that you will be required to balance are not this difficult. However, it does demonstrate that using the half-reaction method gives you a good starting point for balancing especially complicated redox reactions. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Oxidation-reduction half-reactions single out the changes in oxidation state of certain elements within a chemical equation. Balancing the electrons lost and gained in two simultaneously occurring half-reactions can be used to help balance complicated redox equations.

Explanation and practice for balancing redox equations: http://www.mpcfaculty.net/mark_bishop/redox_balance_ oxidation.htm 	  Although oxidation and reduction processes must occur simultaneously, they do not necessarily have to occur in the same space. How can this be used to generate electricity, which is essentially the flow of electrons through a wire? 
Electrochemistry 	  There is worldwide concern about the relationship between climate change and the use of fossil fuels. Many scientists believe that increased use of these fuels (in vehicles and other gas-powered equipment) has the potential to irreversibly damage our environment. In addition to the environmental concerns, supplies of fossil fuels are finite, and because they are non-renewable energy sources, we will eventually need alternatives. New developments in batteries and other energy storage devices are being explored to help deal with these issues. Electrochemical processes are at the heart of these new technologies.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  Write half reactions for the following redox process: What is being oxidized, and what is being reduced? 
Introduction 	  Electrochemistry is the study of chemical processes that occur at the interface between an electron conductor, such as a wire, and a solution of electrolytes, which is often simply an ionic substance dissolved in water. Electrochemical processes involve a transfer of electrons between the wire and the solution. These reactions can be used to create electrical power, to purify metals, and to carry out a number of useful chemical transformations. 
The  Activity  Series 	  In the previous chapter, we looked at a number of oxidation-reduction reactions. We assumed that the reactions occurred as written, but how do we know that a certain redox reaction will take place without actually running the experiment? Which metals will react with water or acid? How do we know if one metal will undergo a singlereplacement reaction with a solution of a different metal cation? Detailed study has made possible the construction of an activity series, sometimes referred to as the electromotive series, in which various neutral metals are ranked by their ability to lose electrons (to undergo oxidation). The most reactive metals are listed at the top and will undergo a reaction simply by exposure to moisture. As we go down the list, we find that some other metals will react with water, but only at elevated temperatures. Others will not react with pure water but will undergo redox processes in the presence of acid. Finally, some of the least active metals are inert even when submerged in very acidic solutions. 
Na 	  Reacts with water, steam, and acids to produce H2 and metal hydroxides 
Cr 	  Reacts with steam and acids to produce H2 and metal hydroxides 
H2 	  Will not react with water, but reacts with acids to produce H2 and metal salts 
Cu 	  Will not react with water or acids to form H2; forms oxides with O2 
Au 	  Found as a pure element in nature; oxides decompose with heating This table summarizes a lot of useful information. For example, cations of a given metal can be reduced back to their elemental form by any more active metal (higher in the activity series), but not by less active metals. For example, we can predict that the following reaction will occur spontaneously: Potassium is more active than magnesium. Potassium has a stronger driving force causing it to give up its valence electrons than magnesium, so we are left with K+ cations instead of Mg2+ cations at the end of the reaction. Similarly, we would predict that the following reaction would not occur spontaneously as written: 
Sn +  Fe2+ ?  Sn2+ +  Fe 	  Iron is more active than tin, so neutral iron could be used to reduce tin cations, but not the other way around. The activity series (sometimes referred to as the electromotive series) is a very useful tool as we explore how to generate electric currents. 
Galvanic  Cells 	  One of the many useful applications of electrochemistry is in the generation of electric current. We saw earlier how electrons can be transferred from one atom to another in an oxidation-reduction reaction. If we place a strip of metallic zinc in a solution of copper sulfate, we will soon see a single-displacement reaction, in which zinc is oxidized to its corresponding cations, and the copper cations will plate out on the strip as neutral copper. The electron transfer from the zinc to the copper is direct, because the metal surface is in direct contact with the ions in the solution. Alternatively, we can channel the electron flow from zinc to copper through a wire by using a voltaic cell. Forcing the electrons to travel through a wire in order to get from one species to another allows us to harness that energy and use it to perform mechanical work, something that is not possible for the situation described above in which the oxidizing and reducing agents were in direct contact. The first such cell was developed by Alessandro Volta in 1800. Similar concepts were explored by Luigi Galvani in the late 1700s, so these cells are often referred to as galvanic cells. A typical cell is illustrated in Figure 23.1. There are two major components to this cell. A solution of Zn(NO3)2 (on the left) has a zinc strip immersed in it. On the right, we see a copper strip in a solution of Cu(NO3)2. A porous barrier separates the two solutions. The solutions are not in direct contact with one another, but ions can flow freely through the barrier. The two metal strips are connected by a wire that allows electrons to move from one strip to the other. Referring to our activity series, we see that Zn is more active than Cu. As a result, Zn will spontaneously give up its electrons to reduce copper cations, but Cu will not spontaneously reduce zinc cations. In the Figure 23.1, Zn can undergo a reaction that produces Zn2+ and two electrons. The two electrons flow through the wire (powering a meter or device if one is present) towards the copper electrode. Once the electrons reach the copper sulfate solution, they are used to reduce Cu2+ ions to metallic copper, which plates out on the copper electrode. When a metal plates out, it is transferred from an aqueous ion in solution to a neutral metal atom in its solid form. The porous disk allows for the transfer of anions from the copper side to the zinc side. During the reaction, more Zn2+ accumulates on the left side of the cell, and Cu2+ is being depleted from the right side of the cell. Without the porous disc, this would cause an unstable buildup of positive charge on the zinc side and negative charge on the copper side. To relieve this imbalance, anions essentially move through the porous disk from right to left, balancing the positive charge of the newly formed Zn2+ ions and moving away from the side with a decreasing concentration of positively charged Cu2+ ions. 
Batteries 	  Records from ancient Greece mention that Thales of Miletus (a Greek philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer who lived from 620-546 BC) rubbed fur with amber and generated a strange phenomenon, which we now call static electricity. Although the ancient Greeks did not have a good understanding of what was happening, we now have well-developed theories about how to generate and use electric currents. There are many situations where an electric current is needed to make a device work, but it is inconvenient (or impossible) to plug the device into a wall circuit. A cell phone or digital watch would not be very useful if we had to plug the device into a power outlet in order for it to function. Batteries provide us with a portable source of electricity that can be used when a power outlet is not available. The first battery was developed by Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) in 1800. He constructed a voltaic pile consisting of alternate discs of silver and zinc that were separated by paper soaked in salt water. According to some sources, Volta tested the battery by measuring the strength of the electric current. His measurement involved seeing how intense the shock produced by the battery was on a person (never a good idea). A modern battery employs oxidation-reduction reactions to generate a flow of electrons. The material being oxidized will release electrons that can flow through an electrical circuit and produce work of some sort. The electrons then flow into the material that is being reduced. This process will be illustrated through specific examples as we look at a few common types of batteries that are in use today. 
Lead- Acid  Batteries 	  One common type of battery is the type used to start a car. When the circuit is open (the poles are not connected), no electrons are flowing. However, when the circuit is closed by turning the ignition key to on, the poles are connected and electrons can flow from one pole to the other. This flow of electrons will create a spark in the engine cylinders that ignites the gasoline. The ignition causes the piston to move up and down, powering the car. A typical car battery involves two poles, one made of lead, and the other made of lead oxide. Each pole is submerged in sulfuric acid, and the two compartments (one containing each pole) are separated by a barrier that is permeable to ions and water. Based on its components, this type of battery is referred to as a lead-acid battery. The overall reaction that takes place is the following: A drawing of Alessandro Voltas voltaic pile, the first electric battery. It was built of many individual cells, each consisting of a disk of copper or silver and a disk of zinc separated by a cloth soaked in acid or brine. A 23-cell pile like this would have produced around 36 volts. 
Pb+ Pb O2 +2 H2 O4 ? 2 Pb O4 +2 H2 	  If we were to assign oxidation numbers to each atom, we would see that the only element changing state is lead. The pure lead (oxidation state = 0) is oxidized to Pb2+, and the lead (IV) oxide (oxidation state = +4) is reduced to Pb2+. We can therefore write the following two half-reactions: Pb0 ? Pb2+ + 2e? 
Pb4+ + 2e? ?  Pb2+ 	  By separating the Pb0 from the Pb4+, we can force the electrons to flow through a wire in order to complete the redox reaction. Eventually, both metal poles are converted to PbSO4, and the battery can no longer produce a flow of electrons. However, the battery can be recharged by forcing the reaction to run in the opposite direction by using an external source of energy (such as the energy given off by the combustion of gasoline). The description given above describes the process that occurs in one cell of a lead-acid battery. Because cars require a battery with a higher voltage than can be obtained with a single cell, car batteries generally consist of several cells connected together to produce the desired voltage output. A typical car battery will generate twelve volts of electricity. 
Dry  Cell  Batteries 	  The car battery is an example of a wet cell battery, because there is a liquid electrolyte (sulfuric acid) present in the system. These batteries must operate in an upright position so the liquid material does not spill out. In contrast, dry cell batteries contain a paste that serves as the positive electrode. The composition and voltage depends on the specific battery, but typical voltage outputs are in the 1.0-1.5 volt range. One common material used for the positive electrode is a mixture of ammonium chloride and manganese dioxide. The half-reaction at this pole is the following: Simplifying this to just the atom being oxidized, we get the following: 
Mn4+ + e? ?  Mn3+ 	  The electrons for this half-reaction are provided by oxidation of metallic zinc: Zn ? Zn+2 + 2e? Also included in this setup are ZnCl2 (part of the paste) and an inert carbon rod that acts as a conductor. Over time, the zinc container will be partially consumed and weakened by the oxidation half-reaction. These batteries cannot be recharged. Running the reaction in reverse would regenerate solid zinc, but not in a form that would have the same structural properties as the original container. Alkaline batteries use either NaOH or KOH in place of the ammonium chloride. The half-reactions in an alkaline battery are shown below: Zn + 2 OH? ? ZnO + H2O + 2e? This type of battery lasts longer than the ammonium chloride version, because zinc corrodes more slowly in a basic medium than it does in an acidic medium. Rechargeable dry cell batteries are used in a wide variety of applications, from small devices like digital cameras and cell phones to cars, including both hybrids that run on a combination of gas and electricity and all-electric vehicles that must be recharged after each short trip. These batteries are generally of the nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) type. In a nickel-metal hydride battery, the negative electrode is composed of nickel (II) hydroxide and some other alkaline electrolyte, such as KOH. The nickel serves as the source of electrons via the following half-reaction: Ni(OH)2 + OH? ? NiO(OH) + H2O + e? Looking only at the element that changes oxidation state (the nickel), we could also write the following: Ni2+ ? Ni3+ + e? The positive electrode is a complex mixture of neutral metals, some of which are generally rare earth metals (e.g., lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium) and others that are more plentiful (e.g., nickel, cobalt, manganese, and aluminum). The half-reaction at this electrode has the following general form: 
H2 O +  M + e? ?  H? +  	  where M is a neutral metal (oxidation number = 0), and MH is a metal hydride. Note that in metal hydrides, hydrogen has an oxidation number of -1, so the metal exists as a cation. Both half-reactions are readily reversible, allowing the battery to be recharged. 
Fuel  Cells 	  There are a wide variety of different fuel cells available. Many are large devices that would be most suitable for stationary generators. The type we will consider in this section is portable and can be used to power a car or similar vehicle. This cell is referred to as a polymer exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The basic operation of this type of fuel cell involves an initial reaction of hydrogen gas with the platinum catalyst (purple area), which facilitates the following half-reaction: H2 ? 2 H+ + 2 e? The electrons are passed through the circuit, providing energy to the system, while the hydrogen ions move across the proton exchange membrane (the red area), which is permeable only to cations. At the other electrode, oxygen from the air reacts with electrons that have gone through the external circuit and the protons that pass through the red membrane area according to the following equation: 
O2 + 4  H+ + 4 e? ? 2  H2 	  One major advantage of a hydrogen fuel cell is that the only waste product is water (and leftover nitrogen from the air, which is not involved in any chemical reactions). However, a major drawback is the need for pure hydrogen, which is flammable and difficult to store. A variety of techniques are being explored in an attempt to solve this storage problem. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The activity series (or electromotive series) ranks metals in terms of their ability to be oxidized. Batteries are based on galvanic (voltaic) cells, which use oxidation-reduction reactions to generate a flow of electrons that can be employed for useful work. The lead-acid battery in a car is a wet cell battery in which there is a net transfer of electrons from Pb to PbO2. Dry cell batteries use a paste instead of a liquid solution. A common type of dry cell battery uses zinc as a reducing agent and a manganese compound as an oxidizing agent. One type of rechargeable battery uses water as the electron acceptor, resulting in the formation of metal hydrides. These can easily be converted back to the original metal by running the reaction in the reverse direction using an external energy source. A common type of fuel cell uses the platinum catalyzed reaction between hydrogen and oxygen gases to generate power.

In the next lesson, we will learn how to determine the amount of electricity generated by an electrochemical cell. Diagram and explain the operation of a standard hydrogen cell. Explain how to determine standard reduction potentials. Use standard reduction potentials to calculate the total potential of a given electrochemical cell. Use the Nernst equation to calculate reduction potentials under non-standard conditions. 
Lesson  Vocabulary 	  electrical potential: A measurement of the ability of a voltaic cell to produce an electric current; typically measured in volts (V). standard reduction potential: A measurement of the tendency of a given half-reaction to occur as a reduction in an electrochemical cell. cell potential: The difference in standard reduction potentials between the two half-cells in an electrochemical cell. standard cell potential: The potential of an electrochemical cell when the temperature is 25C, all aqueous components are present at a concentration of 1 M, and all gases are at the standard pressure of 1 atm. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) : A reference half-cell that can be used with another electrode (half-cell) to determine its standard reduction potential. anode: The cell in which the oxidation takes place. cathode: The cell in which the reduction takes place. How do you use the activity series to determine whether a given redox reaction will occur spontaneously? 
Introduction 	  When designing electrochemical cells such as batteries, scientists and engineers must be able to calculate electrical potentials in order to create powerful and sensible energy sources. By comparing and combining reduction reactions, different cell potentials can be obtained and utilized to conduct an effective electric current. In this lesson you will learn how to predict whether or not a redox reaction will occur spontaneously based on the electrical potentials of various cells. 
Reduction  Potential 	  The activity series that was presented in the previous lesson allows us to predict the relative reactivities of different materials when used in oxidation-reduction processes. We also saw that appropriate combinations of half-reactions can be used to generate an electric current. However, we have not yet looked at the energy changes associated with any of these redox reactions. Electrical potential is a measurement of the ability of a voltaic cell to produce an electric current. It is typically measured in volts (V). Like energy, electrical potential is a relative term; it can only be measured by comparison with something else. The voltage that is produced by a given voltaic cell is the difference in electrical potential between the two half-cells, but it is not possible to measure the electrical potential of an isolated half-cell. For example, if only a zinc half-cell were constructed, no complete redox reaction can occur, so no electrical potential can be measured. It is only when another half-cell is combined with the zinc half-cell that an electrical potential difference, or voltage, can be measured. The electrical potential of a cell results from a competition for electrons between two different chemical species. The "winner" of this battle is reduced (gains electrons), while the "loser" is oxidized (loses electrons). A standard reduction potential measures the tendency of a given half-reaction to occur as a reduction in an electrochemical cell. In a given voltaic cell, the half-cell that has the greater reduction potential is the one in which reduction will occur. In the half-cell with the lower reduction potential, the reverse process (oxidation) will occur. The cell potential (Ecell) is the difference in standard reduction potential between the two half-cells in an electrochemical cell. 
Standard  Cell  Potentials 	  The standard cell potential (Ecell) is the potential of an electrochemical cell when the temperature is 25C, all aqueous components are present at a concentration of 1 M, and all gases are at the standard pressure of 1 atm. The standard cell potential can be calculated by finding the difference between the standard reduction potentials of the two half-cells. 
E?cell =  E?red ? E?oxid 	  Since the reduction potentials for half-cells cannot be measured independently, it is necessary to establish a standard to serve as a reference. This reference is given a standard reduction potential of 0 volts by definition. Every other half-cell can then be compared to this standard electrode in order to determine the reduction potential for any halfcell. The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is a reference half-cell that can be used with another electrode (half-cell) to determine its standard reduction potential. A standard hydrogen electrode is shown in Figure 23.8. The electrode itself is made of platinum, which serves as an inert surface upon which the oxidation or reduction reaction takes place. The electrode is then placed in contact with both hydrogen gas (at a pressure of 1 atm) and an acidic solution in which the concentration of H+ is 1.0 M. Written as a reduction, the following half-reaction takes place in a SHE: Depending on the relative electrical potential of other half-cell that the SHE is combined with, the hydrogen ions may be reduced or the hydrogen gas may be oxidized. In general, reversing a reaction will also reverse the sign of the corresponding electrical potential. However, reversing the above reaction has no effect on the standard potential, because the opposite of zero is still zero. 
H2(g) ? 2 H+(aq)+2e?	 E? = 0.00  	  The standard hydrogen electrode is an arbitrary reference cell that is assigned a standard reduction potential of 0.00 V. 
Determining  Standard  Reduction  Potentials 	  When a standard hydrogen half-cell is connected to a standard copper half-cell and connected to a voltmeter ( Figure 23.9 (A)), the reading is 0.34 V. Oxidation: H2(g) ? 2H+(aq)+2e? Reduction: Cu2+ +2e? ? Cu(s) Overall: H2(g)+Cu2+(aq) ? 2H+(aq)+Cu(s) Observation of the cell shows that the copper(II) ion is reduced to copper metal, while the hydrogen gas is oxidized to hydrogen ions. This is shown below along with the overall reaction taking place in the cell. In this particular galvanic cell, the SHE is the anode (where oxidation takes place), and the copper half-cell is the cathode (where reduction takes place). Electrons flow from the SHE to the copper electrode. The standard cell potential (E) is the measured value of 0.34 V, while the potential of the SHE is defined to be zero. This allows us to determine the reduction potential of the copper half-cell. 
E? Cu = 0.34  V?0.00  V = +0.34  	  (A) The standard hydrogen half-cell is paired with a Cu/Cu2+ half-cell. H2 is oxidized, while Cu2+ is reduced. (B) The standard hydrogen half-cell is paired with a Zn/Zn2+ half-cell. Zn is oxidized, while H+ is reduced. The standard reduction potential for the Cu2+|Cu half-cell is thus equal to +0.34 V. In a similar way, the reduction potential for any half-cell can be determined by connecting it to a SHE and measuring the voltage. Notice the line notation used for the copper half-cell, Cu2+|Cu, which indicates the phase boundary between the aqueous copper cations and the neutral copper metal atoms. This line notation is used as a standard to distinguish between the components of the electric cell. Oxidation: Zn(s) ? Zn2+(aq)+2e? Reduction: Overall: Zn(s)+2H+(aq) ? Zn2+(aq)+H2(g) When a standard hydrogen half-cell is connected to a standard zinc half-cell ( Figure 23.9 (B)), the measured voltage is 0.76 V. However, it is observed that the zinc electrode is oxidized to zinc ions while the hydrogen ion is reduced to hydrogen gas. The SHE is now the cathode, while the zinc electrode is the anode. Now it is the E for the oxidation half-cell that is the unknown in the standard cell potential equation. 
E	76  	  The standard reduction potential for the Zn2+/Zn half-cell is equal to ?0.76 V. A negative standard reduction potential for a particular species means that is easier to reduce H+ than to reduce that species. A positive standard reduction potential for a species means that it reduces more easily than H+. The Table 23.2 lists many reduction potentials under standard conditions. From top to bottom, they are listed in decreasing order of their tendency to occur in the forward direction, as a reduction. Fluorine gas is the most easily reduced, while lithium ions are the most difficult to reduce. Note that this table is the exact opposite of the activity series. Lithium ions are very difficult to reduce, which means that lithium metal is very easy to oxidize.

Calculating  Standard  Cell  Potentials 	  In order to function, any electrochemical cell must consist of two half-cells. Table 23.2 can be used to determine the reactions that will occur and the standard cell potential for any combination of two half-cells without actually constructing the cell. The half-cell with the higher reduction potential according to the table will undergo reduction, while the half-cell with the lower reduction potential will undergo oxidation. If those specifications are followed, the overall cell potential will be a positive value. The cell potential must be positive in order for the redox reaction in the cell to be spontaneous. If a negative cell potential were calculated, the reaction would not be spontaneous. However, that reaction would be spontaneous in the reverse direction. 
Example 23.1 	  Calculate the standard cell potential of a voltaic cell that uses the Ag|Ag+ and Sn|Sn2+ half-cell reactions. Write the balanced equation for the overall cell reaction that occurs. Identify the anode and the cathode. Answer: The silver half-cell has a reduction potential of +0.80 V, whereas the tin half-cell has a reduction potential of -0.14 V. Reduction will happen in the silver half-cell, because its standard reduction potential is more positive. The tin half-cell will undergo oxidation. Oxidation (anode): Sn(s) ? Sn2+(aq)+2e? Reduction (cathode): Ag+(aq)+e? ? Ag(s) Before adding the two reactions together, the number of electrons lost in the oxidation must equal the number of electrons gained in the reduction. The silver half-cell reaction must be multiplied by two. Then, adding in the tin half-reaction, we get the full redox process: Sn(s)+2Ag+(aq) ? Sn2+(aq)+2Ag(s) The overall cell potential can be calculated as follows: 
E?cell = +0.80  V?(?0.14  V) = +0.94  	  The standard cell potential is positive, so the reaction is spontaneous as written. Tin is oxidized at the anode, while Ag+ is reduced at the cathode. Note that the voltage for the silver ion reduction is not doubled even though the reduction half-reaction had to be doubled to balance the overall redox equation. 
The  Nernst  Equation 	  Up to this point, our discussion of cell potentials has focused on the standard states. However, in real life we will rarely be using standard state conditions, so we need a way to work with more practical situations. For conditions that are not standard-state, we use the Nernst equation, named after the German chemist Walther Nernst (winner of the 1920 Nobel Prize in Chemistry). The Nernst equation has the following form: 
E  ln  	  where E is the reaction potential under the actual conditions, E is the reaction potential under standard conditions, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/Kmol), T is the temperature (in Kelvin), n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox reaction, F is a value known as the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and Q is the reaction quotient. Recall that the reaction quotient takes the same form as the equilibrium constant expression, except that it is true even when the reaction is not at equilibrium. For example, the reaction quotient for the following generic reaction is given below: aA+bB ? cC+dD [C]c[D]d 
Q = [ A]a[ B]b 	  If the reaction is run at the standard temperature of 25C, and it is just the concentrations that are non-standard, the Nernst equation simplifies as follows: 
E =  E? ? 0.02569n volts ln  	  Or, if you prefer base-10 logarithms: 
E =  E? ? 0.05619n volts log  	  Lets look at an example problem to see how this equation is used. 
Example  Problem 23.2 	  Calculate the cell potential at 25C for the following reaction: Cu(s) + 2Fe3+(aq) ? Cu2+(aq) + 2Fe2+(aq) The ions are present in the following concentrations: 1.0 x 10?4 M Fe3+, 0.25 M Cu2+, and 0.20 M Fe2+. Answer: The Nernst equation has the following form at 25C: 
E =  E? ? 0.05619n volts log  	  In order to find the cell potential (E), we need to find values for E, n, and Q. Lets start by splitting this reaction into half-reactions. Because there are only two different metals, we can easily see that the unbalanced half-reactions will have the following forms: Cu(s) ? Cu2+(aq) Then, balance each of these half-reactions by adding electrons to the appropriate side (enough to balance the charge on each side of the equation): Cu(s) ? Cu2+(aq) + 2e? This gives us two pieces of information. First, we know that the value of n in the Nernst equation is equal to 2 (the coefficient of the electrons in the balanced half-reactions above). Second, we know that copper is being oxidized and iron is being reduced. Now, look at the table of standard reduction potentials to find the appropriate values. What we will find are values for the following two half-reactions: Cu2+(aq) + 2e? ? Cu(s) Fe3+(aq) + e? ? Fe2+(aq) The reduction of Cu2+(aq) to Cu(s) has a standard potential of +0.34 V, and the reduction of Fe3+(aq) to Fe2+(aq) has a standard potential of +0.77 V. To find E for this complete cell, we subtract the reduction potential of the species being oxidized from the reduction potential of the ion actually being reduced: 
Ecell = +0.43 	  Note: We can also think of this as reversing the sign of the oxidation half-reaction (from +0.34 to -0.34) and then adding the two values together ((+0.77) + (-0.34) = +0.43). However, do not get mixed up and reverse the sign twice! Next, we can determine Q, which has the following form for this reaction: [Cu2+][Fe2+]2 
Q = 1.0106 	  Finally, plug all of these values into the Nernst equation: 
E = 0.43  V?0.17  V  E = 0.26  	  Under the given conditions, this electrochemical cell has a potential of +0.26 V. 
Practice  Problem 23.1 	  Calculate the cell potential at 25C for the following reaction: Fe(s) + Co2+(aq) ? Fe2+(aq) + Co(s) The ions are present in the following concentrations: 0.050 M Fe2+ and 0.020 M Co2+. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The ability of a particular electrochemical cell to generate an electric current is called its electrical potential. Reduction potentials measure the tendency of a substance to be reduced in a redox reaction. The standard hydrogen electrode is arbitrarily assigned a standard reduction potential of 0.00 V, and it serves as a reference by which all other half-cell potentials are measured. The standard cell potential for any electrochemical cell can be determined by finding the difference in reduction potentials between the two half-cells. The cell potential must be positive for the overall reaction to be spontaneous. Reduction potentials can be used to make predictions about whether reactions will occur and whether a particular oxidizing or reducing agent is strong enough for a given purpose. The Nernst equation allows for the calculation of cell potentials under non-standard conditions.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  electrolysis: The process in which electrical energy is used to cause a nonspontaneous chemical reaction to occur. electrolytic cell: The apparatus used for carrying out an electrolysis reaction; consists of an electrolyte to carry charge and two electrodes. electrometallurgy: A technique of extracting and purifying metals from their ores through use of electrolysis. 
Electrolysis 	  A galvanic cell uses a spontaneous redox reaction to generate an electric current. It is also possible to do the opposite. When an external source of direct current is applied to an electrochemical cell, a reaction that is normally nonspontaneous can be forced to proceed. Electrolysis is the process in which electrical energy is used to cause a nonspontaneous chemical reaction to occur. Electrolysis is responsible for the metal coatings that appear on many everyday objects, such as gold-plated or silver-plated jewelry and chrome-plated car bumpers. An electrolytic cell is the apparatus used for carrying out an electrolysis reaction. Figure 23.11 shows an electrolytic cell composed of Zn|Zn2+ and Cu|Cu2+ half-cells. Recall that in the last section, this same pair of half-cells was used as an example of a voltaic cell. In the spontaneous direction, Zn metal is oxidized to Zn2+ ions while Cu2+ ions are reduced to Cu metal. In a voltaic cell, the zinc electrode would be the anode and the copper electrode would be the cathode. However, when the same half-cells are connected to a battery via an external wire, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction. The zinc electrode is now the cathode and the copper electrode is the anode. Oxidation (anode): Cu(s) ? Cu2+(aq)+2e? 
E0 = ?0.34  	  Reduction (cathode): Zn2+(aq)+2e? ? Zn(s) 
E0 = ?0.76  	  Overall reaction: Cu(s)+Zn2+(aq) ? Cu2+(aq)+Zn(s) 
E0cell = ?1.10  	  An electrolytic cell uses an external power source (a battery) to drive a nonspontaneous reaction. The copper half-cell undergoes oxidation, while the zinc halfcell undergoes reduction. The standard cell potential is negative, indicating a nonspontaneous reaction. The battery must be capable of delivering at least 1.10 V of direct current in order for the reaction to occur. 
Electrolysis of  Molten  Sodium  Chloride 	  Several electrolysis reactions are commonly performed on a large scale for the commercial production of certain substances. For example, molten (liquid) sodium chloride can be electrolyzed to produce sodium metal and chlorine gas. The electrolytic cell used in this process is called a Downs cell ( Figure 23.12). Oxidation (anode): 
E0 = ?1.36  	  Reduction (cathode): Na+(l)+e? ? Na(l) 
E0 = ?2.71  	  Overall reaction: 
E0cell = ?4.07  	  In a Downs cell, the liquid sodium ions are reduced at the cathode to liquid sodium metal. At the anode, liquid chloride ions are oxidized to chlorine gas. The reactions and cell potentials are shown below. The battery must supply over 4 volts to carry out this electrolysis.	This reaction is a major industrial source of A Downs cell is used for the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. Liquid sodium metal is produced at the cathode, while chlorine gas is produced at the anode. chlorine gas, and it is the primary way to obtain pure sodium metal. Chlorine gas is widely used as a disinfectant, such as in swimming pools. 
Electrolysis of  Water 	  The electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen gases. The electrolytic cell consists of a pair of platinum electrodes immersed in water containing a small amount of an electrolyte, such as H2SO4. The electrolyte is necessary because pure water does not contain enough ions to effectively conduct a current. At the anode, water is oxidized to oxygen gas and hydrogen ions. At the cathode, water is reduced to hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions. Oxidation (anode): 
E0 = ?1.23  	  Reduction (cathode): 
Overall reaction:	2 H	06  	  The hydrogen ion and hydroxide ions produced in each reaction combine to form water, resulting in the net reaction shown above. The added electrolyte is not consumed in the reaction. In this process, the hydrogen in the water is reduced (from +1 to 0) and the oxygen is oxidized (from -2 to 0). This process was discovered in 1800 by William Nicholson and Johann Ritter. One modern-day application is the generation of oxygen for use in sealed vehicles, such as spacecrafts and submarines. 
Electrolysis of  Aqueous  Sodium  Chloride 	  Earlier we examined the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. It may be logical to assume that the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride, called brine, would yield the same result by the same reactions. However, the reduction reaction that occurs at the cathode does not produce sodium metal, because the water is reduced instead. This is because the reduction potential for water is only ?0.83 V compared to ?2.71 V for the reduction of sodium ions. This makes the reduction of water preferable, because its reduction potential is less negative. Chlorine gas is still produced at the anode, just as in the electrolysis of molten NaCl. Oxidation (anode): 
E0 = ?1.36  	  Reduction (cathode): 
Overall reaction:	2 Cl	06  	  Since the hydroxide ion is also a product of the net reaction, the important chemical sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is obtained by evaporating the water after the hydrolysis is complete. 
Electrometallurgy 	  The extraction of metals from ores and the purification of metals is often accomplished using electrometallurgy. Most metals are found in nature in an oxidized form (usually an oxide or a sulfide) called an ore. If the ore is either dissolved in an aqueous solution or melted, passing an electric current through the material causes the pure metal to be deposited on one of the electrodes. This process was used by the English chemist Humphrey Davy to isolate metallic sodium from a solution of sodium hydroxide, and several other elements were discovered in the next several years using this same technique. We saw earlier that sodium is most commonly produced by electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. Many other metals are also isolated and purified using electrometallurgy techniques, including gold, silver, copper, aluminum, lead, and many alkali and rare earth metals. For some metals, this is the only financially viable method of extraction and purification. In addition to the production of a desired metal, these techniques are also being studied for use in the processing of nuclear wastes and the cleanup of environmental contamination by toxic metals. Aluminum is one example of a substance that was very rare in its pure form before electrometallurgy techniques were developed but is now extremely common. Aluminum ore (bauxite) is predominantly aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Refinement of the metal by simple heating, as is done with iron ore, is ineffective, because the melting point of the aluminum ore is so high (>2000C). Instead, the bauxite is first mixed with sodium hydroxide at high temperatures to remove the other contaminants from the aluminum oxide. This material is then recrystallized and separated from other ore residues. Then, the purified aluminum oxide is dissolved in a molten mixture of calcium fluoride and cryolite (an aluminum fluoride-sodium fluoride salt that melts at 1012C). The lower melting point of the cryolite allows the aluminum ore to dissolve at a temperature that is much lower than its own melting point. The resulting solution is then electrolyzed using carbon electrodes at a temperature of 950-980Udeg;C. The aluminum cations are reduced to neutral aluminum at the cathode (Al3+ ? Al0), and the oxygen anions are oxidized back to molecular oxygen at the anode (2 O2? ? O2). One problem with current methods of aluminum production is the generation of environmental contaminants. Hydrogen fluoride gas is an extremely corrosive and toxic byproduct that must be trapped and neutralized. Other fluorides and metals contaminants can also pollute water, soil, and air if not carefully managed. A major expense in the refinement of aluminum is the cost of electrical power. Refining plants are usually located in areas where electricity is abundant and less expensive. Producing aluminum from recycled materials uses only about 5% of the electricity needed to produce the aluminum from bauxite, which makes aluminum recycling profitable as well as environmentally beneficial. 
Corrosion 	  Corrosion involves the formation of an oxidized form of a metal by an electrochemical process. A common example is the rusting of iron when exposed to water and oxygen. The tarnishing of silver and the red or green deposits formed on copper are other examples. Corrosion in all its forms costs the U.S. millions of dollars each year in expenses for metal replacement. Rust formation involves a complex series of reactions that are still not well-understood. The first part of the overall process appears to be the following reaction: The iron then undergoes further oxidation in the presence of O2 to form ferric oxide (Fe2O3). The complete process is somewhat more complex. The corrosion of copper involves a reaction with carbonic acid, which is formed when atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolves in water. This acid is weak and unstable, but it can produce significant damage over time. The reaction between copper and carbonic acid generates copper carbonate, which is responsible for the familiar blue-green layer seen on structures such as the Statue of Liberty. Silver will tarnish through a similar type of reaction with hydrogen sulfide, which is found in low concentrations in the atmosphere and is often generated by foods with a high sulfur content, such as eggs. The tarnish in this case is silver sulfide (Ag2S). One common approach to minimize the corrosion of metals is to attach a strip of a more active metal, sometimes called a sacrificial metal, to the structure. For example, putting aluminum rings on iron or steel structures helps prevent rusting. Since aluminum is higher than iron in the activity series, it can be used to reduce iron cations back to neutral Fe. Eventually, the aluminum will all be converted to Al3+ cations and must be replaced. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Electrolysis uses an external source of electricity to drive nonspontaneous redox reactions. Several metals (including sodium and aluminum) are manufactured using electrolytic processes. Corrosion involves the deterioration of a neutral metal into an oxidized form, which exists as an ionic complex with oxide, sulfide, carbonate, or other anions. Attaching strips of neutral metals that are higher in the activity series can protect a structure from corrosion.

Cell potentials in biology are another useful application of electrochemistry. 
Nuclear  Chemistry 	  Cherenkov radiation is produced when charged particles move through water faster than the speed at which light travels through water. Water molecules are excited by this process, and when the excited molecules return to their ground state, they release photons that produce the blue light seen in the figure above. One of the places where this type of situation commonly occurs is inside nuclear reactors. Water is used to cool the rods containing radioactive material in nuclear reactors, which use emissions from radioisotopes to produce heat that can drive a turbine and generate electricity. Nuclear power plants are used in many countries around the world. As of 2013, there are 434 operational nuclear plants around the world, over 100 of which are found in the U.S. In 2012, nuclear power accounted for 19% of the total U.S. production of electricity. Radioactivity is poorly understood by the general public. Images of nuclear bombs and runaway power plant incidents are of great concern to many. However, there are many useful applications, including medical imaging and treatment using radioisotopes. In this chapter, we will explore basic ideas about radioactivity and see how we can use this phenomenon for constructive purposes.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  How are mass number and atomic number related to the amounts of different subatomic particles in a particular atom? What is different about multiple isotopes of a single element? 
A  Review of  Isotopes 	  John Dalton first proposed his atomic theory in an 1804 lecture to the Royal Institution, a prestigious British scientific society. In this talk, he put forth the idea that all atoms of an element were identical and that atoms were indestructible. In a little over 100 years, both of these ideas were shown to be incorrect. Studies on atomic weights led Frederick Soddy (1877-1956) to the conclusion in 1913 that atoms of a single element can have more than one possible atomic weight. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work in 1921. At least by our current understanding, a given atom can be defined by its atomic number and its mass number. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus. All atoms with a given atomic number are the same element, because the chemical properties of an atom are primarily determined by the number of positive charges in its nucleus (and therefore the number of negatively charged electrons needed to make it neutral). The mass number of an atom is equal to the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. Since these particles both have a mass of approximately 1 amu and electrons are much smaller, the mass number is approximately equal to the mass of the atom in units of amu. Isotopes are atoms that have the same atomic number but different atomic weights. The difference in weight is due to variations in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. Because they are uncharged, a slight difference in the number of neutrons has very little effect on the chemical properties of a given atom. We can designate the mass number of an isotope (and sometimes the atomic number as well) using numbers to the left of the chemical symbol. The top number is the mass number, and the bottom number (if any) is the atomic number. For example, one isotope of krypton is the following: Because an atomic number of 36 is implied by the fact that this is an atom of krypton, we can also write this as just 84Kr. Other ways to designate this isotope are krypton-84 or Kr-84. The number of neutrons in the nucleus of this isotope can be determined by subtracting the atomic number (36) from the mass number (84), giving a value of 48 neutrons. Remember that the atomic weights listed on the modern periodic table are weighted averages of all naturally occurring isotopes. For example, the atomic weight of Cl is listed as 35.453, even though none of the isotopes of chlorine actually have that atomic weight. Chlorine has many possible isotopes ranging from 28Cl to 51Cl, but essentially all naturally occurring chlorine atoms are either 35Cl or 37Cl. Based on the ~3:1 ratio in which these isotopes occur, the average atomic weight of chlorine is 35.453 amu. Even though no individual chlorine atom has a mass of 35.453 amu, a mole of naturally occurring chlorine atoms will have a mass of 35.453 grams. 
Discovery of  Radioactivity 	  In 1896, a researcher named Henri Becquerel was studying the phosphorescent properties of uranium salts. He believed these properties were related to X-rays, which had just been discovered the previous year by Wilhelm Rntgen. However, he soon found that certain properties of the radiation emitted from uranium did not match those of X-rays. For example, uranium could expose a photographic plate without any external input of energy. By placing a metal cross between the plate and the radioactive uranium salt, a shadow is left on the plate due to the effects of exposure to radioactivity. Pierre and Marie Curie further studied the properties of uranium salts in order to understand the details of this newly discovered radioactivity. The major contributions to their work came from Marie, who showed that the amount of radioactivity present was due to the amount of a specific element in the sample and was not the result of a chemical reaction. She discovered the element polonium and named it after her native Poland. Madame Curie shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre along with Henri Becquerel. She won the Nobel Prize again in 1911 for her work in Chemistry. Later on, Ernest Rutherford (whose name you may remember from the Gold Foil Experiment) showed that there are three distinct types of radioactive emissions that differ in their mass, their charge, and their ability to penetrate through various materials. He did not yet know what these emissions were, and designated them as alpha (?), beta (?), and gamma (?) radiation. We now know that radioactivity involves the spontaneous emission of matter and/or energy from the nucleus of an atom. The most common radioactive atoms have high atomic numbers and contain a large excess of neutrons. All isotopes of elements with an atomic number of 84 (polonium) or higher are radioactive, including familiar radioactive materials such as radon (atomic number 86), uranium (atomic number 92), and plutonium (atomic number 94). Additionally, two lighter elements (technetium, atomic number 43, and promethium, atomic number 61) have no stable isotopes. Most elements have both stable and radioactive isotopes. For example, hydrogen-1 and carbon-12 are stable, but hydrogen-3 (tritium) and carbon-14 are both radioactive. These isotopes make up an extremely small percentage of any naturally occurring sample of their respective elements. 
Alpha  Emission 	  Alpha (?) radiation was eventually found to be made up of particles that consisted of two protons bound to two neutrons. In other words, an alpha particle was simply the nucleus of a helium-4 atom. Because it does not have any electrons, the alpha particle carries a charge of +2. In nuclear equations, alpha particles can be represented by any of the following symbols: ?	2?	2 A typical alpha decay reaction is the conversion of uranium-238 to thorium-234: Many of the largest elements in the periodic table are alpha-emitters. Notice that in this nuclear equation, the total mass number and the total atomic number are both conserved. The sum of the mass numbers and atomic numbers of the products are equal to the mass number and atomic number of the parent nucleus. This is a general feature of nuclear reactions. As a result, knowing that a specific nucleus decays by emitting alpha particles allows us to predict the product nucleus; we simply need to decrease the mass number by 4 and the atomic number by 2. The change in atomic number indicates a change in the elements identity. The new element can be found by looking at the periodic table. 
Beta  Emission 	  Beta (?) emission is a slightly more complicated process. Unlike ?-emission, which simply expels some of the existing subatomic particles from the nucleus, ?-emission also involves the transformation of a neutron into a proton and an electron. The proton remains bound to the nucleus, while the electron is ejected. As it turns out, the beta radiation observed by early nuclear chemists was simply the result of ejected electrons. For historical reasons, the electron is sometimes referred to as a beta particle in this context. In nuclear equations, beta particles can be represented by any of the following symbols: ?	??		?01e	e? Although an electron technically has a very small mass, considering an electron as though its mass is zero makes it easier to balance nuclear equations. During beta decay, the parent nucleus increases its atomic number by 1, but the mass number stays the same. This follows the idea that charge is also conserved in radioactive decay. A typical beta decay process involves carbon-14, which is used in radioactive dating techniques: e 
Positron  Emission 	  A positron is the antimatter version of an electron. It has the same mass as an electron but the opposite charge. A positron can be designated by the following symbols: + 0 0 e e+ ? +1? +1 During a nuclear decay process that occurs by positron emission, a proton is converted into a neutron and a positron. The neutron remains in the nucleus, and the positron is expelled. Overall, the atomic number of the parent nucleus increases by one, and the mass number is unchanged. For example, carbon-11 emits a positron to become boron-11: Positrons represent a special case, because they are a form of antimatter. When a positron encounters an electron, the two particles annihilate one another, and all of their mass is converted to pure energy. This energy is released in the form of two gamma photons traveling in exactly opposite directions. Because of the abundance of electrons in any sample of matter, positrons will be consumed almost immediately in essentially all cases. 
Gamma  Emission 	  Gamma (?) radiation was eventually found to be very high energy electromagnetic radiation, even more energetic than X-rays. Many nuclear processes are accompanied by a large release of energy. This energy is sometimes given off as a photon of gamma radiation. For example, both alpha and beta decay are often accompanied by the emission of gamma rays. Because photons have no mass or charge, they do not affect the mass number or atomic number balance in a nuclear equation. When included in the equations, the release of gamma radiation is generally given the symbol 00?. You will not be required to predict whether a given nuclear reaction includes the release of gamma rays. 
Penetrating  Ability of  Emissions 	  The various types of emissions discussed above differ considerably in their ability to penetrate through matter. The ? particle has the lowest penetrating power, primarily because it is the largest commonly expelled particle. Related to their larger mass, ejected ? particles also move much slower than other types of nuclear decay products. A stream of ? particles can be blocked by a sheet of paper or a human hand. Beta particles (electrons) have a higher penetrating power than alpha particles, but they can still be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminum. However, the materials being bombarded with a high-energy stream of electrons can also become excited, potentially leading to additional reactivity. Of the three basic types of emissions, gamma radiation has the highest penetrating power. Thick, high density materials (such as lead) are required to stop gamma emissions. The thickness of the shielding will determine the effectiveness of the protection offered by the lead. 
Units of  Measurement 	  Radioactivity is quantified by measuring the number of decay processes per unit time. For example, we can measure radioactivity in terms of counts per minute (cpm), where each "count" is a single decay process, such as the emission of an ?-particle. A sample of one particular isotope may have an activity of 5,000 cpm, while an equal amount of another isotope might result in a radiation level of only 250 cpm. For a given nucleus, the amount of radioactivity gives a rough indication of the amount of the radioisotope present the higher the activity, the more of the radioactive isotope in the sample. The curie (Ci), named after Marie and Pierre Curie, is another unit that is commonly used to measure the rate of decay. One curie is equivalent to 3.7  1010 decay processes per second. Since this is a fairly large value, radiation is often expressed in millicuries or microcuries. Another common unit is the becquerel (Bq), named after Henri Becquerel, which is simply defined as one count per second. 
Exposure to  Radiation 	  The units discussed above give us information about the rate of decay for a radioactive sample, but they do not tell us anything about the level of exposure experienced by nearby targets, such as people. The amount of exposure and the resulting medical consequences depend on various factors, including the type of radiation, its intensity, and the length of time that the person is exposed to the radioactive material. A large amount of radiation received over a short period of time is referred to as acute exposure, whereas low levels of exposure over a long period of time are referred to as chronic exposure. Measurement of exposure to radioactivity is important for anyone who deals with radioactive materials on a regular basis. Perhaps the simplest device is a personal dosimeter, which is a film badge that will fog up when exposed to radiation. The amount of fogging is proportional to the amount of radiation present. These devices are not very sensitive to low levels of radiation, but more sensitive devices are also available that reliably measure the frequency of radioactive events. One such device is the Geiger counter. A Geiger counter is a tube filled with an inert gas that will conduct electricity when exposed to charged radiation, such as alpha or beta particles. When a charged particle enters the tube, it changes the electrical potential between the anode and the cathode, and this change in potential is registered by an electrical circuit as a single radioactive event. Geiger counters are fairly inexpensive and reliable, so they are useful in a wide range of applications. More complicated types of counters are also available, but are generally used only in sophisticated experiments. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Radioactivity involves the release of particles and/or energy from the nucleus of an atom. Alpha emissions consist of the ejection of an alpha particle (a helium-4 nucleus) from a radioactive nucleus. Beta emission involves the conversion of a neutron into a proton (which remains in the nucleus) and an electron (beta particle) that is ejected from the nucleus. Positron emission involves the conversion of a proton into a neutron (which remains in the nucleus) and a positron, which is ejected from the nucleus. Gamma emission is the release of energy in the form of high energy electromagnetic waves. Radiation dosage can be measured in several ways, including personal dosimeters and Geiger counters.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  half-life: The amount of time needed for one-half of a sample to spontaneously decay. What tools can be used to determine the rate at which a radioactive substance is undergoing decay? 
Half- Life 	  As radioactive substances gradually decay, there is less and less of the original material present, The half-life of an isotope is defined as the period of time needed for one-half of a sample to spontaneously decay. Some isotopes have long half-lives, such as uranium-234, which has a half-life of 245,000 years. Other isotopes have shorter half-lives. Iodine-131, which is used in thyroid scans, has a half-life of 8.02 days, and oxygen-15 has a half-life of only 2 minutes. Information on the half-life of an isotope can be used to calculate how much of that isotope will be present after a certain period of time. The Table 24.1 includes the half-lives of a few other radioactive isotopes. TABLE 24.1:

This is an example of exponential decay. case, the measured activity will decrease to one-half of its original value after one half-life has passed. For example, if one hour is required for the radioactivity of a certain sample to decrease from 30,000 cpm to 15,000 cpm, that isotope has a half-life of one hour. 
Example 24.1 	  The isotope iodine-125, which is used in certain medical procedures, has a half-life of 59.4 days. How many halflives have passed after 178.2 days? If the initial activity of a sample of iodine-125 is 32,000 cpm, what will be its activity after 178.2 days? Answer: Since we know that one half-life is equal to 59.4 days, we can determine the number of half-lives as follows: Because this value is a whole number, we can simply divide the original activity in half once for each half-life: initial activity = 32,000 cpm after one half-life = 16,000 cpm after two half-lives = 8,000 cpm after three half-lives = 4,000 cpm If the amount of time that has passed is not a simple multiple of the known half-life, we can use the following equation: t Nt = N0 (0.5)t1/2 where Nt is the amount of activity at time t, N0 is the initial activity (at time = 0), t is the amount of time that has passed, and t1/2 is the half-life of the isotope. 
Example 24.2 	  Rubidium-78 has a half-life of 17.67 minutes. If a given sample of Rb-78 has a measured activity of 1.8  104 cpm, what will be its activity after one hour has passed? Answer: Simply plug the given values into the equation above. Note that the units of the half-life and the total amount of time must match. t 
Nt =  N0 (0.5)t1/2 	  Nt = (1.8104 cpm) 
Nt = 1.7103 cpm 	  In this section, we have been looking at isotopes that decay directly to a stable nucleus. However, many isotopes, particularly very heavy ones, require many successive decays before reaching a stable nucleus. For example, the decay of uranium-238 results in the production of thorium-234, which is also radioactive. That decays into protactinium-234, which is radioactive as well. The complete decay chain for uranium-238 is illustrated in the Figure 24.7. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The half-life of an isotope is the amount of time necessary for one half of a given sample to undergo radioactive decay. Half-lives can vary from fractions of a second to millions of years.

What are the various types of spontaneous nuclear decay? 
Nuclear  Fission 	  Radioactive decay, such as the emission of alpha or beta particles, is not the only way that nuclei can be transformed into other isotopes. As it turns out, bombarding certain heavy nuclei with neutrons will cause them to split into two smaller nuclei, in a process known as nuclear fission. Nuclear fission was first discovered by the German scientists Fritz Strassman and Otto Hahn in the 1930s. They began their work by bombarding atoms of uranium with neutrons, hoping to create other large elements. Instead, they were surprised to find barium-141, a much smaller element. Later on in collaboration with Austrian physicist Lise Meitner, they demonstrated the release of neutrons and a large amount of energy along with the smaller nuclei. In Figure 24.9, we see the possible fates of the newly generated neutrons. Some will be lost to the surroundings, and others will collide with non-fissionable nuclei, such as uranium-238. However, some will collide with other U-235 The products of a nuclear fission reaction include smaller nuclei, neutrons, and energy. atoms, thus propagating the fission process and releasing even more neutrons. We will see later how this propagation of neutrons can be employed in a nuclear reactor to generate electricity. As with the equations for nuclear decay, fission reactions are balanced in terms of both mass number and atomic number. For example, the fission process illustrated in the Figure 24.9 is represented by the following equation: energy On each side of the equation, the mass numbers add up to 236 and the atomic numbers add up to 92. Another set of possible fission products from U-235 is formed by the following nuclear reaction: energy Again both the mass numbers and the atomic numbers are balanced on each side of the equation. Nuclear fission can be thought of as a chain reaction. 
Nuclear  Power  Generation 	  The generation of electricity is critical for the operation of nearly all aspects of modern society. The following diagram illustrates the types of fuels used to generate electrical power in the Unites States. In 2009, almost 45% of the power generated in the U.S. was derived from coal, with natural gas making up another 23% of the total. The third primary source of electrical energy is nuclear power, which accounts for approximately 20% of the total amount generated. All of these fuels give off energy in the form of heat. This heat is used to convert water into steam, which is then used to turn a turbine, thus generating electrical power. The control rods, generally made of boron or various metal alloys, play an important role in the modulation of the nuclear chain reaction. Each fission event produces more neutrons than were present initially. If each neutron caused the fission of another atom of U-235, this chain reaction would accelerate, resulting in more and more energy and neutrons being released. The purpose of the control rods is to absorb excess neutrons, which regulates the rate of the chain reaction and prevents overheating. If enough energy were released all at once, a nuclear meltdown might occur, in which the radioactive material starts to melt and leak out of the reactor core along with the water. Control rods help to prevent this type of situation. 
Nuclear  Fusion 	  In contrast to nuclear fission, in which smaller nuclei are created from a larger nucleus, nuclear fusion combines smaller nuclei into larger ones. If the starting nuclei are very small, this process releases an extremely large amount of energy. The fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium is responsible for the energy released by the Sun and other small stars. A typical fusion reaction is shown in the following figure: In this reaction, two different isotopes of hydrogen collide to form a helium-4 nucleus, which is much more stable. A neutron is also ejected, along with the release of large amounts of energy often in the form of gamma rays. Hydrogen-2 (deuterium) and hydrogen-3 (tritium) can be formed by other fusion reactions between isolated protons and neutrons. All of these particles are plentiful in the extremely high temperatures present inside a star. Larger stars are also fueled by fusion reactions involving heavier nuclei, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. However, the principle is the same; smaller nuclei collide and fuse into a larger nucleus, resulting in the release of energy. Because so much energy is released during nuclear fusion, being able to reproduce this process in a controlled fashion would provide almost limitless amounts of energy. Additionally, the waste products from fusion reactions are generally not radioactive, so this would be a much less hazardous source of nuclear energy than fission reactors. Unfortunately, nuclear fusion reactions generally require temperatures in the millions of degrees, which is very difficult to achieve in the laboratory. The development of other methods to force atoms close enough together to cause a reaction have been limited, and harnessing the energy released by nuclear fusion reactions is not yet a feasible option. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Nuclear fission reactions are initiated when certain heavy nuclei, such as uranium-235, collide with free neutrons. The products of a fission reaction are two smaller isotopes, more neutrons, and a great deal of energy. Nuclear reactors use fission reactions to vaporize water. The resulting steam is used to drive a turbine, which generates electricity. Nuclear fusion involves the collision of smaller atoms to form larger ones. Extremely large amounts of energy are released in this process. Nuclear fusion reactions occur in stars but are difficult to reproduce in a controlled laboratory setting, due to the extreme temperatures required.

PET scan: A medical technique known as positron emission tomography which is used to study processes in the brain. What is the relative penetrating power for each type of radioactive decay? What happens to a positron when it collides with an electron? 
Introduction 	  Previously, you learned about certain devices such as a Geiger counter which are used to measure exposure to radiation. In this lesson you will learn about the negative effects of different radiation sources in our lives, as well as some positive ways in which radiation can be used in the medical field. 
Environmental  Sources of  Radiation 	  We are all exposed to a small amount of radiation in our daily lives. Much of this exposure is due to naturally occurring radioactive substances and cosmic radiation (literally high energy particles flying in from space). For example, radon is a colorless, odorless gas formed from the decay of various uranium and thorium isotopes, which are found in the soil throughout much of the U.S. As a noble gas, radon is chemically inert, but it is also radioactive and can easily be inhaled into the lungs. Radon exposure is highest in homes that lack good air circulation, which would allow the gas to be cycled out of the residence. Fortunately, there are a number of inexpensive approaches to decreasing your exposure to radon. 
Effects of  Radiation 	  Radiation can seriously harm living organisms, including humans. In order to better understand how nuclear radiation causes damage on the cellular level, we should first understand the basics of how the cell works. DNA in the nucleus is responsible for protein synthesis and for the regulation of many cellular functions. In the process of protein synthesis, DNA partially unfolds to produce messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA leaves the nucleus and interacts with ribosomes, transfer RNA, amino acids, and other cellular constituents in the cytoplasm. Through a complex series of reactions, proteins are produced to carry out a number of specialized processes within the organism. Anything that disturbs this flow of reactions can damage to the cell. The most harmful situation is when nuclear radiation does something to alter the structure of the DNA. If this prevents the production of a crucial protein, the cell will malfunction or die. In an even worse scenario, some changes to DNA will cause the cell to become cancerous. In a cancer cell, the control processes that regulate cell growth and division are not working properly. As a result, they grow and divide rapidly, often interfering with the functioning of nearby healthy cells. For example, over time internal radon exposure can lead to the development of lung cancer. This is especially problematic for smokers, who already have exposed their lungs to significant amounts of carcinogens. Tissue damage is also common in people with severe exposure to radiation. 
Radioisotopes in  Medical  Diagnosis and  Treatment 	  Radioisotopes are widely used to diagnose, and sometimes treat, various diseases. For diagnosis, the isotope is administered to the patient and then located in the body using a scanner of some sort. The source of the decay product (often gamma emission) can be located by the scanner, and a map of where the isotope was transported in the body can be generated. This information is often very valuable for diagnosing certain medical problems. For example, a radioactive isotope of iodine (I-131) is used in both the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. The thyroid will normally absorb some iodine to produce iodine-containing thyroid hormones. An overactive thyroid gland will absorb a larger amount of the radioactive material. If this is the case, more and more radioactive iodine can be administered, where it will cluster in the diseased portion of the thyroid tissue and kill some of the nearby cells. Cancer treatments often cause patients to feel very sick, because while the radiation treatment kills the unwanted cancer cells, it causes damage to some healthy cells in the process. Technetium-99m is perhaps the most widely used radioisotope in diagnosis and treatment (the m stands for metastable indicating a very short half-life). This isotope decays to Tc-99 by gamma emission. If a very low dose of the isotope is administered, the radiation will be of a very low intensity, so cellular damage will be minimal. Additionally, gamma radiation has a very high penetrating power, so most of it will reach the detector in the scanner. The half-life of Tc-99m is about six hours, so it will remain in the body for some time. Tc-99m is often used to look at cardiac damage. If there is less blood flow in the heart, there will be less of the isotope concentrated in the heart muscle. Similar information can be obtained for blood flow in the brain. There are presently over 25 different isotopes in use for diagnosis and medical treatment. A very partial list can be seen in Table 24.2.

T  Scans 	  One of the more interesting and useful medical applications of radioisotopes is positron emission tomography (PET), often referred to as a PET scan. This technique is especially useful for studying processes in the brain. Many compounds do not enter the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, which is a particularly selective filter that prevents many substances in the blood from being transported into brain tissue. In order to get a good picture of what is happening in the brain, radiolabels (radioactive trackers) are attached to different compounds that are known to enter the brain. Since the brain accounts for about 25% of the bodys glucose consumption, this molecule is often labeled with a positron emitter, such as F-18 (half-life of 109.8 minutes), to study brain function in general. Other radiolabels are attached to specific compounds that will localize in certain areas of the brain to look at specific structures. The PET scanner detects gamma emissions from the collision of a positron with an electron. A positron has the same mass but opposite charge of an electron. As the positron is released from the nucleus of the atom, it will collide with an electron. This meeting of matter (electron) with antimatter (positron) results in annihilation of both particles and the release of two gamma photons that travel in exactly opposite directions. The scanning apparatus detects these gamma rays and stores the data in a computer. From this information, a detailed picture of the brain can be developed. One useful application of PET scanning is in the diagnosis of Alzheimers disease. This debilitating condition associated with memory loss primarily occurs in elderly individuals. A protein known as beta-amyloid gradually forms deposits, or plaques, in the brain. Severe memory loss and impaired movement appear to be direct results of the plaque growth. The compound known as Pittsburgh compound B is often used to identify areas of plaque in the brain. The C-11 atom bound to the nitrogen has a half-life of just 20.38 minutes, so administration and detection must be accomplished very quickly. The label attaches to plaques in the brain and can be observed using a PET scanner. The computer translates the intensity of the decay from the radioactive isotope into a color scale, with red indicating a high level of radioactivity and yellow indicating somewhat less activity. We can see from the scans that the cognitively healthy individual shows the presence of very little plaque in the brain, whereas the individual with Alzheimers has high concentrations of beta-amyloid in numerous areas of the brain. Other studies have used PET scans to look at certain regions of the brain in drug addicts. One of the theories about drug addiction involves activity related to the molecule dopamine, a chemical that helps carry certain nerve impulses from one brain cell to the next. Studies on dopamine activity in the brain have been helpful in understanding the biochemical processes behind addiction. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Everyone is exposed to low amounts of background radiation from medical procedures and naturally occurring radioactive substances. Radioactive emissions can alter the structure of DNA, which can sometimes lead to cell death or even cancer. Radioisotopes are widely used in medical diagnosis. These isotopes need to have short half-lives so that they can be administered in very low doses, thus minimizing damage to cells. Radioactive isotopes are also used in the treatment of certain diseases, such as cancer. These isotopes are administered to only the diseased tissue, with the goal of destroying the unhealthy cells. PET scans are very useful in looking at brain structure and chemistry.

Chapter  Outline 	  From the simple and pleasurable creation of a craft item, like the necklace above, to the heavy-duty pipes that carry water and other materials, polymers are an essential part of todays society. Polymers are very large molecules based on small structural units that are repeated hundreds or even thousands of times. Most of these materials are based on carbon chains, which puts them in the domain of organic chemistry. However, polymers are but one application of modern organic chemistry. The chemistry of carbon-containing compounds encompasses over twenty million compounds and thousands of different reactions, many named after the chemists who developed them.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  How many covalent bonds does each carbon atom in a molecule usually make? How can the hybridization of a given carbon atom be determined? 
Introduction 	  Before the 19th century, scientists had believed that the chemical processes occurring in living systems were fundamentally different from those that could be observed in a test tube. They classified chemistry into two categories: organic and inorganic. Organic processes were thought to take place only in living systems, while inorganic processes occurred in material that was not living. A "vital force" was believed to be necessary for organic reactions to occur. This way of thinking was challenged in 1828 by the German chemist Friedrich Whler when he synthesized an organic compound (urea, found in urine) from an inorganic precursor (ammonium cyanate): Since then, the distinction between organic and inorganic compounds and reactions has blurred. Currently, the field of organic chemistry studies the structure and reactivity of nearly all carbon-containing compounds. Over twenty million organic compounds are known, ranging from very simple molecules to complex proteins. 
Bonding and  Hybridization in  Carbon 	  Lets briefly review the basics of covalent bonding as they pertain to carbon. Carbon has four valence electrons, which have a 2s22p2 configuration in isolated carbon atoms. These four electrons allow carbon to form four covalent bonds, which can mean four single bonds or some combination of single, double, and triple bonds. A carbon atom that has formed single bonds to four different atoms has an sp3 hybridization. The angles between these bonds are equal to 109.5. Hybridization of the valence orbitals in a carbon atom to make a set of four sp3 orbitals. Recall that a double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. In order for a double bond to be formed, each participating carbon atom must have at least one unhybridized p orbital. In a carbon-carbon double bond where both carbons are bonded to two additional atoms, each carbon is sp2 hybridized. The double bond includes a sigma bond between a hybrid orbital from each carbon and a pi bond between the leftover p orbital from each carbon. The angles between any two bonds for an sp2 hybridized carbon are approximately 120. A triple bond (-C?C-) requires each of the carbon atoms to be sp hybridized. One hybrid orbital and two p orbitals from each atom are involved in forming the one sigma and two pi bonds that make up a triple bond. Each carbon Hybridization of the valence orbitals in a carbon atom to make a set of three sp2 orbitals, with one p orbital left over. atom is also bonded to one other atom via the other hybrid orbital. The angle between these two bonds for an sp hybridized carbon is 180. Hybridization of the valence orbitals in a carbon atom to make a set of two sp orbitals, with two p orbitals left over. 
Hydrocarbon  Structure and  Naming 	  Hydrocarbons are molecules that contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms. Because each carbon atom can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, very large and complex molecules can be formed just from these two elements. Hydrocarbons in which all carbons are connected by single bonds are known as alkanes. If a C=C double bond is present, the compound is now an alkene. A triple bond between two carbons (C?C) makes the compound an alkyne. Hydrocarbons can also be broadly classified as either saturated, which means they contain no multiple bonds, or unsaturated, which means they contain at least one double or triple bond. The simplest alkanes are linear chains of carbon atoms, in which no carbon is bonded to more than two other carbon atoms. Branched alkanes are also possible, greatly increasing the complexity of possible structures that can be formed from a given set of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The first six linear alkanes are listed in the Table 25.1.

H3 H2 H2 H3 	  butane 
H3 H2 H2 H2 H3 	  pentane 
H3 H2 H2 H2 H2 H3 	  hexane Starting with pentane, linear alkanes are named by adding "-ane" to the Latin prefix corresponding to the number of carbon atoms in the chain. Since organic chemistry is essentially carbon chemistry, it is important to understand the structure of the hydrocarbon chain. Although alkanes are relatively unreactive, they provide the backbone for more reactive structures known as functional groups, which we will discuss in the following lesson. Most organic reactions will alter only specific functional groups, while the hydrocarbon backbone is generally left intact. 
Drawing  Organic  Structures 	  We can indicate hydrocarbon structures in several ways. The entire structure of hexane is shown in the Figure 25.5 using the usual rules for drawing Lewis structures. Each atom is indicated with the symbol of its element, and each single covalent bond is represented with a line. Hexane structure, with all atoms shown. However, this type of structure is time consuming to draw and can become very cluttered. Because carbons and hydrogen atoms are so prevalent in organic molecules, a chemical shorthand was developed so that not all atoms need to be explicitly drawn. Figure 25.6 is another way to draw the hexane molecule: Skeleton structure for hexane. In the Figure 25.6, the two ends of the chain and each of the intervening corners represents a carbon atom. The six carbon atoms are connected in a linear chain by single bonds. Unless indicated otherwise, we also assume that each carbon makes four total bonds, and any bonds that are not explicitly drawn are connected to hydrogen atoms. The internal carbon atoms above each make single bonds to two other carbons, leaving two bonds not shown. Thus, each of these carbon atoms is connected to two hydrogens. The carbons on the ends of the chain only have one covalent bond drawn in, so they must each be bonded to three hydrogen atoms. Compare these two representations of hexane, keeping in mind that both are conveying the same information. 
Locating  Functional  Groups 	  Most organic compounds are not simple hydrocarbons; they have functional groups that provide additional reactivity pathways. To indicate the location of a functional group within the name of an organic molecule, the hydrocarbon backbone is generally numbered. For example, the hexane molecule (see Figure 25.5) could serve as a parent chain. It has six carbons in it, which can be numbered C-1, C-2, and so on. As long as there is nothing else attached to the chain, it does not matter where we start counting. There is no way to designate which carbon is C-1 and which carbon is C-6. However, once a substituent is added to the chain, we can then indicate a start and an end to the molecule. Now, lets introduce a functional group by replacing one of the hydrogen atoms in hexane with a chlorine atom: To indicate that this molecule has a chlorine atom attached to the hydrocarbon backbone, we could name this compound chlorohexane. However, that name would not be enough information to uniquely identify this molecule, since the chlorine could be attached to any of the carbon atoms. To indicate the location of this substituent, we number the chain, starting with the end that will place the functional group on the carbon atom with the lowest number. Depending on which end is C-1, the compound in the Figure 25.7 could be called either 2-chlorohexane or 5-chlorohexane. According to our rule about giving functional groups the lowest possible numbers, this molecule would be called 2-chlorohexane. Other alkanes with a single halogen atom can be named using a similar strategy, except chloro would be replaced by fluoro, bromo, or iodo, depending on the identity of the halogen. The location of double and triple bonds must also be indicated with numbers. For example, consider the following two molecules: CH3CH2CH=CHCH3 and CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Both of these have one double bond. A simple 5-carbon alkane (no double bonds) would be called pentane, so adding in one double bond changes the name of the structure to pentene, since it is an alkene. However, the location of the double bond affects the physical and chemical properties of the compound. In order to distinguish between the two molecules above, we again number the carbon chain, starting from the end that will give the functional group (the alkene) the lowest number. For CH3CH2CH=CHCH3, we would start counting on the right end. The double bond is between carbon atoms 2 and 3, so this molecule would be named pent-2-ene, where the lower of the two numbers is used. For CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, we would start counting on the left end. The double bond is between carbon atoms 1 and 2, so this molecule would be named pent-1-ene. Triple bonds can be identified in a similar way, except that the suffix -yne is used instead of -ene (to indicate that we are dealing with an alkyne instead of an alkene). 
Cyclic  Hydrocarbons 	  Many organic compounds are cyclic in structure. The compound cyclohexane involves a ring of six carbon atoms, each of which is also bonded to two hydrogen atoms. Figure 25.8 shows a few different representations of the cyclohexane molecule. Ways of representing the structure of cyclohexane. The structure on the right gives the complete picture, where all atoms are explicitly drawn. The middle structure shows a flat representation of the molecule based on the standard shorthand rules for drawing organic structures. The folded structure on the left highlights an important point about organic chemistry the three-dimensional structure of a molecule is not always portrayed accurately by flat drawings. The true structure of the cyclohexane molecule has a puckered shape that looks more like the structure on the left than the flat hexagon in the center. The preferred three-dimensional conformations of organic molecules often play an important role in how the molecule reacts. The following structures illustrate some of the interesting and complex shapes organic molecules can take on: Aromatic hydrocarbons are a special subset of cyclic hydrocarbons. Although many "aromatic" compounds have distinctive odors, this word is used very differently in organic chemistry than in everyday life. The benzene ring is the foundational structure for most aromatic compounds: The illustrations in the Figure 25.10 give different perspectives on the actual structure of the molecule. The lefthand illustration shows the six hydrogen atoms attached to the six carbons and indicates that there are three double bonds in the ring, while the next structure shows this symbolically. A more realistic picture is given by the next two models. The circle shows the reality of the bonding. The three pi bonds in the ring overlap one another and form a cloud of electrons above and below the plane of the ring. Benzene and its derivatives do not undergo the same reactions as most carbon-carbon double bonds, due to the special stability that is inherent in this type of interactive Ways to represent benzene ring. pi bonding. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Hydrocarbons contain only carbon and hydrogen. Alkanes contain only carbon-carbon single bonds. Alkenes contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds. Alkynes contain one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds. Chemists use a shorthand for drawing organic structures that focuses on functional groups and simplifies the drawing of the hydrocarbon backbone. Many hydrocarbons are cyclic and adopt specific three-dimensional structures that influence their physical and chemical properties. Aromatic compounds are cyclic and have a cloud of pi electrons above and below the plane of the ring.

What is organic chemistry? What serves as the framework for all organic compounds? 
Introduction 	  With over twenty million known organic compounds in existence, it would be very challenging to memorize chemical reactions for each one. Fortunately, molecules with similar functional groups tend to undergo similar reactions. A functional group is defined as an atom or group of atoms within a molecule that has similar chemical properties whenever it appears in various compounds. Even if other parts of the molecule are quite different, certain functional groups tend to react in certain ways. In the previous lesson, we already looked at two common functional groups: alkenes and alkynes. Although C-C and C-H single bonds are relatively unreactive, the pi bonds in alkenes and alkynes undergo a variety of characteristic reactions. We will look at some of these reactions in the next lesson. The majority of functional groups involve atoms other than carbon and hydrogen. Some of the most common functional groups are presented in the following sections. 
Alcohols 	  The alcohol functional group involves an oxygen atom that is bonded to one hydrogen atom and one carbon atom. The carbon atom will be part of a larger organic structure. One way to indicate a generic alcohol would be with the formula R-OH. R represents any organic fragment in which a carbon atom is directly bonded to the explicitly indicated functional group (in this case, OH). Alcohols can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the characteristics of the carbon to which it is attached. In a primary alcohol, the carbon bonded directly to the oxygen atom is also bonded to exactly one carbon atom, with the other bonds generally going to hydrogen atoms. In a secondary alcohol, the carbon is attached to two other carbon atoms, and in a tertiary alcohol, the carbon is bonded to three other carbon atoms. The type of alcohol being used will determine the product of certain reactions. Note the naming of alcohols as illustrated in the Figure 25.11. The location of the OH group is indicated with the number of the carbon to which it is attached. We are already familiar with several common alcohols. For example, ethanol (CH3CH2OH) is the alcohol present in alcoholic beverages. It is also widely used in the industrial manufacture of other chemicals. Methanol (CH3OH) is used as a gasoline additive or alternative. Additionally, methanol can be used to manufacture formaldehyde, which is employed in the production of plastics, paints, and other useful substances. Isopropanol is commonly known as rubbing alcohol. In addition to its industrial uses, isopropanol is used to clean various surfaces, including computer monitors, whiteboards, and even skin (e.g., before getting blood drawn). 
Ethers 	  The ether functional group consists of an oxygen atom that forms single bonds with two carbon atoms. Ethers are good solvents for other organic compounds because of their low reactivity. They readily dissolve nonpolar molecules. Diethyl ether is perhaps the best known ether. It is widely used as a solvent and has been used as an inhalable anesthetic. Although ethers themselves are relatively unreactive, they can be converted to peroxides after prolonged exposure to oxygen. Peroxides are very reactive and are often explosive at elevated temperatures. Many commercially available ethers come with a small amount of a peroxide scavenger dissolved in them to help prevent this type of safety hazard. 
Amines 	  An amine consists of a nitrogen atom bonded to some combination of carbons and hydrogens. Like alcohols, amines can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. However, the rules for assigning these categories are slightly different. In an alcohol, the oxygen atom is always bonded to exactly one carbon atom, so we look at the branching on the adjacent carbon, not the oxygen atom itself. In a neutral amine, the nitrogen can be bonded to one, two, or three carbon atoms, and this is how we decide whether it is called a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine. Neutral amines are weak bases, because the lone pair on nitrogen can act as a proton acceptor. Many smaller amines have very strong and offensive odors. For example, the aptly-named compounds cadaverine and putrescine are foul-smelling amines, formed as a part of the decay process after death. Amines serve a wide variety of uses. Diphenylamine acts as a stabilizer for certain types of explosives. Amines are found as components in some lubricating materials, in developers, and are a part of waterproofing textiles. Some amines, such as novocaine, are used as anesthetics. Many pharmaceutical compounds contain amines, including 8 of the 10 most prescribed medications in 2012. 
Aldehydes 	  A very common structural component of organic structures is the carbonyl, which is simply a carbon atom and an oxygen atom connected by a double bond. The reactivity of carbonyls is primarily dictated by the polarization of the C=O bond, but the surrounding atoms also play a role in its specific reaction pathways. All of the remaining functional groups that we will be discussing contain a carbonyl, but they have different properties based on the other atoms that are also connected to the central carbon. An aldehyde is a carbonyl in which the carbon atom is bonded to one carbon atom and one hydrogen atom (or two hydrogen atoms, see below). Because the hydrogen atom is so small, the partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon is very easy for other molecules to approach, making aldehydes a particularly reactive type of carbonyl. Aldehydes are versatile reactants for a wide variety of organic syntheses. Many aldehydes also have distinctive flavors and aromas. For example, the flavor of cinnamon is primarily due to the molecule cinnamaldehyde, and vanillin is the aldehyde most responsible for the smell and taste of vanilla extract. A special aldehyde is the molecule in which the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. This molecule, called formaldehyde, has a wide variety of uses. By itself, it can be used as a tissue preservative or as a very harsh disinfectant. It is also used as a precursor to various materials, including plastics, resins, and other polymers. 
Ketones 	  A ketone involves a carbonyl in which the carbon atom makes single bonds with two other carbon atoms. Ketones undergo most of the same reactions as aldehydes, but they tend to be slightly less reactive. The simplest ketone is acetone, in which the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two CH3 groups. This ketone is commonly used to remove fingernail polish and serves as an industrial solvent. Methyl ethyl ketone is used as a paint stripper and a solvent. Ketones are also used in the production of various polymers, either as a building block or as a solvent. 
Carboxylic  Acids 	  Carboxylic acids are another carbonyl-containing functional group, in which the carbon atom is bonded to an OH group on one side and either a carbon or hydrogen atom on the other. The OH group in an alcohol is not a very good acid; simple alcohols are similar in acidity to water. However, as the name implies, carboxylic acids are weak acids. An OH group that is directly connected to a carbonyl will ionize to a small extent when dissolved in water. The reason for this is the relative stability of the resulting anion. A carboxylate ion ( Figure 25.18), in which the negative charge is spread over two different oxygen atoms through resonance structures, is more stable than an isolated oxygen-centered anion. Carboxylic acids are used in a variety of environments. Formic acid acts as a protective chemical for many stinging insects and plants. Acetic acid gives vinegar its characteristic smell and flavor and is a fundamental biological and industrial building block. Carboxylic acids with longer carbon chains (fatty acids) are used by animals as a way of storing energy and are widely used in the manufacture of soaps. Some compounds contain multiple carboxylic acids within a single molecule. For example, citric acid (three carboxyl groups) is especially abundant in citrus fruits and is used as a flavoring and preservative in many foods and beverages. 
Esters 	  An ester is similar to a carboxylic acid, in that it contains a carbonyl where the carbon is bonded to one additional oxygen atom and one carbon or hydrogen atom. However, the second oxygen atom is bonded to another carbon instead of to an acidic hydrogen atom. Structurally, carboxylic acids and esters are related to one another in the same way as alcohols and ethers. Esters can be formed by heating carboxylic acids and alcohols in the presence of an acid catalyst. This process is reversible, and the starting materials can be regenerated by reacting an ester with water in the presence of a weak base. Some esters have very pleasant odors, so they are used in the manufacture of many perfumes. Propyl acetate contributes to the odor of pears, while isoamyl acetate gives bananas their smell. This ester also serves as an alarm signal for honeybees. Esters are employed in the manufacture of fabrics (polyesters) and Plexiglass. Anesthetics such as procaine and benzocaine also contain esters. 
Amides 	  An amide is a carbonyl in which the carbonyl is attached to one nitrogen atom and one carbon or hydrogen atom. Alternatively, we could define an amide as an amine in which one of the carbon atoms attached to the nitrogen is part of a carbonyl. An amide can be formed by combining a carboxylic acid and an amine. Only primary and secondary amines can be used to form amides, since they have a hydrogen that can be replaced with the carbonyl carbon; tertiary amines will not form amides. The amide shown in the Figure 25.21 was formed from a carboxylic acid and a primary amine. Amides are used as coloring agents in crayons, pencils, and ink. They are employed in the paper, plastic, and rubber industries. Polyacrylamide is a very widely used amide; it is involved in the treatment of drinking water and sewage, and in plastics manufacture. The amide Kevlar is widely employed for the production of body armor, and nylon is another type of amide-based polymer. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Functional groups retain similar chemical properties in a variety of compounds. Functional groups help to distinguish organic molecules from one another. Alcohols consist of an -OH group and commonly appear in the form of ethanol (in alcoholic beverages) and methanol (used in plastic and paint ingredients). Ethers are composed of an oxygen atom that forms single bonds with two carbon atoms. Ethers are relatively unreactive making them good solvents for other organic compounds, such as in the formation of anesthetics. Amines are composed of a nitrogen atom bonded to some combination of carbons and hydrogens. Amines are weak bases commonly used in pharmaceuticals. Carbonyl is composed of a carbon atom double bonded with an oxygen atom, and is a common structural component of many other organic molecules. The reactivity of carbonyl derivatives is largely due to the polarity of the carbon-oxygen double bond. Aldehydes are commonly composed of a carbon bonded to one carbon atom and one hydrogen atom. Aldehydes are particularly reactive due to their high polarity, and are commonly associated with strong smells and tastes. Ketones are carbonyls in which the carbon atom makes single bonds with two other carbon atoms. Ketones are less reactive than aldehydes and are a common component in nail polish removers and paint strippers. Carboxylic acid is a carbonyl in which in which the carbon atom is bonded to an OH group on one side and either a carbon or hydrogen atom on the other. Carboxylic acids are weak acids, for example, vinegar. Esters are similar to carboxylic acids but contain a second oxygen rather than the acidic hydrogen that is in a carboxylic acid. Esters create the pleasant aroma associated with many fruits and flowers. Amides are carbonyls attached to one nitrogen atom and one carbon or hydrogen atom. Amides are used in materials such as crayons and inks, as well as in paper rubber products.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  Which parts of an organic molecule are considered functional groups, and why? 
Introduction 	  With over twenty million organic compounds to keep track of, we need some way to organize information other than simply memorizing reactions for each substance. The presence of functional groups allows us to group together similar modes of chemical reactivity. Instead of learning the reactions that can be performed with a given compound, we learn the reactions that can be performed on a given functional group. Although there are always special cases, specific sets of reaction conditions tend to cause the same changes to a certain functional group regardless of what the rest of the reactant molecule looks like. Although there are thousands of different types of organic reactions, many of the more complex ones can be broken down and understood in terms of simpler processes, such as addition, elimination, and substitution reactions. We will look at a small sampling of the most common processes that occur during organic reactions. In each case, we will focus on how one functional group is changed into another under a certain set of conditions. 
Additions  Across a  Double  Bond 	  There are two types of double bonds we will look at in terms of reactions, the C=C double bond and the C=O double bond. Because one of these bonds is polarized and the other is not, they differ quite a bit in terms of the conditions under which they are reactive. However, the overall change from reactant to product has the same form in either case; the double bond becomes a single bond, and a new atom or group of atoms is attached to each of the two atoms originally involved in the double bond. 
Addition of  Hydrogen 	  Hydrogenation is a very common addition reaction that involves the net addition of H2 across a double bond. Although the actual reaction mechanism for such a process can be quite complicated, the overall transformation is relatively simple. Each atom involved in the double bond is attached to a new hydrogen atom, and the double bond becomes a single bond. For alkenes and alkynes (unpolarized multiple bonds), this process is generally accomplished by mixing the starting material and H2 gas in the presence of a metal catalyst (often Pt or Pd, although some cheaper metals can also be effective under certain conditions). An alkene can combine with one equivalent of H2 gas to form an unfunctionalized alkane. Similarly, an alkyne can combine with two equivalents of H2 (one for each pi bond) to make an alkane. C=O bonds can also undergo a net addition of H2, but the reactants are often quite different. In fact, many conditions for adding hydrogen to an alkene will not affect a C=O bond at all, and vice versa. Complementary reactivity patterns like this allow chemists to selectively change one portion of a molecule without altering the rest. In our chapter on Oxidation-Reduction Reactions, we learned that one definition of reduction is the addition of hydrogen atoms. The addition of H2 across a double bond is an example of this type of reduction reaction. 
Addition of  Halogens 	  Halogenation is analogous to hydrogenation, except that instead of adding a hydrogen atom to each side of the double bond, we add a halogen atom instead. In Figure 25.23, we see that adding molecular bromine to an alkene results in the formation of a dibrominated product. Unlike hydrogenation, no catalyst is required for this reaction to occur. Again, using these same conditions on a C=O double bond will not produce the analogous addition product due to the different reactivity of these two functional groups. 
Formation of  C= C bonds 	  Dehydrohalogenation of an alkane. 
Formation of  C= O bonds 	  Recall that one definition of oxidation is the loss of hydrogen atoms. Oxidation of a primary alcohol will first lead to the formation of an aldehyde. This process is the net removal of H2 (one from oxygen and one from carbon), leaving behind a double bond. In other words, this oxidation is the opposite of the hydrogenation (reduction) reaction that we looked at previously. If water is present, or if we use a strong enough oxidizing agent, the aldehyde will be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid. This fits with the idea that some oxidation reactions involve the literal addition of oxygen atoms to the molecule. Oxidation of a primary alcohol. A secondary alcohol forms a ketone when oxidized. The secondary alcohol cannot be further oxidized to produce a carboxylic acid. Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized in this way, because the carbon atom bonded to the OH group is not also bonded to any hydrogens. Oxidation of a secondary alcohol. 
Esters 	  In the presence of a strong acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid, an alcohol and a carboxylic acid can combine to form an ester and water. Ester formation from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. This reaction is reversible. The reverse reaction, in which water adds to an ester in order to form an acid and an alcohol, is referred to as hydrolysis of the ester. Because the reverse reaction happens so readily, we need to manipulate this equilibrium in order to achieve a high yield of the ester product. For example, if we increase the amount of one of the starting materials, the reaction will be shifted in the direction of ester formation according to Le Chateliers Principle. Usually, the less expensive starting material would be used in excess. Conversely, we can also remove one of the products (generally water) in order to drive the reaction forward. If the reaction is run above the boiling point of water, the H2O product will leave the system as a gas, shifting the equilibrium to the right. Chemical drying agents also provide ways to remove water from active participation in the equilibrium. 
Amides 	  A similar reaction can occur between a carboxylic acid and an amine ( Figure 25.29). We can see from the diagram that the OH of the carboxyl group and a hydrogen from the amine form water as a byproduct. The nitrogen will attach to the carboxyl carbon in the same way the oxygen atom of the alcohol did in the ester synthesis. The reaction shown in the Figure 25.29 uses a primary amine, which has two hydrogen atoms that could potentially be removed to form the final product. The same process can also occur with a secondary amine, which still has one hydrogen attached to the nitrogen. Tertiary amines will not form amides, because the new bond to the carbonyl carbon must replace an existing N-H bond. The reverse reaction (amide hydrolysis) is very useful in the study of protein structure. Proteins are long chains of amino acids (each amino acid contains an amine group and a carboxyl group, both attached to a central carbon atom). The amino acids are linked together by amide bonds to form the long protein chain. One of the techniques for looking at protein structure is to break those amide linkages so we can learn the identity of the amino acids in the chain. We do this through a hydrolysis reaction: Hydrolysis of an amide linkage. Usually, an acid such as HCl is used for the hydrolysis. The amino acids can then be separated and identified. More complex reaction conditions allow the amino acids to be broken off one by one, allowing the amino acid sequence of an unknown protein to be determined. The three-dimensional structures and functions of large protein molecules are ultimately determined by the sequence of amino acids from which they are constructed. 
Organic  Polymers 	  What Are Polymers? Polymers are a pervasive part of modern life. It is very likely that at least some part of your clothing is made of nylon, rayon, or polyester. The milk or juice that you have for breakfast often comes in a polyethylene container. If you dont have breakfast at home, you might get coffee from a fast food establishment, where your order is delivered to you in a Styrofoam container. While getting out of your car, you bang the door on another vehicle. One reason you may not have dented the door is the fact that it could be made out of a polymeric plastic material that resists deformation more than simple metallic structures. Elsewhere on your car, both synthetic and natural rubber are probably present in the tires. All these materials are examples of organic polymers. Polymers are long-chain organic molecules made up of many smaller subunits (called monomers) that are connected together in a repeating pattern. Some polymers are constructed by living organisms, such as starch, cellulose, proteins, and DNA. These natural polymers are covered in the following chapter on Biochemistry. In this section, we will focus on synthetic polymers that are made in the laboratory. 
Important  Synthetic  Polymers 	  One widely used polymer is polystyrene: This polymer is used for many purposes. We find it in Styrofoam packaging materials, plastic cutlery, CD jewel cases, laboratory ware, and a wide variety of other applications. Polystyrene can take on many forms, depending on how it is manufactured. It is inexpensive, easy to work with, and fairly durable. Polyethylene can come in two forms. The low-density form is used for squeeze bottles, insulation for wiring, and flexible pipes. The high-density form is employed in bottles, pipes, and plastic bags. Polyethylene has the simplest structure of all the polymers; it is essentially just a very long linear alkane. Its repeating unit is shown in the Figure 25.32. Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) is very chemically inert and non-wettable water does not stick to it. This polymer has found broad applications in cookware because materials do not stick to it. Since it does not react with other materials, Teflon storage containers are used to package highly reactive or corrosive chemicals. All of these polymers (and many more) are referred to as homopolymers, because they are composed of a single repeating unit. There is another class of polymers called copolymers. This group contains two different repeating units in its structure. Kevlar, used in body armor, is one such copolymer: One of the repeating units is a substituted benzene ring with attached amine groups, while the other repeating unit contains carbonyl groups connected to the benzene ring. In addition to the strong covalent bonds that link these monomers together, the polymeric chains interact with one another via hydrogen bonds, further increasing the strength of the material. 
Synthesis of  Polymers 	  We will now look at two of the reactions that are commonly used to create synthetic polymers. One way to form polymers is through addition reactions. If each monomer contains an alkene or alkyne, various methods can be used to connect each side of the multiple bond with one of the other monomers, resulting in a long chain. One way to form an addition polymer is through a radical chain reaction. The steps in this process are as follows: The other general category of polymer synthesis reactions are the condensation reactions. In these situations, a reaction occurs between two different functional groups with the expulsion of water. For example, polyesters and polyamides can be formed via the condensation reactions discussed earlier in this lesson. Another condensation reaction can be seen in the synthesis of Kevlar: In this case, we see the formation of amide bonds between amines and acyl halides (which can be thought of as activated carboxylic acids). Note that each molecule must have two functional groups in order for this type of polymerization to occur. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Alkenes and alkynes can be reduced with hydrogen gas to form alkanes. Alkenes can react with halogens to form dihalides. Alkenes can react with water to form alcohols. Alcohols can lose water to form alkenes. Alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes or ketones. Aldehydes can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids can form esters with alcohols. Carboxylic acids can form amides with amines. Polymers are long-chain materials with useful properties.

Biochemistry 	  The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes in living systems. In this chapter, we will explore some of the basic chemical components of biological systems and develop an understanding of the roles played by each major type of biomolecule.

Recalling  Past  Knowledge 	  What are the structures for each of the following functional groups: alcohol aldehyde ketone 
Carbohydrate  Structure 	  Carbohydrates are a class of organic compounds in which each carbon in the chain is bonded to an oxygen atom, either through a single bond to an OH group or through a double bond, making a carbonyl. The name comes from the fact that the chemical formula for a carbohydrate can be written in the form Cn(H2O)n, where n is some integer. However, carbohydrates are not actually hydrates of carbon. No water molecules are actually present, and each oxygen in the formula is bonded to at least one carbon atom. One of the most important carbohydrates is glucose, shown in the Figure 26.1. The glucose molecule illustrated in the Figure 26.1 has a carbonyl on C-1 and OH groups on each of the other carbons. This way of representing the structure is known as a Fischer projection, named after the German chemist Emil Fischer (1852-1919), who studied carbohydrate chemistry. When dissolved in water, most of the glucose molecules are not actually present in the form represented in the Figure 26.1. Instead, one of the oxygen atoms near the end of the chain becomes bonded to the carbonyl carbon, and a subsequent transfer of hydrogen results in the cyclic structure shown in Figure 26.2. Because six-membered rings are particularly stable, the oxygen atom used to form the ring will generally be on a carbon atom that is five away from the carbonyl. If such a situation is not possible, five-membered rings can also be formed. Rings of other sizes are generally less favorable than the open-chain form and will not be present in large amounts. 
Classes of  Carbohydrates 	  There are several methods of classifying the various possible carbohydrates. The simplest carbohydrates consist of a short chain or a single ring. These structures can be classified by the number of carbons in the chain. The terms used for simple carbohydrates with 3-6 carbon atoms in their primary chain are shown below: triose three carbons tetrose four carbons pentose five carbons hexose six carbons Some of the most important simple carbohydrates studied in biochemistry include ribose and deoxyribose (pentoses involved in the structure of nucleic acids) and glucose, fructose, and galactose (hexoses that make major contributions to our diet). The simple carbohydrates discussed above are used as the building blocks for complex carbohydrates. Monosaccharides like glucose or fructose can be linked together to form larger structures. When two monosaccharides are bound together, the result is a disaccharide. Some common disaccharides are shown in the Table 26.1. TABLE 26.1: 
Made up of 	  sucrose glucose + fructose lactose glucose + galactose maltose glucose + glucose Longer chains of monosaccharides are referred to as polysaccharides. Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are three extremely common polysaccharides made entirely out of glucose molecules. The differences lie in the types of bonds between the glucose units and the extent of branching in the carbohydrate chain. Starch is found in plants and is consumed as part of our diet. Glycogen is made by the body and is a storage form of glucose for when the cells need extra energy. Cellulose is another long-chain polysaccharide found in plants. Unlike starch and glycogen, the human body cannot break cellulose down into molecules of glucose. Although cellulose does not have any nutritional value in terms of calories, it is a major component of dietary fiber, which has other digestive benefits. 
Dietary  Consumption and  Digestion of  Carbohydrates 	  There are several dietary sources of carbohydrates. Starch is found in many vegetables (especially potatoes) and baked goods. Sucrose (table sugar) is included as part of many prepared foods. Lactose is found in milk products, and maltose is present in some vegetables. A small amount of starch digestion will occur in the mouth, but the bulk of this process occurs in the small intestine. Amylase, an enzyme produced in the pancreas and released into the interior of the small intestine, breaks complex carbohydrates like starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides. These molecules are then cleaved into their corresponding monosaccharides by specific enzymes located in the interior wall of the small intestine. TABLE 26.2: 
Products 	  sucrose sucrase glucose + fructose lactose lactase glucose + galactose maltose maltase glucose + glucose Many people have very low levels of the lactase enzyme. As a result, lactose (found in most dairy products) accumulates in the small intestine, since it cannot be fully digested. This can result in bloating, cramps, abdominal distress, and nausea. Reduction or elimination of lactose in the diet is the most effective treatment. 
Cellular  Utilization of  Carbohydrates 	  What happens after complex carbohydrates have been broken down into simple monosaccharides? When energy is needed, glucose is broken down further via a multi-step process called glycolysis, which means splitting of glucose. All common monosaccharides can be converted by the body to glucose or to some other intermediate along the glycolytic pathway. The key splitting reaction occurs when the enzyme aldolase splits fructose-1, 6disphosphate into two three-carbon compounds. These two compounds then interconvert and form two molecules of pyruvate, the end-product of the glycolytic pathway. Pyruvate then enters an intracellular organelle called the mitochondrion (plural: mitochondria). Through a complex series of processes including two separate pathways, the cell uses O2 and pyruvate to form, among other things, a molecule known as ATP. This compound is essential for many biochemical reactions as well as for processes such as muscle contraction and movement of materials across cell membranes. 
Formation of  Glucose in the  Body 	  Shortly after eating, there is a surplus of glucose in the body. Some of it will be used immediately, but the rest is stored in the form of glycogen. Between meals, when the level of glucose in the blood drops below a certain point, a signal is sent to the liver that says make more glucose. In response, the glycogen in the liver is broken down and the resulting glucose is released into the bloodstream. Alternatively, the body can make glucose molecules from simpler components in a process known as gluconeogenesis. In addition to carbohydrates, fats and proteins can also be broken down into the starting materials for gluconeogenesis, so they are indirect sources of glucose. As a result, any of these classes of compounds can be used by the body to produce energy. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Carbohydrates have a chemical formula that can be written in the form Cn(H2O)n. Simple carbohydrates can be classified in terms of chain length. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form disaccharides or polysaccharides. Digestion of polysaccharides and disaccharides in the small intestine produces glucose and other monosaccharides. Glucose undergoes a lengthy series of reactions that ultimately results in the formation of ATP. Glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis are two complementary pathways used by the body to produce glucose when the concentration of glucose in the blood is low.

Recalling  Past  Knowledge 	  What is the structure of a carboxylic acid? What is the structure of an amine? What is the structure of an amide? 
Amino  Acids 	  Amino acids are a class of molecules that contain both the carboxylic acid and amine functional groups. Amino acids are key building blocks in biological systems. The most common biologically relevant amino acids have the generic structure shown in the Figure 26.3, in which a central carbon atom is connected to an NH2 group, a CO2H group, and a variable R group. The only difference between one amino acid and another is the structure of the R group. In the simplest amino acid, glycine, the R group is just a hydrogen atom. However, other common amino acids may involve alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, or aromatic rings. Many amino acids can be linked together to form a long chain known as a protein. These linkages are formed when the carboxylic acid of one amino acid reacts with the amine of another to produce an amide (see Figure 26.4). In the context of proteins, the newly formed bond between the carboxyl carbon and the amine nitrogen is referred to as an amide bond or a peptide bond. Nearly all biological proteins are constructed from a set of just 20 common amino acids. The names, abbreviations, and other information for each of these amino acids are presented in the Table 26.3.

Protein  Structure 	  The structural features of complete proteins can be broken down into four levels, referred to as primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. These levels are illustrated in the Figure 26.5. The primary structure of a protein is simply the sequence of amino acids from which it is constructed. By convention, this sequence is written starting with the N-terminal amino acid, which has a free NH2 group, and ending with the C-terminal amino acid, which has a free carboxylic acid. Because protein sequences can be very long, the abbreviations listed in the Table 26.3 are commonly used. For example, the sequence lysine-histidinethreonine-valine can be written as either Lys-His-Thr-Val or KHTV. The secondary structure of a protein refers to local coiling or folding. This aspect of the structure applies only to a section of the protein, not the entire structure. The two basic forms of secondary structure are the alpha helix and the beta sheet. Because they have to do with the ways that multiple amides pack together, one or both of these substructures show up in most long protein strands. The appearance of alpha helices and beta sheets can be predicted fairly well (by computers) from the primary sequence of amino acids. Tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of an entire protein chain. Because of the ways that proteins can fold in on themselves, tertiary structure often involves interactions between amino acids that are very far apart in the primary sequence. Ultimately, this is also dependent on the primary sequence of the protein, but because of these long-range interactions, predicting tertiary structures from sequences of amino acids is still very difficult. Quaternary structure refers only to proteins in which more than one chain of amino acids interact to form a single functional structure. If a protein consists of only a single chain, it does not have any quaternary structure. The separate subunits in such a protein are held together by ionic bonds and various types of intermolecular forces, especially hydrogen bonds. They are not covalently bonded to one another, so the individual chains can be separated and studied individually. These subunits can also be recombined to form the original protein. In the Figure 26.6, we see the quaternary structure of an enzyme called succinate dehydrogenase. Four different peptide chains, each drawn in a different color, combine to form the fully functional protein. Again, the four chains are not covalently bound to one another, but they are held together by various other attractive forces. A number of alpha helix groups can also be seen in this structure, especially in the orange and blue subunits. Structure of succinate dehydrogenase. 
Protein  Functions 	  Proteins play a variety of important roles in biochemical systems. Some of the most common protein functions are listed below: 
Enzymes 	  Enzymes are biochemical catalysts, which means that they speed up the rate of a specific chemical reaction. A process that might take weeks in the absence of an enzyme can occur in milliseconds if the proper enzyme is present. A generic enzyme-catalyzed reaction could be represented as follows: enzyme 
Substrate ?  Product 	  The mechanism of the reaction above is somewhat more complicated. In general, the first step involves the enzyme binding to a substrate (the reactant or reactants in the process), forming an enzyme-substrate complex. The enzyme then undergoes a shift in its conformation to produce the product or products, which are then released from the enzyme active site. Typical enzyme-substrate interaction. Over 1,500 enzymes are known. In order to keep track of all these compounds, a classification system was developed based on the type of reaction catalyzed by each enzyme. Six broad families of enzymes are defined as follows: 
Hemoglobin 	  Hemoglobin is a large iron-containing protein that binds to oxygen molecules and transports them around the body. There are four subunits (separate chains) in the hemoglobin complex two alpha subunits and two beta subunits. Each subunit contains one iron ion. Its oxidation state changes back and forth between +2 and +3, depending on whether it is bound to oxygen. The yellow subunits are identical in structure, as are the gray subunits. A smaller organic structure called a porphyrin ring is attached to each protein subunit and contains the iron ion used to bind oxygen. Oxygen binding to iron in hemoglobin. When the oxygen binds to the iron, the three-dimensional shape of the molecule changes. Upon release of the oxygen to the cells, the shape changes back. Some individuals have a specific mutation in the primary sequence of their hemoglobin molecules that causes them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of their red blood cells. This abnormality is genetic in nature. A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening. Inheriting the gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, which is a very serious condition. Sickling in red cells due to presence of hemoglobin S. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Amino acids contain both a carboxylic acid group and an amine group. Proteins are formed by the linkage of amino acids with amide (peptide) bonds. There are four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. Proteins serve numerous functions in the body, including structural support, catalysis, and molecular transportation. Enzymes catalyze biochemical reactions. Enzymes are classified by the types of reactions that they catalyze. Hemoglobin is a protein containing four subunits that transports oxygen throughout the body. In sickle-cell disease, an abnormal hemoglobin structure causes aggregation (clumping) of that protein, which results in deformation of the red blood cells.

Lesson  Vocabulary 	  cholesterol chylomicron fatty acid glycerol lipid lipoprotein steroid triglyceride 
Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  What is the structure of a carboxylic acid? What is the structure of an ester? What do enzymes do? 
Classes of  Lipids 	  In the lesson on carbohydrates, we saw that monosaccharides all have a similar structure, but with slight variations. Many monosaccharides can then be linked together to form long polysaccharide chains. Similarly, amino acids all share some of the same structural features, and linking many amino acids together results in the formation of proteins. In contrast, lipids constitute a much broader class of compounds. A lipid is a biological molecule that is soluble in nonpolar solvents. This also means that lipids are generally not very soluble in polar solvents, such as water. Because of this characteristic, lipids in the body generally cluster together in order to minimize contact with water, and transportation of lipid molecules throughout the body requires that they be reversibly attached to various transport proteins. A lipid bonded to a protein is referred to as a lipoprotein. In the Figure 26.11, we see the structures of some common classes of lipids. Free fatty acids are carboxylic acids that contain long hydrocarbon chains. Saturated fatty acids are alkanes with a single carboxylic acid, whereas unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more C-C double bonds. Fatty acids often form esters with one of the alcohol functional groups on glycerol, a three carbon chain in which each carbon is bonded to one OH group. Triglycerides are common structures, in which all three of these OH groups are esterified with a fatty acid. The three fatty acids in a triglyceride may be the same or different. Another common structure is a phospholipid, in which two of the alcohols in glycerol form esters with fatty acids, and the third is connected to a very polar phosphorus-containing group. Cholesterol is also considered to be a lipid, even though its structure is very different from the ones we have discussed so far. Cholesterol belongs to a broader class of lipids called steroids, all of which possess the same four-ring hydrocarbon core. Other common steroids include cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen. In addition to the categories of lipids listed above, various vitamins are also classified as lipids, including vitamins A, D, E, and K. You may sometimes hear these referred to as fat-soluble vitamins, because they are nonpolar structures that are more soluble in other lipids than in water. 
Functions of  Lipids 	  Lipids play several important roles in the body. Triglycerides are stored in fat cells until the body needs to break them down for chemical energy. These stored triglycerides also help insulate the body against extreme temperatures and cushion organs against physical jostling. Phospholipids and cholesterol are important constituents of the cell membrane. These compounds provide structural integrity to the cell wall, since they are not water-soluble. Other steroids are used as chemical messengers in the body, and the fat-soluble vitamins serve a variety of other functions. 
Digestion of  Lipids 	  Lipids are consumed in the diet from a variety of foods. Animal products contain several different types of lipids, including saturated fats, unsaturated fats, and cholesterol. The degree of unsaturation in the fatty acids found in food (usually as part of a triglyceride) is thought be associated with lowering the bodys stores of cholesterol. Triglycerides in the diet are digested in the small intestine. Since lipids are not water-soluble, they are emulsified with the help of bile acids, which are produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. Bile acids are cholesterolderived steroids that also contain a water-soluble component. The nonpolar region of these acids can interact with triglycerides, and the water-soluble portion allows the entire complex to dissolve in the aqueous environment within the body. The pancreas releases the enzyme lipase to hydrolyze at least two of the ester linkages of each triglyceride. The fatty acids and glycerol esters then pass across the intestinal membrane and are resynthesized into triglycerides on the other side. The re-formed triglycerides (along with cholesterol and other lipids) are not water-soluble, so they will not dissolve in the aqueous environment of the bloodstream. Instead, the newly digested lipids will reassemble as lipoproteins known as chylomicrons in order to move throughout the body. The outer shell of the chylomicron consists primarily of phospholipids (green), in which the polar phosphoruscontaining groups point outward towards the surrounding water, allowing these structures to be relatively watersoluble. Also in the outer shell are various proteins, labeled in the Figure 26.12 as apo A, B, C, and E. Triglycerides (T) and cholesterol (C) are sequestered on the inside of the chylomicron, along with the nonpolar portions of the phospholipids. As the chylomicrons circulate, the inner triglycerides are transported to certain regions of the body, such as the liver and adipose tissue, where they are unloaded. Other lipoproteins also transport lipids throughout the body, but different types of lipoproteins tend to serve different functions. We will discuss some of these differences in the section below on cholesterol and heart disease. Lipoproteins are often classified into five different groups based on their densities. In increasing order of density, these groups include chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). 
Lipids and  Biochemical  Energy 	  Triglycerides in the body function as a long-term method for storing biochemical potential energy. Changes in the levels of the hormones insulin and epinephrine in the blood lead to the release of triglycerides from adipose tissue. The triglycerides are then broken down by lipase enzymes into glycerol and fatty acids. After being transported into the mitochondria, fatty acids are broken down further into two-carbon fragments, called acetyl CoA. Finally, acetyl CoA molecules can be used to generate ATP, which functions as a kind of universal biochemical energy source within the cell. A normal fatty acid might contain approximately 16 carbons, which would result in the formation of 8 molecules of acetyl CoA. Each acetyl CoA can then be used to generate 12 molecules of ATP. Thus, a single fatty acid might be used to produce nearly 100 ATP molecules. Regular exercise will increase the demand for ATP and help lower the amount of triglycerides (stored fat) in the body, as will a decrease in the consumption of materials that contain triglycerides or other metabolic energy sources (such as carbohydrates). 
Overview of  Metabolism 	  The metabolism of fatty acids is highly interconnected with the breakdown of other dietary energy sources, such as carbohydrates and protein. Recall that glucose and amino acids can both be broken down to form the pyruvate molecule. Pyruvate can then be converted into acetyl CoA, which is then further metabolized to produce ATP. Eventually, all sources of biochemical energy are funneled into the same overall reaction pathways. Overview of energy metabolism. Additionally, all of these processes are reversible. The breakdown or rebuilding of biomolecules is directed by specific environmental cues in various parts of the body. Because all of these types of molecules can be broken down to the same common intermediates, they are all interconvertible using our biochemical machinery. For example, say the body needs to produce more steroids, but only complex carbohydrates are available as a source of material. The carbohydrates can be successively broken down into disaccharides, monosaccharides, pyruvate, and finally molecules of acetyl CoA. Then, the acetyl CoA can be assembled into cholesterol, which is then modified to produce the necessary steroid. Fatty acids, triglycerides, and other lipids can be generated in a similar way. 
Cholesterol and  Heart  Disease 	  Because of the link between high levels of cholesterol and heart disease, it is commonly seen by the general public as a bad molecule. However, cholesterol plays a vital role in the body, as both a structural component of cell membranes and a metabolic precursor to various steroid hormones. Only about 30% of the cholesterol in our bodies comes from our diet; the rest is synthesized in the liver, intestines, adrenal glands, and reproductive organs. The same acetyl CoA molecule that provides biochemical energy can also be used by the body to synthesize cholesterol. There are approximately twenty-two steps involved in the formation of cholesterol from acetyl CoA. Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure 26.14). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Plaque formation in artery leading to narrowing of artery. The growth of plaques in the arteries is facilitated by a high level of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which transport cholesterol from the liver to various parts of the body. The opposite process, moving cholesterol back to the liver, is carried out by high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Once back in the liver, the cholesterol can be converted to bile acids, which are either excreted or used in the digestion of dietary lipids. When you get your cholesterol tested, they are measuring not only the total amount of cholesterol in the blood, but also whether it is being transported by LDL or HDL. All of these values are important for assessing the likelihood of a heart attack. Total cholesterol gives an idea of the overall cholesterol load in the body. The LDL cholesterol (sometimes referred to as bad cholesterol) is more likely to be incorporated into a cell or a plaque, so it is important that these levels below. Conversely, since cholesterol being carried by HDL (good cholesterol) is being transported away from the rest of the body and into the liver for disposal, higher HDL levels are generally considered beneficial. High levels of cholesterol in the blood can be treated by medications. The statins (a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs) inhibit the production of cholesterol. One enzyme in the twenty-two step process is rate-limiting this enzyme catalyzes the slowest reaction in the sequence. Blockage of cholesterol synthesis at this step is currently the most effective way of decreasing cholesterol formation in the body. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Lipids are a diverse class of relatively nonpolar biomolecules that generally do not dissolve well in water. Common types of lipids include fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, and steroids. Lipoproteins transport lipids in the bloodstream. Triglycerides can be broken down into fatty acids, which can be further metabolized to produce acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA acts as a common intermediate for many metabolic pathways. It can be broken down further as a source of energy or used as a building block to generate more complex molecules. Elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood can cause arterial damage, which may lead to a heart attack.

Recalling  Prior  Knowledge 	  What do we mean when we refer to the primary structure of a protein? 
Classes of  Nucleic  Acids 	  The final type of biomolecules that we will be looking at are the nucleic acids. Like carbohydrates and proteins, nucleic acids are complex polymers of a few simple building blocks. Nucleic acids provide the molecular blueprints for all proteins produced in living systems. We will explore the process by which this information is translated into functional structures later in this lesson. First, we will look at the structures of nucleic acids. 
Nucleotides 	  The subunits from which nucleic acids are generated are referred to as nucleotides. A nucleotide consists of a pentose molecule connected to a nitrogen-containing base and one or more phosphate groups. Biological systems make use of two different pentoses for the construction of nucleic acids: ribose and deoxyribose. Long polymers of ribose-derived nucleotides are referred to as ribonucleic acids ( RNA), and polymers of deoxyribose nucleotides are referred to as deoxyribonucleic acids ( DNA). In a given strand of DNA or RNA, the only difference between each subunit is the choice of base. The five common bases are shown in the Figure 26.15. Based on the number of rings, they are classified as either purines or pyrimidines. In general, DNA does not make use of the uracil base, and RNA does not contain thymine. As a result, each strand of a nucleic acid will use only four of these bases. 
 	  Individual nucleotides can be linked together through their phosphate groups to form nucleic acid polymers. Once constructed, DNA generally exists as two strands that are linked together by hydrogen bonds, producing a doublehelical structure (see Figure 26.16). In order for the structure in Figure 26.16 to form, the bases that line up across from each other must be complementary to one another. Based on their structures, adenine will make favorable hydrogen bonding interactions with thymine, and vice versa. Guanine and cytosine form another complementary pair. Mismatched bases will form unfavorable interactions in the center of the helix. If we know the sequence of one strand in a DNA double helix, we can predict the sequence of the opposite strand based on the required pairings. 
 	  RNA is nearly identical to DNA, except that the sugar has an extra OH group and uracil is used instead of thymine. Due to the additional hydrogen bonding opportunities generated by the extra OH group, RNA is found more often as a single strand that is folded in on itself. However, RNA can still form a double helix with a strand of either DNA or RNA if the bases form a complementary sequence. RNA is sometimes classified based on the function that it is performing. The types most relevant to the production of proteins are messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). We will look at the role of each type of RNA in the following section. 
Protein  Synthesis 	  The process of protein synthesis is summarized in the Figure 26.19. DNA produces an RNA template that directs the amino acids to be introduced into the growing protein chain in the proper sequence. A specific transfer RNA attaches to each amino acid and brings it to the RNA for incorporation. The first step in the process is transcription the unfolding of DNA and the production of an mRNA strand. This step takes place in the nucleus of the cell. Overview of protein synthesis. Formation of RNA from DNA. The DNA uncoils and provides the pattern for the formation of a single strand of mRNA. After production of the RNA, the DNA refolds into the original double helix. The mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm (outside the nucleus) for further processing. Amino acids will link with specific transfer RNA molecules for proper placement in the protein chain. The tRNA is a small coiled molecule that accepts an amino acid on one end and matches up to a specific three-base portion of the mRNA on the other end. The tRNA interacts with the mRNA so as to put the amino acids in the proper sequence for the developing protein. After adding the amino acid to the sequence, the tRNA is cleaved from the amino acid and recycled for further participation in the process. Because we are converting from one "language" to another (a sequence of mRNA bases into a sequence of amino acids), this part of the process is referred to as translation. The process of assembling amino acids into a protein takes place in the ribosome. This structure consists of two subunits, each of which is composed of both proteins and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The two subunits clamp together on the mRNA and catalyze the formation of the amide linkages in the growing protein. When protein synthesis is complete, the two subunits dissociate and release the completed protein chain. The process of protein synthesis is fairly fast. Amino acids are added to the growing peptide chain at a rate of about 3-5 amino acids per second. A smaller protein (100-200 amino acids) can be produced in a minute or less. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Nucleotides contain a pentose sugar, a nitrogen-containing base, and one or more phosphate groups. Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are composed of long strands of nucleotides bonded together through their phosphate groups. DNA generally exists as two complementary strands connected by hydrogen bonds into a double helix structure. DNA contains the genetic information for the production of proteins. The transcription process produces a strand of messenger RNA from DNA. During translation, messenger RNA interacts with the ribosome and transfer RNA to produce a protein.
