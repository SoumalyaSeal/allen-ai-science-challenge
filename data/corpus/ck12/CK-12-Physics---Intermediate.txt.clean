Chapter  Outline 	  What Is Science? Science has brought countless innovations and advances to humankind. This chapter reviews core principles of scientific inquiry, including standard units, dimensional analysis, and unit conversion. 
Objectives 	  Explain the role of using postulates in science. Explain the role of mathematics in science. Explain how scientists investigate nature by ensuring their models are falsifiable and tested by independent researchers. Describe the difference between a hypothesis, theory, and law. Explain that new theories explain phenomena more accurately than preexisting theories, and such theories are consistent with the correct predictions of previous theories. Describe the scientific method. hypothesis: A proposed explanation for an observation, phenomenon, or scientific problem that can be tested by further investigation. inquiry: An approach to learning that involves exploring the natural or material world, then leads to asking new questions and making new discoveries. scientific law: A concise mathematical relationship that always occurs under specific conditions. A law is not an explanation, and it is no more or less final than a theory. scientific method: A systematic approach used to investigate the natural world that must make predictions, be testable, come from evidence, and be potentially disprovable. theory: A statement or set of statements devised to explain a group of observations or phenomena. Theories have often been repeatedly tested or are widely accepted, and can thus be used to make predictions about natural phenomena. 
Introduction 	  Science is frequently portrayed as a source of absolute truth. In reality, however, science is a dynamic and flexible enterprise. It truly a processnot an end result. The scientific process can be approached as a series of steps, as shown in the Figure 1.1. Scientific inquiry is pursued using the scientific method. The Figure 1.1 presents a very specific sequence of steps, but the process is in fact quite flexible. The order is not fixed, and approaches in the real world are often much less linear. Though the process itself can vary, the scientific method requires that all scientific explanations share certain characteristics. They are as follows: The explanation must be logically consistent. The explanation must make predictions. The predictions must be testable. The tests must be based on evidence. The explanation must be falsifiable, meaning that it can potentially be disproved based on the test results. A scientific explanation is always subject to revision based on new evidence and can be discredited at any point. It can never be absolutely proven. There are a few important clarifications to how the scientific process has been defined so far: There is nothing more solid or final than a theory. A theory is never formally changed to anything else, no matter how much evidence there is. It becomes harder and harder to disprove with more evidence, but it is never upgraded from a theory to a scientific fact or a scientific law. A scientific law is a specific mathematical relationship, which is tested in the same way as a theory and just as open to being disproven at any time. Steps can be skipped as long as the explanation is valid and tested. As a scientist, you could have a strong hunch before investigating, so you create a hypothesis immediately and then move on to testing it. Alternatively, you could devise a series of tests to try out before you have a definite hypothesis. Scientists conduct investigations for a wide variety of reasons. A scientist can conduct work for any purpose, which is still completely scientific as long as it maintains some basic ethics. As a scientist, you could do your work because of the money it would make. Alternately, you could pursue a theory because you like the beauty of the explanation. Further still, you could do your work based on religious conviction, in the tradition of religious scientists like Galileo and Newton. As long as you do not falsify evidence, your reasons are unimportant. Scientists make mistakes and report them. Scientists are never perfect, and even if they follow all procedures properly, unforeseen circumstances can sometimes throw off the results of an experiment. The key to scientific processes is not to throw away the unexpected results, but to keep them, analyze them, and report them. This can help other scientists who might run into the same problem, or can even result in new discoveries. It is unethical to throw out odd results unless you know exactly what caused them. Unethical scientists may alter data to give the results that support what the experiment was intended to show. This could be to enhance their reputation, make more money, or to prove the result that they prefer for personal reasons. A result like this may stand for years, but in time it will be disproven as other scientists attempt investigations to confirm or follow up on the false result. Both intentional deception and honest mistakes are eventually discovered. In order for a result to be taken seriously by the scientific community, researchers must explicitly show how they conducted their work, how the testing was done, and how the data was collected. Presenting their results to their peers allows for feedback, corrections, and insights that may not have occurred to the experimenters themselves. 
Development of  Ideas  Over  Time 	  One example of developing better explanations is in the case of falling objects. Since ancient times, it was widely accepted as true that heavier objects fell faster than lighter objects. The multi-talented Aristotle (384322 BC) of ancient Greece held this belief, and scholars took his word for centuries. This idea is based on good experimental evidence, because very light objects like feathers do fall much more slowly than heavy objects like rocks. Years later, Galileo Galilei (15641642) looked in further detail at the nature of falling objects. He carefully timed marbles as they rolled down a slanted wooden block. He also dropped objects of varying weights. He found that very light objects like feathers were the exception. Heavy objects all fall in about the same time regardless of how heavy they are. Galileo hypothesized that a feather falls slowly due to resistance from the air. Heavier objects are easily pushed through the air, and thus experience little effect from air resistance. He hypothesized that in the absence of air, all objects would fall at the same rate. Robert Boyle first confirmed this hypothesis twenty years after Galileo died. In 1660, Boyle pumped all the air out of a glass tube and then dropped both a feather and a coin inside that tube. Centuries later in 1971, astronaut David R. Scott repeated this investigation during a live TV broadcast from the Moon, as shown in the following video. URL This explanation is more complicated, because it involves two effects: gravity and air resistance. It can be hard to reconcile these two, especially if you dont know how they were discovered. Many students learn that all objects fall at the same rate only as an unexplained fact, but dont know how to relate this to the common case of a feather. The following is a video of high school graduates talking about their understanding of falling objects. URL 
Mathematics and  Technology 	  As science has advanced, evidence has gone beyond just what we can see with our eyes. Modern experiments use technology to collect data and mathematical analysis to reveal patterns within that data. Mathematics can be used to prove a scientific law. As explained above, a scientific law is no more or less absolute than a theory. Rather, it is a mathematical relation that may or may not have an explanation. For example, you might prove that the weight of water is proportional to how much volume it takes up. 
Objectives 	  List and use fundamental units in the study of mechanics. List and use standard units in the study of mechanics. Use dimensional analysis. dimensional analysis: Checking your mathematical equations by keeping units with every number, or predicting units based on the relation of other units. length: The measurement of the extent of something along its greatest dimension. mass: A property of matter equal to the measure of an objects resistance to changes in either the speed or direction of its motion. The mass of an object is not dependent on gravity and therefore is different from but proportional to its weight. meter stick: A ruler exactly one meter in length. scalar: A quantity, such as mass, length, or speed that is completely specified by a single number. It is said to have magnitude, but no direction. SI units: The most modern version of the metric system, also known as the International System of Units (SI). time: An ordered continuum in which events occur in succession from the past through the present to the future. vector: A quantity, such as velocity or force, that must be completely specified by both a magnitude and a direction. For example, if an object is moving, we must know both the amount of motion as well as the direction of motion to know the vector quantity velocity. 
Equations  Including  Units 	  Mathematics is central to science in general and especially physics. The math in physics is always connected to real physical quantities, however. In a math class, an equation might read: However, in physics all numbers represent a specific physical quantity and they have units. Each of the quantities in the equation has abbreviations for units beside it. For example, this is the formula for how high an object would be after dropping for two seconds from the top of a six-story building. Standard UnitsSI Units (Standard International Units) Especially in scientific work, it is vital that we use a consistent and logical set of units. For almost all scientists, that system is the International System of Units, abbreviated SI. This the most modern form of the metric system. It is used universally for all scientific work. It is also used on a daily basis in almost all the world. The three countries that do not officially use metric units in some form today are Burma, Liberia, and the United States. Map of countries not officially using the metric system worldwide. Students often learn the basics of metric units, but are not fluent in them. Especially in physics, it is important not just to perform abstract calculations, but to be able to mentally picture what measurements look like. How heavy is a 10kg weight? How short is someone who is 155cm tall? The standard unit of length used in physics today is the meter, which is roughly the distance from the tip of your nose to the end of your outstretched arm. The meter sticks you have in your classroom do not have this accuracy. The standard unit of mass is the kilogram. A one-kilogram mass corresponds to a weight of approximately 2.2 pounds. Mass and weight are not the same property. Weight is the product of the gravitational acceleration, g, and the mass of the object: W = mg. The corresponding standard weight unit is the Newton, where 4.45 Newtons is equal to 1 pounds. The standard unit of time is the second, which is familiar to most students. The standard unit of temperature is the degree Celsius. One degree Celsius is the same as one degree Kelvin, but they measure from a different starting point. Celsius measures up from the freezing point of water, while Kelvin measures up from the point called "absolute zero". length These fundamental units are combined into derived units, such as  for speed. Speed and velocity have the time length derived units of . Other derived units include force, energy, voltage, and so forth. time 
Vectors and  Scalars 	  If we wish to fully define the motion of an object we must state the objects magnitude and the objects direction. In the case of motion, the magnitude is the speed of the object. Quantities such as displacement are represented by net distance (magnitude) and direction. Any quantity requiring a magnitude and a direction is called a vector quantity. Force is another vector quantity. For example: A 150 N punch (magnitude) to the stomach (direction, loosely speaking!). Quantities that require only a magnitude for their complete description are called scalars. Mass and temperature are examples of scalar quantities. 
Dimensional  Analysis 	  Dimensional analysis is the method of using fundamental or standard units in detecting an error and discerning the correct relationship between physical quantities. As a simple example, recall our old friend d = rt, where d is a distance, r is a rate, and t is time. If we accidentally rewrite the equation as r = t/d, we see that the units are inconsistent since m/s do not equal s/m. If the derived units are not the same on each side of the equation, we know that a mistake was made. The converse is not true. If the units agree, a mistake may still have been made. (Why?) Answer: The units of density are given as g/cm3. Grams are a measure of mass, and cm3 is a measure of volume. Density therefore has units of mass/volume. So the formula for density is: d = m/V, where d is density. Of course, there may be a dimensionless quantity in this formula. Not all formulas have only physical quantites in them. Consider the volume, V, of a sphere: V = 43?r3. Here, r is the radius of the sphere and it has units of length. But the quantity? has no units. It is a pure number. Dimensional analysis cannot determine what, if any, pure numbers are in a formula. But, at the very least, a statement of proportionality is always possible, as in the case of V is proportional to r3. Answer: The acceleration, a, has units of m/s2. 
Objectives 	  Perform unit conversions. Properly use scientific notation. conversion factor: A mathematical expression equating two different units, such as 1 m = 100 cm. scientific notation: A number expressed in scientific notation is written as a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of ten. 
Introduction 	  Just as there are many spoken languages, there are many ways of expressing the same quantities in science. All scientists throughout the world measure length using centimeters, meters, and kilometers rather than inches, feet, and miles. Even within this single system of measurement, it is still necessary to reinterpret, or convert, quantities. For example, it is more efficient to express 1,000 meters as 1 kilometer, or to express 150 centimeters as 1.5 meters ( Table 1.1). 
Examples  Using  Unit  Conversions 	  Note: Answers to the illustrative examples below will be expressed in scientific notation. A number expressed in scientific notation is written as a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of ten. For example: 12,300 = 
Illustrative  Examples 	  For our purposes, let us regard the statement 1 km = 1000 m as an equation. Answer: First we need a conversion factor. We know that 1 km = 1000 m. Dividing both sides by 1000 m, The first result is useful if we wish to convert meters to kilometers, and the second result is useful if we wish to convert kilometers to meters. Using this conversion factor, we put the units that we want on the top. Since the result is in meters, we must convert from km to m. We use the unit conversion factor 1000 m. 1 km Answer: Here we use the conversion factor 10001 kmm. Answer: Recall that 1 h = 60 min = 3600 s. Answer: 
Answer:	8 m/s = 26.8101 m/s 	  URL 
Objectives 	  Describe measurement. Explain what is meant by significant digits. Determine the number of significant digits in a measurement. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide with significant digits. Use scientific notation. precision: The smallest unit that a device can measure. significant digits: The number of precisely-measured digits in a measurement or result. uncertainty (in measurement): The possible variance between a measurement and the true result. 
How to  Measure 	  A typical meter stick is accurate to a millimeter. Assuming the object being measured lines up well with the meter stick and has a sharply-defined end, you can clearly see it measuring closer to one millimeter mark than to another. This is expressed as precision of  0.5 mm, or equivalently,  0.05 cm. A measurement of 42.78 cm can be read exactly to 42.7 cm ( Figure 1.5). The 8 in 42.78, that is, 0.08 cm, is a reasonable estimate, where the actual measure lies within a range of values between 42.78  0.05 cm ? [42.73 42.83]. This measurement has 4 significant digits. What reading would you use assign to the position of the arrowhead? 
Introduction 	  A person stands on their bathroom scale. What is a reasonable weight for the scale to show? A reasonable weight might be: a. 120.5 lbs b. 120.53 lbs c. 120.534 lbs In all likelihood you chose answer A. Good! Why didnt you choose B or C? Most likely, you did not select B or C because the finest measure on most bathroom scales is to the pound. At best we can estimate to one decimal place. This example highlights when and why significant digits are used in science, and especially in physics. When an experiment is conducted, data measurements can only be as precise as the equipment used to make the measurement. 
Significant  Digits Reporting  Data  Correctly 	  The length of the pen shown in the Figure 1.6 is measured as 14.58 cm. Its easy to see that the pen is clearly larger than 14 cm and that it is past the 14.5 cm mark, as well. Where does the 8 (at the end of this measurement) come from? The 8 represents an estimate by the person measuring the pen. The end of the pen is somewhere between the fifth and sixth millimeter. If it had appeared to have fallen exactly in the center of this interval, the final digit would have been reported as a 5. In fact, depending upon who read the ruler, the final digit may have been reported as a 7 or 9, giving us a measurement of 14.57 or 14.59. The last digit of any measurement is significant but uncertain but not completely uncertain! Its reasonable to argue based on varying individual perspectives about whether the last digit is a 7, 8, or 9 (you may even say 14.60) but no one will argue, based on what they can see, that the reading is between 14.50 and 14.55. There is a difference, however, in reading the ruler as best as you can, and the actual uncertainty of the ruler. Mass-produced measuring tools typically have a precision of no better than of the smallest interval of the device. Therefore, 14.58 cm is recorded as 14.58  0.05 cm, [14.53-14.63]. A pen measured in metric units having 4 significant digits. Note: we will not cite our results using a range of values when working on problems in later chapters. This method should, however, be used in reporting laboratory data. What if someone had used the same ruler in Figure 1.6 to measure the pen and stated it was 14.573 cm? How believable is it that they could read a measurement of 0.003 cm with this ruler? Its not believable at all! (Think of the example above.) The 7 was a reasonable guess, but theres nothing reasonable about claiming the 3 is readableits a physical impossibility with this ruler. The ruler measures a maximum of 2 significant figures to the right of the decimalno more and no less! What about zero? Zero can be a source of confusion when it comes to recording significant digits. Lets see if we can understand the source of this confusion. Using the ruler in Figure 1.7, a student measures a calculators length as 18 cm. Whats wrong with how this measurement is reported? A measurement must include a last digit, which is always an estimate. This final estimated number is uncertain but reasonable (significant). This last digit informs us of the precision of the device used. Since 8 is the last digit, it must be an estimate. Therefore it is impossible for the tool to measure numbers like 18.2 or An example of a ruler where the units place is an estimate. 
Zero as a  Placeholder 	  A United States penny has a diameter of 1.91 cm as measured with our ruler. Even though the ruler can measure lengths like 11.91 cm, the penny has no tens of centimeter value. You cant measure what is not there, so there is no added significance if we write a zero in front of the ones-units to indicate there are no tens, like this: 01.91. This number has only three significant figures. The zero is not a measure of anything and the diameter of the penny is in the range [1.86 1.96] cm. A penny cannot be measured to the tensplace so zero in the tens-place is only a place holder and has no significance. a. 0.191 b. 0.190 c. 00.19 d. 10.90 e. 10.060 f. 010.060 Answers: a. 3 b. 3 c. 2 d. 4 e. 5 f. 5 
Ambiguous  Recording 	  How many significant digits are there for the number 100? We have a problem with this. As it is written, we dont know whether the zeros are placeholders or if the tool used to measure 100 can actually measure to the tens place. Had the number been written as 100. (with a decimal point after the third digit), then we could say, yes, and we would know the measurement has three significant digits, with the ones-place being an estimate. But we dont typically write a number terminating in a decimal point. The best method for writing significant digits is using scientific notation. Let us restate the definition of scientific notation. Scientific notation expresses a measurement as a number between 1 and 10, then multiplied by a power of ten. Some examples: If we had intended three significant digits for 100, we would have written it as 1.00  102, using scientific notation. Had we intended one significant digit then we would have written it as 1  102 using scientific notation. Answer: 2.800  103. Answer: 2.80  104. 
Computing with  Significant  Digits 	  There are set rules used to determine the number of significant digits (or figures or numbers!) to report when adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with significant numbers. Lets consider these rules. 
Adding and  Subtracting with  Significant  Digits 	  Rule: When adding or subtracting significant numbers, round to the smallest number of places past the decimal, of the least precise number in the group. Example 1: 23.56 + 47.0 = 70.56 = 70.6 (least precise measure is the tenths place) Example 2: 512 + 48.6295 = 560.6295 = 561 (least precise measure is the ones place) Example 3: 6 102 ?10.76 = 589.24 = 600(leastprecisemeasureisthehundredsplace) Consider why this rule is reasonable. In each example, the two numbers being added or subtracted could not have been measured with the same instrument. The second number in each pair was measured with a tool of greater precision. A less accurate measurement cannot be made more accurate by the addition or subtraction of a more accurate number, no more so than a more precise measuring tool can impart greater precision to a less precise measuring tool. The precision of the sum or difference computation is therefore always determined using the least precise tool. 
Multiplying and  Dividing with  Significant  Digits 	  Rule: When multiplying and dividing with significant digits, the final result must be rounded to the same number of significant digits as the number with the minimum number of significant digits. Example 1: 23.56  47.0 = 1107.32 = 1110 = 1.11  103 (round to three significant digits) Example 2: 512  48.6295 = 24898.304 = 24900 = 2.49  103 (round to three significant digits) Example 3: (6  102)/10.7 = 56.07476636 = 60 = 6  101 (round to one significant digit) Consider why this rule is reasonable. Recall that the last digit in each number is not an exact measure, but an estimate. When multiplying (or dividing), the uncertainty of the estimated digits affects every digit. This rule ensures that the uncertainty is never greater than two digits having a direct calculation from an estimated digit. 
Objectives 	  Describe systematic and random error. Explain precision and accuracy as they relate to error. accuracy precision random error: Error that varies within the inherent uncertainty of a measuring device. systematic error: An error of constant value that is made repeatedly. 
Introduction 	  There is a difference between what we mean by mistake and error in a laboratory setting. A mistake, for example, is accidentally writing 3  5 = 8 rather than 15. On the other hand, a systematic error is one of a constant value that is made repeatedly. Random error varies within the inherent uncertainty of a measuring device: a meter stick ( 0.05 cm) or human reaction time (at worst  0.2 s). We will discuss both of these sources of error, along with precision and accuracy. The classic target example below is a good way of explaining precision. 
Defining  Error 	  The error that generates a precise but inaccurate result is typically associated with systematic error. Systematic error is usually a result of an error of calibration, like a scale that is not zeroed. A nurses aide recording the weights of a group of toddlers may not realize that the scale reads two pounds before any weight is placed on it. Therefore, each toddlers weight appears two pounds greater than it really is (see Figure 1.13). Systematic error is detected when an ordered pair of data should have a direct relationship (the function should pass through the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system) yet does not by a greater uncertainty than the measuring tool suggests. In general, this kind or error can be corrected by a constant shift in the data. Random error generally refers to the limits of the equipment and people involved in an experiment. It does not mean that such an error is necessarily correctable. Consider the example below: Graph showing 2 pound offset due to calibration error. A group of students wish to find the time of fall for a golf ball dropped from a height of 4.9 m. Students take turns dropping the ball and recording the time. Theyve devised this procedure to avoid the systematic error introduced by having the same person drop the ball and the same person time the fall for each trial. They make sure that at least ten data points are collected. The data appear as follows in Figure 1.14. Experimental results of timing a fall of 4.9 m. The time to fall 4.9 m is theoretically 1.00 s. The resulting data was the following times: 0.92, 0.96, 1.12, 0.94, 1.07, 1.03, 1.00, 0.98, 0.91, 0.99 The average value of the data set is: 0.992 = 0.99 s. The theoretical value (the accepted value) is 1.00 s. It seems clear from the data that the timing devices smallest interval of precision is 0.1 s. Therefore, the last digit of each measurement (0.01 s) was significant but uncertain. The timing device has a precision of  0.05 s, so the final result is within the range [0.94 1.04] s. This means the experiment worked quite well, since the accepted value of You can see from the data set that the worst deviation from the average value was: 1.12 0.99 = 0.13 s. This is quite reasonable, factoring in the timing device and the persons response time. If an experiment is performed well, the random error, for the most part, should be evenly distributed near the accepted (theoretical) value. The data should be both precise and accurate. Watch the following video as an example: 
One- Dimensional  Motion 	  One-dimensional motion means moving forwards and/or backwards along a straight line, and is the simplest form of motion to study. The core of learning this is understanding rates, which is how any quantity changes over time. Key rates we will study are speed, velocity, and acceleration. 
Objectives 	  Define scalar and vector. Define distance and displacement. Distinguish between distance and displacement. Graphically model distance and displacement. displacement: The difference between final and initial positions. distance: The positive length between two points. position: The place of an object represented in the same way we might represent a point on a number line. scalar: Term used when referring only to magnitude. vector: Term used when referring to both magnitude and direction. 
Equations 	  Distance: X = |P1 ?P2|+|P2 ?P3|+... 
Introduction 	  We begin our study of motion in the simplest terms possiblemotion that takes place along a straight line. This is called one-dimensional motion. A car traveling east, west, north, or south is an example of this kind of motion. When we imagine a car moving along on a road, we think of the car as represented by a particle. We define the position of a particle in the same way we would define the position of a point on a number line. Later on we will take up the case of two-dimensional motion, like the motion of baseball through the air. 
Scalars and  Vectors 	  Consider the dashboard of a car shown in Figure 2.2. It displays information about the motion of the car. The odometer shows the miles driven by the car during its lifetime. The speedometer shows the instantaneous speed of the car. These values describe amount, or size, or (as we say in physics) magnitude, but they do not include information about the direction of the cars motion. In order to describe the motion of an object completely, two pieces of information are required In physics we use the term scalar when referring only to magnitude. Distance (i.e. 30 miles) and speed (i.e. 30 mph) are two examples of scalar quantities. We use the term vector when referring to both magnitude and direction. Two examples of vectors are: The odometer (300,000 miles) shows the distance the car has traveled and the speedometer shows the instantaneous speed of the car (61 mph). a. A race car moving at 110 mph b. A turtle strolling at 200 cm/min c. An SUV moving at at 40 km/h east Answer: C, since both speed and direction are given. Speed is considered the scalar component of velocity. Answer: We do not associate any direction with time, since we cannot choose to move in whatever direction we wish through time. This is not to say that t = -3.0 s has no meaning. It simply refers to a situation that occurred three seconds before our observation began. It does not imply that we can move backward in time. 
Position 	  We need to know where things are, both in the context of daily life and in the complexities of modern science. Physics defines the location of an object by assigning a position to it. Just as with mathematics, physics typically uses a coordinate system. The coordinate system must have a zero point or origin in order to properly reference position. Since we are discussing one-dimensional motion we will use the simplest coordinate systema number line with a marked zero, negative values to the left of zero, and positive values to the right of zero. Distance is a scalar quantity giving the positive length between two points. The total length for a series of distances can be computed by adding the absolute values of each length segment. X = |P1 ?P2|+|P2 ?P3|+... Displacement is the difference between final and initial positions. ?x = Pf ?Pi, where Pf is the final position of the object and Pi is the initial position of the object. 
Determining  Distance and  Displacement 	  Place a dot anywhere along a line and you have identified a position for an object. Lets imagine a marble on the line at position, P1 = 3 units, that travels to position P2 = 7 units, and then turns around, ending its journey at the origin P3 = 0 units (illustrated in Figure 2.3). To answer the first question, we add the distance the marble moved from P1 to P2 and then from P2 to P3 without regard for direction. |P1 P2| = 4 units |P2 P3| = 7 units |P1 P2| + |P2 P3| = 11 units To answer the second question we note where the marble started (3 units) and where the marble ended (0 units). 
P3 = 0 units 	  P3 P1 = 0 3 units = -3 units The displacement of the marble is therefore three units to the left. Notice that the first case (distance) gives no information on the final position of the marble, and the second case (displacement) gives no information about the total distance the marble travels. The use of negative signs in physics typically indicates direction, rather than quantity. A position of -3 units is not a larger position than -5 units, even though mathematically, negative three is larger than negative five. 
Using  Graphs to  Distinguish  Between  Distance and  Displacement 	  Mr. Jones lives on the same road as the high school where he works. During his morning commute, Mr. Jones drives two miles in two minutes to reach the donut shop. He spends six minutes at the shop and then realizes hes forgotten his lunch at home. He returns home, again covering two miles in two minutes. How should the data be graphed to represent the motion of Mr. Jones car? Which of the two graphs below is correct? Both of these graphs are correct, but they provide different information. Graph 1 in Figure 2.4 displays the distance traveled by the car as a function of time, while Graph 2 in Figure 2.5 displays the position of the car as a function Graph 1. This graph shows what the odometer would display: Mr. Jones traveled four miles. What it does not display is the current location of Mr. Jones car. Graph 2. This graph shows the location of the car. You can tell from reading the graph that the car has returned to where it started. However, determining the distance the car traveled from this graph is not that obvious. of time. After ten minutes, the car has traveled four miles (Graph 1 in Figure 2.4), and it is back where it started (Graph 2 in Figure 2.5). Using Graph 2 in Figure 2.5, the total distance the car traveled can be found by adding up the segments of its motion, while the final position of the car can immediately be read from the graph. Using Graph 1 in Figure 2.4, the total distance the car traveled can immediately be read from the graph, but there is no way to determine the cars final position. Graph 2 in Figure 2.5, the position versus time graph, is more useful. Answer: As long as all of the motion takes place in only one direction. Answer: Consider the definition of displacement: ?x = Pf ?Pi. Since the initial and final positions for both paths are identical, the displacement must be the same for paths A and B. URL

Average  Speed and  Instantaneous  Speed 	  Suppose you are travelling along a long straight highway. You start driving, and an hour later, you are 100 km away. Your average speed is the 100 km/hr. The information you have is time and distance. You can calculate your speed by dividing the distance youve traveled by the time of travel. distance	?x	100 km 
Speed =	=	=	= 100 km/hr 	  time	?t	1 hour During the hour that this trip took, your speedometer may have many different readings. You might have been traveling faster during the first part of the hour, and then slower in the second half. The reading on the speedometer is your instantaneous speed. If you go back on a return trip, the calculation of the speed is the same. The result is still 100 km/hr (also abbreviated "kph" for "kilometers per hour"). Like distance, speed is a scalar quantity and thus always positive. The speedometer reading is the same no matter what direction you are driving in. Speed cannot provide information about direction. 
Average  Velocity 	  Velocity is different than speed because velocity is a vector quantity and as such will have both a magnitude and a direction. Velocity is the combination of speed and direction. We define velocity as the change in position divided by the change in time. Change of position can be either positive or negative, so velocity can be positive or negative. v In the example above, the velocity on the outbound trip is +100 km/hr, while the velocity on the return trip is -100 km/hr ( Figure 2.7). See below for detailed calculations. Velocity vectors on cars indicating direction and magnitude.

Mr. Jones velocity during the time interval [0, 2] is calculated using the definition of velocity: ??xt . What is the slope of the line for the interval [0, 2]? A bit of thought would lead you to the conclusion that the slope is identical to the definition of velocity, as long as the units are included. In fact, the units of velocity are an aid in determining how to calculate velocity; miles over minutes imply division. This is a very important result: any slope in a position vs. time graph has units of distance/time. Therefore, the slope of the line in a position-time graph is velocity. During the interval [8, 10], the slope of the line is negative. We can immediately surmise that the motion is toward the left on a conventional number line. During the interval [2, 8], the line is horizontal, so the slope is zero, which in turn indicates that the velocity is also zero. This conclusion makes sense physically, since Mr. Jones (and his car) are at the same position during the time interval [2, 8]. If his position is not changing, then of course, hes not moving. So his velocity must be zero. Lets state some general conclusions regarding position-time graphs, using the sign conventions of a number line. Answers: The ant has a velocity of -5 m/s over the first five seconds and a velocity of +3 m/s over the last six seconds ( Figure 2.8). Answers: During the first five seconds the marble rolls to the right, slowly. During the next five seconds, it continues rolling to the right but faster. During the next five seconds, the marble rolls to the left a bit slower than during the previous five seconds. During the last five seconds, the marble is stationary. URL 
Objectives 	  Calculate average speed for varying rates. Explain what is meant by instantaneous velocity. average speed: Found by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time required to travel. instantaneous velocity: Velocity at a specific time, estimated by finding an average velocity over smaller and smaller time intervals. 
Introduction 	  Average speed is always found by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time required to travel. If you are always given numbers in distances and times, this is easy. If you are given speeds, then you need to convert those speeds into distances before taking the average. Example 1: A person travels for 60 miles at 20 miles per hour, and then travels another 60 miles at 60 mph. What is their average speed? To find the average speed, we first need the total time. Time to drive the first 60 miles: 60 miles/20 mph = 3 hrs. Time to drive the second 60 miles: 60 miles/60 mph = 1 hr. The average speed for the trip is then: Average speed = total distance = (60+60) miles = 120 miles = 30 mph total time 3+1 hours 4 hrs There is a common error that the average of 20 mph and 60 mph should be 40 mph, but that is only if they traveled those speed for equal times. Example 2: A person travels for two hours at 30 miles per hour and then travels for one hour at 60 mph. What is the persons average speed? Total distance covered at 30 mph: 30mph2hrs = 60 miles. Total distance covered at 60 mph: 60mph  1hr = 60 miles. Average speed = total distance = (60+60) miles = total time 3 hours 40 mph The car speeds up along its trip. Answer: v		mph . Answer: There is no mention of the length of the bridge. The information is probably unnecessary. What is known? The length of the bridge is the same regardless of which way it is traversed. Call the length of the bridge L. Since we dont know the time that it takes for each trip over the bridge, lets call the time going: t1 and the time returning t2. We use the definition for average speed:v = total distancetotal time The distance going can be expressed as: L = 25t1, and the distance returning can be expressed as L = 40t2. Solving each of these equations for time, permits the time of each trip to be expressed as: t1 = 25L and t2 = 40L . The total distance for the trip is L+L = 2L. Therefore: 
Total distance =	(2 L)	. total time 	  Notice LL can be factored out of the equation, which means the length is irrelevant to the problems solution as we had surmised. A bit of algebraic rearranging gives us: 
Determining  Average  Velocity 	  If the motion is always in the same direction, the average velocity will have the same numerical value as the average speed, except that a direction of motion must also be given. If motion changes direction, though, the average velocity will be different than the average speed. Average velocity depends on the total displacement, defined as the line from the final position from the initial position. If we assign the zero position on the New Jersey side of the bridge, then when traveling to New York, the displacement is: Pf ?Pi = L? 0. Traveling back from New York, the displacement is Pf ?Pi = 0 ?L. The total displacement is L+(?L) = 0. The average velocity for the round trip over the bridge is 0 mph. A car moves due east at 30 mph for 45 min, turns around, and moves due west at 40 mph for 60 minutes. What is the average velocity for the entire trip? Answers: 
Instantaneous  Velocity 	  As we said earlier, instantaneous speed is like the reading of a cars speedometer. It is the speed at any exact point in time. Instantaneous velocity refers to velocity at a specific time, such as t = 3.0 s. It is like the reading of a speedometer combined with a pointer for current direction. In practice, we cannot find a truly instantaneous velocity. Instead, we find an average velocity over smaller and smaller intervals of time. For example, a modern car speedometer works by measuring the fraction of a second it takes for the cars wheels to turn once. For driving, this is close to instantaneous. When we measure average velocity over a smaller and smaller intervals of time (?t), we get closer and closer to instantaneous velocity. The diagram below shows the position of an object at the times t2, 5.00 s and t1, 3.00 s. If t1 is held fixed and t2 permitted to approach t1, the slope of the line between t2 and t1 progressively comes closer to the slope of a tangent line through t1. The slope of the line through t1 is called the instantaneous velocity at t1. In general, the slope of the tangent line to a curve in a position-time graph gives the instantaneous velocity. URL As T2 approaches T1 the tangent line through T1 is approximated. 
Objectives 	  The student will: define and explain acceleration. average acceleration: The change in velocity divided by the duration of the time period. constant acceleration: A type of motion in which the velocity of an object changes by an equal amount in every equal time period. 
Equation 	  ~a avg=?~v?t , where the arrows indicate that ~a and~v are vector quantities 
Introduction 	  In everyday life, we use acceleration to refer to an object getting faster and picking up greater speed. In physics, though, we use acceleration to mean any change in velocity. In physics, acceleration can refer to speeding up, slowing down, or turning. Because velocity is a vector, it has a direction. A change in direction is a change in velocity. In a car, using the gas pedal is accelerating, but so is using the brakes or the steering wheel. To see what a change of velocity means, it is best to represent an objects motion with a velocity-time graph. This is extremely useful in determining acceleration and displacement. Average acceleration is a change in velocity, divided by a change in time. It can be calculated with this equation: ~a avg = ?~v?t If the rate of change in velocity is uniform, the acceleration is uniform, as well. Note that uniform acceleration and constant acceleration mean the same thing. We will only consider uniform acceleration unless otherwise stated. Answer: If the brakes are applied while moving to the right the acceleration is to the left and therefore negative. If the breaks are applied while the car is traveling to the left, the acceleration is to the right and is therefore positive. Answer: Increase your velocity to the left. As common as the term acceleration is, there is a good deal of confusion surrounding the concept. An object can have any acceleration and simultaneously have a zero velocity. The velocity of an object at any instant (think of the speedometer in your car) gives no information in determining the objects acceleration, only the rate of change of velocity can be used to determine the objects acceleration. 
Thinking  About  Acceleration 	  Suppose that a cheetah, starting from rest, has an acceleration of over 33 (km/hr/s), or kilometers per hour per second. After one second, the cheetah has a speed of 33 km/h, after two seconds, its speed is 66 km/h, and after three seconds, its speed is 99 km/h and 99 km/h is over 60 mph. So it takes a cheetah only three seconds to go from zero to 60. The cheetah increases its velocity by 33 km/h every second. The units help to explain that acceleration depends upon the changing rate of velocity. 33 km/h is the same as 9.2 m/s (meters per second). So an acceleration of 33 km/h per second is 9.2 m/s per second. This is expressed as 9.2 m/s2. Using dimensional analysis, we can see this from the formula for acceleration, a . The cheetah is the fastest land animal. Answer: A useful conversion to remember is 1 km/h =  m/s. (1 km/h) m/s Using this conversion, 65 km/h = 18 m/s, the acceleration is: a	5 m/s2. Answer: Using our conversion from before, 1 km/h =  m/s, we can make a conversion fraction for km/h to m/s. If the gazelle started from rest, and accelerates at 4.5m/s2, then after the first second its speed is 4.5 m/s, after the second second, its speed is 9.0 m/s, and after the third second its speed is 13.5 m/s. So we know the answer must be between two and three seconds. Using the definition of acceleration, a = ??vt ; substitution gives: 4.5 m/s2 = 11?m/st . Rearranging and solving, gives: ?t = 411.5 m/sm/s2 = 2.4 s 
Objectives 	  The student will: interpret area in an acceleration-time graph. represent motion using a velocity-time graph. interpret slope and area in a velocity-time graph. linear: Related to, or resembling a straight line. midpoint: The point of a line segment or curvilinear arc that divides it into two parts of the same length; a position midway between two extremes. 
Introduction 	  The units associated with real world variables are a great aid in understanding physical phenomena. In this section it will become clear why labeling variables associated with the slope, or the instantaneous slope (given by the tangent to a curve), and area under a curve, are so useful. 
Graphs of  Acceleration vs  Time 	  We begin with a car stopped at a red light. When the light turns green, the car begins to move with a constant (uniform) acceleration of 2.0 m/s2. We define the instant that the car begins to move as t = 0.0 s, and the initial position of the car, at the red light, as 0.0 m. How is the graph of acceleration versus time over the time interval [0.0, 4.0] seconds plotted? Since the acceleration is uniform, it remains 2.0 m/s2, the entire four seconds, which suggests a horizontal line for the acceleration-time graph. Consider the units of the area in the acceleration-time plane. Any area will do. Lets choose a rectangular area. We compute the rectangular area the same way we compute any rectangular area: multiply the rectangles length by its width. Our interest is not in computing a number. Instead, we wish to determine the units of the area. At first glance, this may seem a confusing goalafter all, area is measured in units of length squared, such as meters squared. However, the area in the acceleration-time plane is different because the x and y axes do not have units of length. The y?axis has units of acceleration, m/s2, and the x?axis has units of time, s; the area, therefore, has units of s2 1 s . But m/s are the units for either speed or velocity. If we treat acceleration as a vector, allowing for a change in direction, then the area in the acceleration-time plane is the change in velocity. Using the area to compute speed from an acceleration-time graph is only correct for motion in one direction. However, computing the change in velocity from an acceleration-time graph is always true, and so unless otherwise stated, we will only use this method for velocity calculations. Use the area under an acceleration-time graph to create a velocity-time table. Note the velocity is the instantaneous velocity. Consider the rectangular area formed for the time interval [0, 1] (horizontal length) and the corresponding acceleration interval, [0, 2] (vertical length). The area for the interval is (1.0 s)(2.0 m/s2) = 2.0 m/s. The result is interpreted, as follows: During the time interval [0, 1] the car has gained a velocity of 2.0 m/s. Thus, at the instant t = 1.0 s, the car has an instantaneous velocity of 2.0 m/s. The area of the rectangle for the time interval [0, 2] and the corresponding acceleration interval [0, 2] = (2.0 s)(2.0 m/s2) = 4.0 m/s. Therefore, at t = 2.0 s, the car has an instantaneous velocity of 4.0 m/s. Repeated applications of this process for time intervals [0, 3] and [0, 4], leads to the Table 2.2. TABLE 2.2: 
Velocity- Time  Table 	  t(s) v(m/s) Notice that for any interval of 1.0 s, the car gains another 2.0 m/s of velocity, which is exactly what is meant by Answer: We begin by realizing that from rest means the initial velocity (and speed) of the bus is zero. Conceptually, we imagine that every second the bus gains 1.5 m/s of additional speed. Therefore, at the end of the fourth second, the bus has a speed of 6.0 m/s and a velocity of 6.0 m/s due east. Answer: At its highest position above ground, before falling back to Earth, its velocity is 0.0 m/s. a		10 m/s2 ? Answer: a = ??vt = ((vtff ??tvii)), a = (?30(3?) 0) = ?10 m/s2 Questions to consider: 
Gravitational  Acceleration 	  The rate at which a freely falling object increases its velocity is attributed to the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on bodies near its surface. The force of gravity near the Earths surface is assumed to be constant, and therefore the gravitational acceleration near the Earths surface is constant, as well. It was Galileo who challenged the accepted wisdom of Aristotle. Aristotle hypothesized that objects fell at a rate proportional to their weight. Galileo, on the other hand, insisted that all objects, regardless of their weight, in the absence of air resistance, fall at the same rate. See the link below regarding Galileos famous ball drop experiment. URL Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was the first person to determine the numerical value of the acceleration of gravity near the Earths surface. In order to do this, he needed to convince himself that when an object was released, it continually sped up. Early on, he believed that after a very short time, the speed of a falling object remained fixed. It was not until he diluted the effect of gravity by rolling balls down long inclined planes in order to decrease the acceleration of gravity that he convinced himself that objects not only continue to increase their speed, but that they increased their speed by a fixed amount during equal time intervals. For example, a solid ball rolling down an inclined plane fixed at a five degree angle increases its speed about 0.61 m/s every second. That is, it has an acceleration of 0.61 m/s2. Galileo was able to reason that when the inclined plane is raised to 90 degrees (that is, vertical) falling objects would accelerate at ?10 m/s2. This is the value of the gravitational acceleration, g, near the Earths surface. The exact value of gravitational acceleration varies with your position on the Earth, going from ?9.75 m/s2 to ?9.83 m/s2, but the value of -10 will be used for our calculations. The acceleration-time graph below is for a toy rocket launched upward with an initial velocity of +30 m/s. Note that the initial velocity cannot be determined from the graphit must be a supplied piece of information; or, as we say, an initial condition. URL We can generate a velocity-time table in the same way as before by determining the area in the acceleration-time plane or by using the equation: vf = at +vi. If we use the area method we see after one second the area is -10 m/s. The negative sign implies that after the first second of travel, the object has lost 10 m/s of its speed. Since the initial velocity was +30 m/s, it has +20 m/s of velocity remaining by the end of the first second of travel. Since the acceleration-time graph is horizontal, each proceeding second of time will again have an area of -10 m/s. Thus, as each second goes by, the rocket loses another 10 m/s of velocity. The equation vf = ?10t + 30 shows this very nicely. See the Table 2.3: TABLE 2.3: T(s)	V(m/s) Answer: Yes. Using the same method to find the units of the area, multiplying the vertical units by the horizontal units, we have  m. Thus, the area in the velocity-time plane represents the displacement of the rocket at a specific time. Lets use the area in the velocity-time plane in order to generate a position-time graph for the rocket. Lets say the initial position of the rocket is +10 m. Consider the trapezoidal area under the graph for the time interval [0, 1] (see Figure 2.17). It is helpful to break the trapezoid into a rectangle and triangle in order to compute the area. The rectangle can be formed with a horizontal side (length) of 1.0 second long and a vertical side (height) of +20 m/s high. The triangular area can be formed with a base of 1.0 second and height of +10 m/s. The area of the rectangular is then (1.0 s)(20 m/s) = +20 m and the area of the triangle is 5 m. The total area gives a displacement of +25 m. Recall however, that the rocket started at +10 m. Therefore, at t = 1.0 s, the rockets position is (+10)+(+25) = +35 m. Next, look at the time interval [1, 2]. A rectangle with the length 1.0 s and the height +10 m/s, and a triangle with a base of 1.0 s and a height of 10 m/s can be constructed. The area of the rectangle is +10 m and the area of the triangle is again, +5 m. The position of the rocket at t = 2 s is therefore (+35)+(+10)+(+5.0) = +50 m. The interval [2, 3] is just composed of a triangle with the same position +5.0 m. Thus the rockets position at t = 3.0 s is, (+50)+(+5.0) = +55 m. Notice that the velocity of the rocket is zero at t = 3.0 s. So, at t = 3.0 s, the rocket has position +55 m (55 m above ground level), zero velocity, and an acceleration of ?10 m/s2. Remember, the acceleration is the slope of the line in the velocity-time plane, and the slope is constant. Since the velocity of the rocket is zero at t = 3.0 s, it suggests the rocket has reached its highest position and will begin its descent earthward. If this is indeed the case then the position of the rocket at t = 4.0 s must be lower than 55 m. For the time interval [3, 4], we see that the triangle is the same as for the time interval [2, 3]. However, the velocity is a negative quantity for the [3, 4] time interval, and therefore the position will be negative. Hence, instead of the +5 m we determined for the interval [2, 3] we have -5.0 m. Since the rocket is at +55 m at t = 3.0 s, at t = 4 s, it is at (+55)+(?5) = +50 m. See if you can determine that at t = 5.0 s, the rocket is at + 35 m and at t = 6.0 s, it is at +10 m. In other words, it is in the same position at t = 6.0 s as when it was launched, at t = 0. (Why do you think that is the case?) 
Deriving the  Kinematic  Equations 	  We begin with a familiar problem. Parachutists can land safely because they are not in free fall (more than the force of gravity acts upon them). Air resistance early on in the jump is responsible for quickly bringing a parachutist to a comparatively small, constant rate of fall, commonly called the terminal velocity. If the terminal velocity is 7 m/s how far will a parachutist fall in 3 seconds? URL We have: x = vt = 73 = 21 m. Problems such as this are easy because the velocity is constant. Consider a question with varying velocity. A toy rocket is launched with an initial velocity of +30 m/s. How far has the rocket traveled after three seconds if it started from an elevation of +10 m? We can still solve this problem using x = vt but we need to determine what the appropriate v is. We make use of the area in the velocity-time plane do to this. Rather than add up the areas in the velocity-time plane, one second at a time, lets find the area under the graph for the interval of time [0, 3]. This area is a triangle, with a base of 3 s and a height of 30 m/s. The area of the triangle is 45 m (remember we had an initial position of +10 m in the problem so we end up with +55 m). The equation used to find 45 m can be reinterpreted as 15. Geometrically, this represents a rectangle of length 3 s and height 15 m/s. The average velocity for the time interval [0, 3.0] is  = 15 m/s. This result suggests that whether we find the triangular area under the graph from 0 to 3 seconds, or the area of a rectangular using the average speed times the time interval, the result is the same. The big triangle shows the rocket slowing as it goes up. The big rectangle is going up at the average speed. These have the same area because the red and blue areas are the same. This is not a coincidence since 15 m/s is the midpoint of the linear function vf = at +vi between 0 and 3 seconds. For the first half of the time interval [0, 1.5] the velocity of the rocket is slower than 15 m/s, and for the second half of the time interval [1.5, 3.0] it is faster than 15 m/s. The midpoint of the interval can therefore be used as the average velocity. Thus, vavg = . In a circus act, a performer is shot from a vertical cannon with an initial speed of 40 m/s. Using ?10 m/s2 as an approximation for the acceleration due to gravity: Answer: Though many problems can be solved this way, there are more difficult problems requiring a bit more mathematical sophistication. We now derive two useful one-dimensional kinematic equations. All that is necessary in order to derive the next two kinematic equations are the use of: (vi+vf )t 
Equation  B: vf = at +vi 	  Substitute vf from B into A and after rearranging and simplifying we have: xf xi vf ?vi 
Using  B, find t =	a 	  Substitute t from B into A and after rearranging and simplifying we have: vf 2 = vi2 +2a?x 
Kinematic  Equations 	  The link below shows an example using the kinematic equations for horizontal motion under acceleration. URL Displacement is the difference between the ending position and starting position of motion.	It is a vector quantity. Velocity is the rate of change of position. It is vector quantity. Average speed can be computed finding the total distance divided by the total time or by a weighted average. The slope of a line in the position-time plane represents velocity. The area in the acceleration-time plane represents a change in velocity. Area in the velocity-time plane represents a change in position (displacement). The slope of a line in the velocity-time plane represents acceleration. The gravitational acceleration near the surface of the earth is very close to 9.8 m/s2. The kinematic equations of motion in one dimension are: 
Chapter  Outline 	  Two-dimensional motion expands the concepts of motion to cover change in two directions at once. At the core of this are the concept of vectors, and the independence of motion along each axis. 
Objectives 	  The student will: understand how motion along each axis can be resolved independently solve problems involving objects which are simultaneously under the influence of uniform acceleration and constant velocity along different dimensions free fall: The condition of acceleration due only to gravity. An object in free fall is not being held up, pushed, or pulled by anything except its own weight. Though objects moving in air experience some force from air resistance, this is sometimes small enough that it can be ignored and the object is considered to be in free fall. instantaneous velocity of a projectile: The velocity of an object at one instant during its motion. In the case of a projectile, the instantaneous velocity vector would be the result of a constant velocity horizontal motion and an accelerated velocity vertical motion. projectile motion: Projectile motion is a form of motion where a projectile is thrown near the Earths surface with some horizontal component to its velocity. The projectile moves along a curved path under the action of gravity. The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory. Projectile motion is motion in two directions. In the vertical direction, the motion is accelerated motion and in the horizontal direction, the motion is constant velocity motion. range: A projectile launched with specific initial conditions will travel a predictable horizontal displacement before striking the ground. This distance is referred to as the projectiles range. 
Equations 	  xf = vxt +xi yf = 21gt2 +yi (only for no initial vertical velocity) 
Independence of  Motion 	  The key to understanding motion in two or more dimensions is one principle: Motion in each dimension works independently. What does this mean? If we slide an object along a horizontal surface with little friction, like a hockey puck over ice, it will keep going in the same direction and speed constant velocity. If we drop an object in the air, it will fall with speed increasing at the same rate constant acceleration.	What happens if we combine these, like if we slide an object off the end of a table so that it falls? In the horizontal direction, it continues with the constant speed. In the vertical direction, it speeds up with constant acceleration exactly as if dropped. These two combine to make a path (or trajectory) that curves downward. This is a special case of what is called projectile motion. 
Free  Fall 	  Free fall is an idealized state of motion in which air resistance is neglected and only gravity acts upon a falling object. We consider situations in which objects are in free fall, after being launched with a certain horizontal velocity. Examples of such motion would be a baseball thrown with an initial horizontal velocity (a line-drive) or rifle aimed horizontally and shot. We will discuss the more general case of an object fired at some angle above the horizontal in the next section. Take two pennies and place them on a table top. Position one penny close to the edge of the table. Then, slide the other penny into the stationary penny with a glancing (very off center) blow. Both pennies will fall off of the table, but the one that was motionless will fall almost straight down (you may have to try this several times) while the other penny should slide off the table with an evident horizontal velocity. Have a friend watch the result to confirm that the pennies impact the ground at about the same instant. Gravity does not care how fast an object moves horizontally (just as the forward motion of the boat, in the last section, was unaffected by the current.) The faster-moving penny follows an obvious parabolic path to the ground. The parabola is the result of the penny engaged in two one-dimensional motions, simultaneously: horizontal motion at a constant velocity (air resistance is negligible) and vertically accelerated motion due to gravity. Because the penny accelerates vertically, it does not move equal distances in equal times, as is the case for the horizontal direction. If the horizontal and vertical distances stayed in a fixed ratio to each other, the penny would appear to fall diagonally, not with the curve of a parabola. URL A gun is positioned horizontally 1.75 m above the ground. A bullet exits with a muzzle velocity of 400 m/s. At the same instant as the bullet leaves the gun, an identical bullet is dropped from the height of the gun barrel. The second bullet falls straight down, landing at the feet of the shooter. Answer: Yes, they do. Answer: The answer to this question relies on two pieces of information: (1) the horizontal velocity of the bullet and (2) the time it takes the bullet to fall to the ground. Since were told how fast the bullet is moving horizontally (400 m/s) we need to know how much time elapses before bullet hits the ground. Once we have the time, the range is only a matter of using x = vt, where x is the range of the bullet. The time is found by using the one-dimensional kinematic equation: yf = at2 +vit +yi 
Setting yf	0 (in the y?direction), yi = 1.75m 	  Therefore, 0 . So, the range of the bullet is: x = vt = (400m/s)(0.589s) = 239.2 = 239m. By convention we often specify x as R for the range, hence R = 239 m. Note, this is an idealized example since air resistance is substantial for a bullet traveling at a speed of 400 m/s. b. The muzzle velocity of the bullet from the barrel. c. Both the height and the muzzle velocity d. Both a and b and the weight of the bullet. Answer: The correct answer is C. Consider a bullet fired from the same height but an exit speed of 500 m/s: range = 500(0.598) = 299 m. Consider the height of the gun lowered to 1.50 m with the same exit speed of 400 m/s. Time to ground and time of flight = 0.553 s, r = 400(0.553) = 221.3 m. 
Lab  Example 	  Students are given the task of finding the muzzle velocity for a toy dart gun. The gun is held horizontally and the distance from the floor to the dart is 1.5 meters. The dart is fired half a dozen times and the average horizontal displacement is 6.0 meters. What is the velocity of the dart as it exits the barrel of the gun? (See Figure 3.3.) This motion has two components: Vertical free-fall and horizontal motion at constant velocity. A chart to keep track of the data is useful. TABLE 3.1: 
Vertical 	  x = 6.0 m y = 1.5 m v =? v = 0 m/s a = 0 a = ?10 m/s2 t =? t =? The amount of time that the dart takes to hit the ground is also the amount of time it spends traveling horizontally. Therefore, once the time for the dart to fall 1.5 m is calculated, it can be used to determine the darts horizontal velocity. Furthermore, since we can determine the vertical velocity of the projectile at any point along its trajectory, we can also determine its instantaneous velocity at any time during its flight. Using kinematics in one dimension, we find the time for the dart to hit the ground: yf = 21at2 +vit +yiyf = 0,yi = 1.5 m and a = g = ?10 m/s2. Inserting our values, we find the time equals 0.55 seconds. Therefore, the dart has traveled a horizontal distance of 6.0 m in 0.55 seconds. Its horizontal component of velocity is therefore vx =	 = 10.9 m/s When it hits the floor after 0.55 seconds, it has the same horizontal velocity that it started with. Its vertical velocity at that time is vy = at = (?10m/s2)(0.55s) = ?5.5m/s The vertical and horizontal velocities are independent, and can be solved separately. 
Plotting the  Motion of the  Dart in the 	  It would be instructive to graphically display the horizontal and vertical motions of the dart since their graphical forms are different. The horizontal motion of the dart has constant velocity. The dart covers equal horizontal displacements in equal time, and its representation in a position-time graph is linear as seen in Figure 3.4. The vertical motion of the dart has constant acceleration. The dart does not cover equal vertical displacements in equal time, and its representation in a position-time graph is parabolic as seen in Figure 3.5. The horizontal motion of the dart has constant velocity. The vertical motion of the dart undergoes acceleration. 
Objectives 	  The student will: explain the relationship between coordinates and components. use vectors and vector components to add and subtract vectors. use trigonometric relationships to express vector components. resultant vector: A single vector that is the vector sum of two or more other vectors. trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent, inverse tangent vector addition: Vector addition is the process of finding one vector that is equivalent to the result of the successive application of two or more given vectors. Another way to define addition of two vectors is by a head-to-tail construction that creates two sides of a triangle. The third side of the triangle determines the sum of the two vectors. vector components: Parts of a vector that add up to the whole. In two-dimensional problems, there are usually two componentsthe horizontal x-component and the vertical y-component. Vector addition of all the components yields the original vector. vector subtraction: An operation identical to adding a negative inverse of a vector, defined as a vector in the opposite direction to the vector with the same magnitude.

Introduction 	  The key to understanding motion in two or more dimensions is one principle: Motion in each dimension works independently. The real world has three spatial dimensions. Representing motion in two dimensions can model many real world phenomena more completely than modeling in one dimension. Some examples of two-dimensional motion are: an arrow shot into the air a baseball hit into left field a ball rolling off a table top 
Representing  Vectors in  Two  Dimensions 	  If you were asked to give directions to the point (3, 4) in Figure 3.7, you might suggest: Beginning at the origin of the coordinate system, walk along the x?axis, 3 units, then, turn left and walk 4 units in the y?direction. The arrow, drawn from the origin to the point (3, 4) is a graphical representation of a vector quantity. By definition, a vector quantity must have magnitude (amount) and direction. The length of the arrow indicates the magnitude of the vector and the inclination of the vector to the x?axis indicates its direction. Later on, we will indicate the direction of a vector using the angle, ?, it makes with the positive x?axis. A coordinate system with an arrow beginning at the origin and ending at the point (3,4). When we discuss vectors, we often refer to the x and y coordinates of a point as the components of the vector; the x?component of ~A and the y?component of ~A, where the bolded ~A is read as, vector A. Figure 3.8 shows the graphical representation of the x and y components of the vector (3, 4). The components of the vector may represent position, velocity, acceleration, force, and many other concepts. The red arrows represent the axial components of the vector beginning at the origin and ending at the point (3,4). 
Adding  Vectors 	  If we move over +3 and up +4 as instructed above, we end up standing at the tip of the arrowhead. If are now instructed to move +6 more units in the x?direction and +2 more units in the y?direction, where do we end up with respect to the origin of the coordinate system? We can determine our location by finding the total displacement in the x and y directions, separately. x : (+3+ (+6)) = +9,y = (+4+(+2)) = +6. Therefore, our final position is (+9,+6). A new vector from the origin to the point (+9,+6) can now be drawn. This vector represents the sum of the two vectors and is called the resultant vector. (See the green vector in Figure 3.9.) vector (+3,+4)+vector (+6,+2) = the resultant vector (+9,+6). We define vector (+3, +4) as ~A, and vector (+6, +2), as ~B, and vector (+9, +6), as C~ . Thus we can state: ~A+~B = C~ , and consider this process as vector addition. If vectors ~A and ~B had originally been drawn from the origin (see Figure 3.10), we could still add the two vectors together. Two methods to do so are presented below. Method 1: (Numerical) Add each vectors respective x and y components. Method 2: (Graphical-see Figure 3.10) Keep ~A where it is and slide ~B parallel to itselfpreserve its direction and lengthuntil the tail (the end) of ~B connects to the tip (head) of ~A, as we originally had done. Since the order of addition for Method 1 is irrelevant, that is: x = +3 +(+6) or 6 +(+3) and y = +4 +(+2) or +2 +(+4), this suggests that for the graphical method, the same resultant is formed regardless of whether ~B is slid and ~A remains where it or ~A is slid and ~B remains where it is. In using the graphical method an appropriate scale must be devised, such as 1.0 cm = 10.0 m or 1.0 cm = 5.0 m/s. Such a scale ensures that when vectors are drawn, they are correctly represented relative to each other. A protractor can also be used in order to draw the vectors correctly. In general, both methods are valid for any number of vectors as well as for subtracting vectors. 
Vector  Subtraction 	  Method 1: Subtract ~B from ~A: Multiply the x and y components of ~B by (-1) and then add our new ~B (lets call it ?~B) to ~A. Thus, ~A+(?~B), gives: x = (+3+(?6)) = ?3, and y = (+4+(?2)) = +2. Recall that ~A+(?~B) can be written as. Therefore, ~A?~B =C~ 0 = (?3,+2). Method 2: Since a vector can be made into its negative by multiplying its components by (-1), the graphical transformation of this multiplication process is a vector of the same length as the original vector but directed opposite to the original vector (see Figure 3.11). This is exactly what occurs when an ordered pair of coordinates has both of their signs changed. Therefore, all that is required to subtract vector ~B from vector ~A, is to reverse the direction of ~B, and add it to ~A: ~A+(?~B) =C~ . URL Answer: . Answer: . 
Using  Trigonometric  Functions to  Express  Vector  Components 	  Lets return to the situation we began with: finding our way from the origin to the point (3, 4). There is yet another set of directions that will take us from the origin, (0, 0) to (3, 4). Instead of moving in the x and y directions, we could move some number of units at a certain angle to the x?axis. For this particular example, moving 5 units at an angle of 53.13? is equivalent to walking +3 units in the x?direction, turning left, and walking +4 units in the y?direction. (Why do you think it is exactly 5 units?) If both methods yield the same result, there must be a way to mathematically show they are identical. And there is. It can be done using a few definitions involving ratios associated with a right triangle. 
Angle  A = 53.13 and angle  B = 36.87 	  The reference angle referred to in the sine, cosine, and tangent functions is A. See Figure 3.12 and the definitions given below. The reference angle is usually the angle formed with the positive x?axis, though as we will see, angle B can just as easily be used as the reference angle. Due to a bit of history, linguistics, and custom, we define these ratios as follows: The sine ratio is sinA = yr; (side opposite the reference angle(hypotenuse=r)	=y) The cosine ratio is cosA = xr; (side adjacent the reference angle(hypotenuse=r)	=x) The tangent ratio is tanA = cossinAA = xy; ((side opposite the reference angleside adjacent the reference angle)) The reference angle is the angle opposite the y side of the triangle. Once this angle is known, its the same angle for all the trigonometric functions. Again: sinA = yr,cosA = xr and tanA = xy. 
Answer: sin B = xr,cos B = yr and tan B = xy 	  Answers: x?leg: Using the definition of the sine:sin y?leg: Using the definition of the cosine: cos In general, when the reference angle is along the x?axis: x = rcos? and y = rsin?; and the ordered pair(x,y) = (rcos?,rsin?). A notation used to represent a vector in terms of an angle (direction) and a length (magnitude), is (r,?). Using the numerical values in the last example we have (5,53.13?). We interpret(5,53.13?), to mean the vector makes a positive 53.13 degree angle, when rotated counterclockwise from the positive x?axis, and has a length of 5 units from the origin to the tip of the arrowhead. 
Magnitude of  	  Answer: ~R is in the first quadrant, since both x and y are positive. Hence, we know the angle must be between 0 and 90 degrees. Furthermore, since y is larger than x, the angle must be greater than 45 degrees. Using the ratio associated with the tangent function we have: Therefore, we need to find the angle which gives the ratio . This can be done using the inverse function on your calculator. ? = tan?1 1.196 = 50.10?. Finally, ~R = (29.09,50.10?). 
Objectives 	  The student will: explain frames of reference and inertial frames. solve problems involving relative motion in one dimension. solve problems involving relative motion in two dimensions. inertial frame: A reference frame in which the observers are not subject to any accelerating force. reference frame: A coordinate system or set of axes within which to measure the position, orientation, and other properties of objects in it. It may also refer to an observational reference frame tied to the state of motion of an observer. relative velocity: The vector difference between the velocities of two bodies, or the velocity of a body with respect to another body which is at rest. 
Equations 	  (velocity of b relative to a) ~Vab =~Va ?~Vb (velocity of a relative to b) 
Introduction 	  Velocity is always measured relative to something. We measure how fast a person runs or how fast a car drives relative to the ground. However, we know from astronomy that the Earth itself is both turning around its axis and going around the Sun. A reference frame is a fixed point and we measure directions relative to it. If you are on a bus going north at 60 mph, then the person seated across the aisle from you has velocity 60 mph north relative to the ground and velocity zero relative to you. If the bus is going at a steady speed, you can toss a coin across to them, and it works the same as if you were standing on solid ground. In the bus frame of reference, you and the other passenger have velocity zero, and the coin has a slight velocity east (say 20 mph). In this frame of reference, someone standing to the side of the road would have a velocity 60 mph south. With the ground as your frame of reference, you and the other passenger are both moving 60 mph north, while the coin is moving diagonally northeast. The coins velocity vector is 60 mph north and 20 mph east added together. Both of these frames of reference are correct. You can solve any problem using either one, as long as you use it consistently. Some problems, though, are easier in one frame of reference than in another. If you wanted to solve how long it would take for the coin to go across the aisle, for example, then the bus frame of reference is much simpler. 
Inertial  Frames 	  There are endless examples of relative motion. Suppose that youre in an elevator that is rising with a constant speed of 2 m/s relative to the ground. If you release a ball while in this reference frame, how will the motion of the ball differ than had you dropped the ball while standing on the ground? Had you been asleep in this reference frame and woke after the compartment was in motion, you would have no idea you were in motion. There is no experiment that can be performed to detect constant velocity motion. If youve ever traveled in a jet moving 1000 km/h (about 600 mph) with no air turbulence, then you know from firsthand experience that you felt motionless. After the brief acceleration period, you can no longer sense the motion of the elevator. The ball will move as if it has been released in the reference frame of Earth. As a general statement, we consider all constant velocity reference frames to be equivalent. This idea is known as The Galilean Principle of Relativity. Constant-velocity reference frames are called inertial frames of reference. An at-rest reference frame is an arbitrary construct. If youre traveling with a constant velocity in your car, the reference frame of the car is an at-rest frame. The elevator compartment moving 2 m/s is an at-rest frame with respect to the compartment. Youwho are sitting and reading this firmly placed on the earthconsider yourself to be in an at-rest reference frame. But you know the Earth itself is in motion. It rotates about its axis with a speed of about 1600 km/h (1000 mph) at the equator, and it orbits the sun with an average speed of 108,000 km/h (67,000 mph). In fact, the Earth isnt even an inertial frame of reference, since it rotates about its axis and its orbital speed varies. (Remember, velocity is constant only if its magnitude and direction do not changeobjects in circular motion do not qualify!) We usually approximate the Earth as an inertial frame of reference since we do not readily sense the earths acceleration. Objects on Earths surface have a maximum acceleration due to its rotation of about 
Relative  Motion:  Part 1 	  The Figure 3.13, a moving walkway, provides us with our first example of relative motion. Let us consider two Cartesian coordinate systems. One is attached to the stationary Earth. The other is attached to a walkway moving with a constant horizontal velocity of 1 m/s with respect to the earth. If a ball is thrown with an initial horizontal velocity of 3 m/s in the direction the walkway is moving by a person standing on the walkway, what horizontal velocity does a person standing on the ground measure for the ball? The person in the Earth frame sees the ball having a combined velocity of 4 m/s. The person in the moving frame will measure it as 3 m/s. According to The Principle of Galilean Relativity, the velocity, V, seen from the at-rest frame is additive, that is, V = 1 m/s+ 3 m/s. See Figure 3.14. URL Two cars are headed toward each other. Car Amoves with a velocity of 30 mph due east and Car Bwith a velocity of 60 mph due west, relative to at-rest earth. See Figure 3.15. a. What is the velocity of car B relative to the velocity of car A? We define motion to the east as positive (+30 mph), and motion to the west as negative (-60 mph). From our previous statements regarding relative velocity we can feel that the relative velocity is greater than either speed: If we define the relative velocity (the velocity of car B relative to the velocity of car A) as: a, then ?60?30 = ?90 mph, a person in car A sees car B moving west at 90 mph. The person in car A sees himself as motionless while car B is moving toward him with car Bs speed and his own speed which he does not perceive. b. What is the velocity of car A relative to the velocity of car B? This means we are assuming car B is our at rest coordinate system. The person in car B sees himself as motionless, while car A is moving toward him with car As speed and his own speed, which he does not perceive. Part a: Passengers in the Car reference frame assume they are motionless. Part b: Passengers in the Car reference frame assume they are motionless. Note: The at-rest frame sees its motion reversed in the moving frame. Car A is moving due east with a speed of 30 mph and Car B is moving due north with a speed of 30 mph. a. What is the velocity of car A relative to car B? ~Vab =~Va ?~Vb The two vectors are not along the same line so well use their components ~Va = (+30,0) and ~Vb = (0,+30), where east is +x and north is +y , therefore,	. The components are directed east and south, so the direction is southeast. Since both components have the same magnitude, the angle must be 45?. But since the vector is in the southeast direction it is in the 4th quadrant so the angle is 315?, and the magnitude is the Pythagorean sum  mph Thus:	4 mph in direction 315? b. What is the velocity of car B relative to car A? The magnitude of the relative speed is the same, but the direction is reversed. Thus: ~Vba = 42.4 mph in direction 135? 
Relative  Motion:  Part 2 	  URL We begin Part 2 with a boat trip! A boat crossing a calm body of water. A boat moving at 4.0 m/s crosses a still lake, leaving from Point A and arriving at Point B. The distance between points A and B is 100 m. The path of the boat is directly from A to B and the time of travel is quickly found:  = 25 s. (See Figure 3.18.) What if the situation was changed to a river with a current of 3.0 m/s flowing due east, while the boat still leaves from point A, attempting to head due north to reach point B, moving at 4.0 m/s relative to the water? If the person steering the boat does not take the current of the water into consideration, the boat will not reach point B. The boat will arrive somewhere downstream from point B. Lets analyze this situation further (see Figure 3.19). Assuming the boat is aimed due north with no attempt to compensate for the current: In order to answer the first question we must decide if the presence of the current increases or decreases the northerly speed of the boat. What do you think? Lets think this through. If the current were flowing northeast or northwest, the boats northerly speed would increase (think of a tail wind adding speed to an airplanes motion). We already agree that the eastern (or western) component will cause the boat to veer off course. If the current, however, were flowing southeast or southwest, then the boats northerly speed would decrease (think of a headwind, subtracting speed from an airplanes motion). Again, the eastern (or western) component of the currents motion will cause the boat to veer off course. (See Figure 3.20.) We must conclude that a sideways (east or west) current cannot affect the forward (northward) motion of the boat. True, it can change the overall velocity of the boat. In Figure 3.21 the boat is moving both east, due to the current, and north under its own power. So, as seen from Point A or Point B, the boat is moving northeast. Since its velocity due north has not been affected by the current, the boats northern component of speed in still 4.0 m/s, and since the boat moves east with the current, it now has an eastward velocity of 3.0 m/s. Answers to questions 1 4: formula: square root of	32 +42 = 5 m/s. A final consideration is the interesting case of determining how to steer the boat such that it follows a straight course from point A to point B, in spite of the current. Recall that if there were no current the boat could just be aimed due north and it would easily move from point A to point B. We can intuit that the only hope of having the boat go from point A to point B is to aim the boat, somewhat, into the current, or upstream. In other words, we can effectively travel straight across as we did in the no-current situation by aiming the boat some amount into the current. Why does this work? First, consider what happens if a boat is aimed directly upstream with a speed equal to that of the current. The boat has a velocity of 3.0 m/s west and the water current has a velocity of 3.0 m/s east. What would someone positioned at point A see the boat do? If you think of the motions as two vectors for a moment: +3.0 m/s (current) + -3.0 m/s (boat), the vector sum is zero. In other words, the boat appears to be motionless to the observer at point A. So if the boat in our problem is aimed into the current such that its westward component is 3.0 m/s, we effectively have a situation equivalent to no current. The boat has a velocity of 4.0 m/s relative to the water and its westward component must be 3.0 m/s relative to the water if it is to cross directly from A to B. Using the Pythagorean formula we find the boats northern component of motion to be the square root of 7.0 m/s or about 2.65 m/s. The boat will move due north at 2.65 m/s and arrive at the point B in 2. seconds. With no current, the trip took 25 seconds. Some of the boats forward motion had to be sacrificed in order to maintain the correct direction of travel. We can also enquire about the direction the boat was aimed in order to make the trip directly to point B. Since the components of the vector triangle are known, any trigonometric function will do. Lets use the sine and find the angle as measured from the north-south line. Note, this was not the same angle that resulted when the boat was aimed due north and the current carried it downstream of B. Solve problems involving objects experiencing uniform horizontal motion and accelerated vertical motion 
Understand relative motion in a vertical plane 	  draw and interpret graphs involving two-dimensional projectile motion solve for the instantaneous velocity of a projectile predict a projectiles range 
Free fall 	  The condition of acceleration which is due only to gravity. An object in free fall is not being held up, pushed, or pulled by anything except its own weight. Though objects moving in air experience some force from air resistance, this is sometimes small enough that it can be ignored and the object is considered to be in free fall. 
Projectile motion 	  Projectile motion is a form of motion where an object (called a projectile) is thrown near the earths surface with some horizontal component to its velocity. The projectile moves along a curved path under the action of gravity. The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory. Projectile motion is motion in two directions. In the vertical direction, the motion is accelerated motion and in the horizontal direction, the motion is constant velocity motion. 
Instantaneous velocity of a projectile 	  Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of an object at one instant during its motion. In the case of a projectile, the instantaneous velocity vector would be the resultant of a constant velocity horizontal motion and an accelerated velocity vertical motion. 
Range 	  A projectile launched with specific initial conditions will travel a predictable horizontal displacement before striking the ground. This distance is referred to as the projectiles range. 
Equations 	  y t xf = (vcos?)t +xi yf yi vx = vcos? vy = vsin? 
Introduction 	  Independence of Motion along Each Dimension looks at the special case of throwing an object in a purely horizontal direction. Projectile motion is the general case of throwing an object in any direction, from sliding an object off a desk to kicking a soccer ball as shown in the Figure below. URL 
Finding instantaneous velocity 	  Lets look back at the case of a dart fired out from a dart gun, using vector mechanics. Consider the trajectory of the dart sometime between pulling the trigger and striking the ground. The diagram below is a representation of the instantaneous velocity components of the dart. 
Chou  License:  C- Y- C- A 3.0 	  Using only one-dimensional mechanics, we found that in the y-direction, it takes 0.55 seconds for the dart to hit the floor from a height of 1.5 meters. If the dart traveled a horizontal distance of 6.0 m in 0.55 seconds, then its horizontal component of velocity is therefore vx =	 = 10.9 m/s . What is the vector velocity at time, t = 0.25s ? The x and y velocity components represent the legs of the right triangle (see Figure abovevx2 +vy2 = v2, gives the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity of the projectile once the square root is taken. The x velocity is constant, so we know it is 10.9 m/s at all times. For the y velocity, we know from one-dimensional motion that vf = at +vi. The acceleration from gravity is constant, giving: (?10m/s2)(0.25s)+0m/s = ?2.5 m/s. Now that both legs of the right triangle are known, we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the instantaneous speed (the hypotenuse of the right triangle) at time, t = 0.25 s. q	q v =	v2x +v2y =	(10.9m/s)2 +(2.5m/s)2 = 11.2 m/s If all that was asked for in this problem was the instantaneous speed of the dart at 0.25 s we would be done. However, you may be asked for the darts instantaneous velocity at t = 0.25 s. In that case, you need to determine the instantaneous direction of the dart as well (recall that velocity is a vector quantity, and as such, has a magnitude and a direction). Finding the instantaneous direction of the velocity of the dart at t = 0.25 s: Using the tangent function is the most efficient method. The angle that we need to find is somewhat arbitrary; after all, other than the right angle, the triangle has two perfectly good angles to choose from. The angle usually preferred, however, is measured from x?direction. Using the inverse tangent relationship which can be found on your calculator, we have: If you are asked to represent the vector using the trigonometric definition of angle measurement, than either ?12.7? or 347.3? would do. The final vector result can be stated as (11.2m/s,?12.7?). 
Components of projectile motion 	  In the problem that follows we imagine the projectile launched from the ground with an angular elevation between 0 and 90 degrees, with an initial x?component of velocity of +30 m/s and an initial y?component of velocity of +40 m/s. 
Auyeung  License:  C- Y- C- A 3.0 	  Some typical questions that can be asked in such a situation are: vi+vf Of course, instead of using a bit of physical reasoning and simple arithmetic, we could have used more sophisticated equations to answer all these questions, but why make things more complicated than they have to be? Before leaving this problem, lets alter the given information, in order to see another way the problem could have been stated. A projectile is launched from the ground at an angle of 53.13 degrees with a speed of 50 m/s. Find the answers to questions 1-4 above. Our claim is that both problems are, in fact, identical and have the same answers. If were not given the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity, it is good policy to find them before trying to solve a problem of this sort. The x?component (horizontal) is: vx = vcos? ? 50cos53.13? = 30 m/s The y?component (vertical) is: vyi = vsin? ? 50sin53.13? = 39.999 ? 40 m/s, Since we see that the components are identical to the original problem, we can solve the problem the same way. URL An interesting aside: If at 4.1 s, (the time when the projectile has reached its maximum height) we pretend to erase the first half of the projectiles motion and label the projectile at its peak position with a vector (rather an a component of a vector) pointing to the right with a speed of 30 m/s, the remaining path of the projectile would be similar to the bullet and dart of the previous section (3.3 A Special case of Projectile Motion) and the problem would be solved in the same manner as both bullet and dart problems. See Figure below. Lets take a trip! Imagine a small airplane flying at a constant elevation of 80 m over your school soccer field, with a velocity of 50 m/s, (about to 110 mph), eastward; see Figure above. Ignore air resistance. 
Auyeung  License:  C- Y- C- A 3.0 	  The package remains under the plane, but people on ground see the packages descent as a parabola. Author: Image copyright Konstantin Yolshin, 2012; modified by CK-12 Foundation Christopher Auyeung License: Used under license form Shutterstock.com Source: URL Answer: An observer on the ground would see the package fall in a parabolic arc, as if it had been projected horizontally with a speed of 50 m/s; the same motion performed by the bullet and dart; (though the package would remain directly below the airplane). Answer: The package would appear to fall straight down, since the package and the airplane both have the horizontal velocity of 50.0 m/s. Answer: No, it will not, since, as the package falls, it is moving at the horizontal velocity 50 m/s. Answer: If we know how much time the package spends traveling at 50.0 m/s after it is released, we can use x = vt to solve the problem. The time the package remains in the air is found using our one-dimensional equation: yf yi where a = g = ?10 m/s2 , viy = 0 m/s (at the instant the package is released it has no velocity in the y?direction), yf = 0 and yi = 100 m; therefore, 0. Solving for t, we find t = 4.0 s. Thus x = (50.0m/s)(4.0s) = 200m. The package fell 200 m past target A. In order for the pilot to hit target A, the package must be released 200m before reaching the target, or 4.0 seconds before reaching target A. See Figure below 
Deriving some general results from the projectile equations 	  From the problems that we discussed, it should be reasonably clear that the equations we derived for one-dimensional kinematics can be used, with caution, for 2-dimentional kinematics. The only difference is that care must be taken in correctly identifying velocity components. Recall that if velocity is stated as V at an angle of ?[U+F02C] then the initial x and y components of the velocity are, vcos? and vsin?, respectively. With this in mind, we rewrite our kinematic equations as follows: The other equations are treated the same way, using the initial velocity in the y?direction: 
Special cases 	  What is the maximum range, R, of a projectile if yi = yf = 0? setting yi and yf = 0 in equation 2, and factoring out t, we have: t There are two solutions: t = 0 and t = ?2vgsin? The trivial condition is satisfied at launch (t = 0,yi = 0) and the nontrivial condition is satisfied at landing . If t = ?2vgsin? is substituted into equation 1 : R = (vcos?)t 
We have:  	  Using the trigonometric identity 2sin?cos? = sin2?, we have: R = ?v2sin2g ? We can extract a useful result from the range equation. Assuming that g is constant, the range is a function of the V and ?. Lets consider the angle. Since the maximum value of the sine is 1.0 then whatever angle makes sin2? = 1, will also maximize the range. Since sin90? = 1, 2? = 90? and the angle which produces the greatest range is 45?. The range continually increases with increasing velocity so there is no interesting information we can get out of V, except to say that V must be is at least some minimum value if the intended target is to be reached. Since 45? gives the greatest range, what kind of range will smaller and larger angles than 45? give? Forty-five degrees is an optimum condition and we notice that for ? = 30? and ? = 60? (equally distributed about 45? we have 2? = 2(30?) = 60?, and 2? = 2(60?) = 120? which gives sin60? = sin120?. The implication is that the range is the same for angles (45? +?) and (45? ??). This condition can be readily proven with a bit of trigonometry: Is sin(2(45? +?)) = sin(2(45? ??)) an identity? The distribution gives sin(90? + 2?) = sin(90? ? 2?), which after expansion gives: cos(2?) = cos(2?) and confirms the statement is an identity. Lastly, we consider expressing y as a function of x, rather than t. By solving equation 1 for t and substituting the result into equation 2, we have, after recalling tan? = , If Xi = 0 then ?x above can be replaced with X, or R. URL .

Newtons  Three  Laws 	  Newtons three Laws of Motion are the core of our understanding of force, which is how objects affect each others motion. In this chapter, we will cover the definition of force, an objects innate resistance to being moved by force called inertia and how forces interact with each other. 
Objectives 	  The student will: 
Understand the meaning of inertia and  Newtons  First  Law 	  force: Any effect on the motion of another object. This includes pushing and pulling, as well as resistance to being moved across or through. inertia: The resistance of any object to changing its state of motion, equal to its mass. mass: A measure of the amount of matter in an object. Weight on Earths surface is based on mass, but an objects mass is the same wherever it is taken. net force: The combination of all the forces on a single object. 
Introduction to  Newton 	  Isaac Newton was a 17th century scholar, scientist, and mathematician who formalized our present understanding of force. Our everyday experience is that moving objects always tend to stop, but Newton proved that this was the result of other things getting in the way like air resistance or friction. If you slide a book across a table, it comes to a stop. If you slide it along ice, it will go further before it stops. In the absence any opposing force, an object will slide forever. Newtons work showed that the natural state of moving objects in the absence of an opposing force is not rest, but continuous motion. 
Force 	  In everyday English, we use force to mean pushing or being pushy. For example, someone is called forceful if they insist on getting their way. In physics, pushing is a force, but force also means resisting being pushed. When you are standing, the ground is exerting force on you that keeps you from falling. The ground is not doing anything, but is still exerting a force known as a normal force. Common types of forces include: These three together are known as contact forces. Other forces include: A net force is not a type of force, but rather the combination of all the forces on a given object. 
Newtons  First  Law:  Inertia 	  Galileo formulated what we now call Newtons First Law of Motion. Newtons First Law of Motion: An object remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. A very important idea is implicit in Galileos statement. Objects at rest and objects in uniform motion (constant velocity) are equivalent. Both states rest and uniform motion are arbitrary, they are, in effect, interchangeable. Any frame of reference (reference frame) which can be said to exhibit a state of at-rest or uniform motion, with respect to any other frame of reference is said to be an inertial frame of reference. We usually associate a coordinate system with a frame of reference. If youre standing on a street corner and a bus passes, you see the passengers on the bus in motion and they see you in motion. If youre seated on the bus and a passenger gets up from her seat and walks down the length of the bus, you assume youre at rest and shes in motion. Typically, an at-rest reference frame is understood to mean a frame of reference attached to Earth. (In fact, the Earth is not a perfectly inertial frame of reference since it rotates, but its a good approximation for most uses.) Any reference frame moving with constant velocity relative to you can be used as an at-rest reference frame. If youre in an elevator moving with constant velocity, up or down, and conduct an experiment to determine the acceleration of gravity, youll measure the same value of the acceleration if you conduct the experiment standing on Earth no matter what experiment you use! All inertial frames give rise to the same laws of physics. a. Less b. More c. The same Answer: C. All experimental results are the same regardless of which inertial frame is used to conduct the experiment. Inertia is one of the most baffling ideas in physics. One of the common choices in the question above is option A. Many people reason that since the elevator floor is moving upward, the ball will impact it sooner than it would the ground. Perhaps we can explain what is happening in the elevator by asking what we would see while standing on the Earth and viewing only the motion of the ball. Initially, we see the ball rising with a constant velocity of 3 m/s. At the instant the ball is dropped, we see the ball begin to slow down, as it continues to briefly ascend no differently than had the ball left own hand with a velocity of 3 m/s. The acceleration of gravity that the ball experiences is the same whether you toss the ball into the air or simply drop the ball. In the reference frame of the elevator, the ball simply appears to drop to the floor. The elevator floor is no more rushing up to meet the ball then the stationary Earth does. (We will be more precise with this statement when we discuss Newtons Third Law.) We associate inertia with mass: the more mass, the more inertia. The more mass an object has, the more force is required to alter its state of motion. Pulling a table cloth out from under the dishes, putting a coin on your elbow and quickly retracting your elbow and catching the coin, and removing the support under a coin with a fast horizontal motion allowing the coin to drop through an opening it was suspended above, are all examples of tricks where an objects inertia is responsible for the perceived magic. An unfortunate example of inertia in action is so-called whiplash injury. Suppose a moving car rear-ends another car that is at rest. Imagine that the drivers seat of the front car does not have a head rest. In that case, the car, and the drivers body, lurch forward, but the drivers head tends to stay in place due to its inertia, straining the neck. The resulting damage to the neck is called a whiplash injury. This bit of physics often creeps into the courtroom. URL Its not uncommon in science fiction shows to show a space ship towing another disabled ship. As long as the towing ship is moving with constant velocity, there is no reason to keep towing. The disabled ships inertia will maintain the same velocity since there is negligible friction in deep space. In reality, we can send unmanned probes into deep space with only enough fuel to break out of Earths orbit. Once the probe is moving fast enough to escape the Earths gravity, its thrusters are turned off for months or years depending upon how far the journey. The New Horizons space probe will spend most of its year journey traveling nearly 60,000 km/h without a need of fuel as a result of its inertia. It will arrive at Pluto July 14, 2015. We use the symbol F to mean force in physics and we use the Greek letter sigma, ?, read as the sum of to express the condition under which Newtons First Law holds, that is: ?F = 0; the sum of all forces acting on an object is zero (in other words, the net force, Fnet on the object is zero, ?F = Fnet = 0). Under this condition the object may be at rest or have a constant velocity. A student holds a physics text book out the window of a helicopter ascending with a speed of 10 m/s. When the helicopter reaches a height of 100 m, she releases the text. The highest position above the ground that the book achieves is: a. 100 m b. Greater than 100 m Answer: The correct answer is B. Due to the books inertia it continues moving upward after being released. The unbalanced force of gravity slows the book down until it reaches its highest position above the ground. (The books highest position is approximately 105 m.) 
Define  Newtons  Second  Law and net force 	  Calculate acceleration from force and mass  Calculate force from acceleration and mass 
Newtons  Second  Law 	  Kick a small stone and it moves fairly fast. Kick a larger stone with the same force and it doesnt move so fast. We hypothesize that force is capable of producing acceleration and the size of acceleration is dependent upon the mass of the object to which the force is applied. If we use, without stating a precision definition, the term mass, we see a relationship between the net force, acceleration, and mass. Newtons Second Law: The acceleration, a, of an object is directly proportional to the net force, ?F, upon it and inversely proportional to its mass, m. As long as one force is involved, this is pretty simple. The more massive something is, the harder you have to push it and the harder you push it, the more you can accelerate it. These are all linearly proportional, which means that they are found by simple multiplication. Suppose on a muddy day, an opposing player with the ball loses his footing and starts slipping toward you, and you bring him to a stop. Because he slipped, hes not pushing back, so your push is the only force on him. Suppose later that game, a similar case happens. Here are some cases of how linear proportionality works in a case like this: If you use twice as much force, you can accelerate the next player twice as quickly, bringing him to a stop in half the time. If you use twice as much force, you can accelerate a player twice as massive, bringing them to a stop in the same time. If the new player is twice as massive, it would take twice as much force to accelerate them the same amount. Alternately, if the new player is twice as massive and you apply the same force, he will only accelerate half as much. He would come to a stop more slowly, taking twice as long. If the new player comes to a stop twice as quickly (twice the acceleration), then he may have had twice the force applied to him. Alternately, if the new player comes to a stop twice as quickly (twice the acceleration), then he may have the same force applied to him, but he is only half as massive. 
Calculating  Acceleration  From  Force 	  Mass is the stuff (matter) that an object possesses. The pull of gravity on mass is the masss weight. The more mass an object has, the more inertia it has, and the more weight it has at a particular location. However, we do not need gravity to define mass. Imagine, for instance, a rectangular block of wood of mass m resting upon a horizontal frictionless surface. A block accelerates along a frictionless table due to a horizontal force of 30.0 N acting upon it. (The force of gravity and the normal force also act upon the block, but these forces do not enter into our discussion. We will have more to say about these when we discuss free-body diagrams.) Measuring the position of the block as a function of time, we are able to determine the acceleration of the block is 2.00 m/s2. Since F = ma, we have 30 N = m(2.0 m/s2) and m = 15 kg. Notice we did not use gravity to determine the mass of the block. Had we weighed the block we would have found its weight to be 147 N. Using W = mg, we find the blocks mass as 15 kg. URL Things to consider: 
Mass vs.  Weight 	  Mass is a scalar quantity having units of kilograms. Weight is a vector quantity measured in Newtons. Your mass does not change regardless of where you are in the universe. Your weight on the other hand is dependent upon gravitational acceleration. Hence, your weight changes depending upon which planet youre on. We use the word gravity to represent the force that keeps our feet on the ground. When we jump, we dont just keep moving upward. We reach a high point, depending on how much effort we put into the jump, and then fall back to Earth. Galileo determined that the acceleration, g, due to gravity for all falling bodies close to Earths surface has a numerical value of about 10 m/s2. It is important not to confuse the acceleration due to gravity, g, and the force of gravity W or mg. Weight, W, is defined as the product of mass, m, and acceleration due to gravity, g: W = mg. The weight of a 1.0 kg mass is: W = (10 m/s2)(1.0kg) = 10 kgm/s2 = 10N. The weight is 10 Newtons. a. 1.0 kg b. 10. kg c. 0.10 kg Answer: C. W = mg so m = Wg .

Use  Newtons three laws to solve problems in one dimension 	  center of mass: The point at which all of the mass of an object is concentrated. dynamics: Considers the forces acting upon objects. free-body diagram (FBD): A diagram that shows those forces that act upon an object/body. 
Equations 	  ?F = Ma 
Newtons  Third  Law:  Forces or  Pairs of  Forces 	  It was Newton who realized singular forces could not exist: they must come in pairs. In order for there to be an interaction there must be at least two objects, each feeling the others effect. Newtons Third Law: Whenever two objects interact, they must necessarily place equal and opposite forces upon each other. Mathematically, Newtons Third Law is expressed as FAB = ?FBA, where the subscript AB means the force exerted on A by B and the subscript BA means the force exerted on B by A. Forces FAB and FBA are identical forces and never act upon the same object. Forces that are equal and opposite and act upon the same object are not a pair. 
Problem  Solving 	  We use Newtons laws to solve dynamics problems. Dynamics, unlike kinematics, considers the forces acting upon objects. Whether it is a system of stars gravitationally bound together or two colliding automobiles, we can use Newtons laws to analyze and quantify their motion. Of Newtons three laws, the major mathematical workhorse used to investigate these and endless other physical situations is Newtons Second Law (N2L): ?F = Ma. In using Newtons laws, we assume that the acceleration is constant in all of the examples in the present chapter. Newtons laws can certainly deal with situations where the acceleration is not constant, but for the most part, such situations are beyond the level of this book. A notable exception to this is when we investigate oscillatory motion. As a last simplification we assume that all forces act upon the center of mass of an object. The center of mass of an object can be thought of as that point where all of the mass of an object is concentrated. if your finger were placed at this point, the object would remain balanced. The 50 cm point is, for example, the center of mass of a meter stick. 
Free- Body  Diagrams 	  A diagram showing those forces that act upon a body is called a free-body diagram (FBD). The forces in a FBD show the direction in which each force acts, and, when possible, the relative magnitude of the each force by the length of the force vector. Each force in a FBD must be labeled appropriately so it is clear what each arrow represents. 
Example 1:  Sitting  Bull 	  In the Figure 4.5, a 1.0 kg bull statue is resting on a mantelpiece. Analyze the forces acting on the bull and their relationship to each other. There are two vertical forces that act upon the bull: Answer: Using N2L we write: ?F = Ma, where ?F = FN ?mg = ma = 0, where a = 0. The negative sign (?mg) indicates that the Earth pulls on the statue downward. Usually, when solving problems with N2L, forces that point down and to the left are expressed negatively and forces that point up and to the right are expressed positively. These are just conventions and any consistent set of conventions is permissible. It is also important (when enough information is provided) to draw the length of a vector in proportion to its magnitude. In the diagram above, FN and mg are drawn the same length, reflecting the fact that they have the same magnitude. Important: in the diagrams, the arrows must originate inside the object, pointing outward The statue is stationary so it has zero acceleration. This reduces the problem to Fn = mg, which intuitively seems reasonable. When the problem is solved, it shows the magnitudes of the forces are equal. It must be kept in mind that their directions are opposite and that they are not a N3L pair. 
Example 2:  Hanging  Loose 	  In the Figure 4.6, Mr. Joe Loose is hanging from a rope for dear life. Joes mass is 75 kg. Use g = 9.8 m/s2. Answer: We assume the mass of the rope is negligible. Including the mass of the rope is not particularly difficult, but were just starting out! The convention in physics is to use label T, for tension. A tension force is transmitted through a string, cord, or rope. Once again, we apply ?F = Ma, where ?F = T ?mg = ma = 0 since a = 0. T = mg = (75.0)(9.8) = 735 N = 740 N 
Example 3:  Sliding  Away 	  A 4900 N block of ice, initially at rest on a frictionless horizontal surface, has a horizontal force of 100 N applied to it. Answer: Always begin by drawing an FBD of the problem. Typically, applied forces are either written as F or Fab. If there are multiple forces, depending on the wording of the problem, each force may have a subscript that reflects its meaning, or may just be numbered. 
Answer:  W  kg 	  Answer: ?F = Ma, ?F = Fap = ma. 
Example 4:  A  Touching  Story 	  In Figure 4.8, Block A has a mass of 10.00 kg and Block B has a mass of 6.00 kg. Both blocks are in contact with each other, with Block A experiencing an applied 70.0 N force to the right as shown. Note that both blocks have the same acceleration. Note: When referring to more than one mass we often use the word system. Answer: As Block A moves to the right it experiences a force from Block Bto the left. This force is labeled: ?FAB (force on A by B) Block B is pushed to the right with the same force that it exerts upon block A, according to N3L This force is labeled: FBA (force B by A); the magnitudes of FAB and FBA are, of course, equal, according to N3L. Answer: We use N2L applied to each block: Block A : ? f = MA. ?F = 70.0?FAB = 10.00a. Block B : ?F = MA. ?F = FBA = 6.00a. We have a system of two equations and two unknowns since the magnitudes of FAB and FBA are identical. Adding FBA to left side of the Block A equation and 6.00a to the right side of it, we have: Notice that on the left side of the resulting equation, the sum of ?FAB and FBA is zero and on the right side of the equation the sum is 10.00a+6.00a. The N3L pair of forces, ?FAB and FBA is considered as a pair of internal forces with respect to the system. When solving a system of equations having an N3L pair of forces, these internal forces add up to zero. Additionally, the right-hand side of the equation must always equal the total mass of the system. For this example (mA +mB)a. In more complicated problems, care must be taken if different parts of the system have different accelerations. Answer: This is answered by solving either the Block A or Block B equation. The Block B equation is certainly easy to solve. Dropping the subscript: F = 6.00(4.375) = 26.25 = 26.3 N 
The  Atwood  Machine 	  The Atwood Machine (invented by English mathematician Reverend George Atwood, 1746-1807) is used to demonstrate Newtons Second Law, notably in determining the gravitational acceleration, g. Example 5: One end of the rope in Figure 4.11 is attached to a 3.2-kg mass, m1 and the other end is attached to a 2.0-kg mass m2. Assume the system is frictionless and the rope has negligible mass. Answer: Answer: Before we begin, we decide in which direction the system accelerates. Since the mass of the m2 is smaller than the mass of m1,m2 will accelerate up and m1 will accelerate down. Therefore the tension in the rope is greater than the weight of m1 but smaller than the weight of m2. Using N2L we write the equations of motion for m1and m2. ?F = (3.2)(9.8)?T = 32a (since T < mg1,a > 0) ?F = T ?(2.0)(9.8)?T = 2.0a (since T < mg2,a > 0) The equations are set up so that the acceleration has a consistent sign. Had we chosen the direction of the acceleration incorrectly, our answer would have been a negative number, informing us of our error. Solving the system of equations we have: (3.2)(9.8)?(2.0)(9.8) = 5.2a, solving for the acceleration gives: a = 2.26 m/s2 = 2.3 m/s2. Atwood used a pendulum mechanism for timing the system of masses and adjusted the distances of the masses to ensure an integral number of seconds. Answer: Again, either equation will provide the answer. Using the second equation above, we have: 
T = (2.0)(9.8)+(2.0)(2.26) = 24.12  N = 24  	  One possible check on the problem is to insure that: mg2 < T < mg1 mgax = (2.0)(9.8) = 19.6 N = 20 N and mglog = (3.2)(9.8) = 31.36 N = 31 N. Therefore: 20 < 24 < 31. It is always wise to check your results for consistency. URL

Chapter  Outline 	  Just as motion in two dimensions introduced vectors, forces in two dimensions also involve more involved issues. Besides vector foces, there is also the particular case of the forces involved in circular motion. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how to solve problems involving the normal force. Understand how to solve problems involving friction. friction: A force that opposes two objects sliding against each other. Friction acts in a direction along the flat surface of an object. normal force: The force exerted by the ground or other object that prevents other objects from going through it. vector components 
Introduction 	  Just as velocity and acceleration are vectors that can point in any direction, force is a vector that has both a magnitude and a direction. 
The  Normal  Force 	  As discussed in one-dimensional forces, a normal force is the force exerted by the ground or other object that prevents other objects from going through it. In the Figure 5.2, a block that rests upon the ground is pulled in a diagonal direction up and to the right. Just as velocity and acceleration can be x and y components, we will need the same skills in resolving the force vector in the Figure 5.2. The applied force, ~F, acts at an angle to the horizontal. Knowing the value of the angle is not necessary to understand the effect on the normal force. Recall that the normal force, ~FN, is the reaction force to the force that the block exerts on the ground. The applied force, ~F, has two components. One component acts toward the right (the x?component) and the other component acts upward (the y?component). Consider the effect that the y?component has on the normal force. Since y?component of the force ~F acts in the upward direction, it effectively eases some of the blocks weight off the ground. If the y?component were equal in magnitude to the weight of the block, the ground would not experience any force upon it due to the weight of the block. We can see that upward forces reduce the reaction force on the block. Thus, upward forces acting on the block reduce the normal force. In the Figure 5.2, the weight, mg, of the block is 100 N and the force, ~F, has a y?component, Fy, of 25 N. Answer: We know that gravity and the normal force act only in the y?direction, and that the block is not moving (velocity and acceleration zero). We can use Newtons Third Law, which can be applied to the net force in the y?direction and the acceleration in the y?direction. ?F = FN +Fy ?mg = may = 0. y 
Therefore,  N = 100?25 = 75  	  llustrative Examples Answer: The first thing to do is to resolve the applied force into its x and y components: Fx = F cos? = F cos30? = 100cos30? = 86.6 N Fy = F sin? = F sin30? = 100sin30? = 50.0 N Next, since we were given the mass of the block, we need to find its weight: 
W = mg = (25.0kg)(10m/s2) = 250  	  The question concerns the forces in the y?direction. ?Fy = FN +50N?250N = may = 0, therefore, FN = 200 N Answer: This question concerns the forces in the x?direction. ?Fx = 86.6 N = max = (25.0kg)ax, therefore, a = 3.46 m/s2 Had the applied force been directed as shown in this diagram, what effect do you think it would have had on the normal force? See diagram below. (a) The normal force is greater than the weight of the block. (b) The normal force is less than the weight of the block. (c) The normal force equals the weight of the block. Answer: The answer is A. See if you can convince yourself that the normal force in this situation would be 295 N if the values of the given quantities were the same as in the previous question, but with the direction of F as shown above. 
Friction 	  Friction is a force that opposes two objects sliding against each other, and is a contact force like the normal force. While the normal force acts perpendicular to the flat surface, friction acts in a direction along the flat surface of an object. We generally speak of two kinds of friction: kinetic friction and static friction. We will begin our discussion of friction with kinetic friction. 
Kinetic  Friction 	  Kinetic means moving. Kinetic friction means friction between two objects sliding against each other, such as: (1) sliding a book across a desktop and (2) your foot slipping on an icy pavement. The force from kinetic friction is abbreviated fk. (Friction forces by convention use a lower case f.) We know a force must exist on the book because it eventually stops moving. Newtons Second Law implies there must be some force acting on the book to slow it down and eventually bring it to rest. We call this force kinetic friction. Friction arises because no matter how smooth the surface of the book or the surface it is in contact with may look or feel, microscopically the two surfaces are rough. The smallest unevenness of the surfaces acts to impede the motion of the book. In fact, a force must be applied to the book just to overcome this roughness before it can be set into motion. The force that acts on the book before it is set into motion is called the static friction force, which we will discuss after dealing with kinetic friction. Kinetic friction follows three basic rules: As you well know, its easier to push an object from one point to another than to carry it from one point to another. We usually just accept this observation as obvious. But why is this so? This observation leads to the conclusion that the force of kinetic friction is usually less than the weight of the object to be moved. If not, why push when you could more easily lift? The coefficients of friction, k, are measured experimentally. A typical experimental set-up, which is often encountered in school physics laboratories, is to use a spring scale to pull increasing weights at a constant velocity, Figure 5.4. Since the velocity is constant, the force that the spring scale exerts is equal to the magnitude of the kinetic friction. As the weight that is pulled increases, so too does the minimum force required to set the weight in motion. But as noted above, we would expect the force reading on the spring scale to be smaller than the weight being pulled. The ratio of the force on the spring scale to the weight of the object is found to be constant, and is k. The Set-Up: mg = 20 N TABLE 5.1: Weight (N)	Spring reading = friction force (N) If we graph kinetic friction force vs. weight, we would find a straight line with a slope of 0.5. The slope of this graph represents the coefficient of friction, k. Notice that friction is measured in Newtons since it is a force. What are the units of k? Answer: Since kis defined as the ratio FfNk , it must be a pure number. It has no units since it is a ratio of force units: NN which cancel out. Answer: The force needed to slide the object is the same as the force needed to lift the object. fk = (1)(FN) = mg Since uk is usually found to be less than 1, it substantiates the notion that its easier to push (or drag) an object than lift it! 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  In Figure 5.6, a force F of 60 N acts at an angle of 30 degrees above the horizontal upon a block of weight 100 N moving it with constant velocity. (a) Draw the Free Body Diagram (FBD) for the problem. (b) Determine the friction force between the block and the surface. (c) Determine the normal force on the block. (d) Determine the coefficient of kinetic friction, k. Answers: (a) See Figure 5.6. Notice how the friction force is represented in FBDs. It is drawn as an interface vector. (b) Since the block moves at constant velocity ?F = 0. x Therefore ?F = F cos?? fk = 0,60cos30? = fk; fk = 51.96 = 52 N. x (c) We assume the block has no vertical motion, therefore, ?F = 0 y ?F = FN +F sin??mg = 0;FN = mg?F sin? = 100?60sin30? = 70 N y (d) Since fk = kFN;k 
Static  Friction 	  The original meaning of static is not moving. Static friction, fs, exists when the contact surfaces do not slide relative to one another. Two examples would be: (1) a coin on an inclined surface that remains stationary and (2) exerting a force on a heavy couch that refuses to move. For a given pair of surfaces, the coefficient of static friction s is larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction, k. Put simply, there is less friction when objects are in motion. We mentioned earlier in the section that regardless of how smooth the surfaces of two objects appear, at the microscopic level they are very rough. Atoms actually interact along the irregular contact areas between the surfaces forming electrical bonds. As soon as there is relative motion between the surfaces, the bonds begin to break. Heat due to friction continues to aid in breaking the bonds, making it easier to maintain motion. Kinetic friction is smaller than static friction; and k < s. Consider Figure 5.7. The man in the figure is trying to slide a heavy couch. He exerts a force F1 which is insufficient to set the couch in motion. He then applies a greater force F2 and the couch still does not move. In each case, since a force was placed upon the couch, and it remained stationary, an equal and opposite force must have acted upon the couch ( fs1 and fs2, respectively) such that the net force on the couch remained zero, and the couch remained at rest. We call this force static friction. But unlike kinetic friction, the static friction force is not confined to one value. For example, if F1 was 100 N and F2 was 150 N in Figure 5.7, then the static friction forces were fs1 = 100 N and fs2 = 150 N, respectively. In fact, the static friction force can take on any value greater than or equal to zero up to the maximum force at which the couch is set into motion. At the point the couch is set into motion, static friction is gone and kinetic friction begins. Because static friction can take on any value up to the point of motion, we define static friction using an inequality: fs ? sFN The coefficient of static friction, s, is found by determining the maximum force, fs max, just before the instant an object is set into motion. We will generally drop the subscript on the static friction force when the context is clear. 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  The couch in Figure 5.7 just begins to move when a force of 175 N is applied to it. (a) What is the maximum static friction force, fs, between the couch and the floor? (b) What is the coefficient of static friction, s, if the couch weighs 1000 N? Answers: (a) Since the maximum force applied before the couch moves is 175 N, this must be the maximum static friction: fs = 175 N. Notice that the coefficient of static friction, s, is a pure number (it has no units) just as the coefficient of kinetic friction, k. This is because the coefficient of static friction, s, depends upon the nature of the materials in contact and it is a ratio of two forces, as is the coefficient of kinetic friction, k. Kinetic and static friction oppose motion. Friction acts to oppose the motion caused by an applied force, thus opposing the relative motion between two surfaces. If you attempt to accelerate your car and there is insufficient static friction between the tires and the road (for example, if youre on ice), the tires would spin and the car would gain no additional speed. Kinetic friction would oppose the motion of the tires, even on ice, and youd burn rubber. However, during those moments when your tires made contact with the asphalt, static friction would oppose the applied force your tires put upon the road and send the car forward. At the area of contact between the tire and the road, the tire pushes back on the pavement and the pavement pushes on the tire in the forward direction (Newtons Third Law in action!). The force of static friction is responsible for pushing the car forward. The force of static friction opposes the motion of the tire relative to the road, but has the same direction as the velocity of the car. Answer: As the angle increases, the normal force decreases so the friction force must also decrease. If the normal force goes to zero, so does the friction force. Answer: The taller he is, the more vertical the force, so the normal force would decrease. (a) What is the magnitude of the static friction force on the calculator? (b) Can the static friction force ever be smaller or larger than 1 N? URL Answers: The static friction force may possibly be larger than 1 N if the student applies a bit more force and the calculator remains motionless. The force at which the calculator just begins to move is the maximum force that static friction can provide. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how to analyze and work with forces on inclined planes Understand how to apply Newtons Second Law to the inclined plane problems inclined plane: Any flat surface tilted somewhere between horizontal and vertical. 
Introduction 	  An inclined plane is any flat surface tilted somewhere between horizontal and vertical, like a ramp, a flat side of a hill, or a playground slide. Problems using inclined planes shows us how to divide up vector forces including gravity, normal force, and friction. 
Using  Inclined  Planes 	  For objects in motion along inclined planes, it is convenient to establish the x?axis along the plane. An object undergoing motion along an inclined plane has at least two forces acting upon it: the force of gravity and the normal force from the inclined plane. As we will see, the normal force is always less than the weight when the object is placed on an inclined plane. To understand this, consider two extremes for an inclined plane: In the first case, the object is at rest because the net force on it is 0. In the second case the object has a net force on it of mg and therefore accelerates at g. Consider the following questions. In order to answer these questions, we establish a coordinate system such that the x?axis is along the inclined plane and the y?axis is perpendicular to the plane. Next, we construct a Free-Body-Diagram (FBD) for the crate. What to notice: We use Newtons Second Law in the x and y directions in order to answer questions 1 and 2. ?Fy = FN ?mgcos? = 0 FN = mgcos? FN = 100Ncos30? 
N = 100 N(0.87) = 87  	  ?Fx = mgsin? = ma, a = gsin?, a = (10m/s2)sin30? = 5.0 m/s2 Every second the crate gains another 4.9 m/s of velocity, so after 3.0 s: (5.0m/s2)(3.0s) = 15 m/s In other words, vf = at +vi, where the initial velocity is zero. Using the acceleration: xf at2 +vit +xi, xf	5 m Using the average velocity: x = v avgt = (7.5m/s)(3.0s) = 22.5 m URL Answer: False. The normal force is perpendicular to the inclined plane. Answer: False. Its weight is always 200 N. Answer: True. The normal force is FN = mgcos?. Since the cosine function decreases as the angle increases, the normal force decreases, as well. Answer: a = gsin? 
Friction and  Inclined  Planes 	  Theres a quick activity that can be used to show the effect of static friction on an inclined plane. You will need a book and a coin (see picture below). Place the coin on the top of the cover of the book and slowly begin to lift the cover. Youll notice that as you raise the cover the coin stays put. If the cover were a frictionless surface, the coin would slide down immediately as you began to lift the cover. Static friction keeps the coin stationary. However, there is a point at which the coin will begin to slide. Theres a critical height (angle) at which the component of the force of gravity down the inclined cover exceeds the force of static friction. If you play with this set-up for a while, youll notice that once the coin begins to slide you can slightly lower the cover and the coin continues sliding, even though the cover is raised to a less extent than what was needed to have the coin begin its slide. This is another reminder that static friction tends to be greater than kinetic friction. We like to quantity how static and kinetic friction affect objects on inclined planes. We will take the case of static friction first. ?F = fs ?mgsin? = 0, replacing fs with sFN, x sFN ?mgsin? = 0, replacing FN with mgcos?, s(mgcos?)?mgsin? = 0, s , s = tan? Answer: Since s = tan?,s = tan30? = 0.577,s = 0.58 Answer: False. As you can see from the inclined plane problem, the coefficient of friction is dependent only upon the tangent of the angle. Recall that the definition of s is the ratio of the friction force to the normal force and therefore as no units (it is a pure number). If we exceed the maximum angle at which the static friction can hold the coin, the coin will slide and kinetic friction will act upon the coin. We consider this situation next. Figure 5.14 is almost identical to Figure 5.13. The only differences are that the coin is represented as a dot and the kinetic friction vector has been drawn a bit smaller than the static friction vector. In this case, the coin will accelerate down the book cover. We wish to determine the acceleration. We choose the direction down the book cover as positive. Using Newtons Second Law: ?Fx = mgsin?? fk = max , replacing fk with kFN mgsin??kFN = max , replacing FN with mgcos? mgsin??k(mgcos?) = max ax = g(sin??k cos?) Answer: k = 0.466 = 0.47. Hint: Consider the result of the last example. Answer: ?F = mgsin?? fk = ma fk = mgsin??ma ? (60)(9.8)sin18? ?(60)(2.1) fk = 55.7 = 56 N Answer: fk = kFN = k(60)(9.8)cos18? = 55.7 N and therefore k = 0.099 = 0.10 (i) What force must he exert? (ii) Of this force, what percentage is the skiers weight? Answers: (i) F = (60)(9.8)sin18? +0.099(60)(9.8)cos18? = 237 = 240 N (ii) W = mg = (60)(9.8) = 588 = 590 N ? ratio	40% Answer: A smaller force is usually required to move objects up the plane than lifting against gravity. 
Illustrative  Example 	  How do we determine the acceleration and the tension between two masses when one of the masses is on the inclined plane and the other hangs over the plane, as in Figure 5.15? Again, we call on Newtons Second Law in order to solve the system. Lets assume there is no friction in the system and the rope between the masses does not stretch and has negligible mass. The values for the masses and the angle of the incline are given below. M = 40.0 kg m = 30.0 kg ? = 25.0? Find, (A) the acceleration of the system and (B) the tension in the rope. 
Finding the acceleration of the system 	  We always start by drawing FBDs and resolving vectors. The x?component of Mg: Mgsin? The y?component of Mg: Mgcos? Newtons Second Law equation for the mass m: We assume that mg moves down and therefore mg > T. (This is an arbitrary choice.) ?F = mg?T = ma;? ?F = (30kg)(10m/s2)?T = 30a m	m 
Newtons  Second  Law equation for  	  Since m moves down, M moves up the incline. Therefore T > Mg. ?F = T ?Mgsin? = Ma ? ?F = T ?(40)(9.8)sin25? = 40a 
M	 	  Solving the two equations above simultaneously for the acceleration gives: (30)(9.8)?T +T ?(40)(9.8)sin25? = 70a;a = 1.83 = 1.8 m/s2 Had the answer come out negative it would have indicated that we had chosen the direction of the acceleration incorrectly. It is also helpful to note that the tensions, T and ?T, add to zero. The tensions T and ?T are a Newtons Third Law (N3L) pair of forces. Such a pair cannot act on the same object. The object in this case is the system. From the point of view of the system, a Newtons Third Law pair of forces is considered internal to the system. Internal forces must always add to zero when a simultaneous set of Newtons Second Law equations are solved. The only forces remaining (on the left side of the equation) are the external forces acting on the system. 
Finding the tension in the rope 	  Since the acceleration is known, we can substitute its value in either the Newtons Second Law equation for the mass m or the mass M. Using the equation for the mass m is a bit simpler so: 
T = (30)(9.8)?(30)(1.83) = 239.1 = 240  	  As a check for reasonableness we can determine if the tension is greater than Mgsin? and less than mg. Try it and see! Answer: False. As we saw in the last problem, m was smaller than M and M still moved up the plane. There is, however, a special value of the mass mwhich can keep the system stationary or have the system move up or down the plane with constant velocity. We consider this situation in question 2. Answer: We go back to the equations for m and M in the last problem and assume the acceleration is zero. Simplifying, we have: mg?Mgsin? = 0 Thus m = M sin? is the condition for which the system remains at rest or moves with constant velocity. A mass m of 16.9 kg would satisfy this condition in the last problem. (Can you see why?) 
Illustrative  Example 	  Refer back to Figure 5.16. Assume that friction exists between the mass M = 40 kg and the plane. A diagram of this situation is identical to Figure 5.16 except that friction is included opposing the motion of M. (See Figure 5.16). Lets find the acceleration of the system and the tension in the rope for this problem. Well assume that the mass m = 30 kg accelerates down the plane. Since friction is directed along the plane, it has only an x?component, directed opposite the tension T and in the same direction as Mgsin?. The Newtons Second Law equation for the hanging mass m remains the same. Lets assume that k = 0.20 and keep all other values the same as in the last problem. a. Find the acceleration of the system. Newtons Second Law m: ?F = (30)(9.8)?T = 30a Equation m m NSL M: ?F = T ?(40)(9.8)sin25? ? fk = 40a, replacingfk with kFN, 
 	  T ?(40)(9.8)sin25? ?kFN = 40a, replacing FN with mgcos?, T ?(40)(9.8)sin25? ?0.20(40)(9.8)cos25? = 40a Equation M Solving Equations m and M simultaneously we find, a = 0.818 = 0.82 m/s2. b. Find the tension. Using Equation m we have T = 269 = 270 N In the absence of friction, if m = M sin?, the system may either move with constant velocity or remain stationary. If kinetic friction is present, is it possible for the system to move with constant velocity if m 6= M sin?? Answer: Yes. Try solving the equations with acceleration equal to zero, but keep k as an unknown. The value that you find for k will give the coefficient of friction necessary to keep the system moving with constant velocity while m and M remain 30 kg and 40 kg, respectively. If youve done the work correctly, you should find k = 0.47. 
Objectives 	  Students will learn that in circular motion there is always an acceleration (and hence a force) that points to the center of the circle defined by the objects motion. This force changes the direction of the velocity vector of the object but not the speed. Students will also learn how to calculate that speed using the period of motion and the distance of its path (circumference of the circle it traces out). centripetal acceleration: The inward acceleration that keeps an object in circular motion. centripetal force: The inward force that keeps an object in circular motion. 
Introduction 	  A satellite orbits around the Earth in Figure 5.17. A car travels around a curve in Figure 5.18. All of these objects are engaged in circular motion. Let us consider the satellite first. The satellite is held in place by the Earths gravity. The gravity holds the satellite in its orbit. In what direction does this force act? If the earth were magically gone, the satellite would fly off tangent to its motion at the instant gravity no longer held it. The force preventing this from happening must keep pulling the satellite toward the center of the circle to maintain circular motion. What is the force in Figure 5.18 that prevents the car from skidding off the road? If you guessed the friction between the tires and the road youd be correct. But is it static or kinetic friction? Unless the tires skid, there can be no kinetic friction. It is static friction that prevents the tires from skidding, just as it is static friction that permits you to walk without slipping. In Figure 5.19, you can see the foot of a person who walks toward the right by pushing their foot backward with a horizontal component of force F. They move forward because the ground exerts a horizontal component force fs in the opposite direction. (Note that vertical forces are ignored.) The force the ground exerts on the persons foot is a static friction force. Because the foot does not slide, we know that F and fs are equal opposed forces. We can easily see which direction the static friction force must act when we walk, but what about a car performing circular motion? In what direction does the static friction act on the car in Figure 5.18? Notice that the vector ?V points toward the center of the circle. (Recall that ?V can be thought of as the sum of the vectors V2 +(?V1).) The direction of the acceleration points in the direction of ?V since acceleration is defined as a = ??~vt . This is reasonable, since if there were no force directed toward the center of the circle, the car would move off tangent to the circle. We call the inward force that keeps an object in circular motion a center seeking, or centripetal force and the acceleration, centripetal acceleration. The centripetal acceleration is often denoted as ac In order to find the correct expression for the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration well need to use a little geometric reasoning. Figure The magnitudes of ?V1 and V2 are equal, and the change in location of the car occurs over a very small increment in time, ?t. The velocities are tangent to the circle and therefore perpendicular to the radius of the circle. As such, the radius triangle and the velocity triangle are approximately similar (see the Figure 5.21). We construct an approximate ratio between the two triangles by assuming that during the time ?t, the car has traveled a distance ?s along the circle. The ratio below is constructed in order to determine the acceleration. ?rs =. ?vv, which leads to, v?s =. r?v. Dividing both sides of the equation by ?t, we have: v??st =. r??vt . But ??st is the speed v of the car and ??vt is the acceleration of the car. If we allow the time to become infinitesimally small, then the approximation becomes exact and we have:v2 = ra,a = v2 r . Thus, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration for an object moving with constant speed in circular motion is ac = vr2 , and its direction is toward the center of the circle. 
Illustrative  Examples using  Centripetal  Acceleration and  Force 	  Example 1A: A 1000 kg car moves with a constant speed 13.0 m/s around a flat circular track of radius 40.0 m. What is the magnitude and direction of the centripetal acceleration? Answer: The magnitude of the cars acceleration is ac  s2 and the direction of its acceleration is toward the center of the track. Example 1b: Determine the force of static friction that acts upon the car in Figure 5.22. Answer: Using Newtons Second Law: ?F = fs = ma = 1000(4.225) = 4225 = 4230 N Example 1c: Determine the minimum necessary coefficient of static friction between the tires and the road. Answer: ?y F = FN ?Mg = 0,FN = Mg but fs = sFN = ma 
Thus, s Mg =  Ma,sg 	  True or False? Answer: False. As long as the car does not skid, there is no relative motion between the instantaneous contact area of the tire and the road. Answer: True. In attempting to move an object, a range of forces of different magnitudes can be applied until the maximum static friction between the object and the surface it rests upon is overcome and the object is set into motion. Recall that the magnitude of static friction is represented by the inequality: fs ? sFN Answer: False. The coefficient of friction is independent of the mass of an object. Recall that it is the ratio of the friction force to the normal force. As such, it is a pure number dependent only upon the nature of the materials in contact with each otherin this case rubber and asphalt. 
Objective 	  The student will: Understand how to apply Newtons Second Law under equilibrium conditions in two dimensions. static equilibrium: Objects in static equilibrium are motionless. 
Introduction 	  There are many objects we do not want to see in motion. In the Figure 5.23, the mountain climbers want their ropes to keep them from moving downward. We construct buildings and bridges to be as motionless as possible. We want the acceleration (and velocity) of these objects to be zero. For an object to be in static equilibrium (that is, motionless) the right-hand side of Newtons Second Law, ?F = ma, must be zero. Thus, ?F = 0. This equation is simple enough when an object is held with a single support. In an earlier example, we depicted Joe Loose hanging by a single rope ( Figure 5.24). Joes goal was to remain hanging in equilibrium (just like the climbers in the photograph). The force of gravity pulling Joe down was exactly balanced by the tension in the rope that supported him. But Joe wont be hanging for very long, will he? You can see that the rope is slowly fraying against the mountainside (recall the original problem). Soon it will snap. But Joes in luck, because a rescue team has come to his aid. They arrive just in time to secure two more ropes to the mountain side and toss Joe the slack to tie around his waist before his rope snaps! Joe is saved. But does Joe thank the rescue team like any sane person would? No. Instead, still in midair, he pulls out a pad and pencil from his back pocket in order to analyze the forces acting on him ( Figure 
Static  Equilibrium Saving  Joe 	  In order for Joe to remain in equilibrium, he must not move in the x? or y?directions. This means that the sum of all forces in the x?direction must add to zero. And the sum of all forces in the y?direction must add to zero. The procedure for solving problems with forces in equilibrium is as follows: In order to solve this problem, well need more information, including the angles that the ropes make with the vertical. The information is provided below, along with Figure 5.26. ?1 = 45? ?2 = 30? 
Find  T1 and  T2 	  The solution requires solving a set of simultaneous equations. First, we find the components of vectors T1 and T2. T1x = T1 sin45? and T1y = T1 cos45? T2x = T2 sin30? and T2y = T2 cos30? Next we apply Newtons Second Law. ?Fx : T2 sin30? ?T1 sin45? = 0 ?Fy : T2 cos30? ?T1 cos45? = 800 ? The first equation can be quickly simplified to give T2 =	2T1. T2?is then substituted in the second equation and T1 is found. Once T1 is found, T2 can easily be computed using T2 =	2T1. 
T2 = 585.56 = 586 = 590  	  What general equation can be written for ?F if the angles in Figure 5.26 are equal? y Answer: The sum of the y?components is responsible for supporting the weight. If the angles are equal, the ropes have equal tension. Therefore, the tension in the y?direction of either rope can quickly be found since: mg ?F = 2Ty = mg ? Ty y FN = mgcos?. com .

Work and  Energy 	  Energy is a common concept in the modern world. A key to understanding energy in detail is how different kinds of energy transform from one to the other, such as circular motion being changed into electrical power. 
Objectives 	  The student will: 
Be able to solve problems involving work 	  scalar quantity work: Force applied over a distance. 
Introduction 	  In the language of physics, work is force applied over a distance. Note that the force may be slowing the object down, speeding it up, or maintaining its velocity  any number of things. It is an amount equal to the distance the object moves multiplied by the component of force in that direction. For example, suppose you climb a ladder. On average, the force you apply upwards to climb a ladder is equal to your weight. The total work done then is your weight, mg, multiplied by the height of the ladder, h, giving the equation: W = mgh. This work is important because it is one way of measuring energy. By climbing the ladder, you have developed energy that can be used for other purposes. 
Units of  Work:  The  Joule 	  The SI unit for work and energy is the Joule. This is pronounced like jewel, and is named after an English physicist, James Joule (1818-1889). James Joule was a small-town brewer whose pioneering discoveries about work, energy, and heat led to the metric standard unit of work being named in his honor. Joule discovered the relationship between heat and mechanical work. One Joule is defined as one Newton of work applied through one meter of distance. It is abbreviated as a capital J. 
Vector  Definition 	  Work can also be done where the force is applied in a different direction to the displacement. If an object has traveled a distance d under force ~F, the work done on it will be equal to d multiplied by the component of ~F along the objects path. The component of the force on the path will be Fd cos?, where ? is the angle between the direction of the force and the direction of the objects movement. Consider three special cases: 1. A force is pushing the object in the direction that it is going, so ?= 0?;cos0? = 1 and that force is said to be doing positive work upon the object. 2. The force is pushing opposite the objects motion, so ?= 180?;cos180? =?1 and the force is said to be doing negative work upon the object. 3. The force is perpendicular to the object, making it turn but not speed up or slow down, so ? = 90?;cos90? = 0 and no work is done upon the object. In general, for any angle [0, 90) between the force and displacement, positive work is done upon the object. For any angle (90, 180] between the force and displacement, negative work is done upon the object. Positive work is done when is in the range [0, 90) with the respect to the displacement. Negative work is done when is in the range (90, 180] with respect to the displacement. 
Illustrative  Example 6.1 	  In Figure 6.5 a man is pushing a crate with a force of 500 N over a distance of 3.0 meters. How much work does the man do on the crate? W = (F cos?)x, where the angle ? between F and x is 0?. Answer: W = (500N)(3m) = 1500 Nm. One thing we immediately see from this exercise is the units of work. No work is done upon the object when acts perpendicular to the displacement of the object. kgm2 A N*m is the same as	s2	which is given the name Joule, abbreviated J. Therefore, the man in Figure 6.5 has done 1500 J of work on the crate. The Joule takes its name from the 19th-century British physicist James Prescott Joule (1818-1889), which we will have more to say about in Chapter 14 (Thermodynamics). 
Illustrative  Example 6.1.3 	  The weightlifter in Figure 6.6 is about to lift a barbell of mass 120 kg through a height of 0.85 m. How much work will he do on the barbell? Answer: W = Fx = (mg)x = (120)(9.8)(0.85) = 999.6 = 1000 J 
Illustrative  Example 6.1.4 	  The man in Figure 6.7 is exerting a force of 300 N at angle of 25 degrees to the floor in order to pull the tire a distance of 3.25 m. How much work is he doing on the tire? Answer: Lets sketch Figure 6.7 in order to analyze the problem. In the Figure 6.8, force F has the magnitude of 300 N and makes a 25.0-degree angle with the floor. Care must be taken in computing the work the girl does on the block. The force she is applying to move the block is not directed in the direction the block will move. We must find the component of the force acting parallel to the floor. Using vector resolution, we find: Fx = F cos? = 300cos25.0? = 271.89 = 272 N The work she is doing on the block is therefore: 
W =  Fxx = (271.9)(3.25) = 883.68 = 884  	  URL Answer: No, shes not. It doesnt matter if the woman holding the bag will tire of holding it eventually. As long as she doesnt move the bag, she does no work on it no matter how much her arm aches or how much the bag weighs. Answer: No, shes not. The force shes exerting on the bag is perpendicular to the direction of motion. It cannot cause or impede the motion of the bag, so it can do no work upon it. (Recall that W 
Objectives 	  The student will: 
Be able to distinguish between kinetic and potential energy 	  Understand the role of friction as it pertains to work and energy Be able to solve problems involving kinetic and potential energy and friction. energy: The ability to do an amount of work. Different forms of energy can do work indirectly. kinetic energy: Energy of an object from its motion. potential energy: Energy from an objects position.

Introduction 	  In the language of physics, energy is the ability to do work. Remember that we previously defined work as force applied over distance. Doing work creates energy, and energy can be used to do work. Force and work can come in endless forms, from nuclear to microscopic to everyday objects. Figure 6.10 are some icons portraying different types of energy. From left to right, there is a lightning bolt, a campfire, a speeding bullet, a battery, a log, and a rock on a hill. In ordinary language, only the first two are energy. However, within physics there are two kinds of energy: kinetic energy and potential energy. The three on the left represent types of kinetic energy, where the word kinetic means related to motion. lightning ? moving electrical charge ? electrical energy campfire ? moving molecules ? thermal energy or heat bullet ? moving object ? mechanical kinetic energy or just kinetic energy The three on the right represent less obvious forms of energy, known as potential energy. battery ? can release electrical energy ? chemical potential energy log ? can release thermal energy ? chemical potential energy rock on hill ? can release kinetic energy ? gravitational potential energy 
Kinetic  Energy 	  The simplest result of work is kinetic energy. If you have a stationary object and you push it with some force over a distance, then it is moving and thus has kinetic energy. Suppose you push a baseball of mass m with force F over distance d. The work done would be F d. We know from our previous mechanics that F = ma. If it started from rest and accelerated from only this force, then the distance it went is d = 12at2 and its final velocity is v = at. This tells us that the work done is: 
 	  This expression is true for all kinetic energy, regardless of how it was accelerated. Kinetic energy is abbreviated KE and is found by the standard formula: 
E = mv2 	  The units of energy are the same as for work, the Joule.	1 Joule is 1 Newton  1 meter, or more fully, since 1 
Example 1 	  a. Aroldis Chapman of the Cincinnati Reds is credited with throwing the fastest baseball during a game. The ballhad a speed of 46.95 m/s and a mass of 145.0 g. What was the kinetic energy of the ball?

How would the kinetic energy compare for a ball thrown with half the speed but the same mass? Answer: The kinetic energy would beas great. 
Example 2 	  a. A race car of mass 900 kg is at rest on the starting line, then uniformly accelerates at 5 m/s2 over a distance of 60m67.1 m. What was its change in kinetic energy? Answer: We can solve the change in velocity from the kinematic equation: vf 2 = vi2 +2a?x. From our kinetic energy formula, the initial kinetic energy is mvi2, while the final kinetic energy ismvf 2. Combining this with the previous kinematic equation, we have: 
Ef =mvf 2 = m(vi2 +2a?x) = mvi2 +(ma)?x 	  We know from Newtons Second Law that ?F = Fnet = ma, so this final term is just F?x, which is the net work done on the object. The equation Wnet = ?KE is referred to as the Work-Energy Principle. What we have learned from the above is that the change in kinetic energy can easily be found by computing the work done. The change in kinetic energy of the race car is therefore: 
W =  Fx = (ma)x = (900kg)(5m/s2)(60m) = 270,000  	  Answer: If the speed remains constant, then the change in kinetic energy is zero by the Work-Energy Principle and therefore the net work done on the tire must be zero. 
Answer:  Friction 	  Answer: Work is defined as W = (F cos?)x. Since the friction force opposes the motion of the tire it acts oppositely to the tires displacement. The angle, ? between the force of friction and the displacement is 180-degrees, and the cos180? = ?1. Recall that the displacement of the tire was 3.25 m and the force which the man applied in the direction of the tires motion was 272 N. The force of friction therefore must have been -272 N: fk = F cos180? = 272(?1) = ?272 N. The work done by friction is therefore (?272)(3.25) = ?884 J. The work done by friction is transformed into heat energy. (The bottom of the tire is warmer than its surroundings.) Eventually, the heat dissipates but it does not disappear. The work due to friction is transformed into thermal energy, which increases the internal energy of the universe. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can be transformed from one form of energy into another form of energy. 
Potential  Energy 	  In understanding force, we know that an object close to the surface of the Earth experiences a force equal to mg, where g, is called the intensity of the field. In introductory physics, g is more commonly known as the gravitational acceleration and has an average value of approximately 10 m/s2. When an object is lifted in the gravitational field, work is done upon it since a force F lifts the object a height h. See Figure 6.13. If F = Mg, the work the force F does on the object in lifting it a height h is Mgh. Lifting the object increases its potential energy by Mgh. In general, we establish an arbitrary zero point for the potential energy. This zero point is usually set at the lowest level at which the object finds itself in the situation described. In Figure 6.13, suppose you lifted a volleyball from the ground to over your head. The volleyball has a weight of mg = 3N and the height it is lifted to is h = 2.0m above the ground. Your lifting force F has done 6J of work upon the object. URL Answer: The net force, ?F on the object is zero since gravity is exactly matched by the lifting force. We know this because the ball is not accelerating it is only lifting at a constant speeed. Since the net force is zero, the net work, W = (?F)h = Fh?mgh = 0. The change in as measured from an objects center of mass. Answer: True. Gravity acts in the opposite direction of the motion of the object and therefore does negative work on the object. Answer: True. In this case the force of gravity is in the same direction as the motion of the object. 
Potential  Energy and  Springs 	  The spring is a useful and ubiquitous invention that is often overlooked. There are spring-loaded screen doors and toys and a host of other devices that hide the springs away so we are privy only to their magical movements. In a clockwork universe, springs may not be kings, but youd be hard pressed to find many other things so important! But it is more than just the mechanical workings of springs that are important to physicists. As we will see in later chapters, the spring behavior has rich analogies in many other branches of physics. A force must be applied in order to stretch or compress a spring. Work therefore must be done on the spring. The work done on the spring is stored in the form of potential energy in the spring. In order to find the work done on the spring, we calculate the product of the applied force and the distance the spring moved. But the force applied to a spring is not constant; it does not, for example, take the same force to stretch a spring 5 cm as it does to stretch it 10 cm. Fortunately, the relationship between the force and the distance a spring is stretched is a simple one. Robert Hooke (1635, 1703) discovered that the force is directly proportional to the distance the spring is stretched (or compressed). In other words, it takes twice the force to stretch the spring twice the distance, three times the force to stretch it three times the distance, and so on. Mathematically, we have F = kx, where F is the applied force, k, is the spring constant with units N/m and x is the distance the spring is stretched. 
Illustrative  Example 	  A plot of the applied force, F vs. x, the distance the spring is stretched, is shown in Figure 6.15. This shows how the applied force is related to the distance the spring is stretched. Writing the equation for the potential energy stored in the spring requires finding the value of the force. Since the relationship is linear, we can use the average force. Using Figure 6.15 as an example, we notice that the initial force is 0.0 N and the final force is 3.0 N. The average force is therefore 5N and so the total work in stretching the spring 0.25 m (and hence the amount of energy stored in the spring) is: 
W =  Favgx = (1.5)(0.25) = 0.375  	  An equation for the potential energy stored in a spring can be derived as follows: Taking the initial force as zero and the final force as Ff , we have, W = Favgx = x = (0+2kx)x = 12kx2. This is the equation for the potential energy (PE) stored in a spring: Wapplied = PE = 12kx2. Answer: A spring constant of 200 N/m is understood to mean that it requires a force of 200 N to stretch or compress the spring 1 meter. A spring constant of 100 N/m requires half the force (100 N) to stretch or compress the spring the same distance, 1 meter. Answer: Since the force is directly proportional to the distance the spring is stretched, twice the force must be applied to stretch the spring 20 cm or 40 N. Answer: F = kx : 20 = k(0.10), k = 200 N/m 
Answer:  E   	  Answer: PE . Notice, by reviewing (2c) and (2d) that the PE is directly proportional to the square of the distance. 
Understand the meaning of energy conservation 	  Be able to use energy conservation in solving problems. Conservation of Mechanical Energy: The total of kinetic energy and potential energy in a system remains constant as long as there are no dissipative forces or interaction with outside the system. Conservation Principle: A conserved quantity is a quantity where the total cannot increase or decrease. dissipative forces: Forces such as friction that change mechanical energy into other types of energy, such as heat energy. 
Introduction 	  In the language of physics, a conserved quantity is a quantity where the total can never increase or decrease. Conservation of energy means that energy is transformed from one type to another, but is never added or removed. Consider climbing up to the top of a half-pipe at a skate park. Climbing up the ladder in a skate park. By climbing up a ladder, a person is adding in mechanical energy. There is chemical potential energy within their body that is expended by using their muscles. In physics terms, they do work climbing to the top of the half-pipe. This creates gravitational potential energy. Suppose the half-pipe is 4 meters tall and the person has a weight (mg) of 900 Newtons. This means that there is (900N)(4m) = 3600J of gravitational potential energy created by climbing up. If the person skates off the edge, they are lowering their height (reducing potential energy) but also speeding up (gaining kinetic energy). This is a basic energy transformation and illustrates the principle of Conservation of Mechanical energy transformations on a skateboarding half-pipe. Mechanical Energy. The total energyboth kinetic and potentialwill remain constant as long as there is no friction and the person does not expend more muscle energy pushing off. Friction is often referred to as a dissipative force. If the skater falls down and skids to a stop, then friction has taken effect. The friction does negative work, reducing the kinetic energy. The dissipated kinetic energy is turned into heat energy. This is why rubbing two objects together makes them warmer. Mechanical energy is conserved only when dissipative forces are absent. The conservation of mechanical energy can be rephrased as follows: Assuming there arent any non-conservative forces acting upon a system, the initial kinetic and potential energy contained within a closed system equals the final kinetic and potential energy contained within that system. Mathematically: 
Ei + Ei =  Ef + Ef 	  The initial sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is equal to the final sum of kinetic energy and potential energy. URL 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  A 0.145 kg ball leaves the earth with an upward velocity of 15.0 m/s. a. Qualitatively describe the changes in kinetic and potential energies of the ball during its ascent and descent inFigure 6.18. Take the ground as the point of zero gravitational potential energy. Answer: At the instant the ball is released, all of its energy is in the form of kinetic energy. As the ball ascends, its kinetic energy is transformed to gravitational potential energy. When the ball reaches its highest position, its speed is zero and, therefore, its kinetic energy is zero. All of the energy of the ball is now in the form of gravitational potential energy. As the ball begins its descent, gravitational potential energy is transformed back into kinetic energy. At all times the sum of kinetic and potential energy is constant. b. What is the total energy of the ball at half of its maximum height? Answer: The total energy of the ball remains constant, so it is irrelevant at which position the total energy of the ball is found. Therefore: 
E	3  	  c. Use the Conservation of Mechanical Energy to find the maximum height the ball reaches. Answer: Ei = Ef , 
Ef =  Ef + Ef = 0+mgh 	  mv = mgh, v = gh, h = = = 11.2m 2 2 2g (2)(10m/s2) d. What is the KE of the ball at position 5.00 m? Answer: The PE of the ball at this position is: PE = mgh = (0.145kg)(10m/s2)(5.00m) = 7.2J The total energy of the ball is 16.3 J and therefore the KE is: 16.3?7.1 = 9.2 J e. What is the speed of the ball at position 5.00 m? Answer: KE , v = 9.9 m/s Notice that the equation in part (c), mv2 = mgh, can be solved as v2 = 2gh, and is identical to the kinematic equation: vf 2 = vi2 +2a?x, where vf = 0, and a = ?g. URL 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  Qualitatively describe the kinetic and potential energies for the bob on the pendulum in Figure 6.19 at positions P1,P2,P3. 
Answers 	  a. P1: The bob is momentarily at rest at its highest position, so all the energy is in the form of gravitational potential energy. b. P2: The bob is at its lowest position, so all of the energy is in the form of kinetic energy. c. P3: The bob is between its lowest and highest positions, so it has a combination of kinetic and potential energies. 
Illustrative  Example 3 	  The kinetic and potential energies used to solve problems related to the gravitational field of the earth can often be reduced to kinematic equations. Why then, you might wonder, do we bother with energy in the first place? Perhaps the next example will clarify this. A sled slides from rest from a height of 4.00 m down a frictionless curved ramp. What is the maximum speed that the sled can achieve? See Figure 6.20 Answer:The sled begins its ride with all potential energy and has its maximum speed when all of its potential energy has been transformed to kinetic energy. This occurs when the sled comes off the ramp, thus: Ei = Ef , KEi +PEi = 
Ef + Ef : 0+mgh =mv2 +0 	  mgh gh v = p2(9.81)(4.00) v = 8.86 m/s Consider trying to solve this problem using Newtons Laws. What acceleration would you use along the ramp? Since the ramp is curved, the acceleration is changing at every instant. This problem would be very difficult to solve using Newtons Laws and more information would be required as well. We would need to know the function that describes the shape of the ramp and then we would need to make use of calculus, which is beyond the scope of this book. where a	s	, and ?x = ?4.00m vf 2 = 0+2(?9.81)(?4.00) = 78.4, vf = 8.86 m/s The speed at the bottom of the ramp is identical to the speed the sled would have had, had it fallen straight down. Energy conservation is independent of the path the object takes, as long as there are no non-conservative forces present. 
Illustrative  Example 4 	  In Figure 6.21, an amusement park ride is constructed such that a car carrying passengers is initially locked against a huge compressed spring. When the spring is released, the car is projected along a straight horizontal segment of track before encountering a curved ramp. The system is assumed to have negligible friction. What is the maximum height the car meets above the ground if the spring is compressed 0.75 m, the spring constant is 25,000 N/m, and the car and passengers have a mass of 500 kg? Answer:The initial energy is contained in the compressed spring which upon release will be communicated to the car. After the car is free of the spring it will have its maximum kinetic energy which remains constant along the horizontal until the car begins its rise along the curved ramp. At the height, h, all of the kinetic energy has been transformed into potential energy. 
Illustrative  Example 5 	  In this example, we will introduce the effect of a dissipative force. Though the mechanical energy will not be conserved, the total energy will be conserved. To solve problems that involve friction, we have to keep track of the energy that is transformed into heat. In Figure 6.22, the 20.0-kg block is pushed 0.50 m against a spring with a spring constant of 500 N/m. The ground underneath the spring is frictionless, but at the point the mass is free of the spring, the coefficient of kinetic friction, k between the mass and the ground is 0.20. Find the distance x the mass travels before stopping. Answer: As in the last example, the initial energy is all potential energy and it is stored within the spring. As soon as the block is free of the spring it has its greatest kinetic energy, but it also begins to immediately transform that energy into heat. When all of the blocks kinetic energy has been transformed into heat, it will no longer have kinetic energy and it will come to a stop. We write the initial energy, Ei of the system (spring plus mass) as: KEi +PEi = 0+ 12kx2 and the final energy Ef of the system as KEf +PEf +Q, where Q is the mechanical energy lost to heat. Q is the work done by friction: W = Q = fx, where f = N = mg. Thus, Therefore; 21kx2 = mgx, 
Ei = 0+	kx and  Ef = 0+0+ Q = mgx 	  m Answer: True. Dissipative (or non-conservative) forces transfer the kinetic and potential energies of large-scale objects to small-scale objects such as atoms. Answer: False. In the case where all of the mechanical energy has been transformed into heat we know the resulting kinetic and potential energies are zero. In cases where we can measure the instantaneous velocity and position of the objects in the system, the kinetic and potential energies can be found, as well as the energy lost to heat. 
Objectives 	  The student will: 
Be able to solve problems involving power 	  power: The rate at which work is done. 
Introduction 	  In the language of physics, work is defined as force applied over a distance (W = F?x). No mechanical work is done when holding a heavy weight for a long period of time. You may grow tired but no mechanical work is done unless there is a displacement. Power is defined as the rate at which work is done. The faster work is performed, the more power is delivered. The average power is found by dividing the work done (or energy used or energy produced) by the time it takes to perform the work: Pavg = Wt . If the rate at which the work is done is constant, then P, of course, is constant. Power has standard metric units of Joules per second, called Watts (W). These units are named for the Scottish engineer James Watt (1736-1819), picture in the Figure 6.23, who, among many other achievements, perfected the steam engine. Answer: W	Fx	(2500)(2.40) 
First lift :  Pavg =	=	=	= 2000  	  t	t	3.00 W	Fx	(2500)(2.40) 
Second lift :  Pavg =	=	=	= 1000  	  t	t	6.00 Answer: Since the first lift required only half the time of the second lift, the first lift required twice the power of the second lift. (See 1 above.) It is also useful to re-express the equation for power in terms of average speed and constant force. Since power is defined as Pavg = Wt = Fxt we can also write Fxt as F xt where xt is average speed and F is constant. Thus: Pavg = Fv. URL 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  A jogger of mass 65.0 kg wishes to run up a hill of height 10 meters in 16 seconds ( Figure 6.24). What power must the jogger produce? Answer: If we assume only conservative forces, then the work the runner does running along the incline a distance x, to a height of 10 m, is no different than the work he would do lifting his weight directly to a height of 10 m. In other words, the work is independent of the path taken. The calculation below is done along the incline but the final result is identical to lifting his weight a height of 10 m in a time of 16 s. See Figure 6.24. P = Fxt = (mg sint ?)(x) = mg(xtsin?) = mght	= mg ht  = mgv 
Note: h = xsin?, v = ht 	  The average vertical speed the jogger must have is v 62 m/s and the force required is the joggers weight, mg = (65.0kg)(10m/s2) = 650 N, thus, P = mgv = Fv = (650N)(0.62m/s) = 406 W 
Horsepower 	  The term horsepower is often associated with automobiles. It is not uncommon for car salespeople to make a point of including horsepower rating as a selling point. If they are trying to sell a sport car then horsepower definitely enters the conversation. For more fuel efficient cars, a sales person is apt to make comments regarding miles per gallon and then add and it still manages and then quote some number of horsepower. So what exactly do we mean by the term horsepower? James Watt (see Figure 6.23) is credited with the invention of the unit of horsepower. Supposedly, he created the term in order to measure the power output of the steam ships he was marketing. He wanted a unit that anyone during the early 19th century would understand. So Watt chose the given amount of work a horse could do over a given period of time, settling on the definition that one unit of horsepower was equal to the power output of a horse lifting 550 pounds a height of one foot in one second, that is 1.00 hp = 550ft-pounds/s. In SI units, this is equivalent to 1.00 hp = 746 W. 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  The Le Mans car race lasts 24 hours. It is not uncommon during that time for a car to travel at a constant speed of 240 km/h in straight line motion while experiencing a drag force of 4600 N due to air resistance. What power, under the given conditions above, does a race car engine develop in units of horsepower? Answer: Since the speed of the car is constant and its direction of travel unchanging, the net force on the car must be zero. The force the engine provides, therefore, must be equal in magnitude to the drag force. Since power can also be expressed as P = Fv, the units of power are also N*m/s. Before we begin, we must remember to convert 240 km/h to m/s: The power the engine develops is P = Fv = (4600N)(66.7m/s) = 307,820 = 308,000 W 
Illustrative  Example 3 	  Answers: 
Note: 1.00 k Wh	s	h	 	  Work is defined as W = Fxx = (F cos?)x, the product of the component of the force along the line of motion and displacement. Work has units of N*m, or (kgm2/s2), also known as Joules (J). 
Energy comes in two forms: kinetic and potential 	  Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and potential energy is the energy of position. Potential energy can also have many forms. For example: gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, chemical potential energy, and nuclear potential energy to name a few. Energy is the ability to do work and has units of joules, J. 
Gravitational potential energy has the form:  E = mgh 	  The potential energy stored in a spring has the form: PE =kx2 The relationship between the applied force and the distance a spring is stretched or compressed is: F = kx (Hookes Law) 
The  Work- Energy principle is  W = ? 	  Dissipative forces such as friction are considered non-conservative forces. Mechanical energy is not conserved in the presence of non-conservative forces. The conservation of mechanical energy can be written as: KEi +PEi = KEf +PEf In the presence of dissipative forces the conservation of energy can we written as: KEi +PEi = KEf +PEf +Qf , where Qf is the energy that has been transformed into heat. In the event of an explosion, heat, Qi, is added to the initial KE and PE energies and in the most general case, heat can also be lost, Qf , after the explosive, thus: 
Ei + Ei + Qi =  Ef + Ef + Qf 	  The average power is the rate at which work is done or consumed or produced : P = Wt = (Fxt ) = Fv and has units of Watts (W) com . Used under license from Shutterstock.com com . Used under license from Shutterstock.com 
Momentum 	  Momentum is another way of looking at how objects affect each others motion. Rather than looking at how forces change over the time of the interaction, we can look at how objects are moving before they interact and then after they interact. 
Objectives 	  The student will: 
Be able to solve problems using momentum 	  momentum: An objects tendency to stay in motion, calculated as the product of its mass and velocity. Momentum has both magnitude and direction, so is a vector quantity. 
Introduction 	  Heavier objects are harder to stop. The same is true of faster-moving objects. These observations are described well in Newtons Laws. An alternate way of analyzing the same tendency, though, is the property of momentum. Within a given reference frame, an objects momentum is defined as the product of mass and velocity, and is represented by the letter p, making the formula ~p = m~v. The arrows indicate that both momentum ~p and velocity~v have direction, and thus are vector quantities. Most poeople understand that being hit by a 100-kg person running at 3.0 m/s is less desirable than being hit by a 50-kg person running at 3.0 m/s. Intuitively, we recognize that being hit by a small mass is preferable to being hit by a large mass when they are moving with the same velocity. What momentum do the football players in Figure 7.2 and Figure 7.3 have? Answer: kgm plarge = mlargev kgm psmall = msmallv ? (50 kg)(3.0m/s) = 150 s As can be seen above, the SI unit of momentum is kgsm. There is no special name for this unit. 
Illustrative  Example 7.1.1 	  The cat in Figure 7.4 has a mass of 6.1-kg and the mouse in Figure 7.5 has a mass of 0.074 kg. What velocity would the mouse require in order to have the same momentum as the cat, if the cat walks with a velocity of 0.50 m/s? Answer: The cats momentum is pc = (6.1 kg)(0.50 m/s) = 3.05 kgsm The mouses momentum is : pm = (0.74 kg)(vm) In order to find the velocity of the mouse we equate their momenta (plural form of momentum). pc = pm ? 3.05 = (0.074 kg)vm ? vm = 3.05 kgsm = 41m/s 0.074 kg This is about 92 mph. Massive objects moving at low speeds can easily have more momentum than light objects traveling at their fastest. (An economy car, for example, would need a speed of about 67 m/s to have the same momentum as an 18-wheeler with a speed of 4.5 m/s. What is the ratio of their masses?) URL 
A  Change in  Momentum 	  It is important to remember that momentum is a vector quantity. This can best be illustrated by considering a change in momentum. 
Illustrative  Example 7.1.2 	  Earlier, we stated that Aroldis Chapman of the Cincinnati Reds was credited with throwing the fastest baseball during a game. The ball had a speed of 46.95 m/s and a mass of 145.0 g. We will calculate the change in momentum for two cases. In Case 1, Chapman makes his throw, its a swing and a miss by the batter, and the ball is caught by the catcher. In Case 2, the ball is bunted by the batter. A bunt means that the bat is brought to rest at about waist level and the ball is permitted to bounce off it. We will assume that the bunted ball leaves the bat opposite to the direction it was thrown and at the same speed it was thrown. Case 1: We calculate initial momentum of the ball as it leaves Chapmans hand and the final momentum of the ball in the catchers mitt. The work is shown below: kgm pi = mvi kgm pf = mvf = (0.145 kg)(0.00m/s) = 0.00 s (B) Batter (A) Ball caught by catcher. bunting ball. The change in momentum of the ball, ?p, is: pf ? pi = 0?(+6.81) = ?6.81kgsm Case 2: The ball hits the bat with a horizontal speed of 46.95 m/s and it leaves the bat with a horizontal speed of What would you guess is the magnitude of the horizontal momentum change of the ball? a. 0 b. 6.81kgsm c. 13.6kgsm It is not uncommon to choose answer A but that is incorrect. Had the problem been stated using velocity instead of speed and direction, the correct answer may have been more obvious. That is: The ball hits the bat with a horizontal velocity of 46.95 m/s and it leaves the bat with a horizontal velocity of -46.95 m/s. Remember that speed is only the magnitude of velocity, but momentum is a vector quantity. Therefore, we must always consider the velocity of objects when working with momentum. Lets work out Case 2 with Figure 7.7 in mind. If we arbitrarily assume the balls velocity to the batter is positive, as in Figure 7.7, then kgm pi = mvi = (0.145 kg)(46.9 m/s) = 6.81 s The final momentum of the ball is negative since it moves in the opposite direction. kgm pf = mvf = m(?vi) = (0.145 kg)(?46.9 m/s) = ?6.81 s The change in momentum of the ball is therefore: ?p = pf ? pi = ?6.808?(+6.808) = ?13.6kgsm or a magnitude of 13.6kgsm 
Objectives 	  Students will learn the meaning of impulse force and how to calculate both impulse and impulse force in various situations. impulse 
Introduction 	  Earlier, we solved a problem dealing with change in momentum. We emphasized that momentum is a vector quantity and that care must therefore be taken in dealing with the direction of velocity. Now, we will again discuss a change in momentum, but we will investigate it from the point of view of Newtons Second Law (N2L). The connection between the change in momentum and N2L will help to explain some everyday occurrences involving collisions, for example, why it is a good idea to bend your knees when landing on the ground, why it is a good idea to bring your arm back as you catch a fast ball, or why it hurts more to land on concrete than on a mattress bed. We can explain the reasons for these statements by defining a quantity called an impulse. 
Newtons  Second  Law  Revisited 	  Recall that N2L can be stated as ?F = Fnet = ma. We will rewrite this equation dropping the net subscript. We will also assume that F represents the average net force (we will see why in a moment) and express the acceleration as a = ??vt = (vf??tvi), giving us: (vf ?vi)	mvf ?mvi F = m	=	? F?t = mvf ?mvi = ?p ? F?t = ?p ?t	?t We call F?t = ?p the impulse-momentum equation. The left-hand side is referred to as the impulse and the righthand side is referred to as the change in momentum. The equation suggests that we neednt only use the unit kgs?m to express momentum since the change in momentum is equivalent to F?t, expressed in the unit N ?s. In typical collisions there is a rapid buildup of force between the objects colliding and a rapid diminishing of the force as they either come to rest or separate from each other. In either case the force is not constant and the time of interaction is brief. Figure 7.8 shows a baseball as it compresses and expands as its being hit by a bat. Figure 7.8 shows a graph of the force on the baseball as function of time during the interaction with the bat. The times for such interactions are measured in milliseconds and the force is in kilo-newtons. 
Illustrative  Example 7.2.1 	  If a ball thrown by Aroldis Chapman remains in contact with a baseball bat for 0.70 milliseconds: (a) What is the impulse the ball experiences? (b) What is the magnitude of the average force the ball experiences? Recall the mass of the ball is 0.145-kg and the velocity is 46.95 m/s. Answers: a. In an earlier example, we showed that the change in momentum ?p was: ?p = pf ? pi = ?6.808?(+6.808) = ?13.62 ? ?13.6kgs?m or a magnitude of 13.6kgs?m (Note-the negative sign indicates that the direction of the force on the ball is opposite to the balls incoming direction.) Since ?p = F?t ,the impulse the ball experiences is -13.6 N-s b. The magnitude of the average force is F	 N 
Illustrative  Example 7.2.2 	  We continue with our baseball example with a question for the catcher. It is a very good idea when catching a fastball to move your arm back as you catch the ball. Lets determine the force on the catchers mitt under two conditions: (1) The catcher moves his arm back 1.00-cm in catching the ball and (2) The catcher moves his arm back 10.00-cm in catching the ball. We use the values given in the original problem: m= 0.145?kg and vi = 46.95ms , in addition to the two displacements- 
Case 1 	  There are several ways to work the problem. We will find the time it takes the ball to come to rest in each case and then use the change in momentum to solve for the force. To find the time we divide the displacement of the ball by its average velocity, that is, vavg x = vavg?t ? ?t =	x	= 0.010 m = 4.26	?4 ? 4.310?4 s 10 m vavg	23.475 s Recall that the change in momentum was calculated already as ?6.81kgs?m. We now use F ?6.81 kg?m ?15,986 ? ?1.60104 N This is a very large force, equivalent to 3,600 pounds. In all likelihood, this would result in serious damage to the catchers wrist. 
Case 2 	  Since the displacement is ten times greater in this case, the time to bring the ball to rest will be ten times longer  s s ? .	kg?m And as before F. Even though the force in Case 2 is ten times smaller, you wouldnt want to do this without a really good catchers mitt! Why is it less painful to fall on a mattress bed than on concrete? Answer: Lets say youre standing up and decide to let yourself fall over like a slightly tipped bowling pin. In one case, at floor level, there is a mattress and in another case there is concrete. Well assume in each case you have the same initial velocity (close to zero) as you begin your fall. The velocity v1 with which you hit both the mattress and the concrete is the same, since you fall through the same displacement. Lets define velocity v1 as the initial velocity of impact and the final velocity as zero, since the mattress and concrete have brought you to rest. In each case, the change in your velocity is the same as youre brought to rest, and your mass is the same, as well. Therefore, the change in your momentum (and therefore impulse) is the same in both cases. The only difference is, since the mattress gives more than the concrete, it will take more time for the mattress to bring you to rest than the concrete. As we saw above, if the change in momentum is constant, force is decreased the longer it takes to come to rest.

Be able to solve problems using the conservation of momentum 	  Understand the motion of the center of mass of a system center of mass: The balancing point of a system, or the point at which all of the mass in a system is concentrated. Conservation of Momentum: The change in the total momentum of a system is zero. 
Introduction 	  A conservation principle states that there is a quantity which remains constant within a system. Earlier, we concentrated on the conservation of mechanical energy. We now consider the conservation of momentum by once again referring back to Newtons Second Law (N2L). As a reminder, N2L states that a net force on a mass m will accelerate the mass m, that is ?F = Fnet = ma. mvf ?mvi When we discussed impulses, we rewrote N2L as F = ?t ? F?t = mvf ?mvi = ?p. Recall that F represents the net force on the object (or system) in question. The equation states that if the net force on the system is zero, mvf ?mvi the change in momentum of the system must also be zero since 0 = ?t = ?p ? ?p = mvf ?mvi = 0. We can write this result as a conservation principle by stating ?p = pf ? pi = 0 ? pi = pf . We claim that it represents a conservation principle because were led to a similar conclusion as we saw with the conservation of energy. The initial energy of the system equaled the final energy of the system (Ei = Ef ). Here, we have been lead to the conclusion that the initial momentum of the system equals the final momentum of the system (pi = pf ). In general, for any isolated system, the change in the total momentum of the system is zero. As long as this condition holds, the momentum of a system with any number of interacting objects is conserved. 
Illustrative  Example 7.3.1 	  This is a very familiar example of momentum conservation. You may have seen this using a Newtons Cradle apparatus ( Figure 7.9), but the same conservation principle can be easily demonstrated using two identical marbles or two identical coins. As seen in Figure 7.9, the ball on the left is permitted to swing into the remaining hanging balls, and the ball on the right swings out. We say the momentum of the left ball has been transferred to the momentum of the right ball. The momentum is actually transferred through each of the balls. The same can be demonstrated with two identical marbles. One is at rest and one is in motion, causing a head-on collision with the marble at rest. We solve this problem (and all others, unless stated otherwise) assuming that the interacting objects form an isolated system. In Figure 7.10, marble A has mass m and moves with velocity vi along a horizontal surface toward marble B with mass m, and initial velocity vBi = 0. After the collision ( Figure 7.11), marble A is at rest and marble B is moving with the final velocity vBf . Using Conservation of Momentum, we first write the initial momentum of the system, pi and then write the final momentum of the system pf . Once these quantities are known, we use the conservation of momentum pi = pf . pi = mvAi +mBi = mvAi +m(0) = mvAi pf = mvAf +mvBf = m(0)+mvBf pi = pf ? mvAi = mvBf ? vAi = vBf We find the final velocity of marble B is the same as the initial velocity of marble A. In other words, all of the momentum of marble A has been transferred to marble B. You can get a feel for the truth of this result using two identical coins. What youll see when you have them collide head-on is that the first coin will stop and the second coin will move. However, because of the effect of friction between the coins and the surface, you will not be able to see the target coin move along with the same velocity as the incoming coin. Two identical marbles of mass m are moving directly toward each other with equal speeds v. The momentum of the system is: a. zero b. mv c. 2mv Answer: The correct answer is A. Since the marbles are moving directly toward each other, they must have opposite velocities. Therefore, one marble has momentum mv and the other marble has momentum ?mv. The momentum of the system is mv+(?mv) = 0. 
Illustrative  Example 7.3.2 	  A car of mass 1000-kg at rest at a stop light is hit from behind when a second car of mass 900-kg moving at a speed of 13.4 m/s, collides with it. If the two cars lock bumpers, what common speed do they move off with after the collision? We use Conservation of Momentum to solve the problem, writing the initial and final momenta of the system and then setting them equal. pi = (1000 kg)(0)+(900 kg) s pf = (1000 kg+900 kg)vf pivf s vf URL Answer: If we redo the problem, we find that vf is half of the initial speed of the car that caused the accident, . Answer: The result is the same as in number 1, namely, . As long as two objects have the same mass, they will move off together with half the incoming speed after the collision, as shown below. pi = (mvi)+(m)(0) = mvi pf = mvf +mvf = 2mvf vi pi = pf ? mvi = 2mvf ? vf 
Illustrative  Example 7.3.3 	  Consider the case of two objects, m1 moving with initial velocity v1i and m2 having an initial velocity v2i = 0, colliding head-on and moving together after the collision. Find their final common speed. pi = m1v1i +m2(0) and pf = (m1 +m2)vf m1 pi = pf ? m1v1i = (m1 +m2)vf ? vf = v1i m1 +m2

Illustrative  Example 7.3.4 	  In Figure 7.12, a girl of mass 30-kg stands motionless upon a frictionless horizontal surface with a bag of ten baseballs. The baseballs have a mass of 0.145 kg each and the total mass of the balls and bag is 1.70-kg. The girl takes one baseball out of the bag and throws it with a velocity of 7.00 m/s due west relative to the ground. What is the velocity of the girl after she throws the baseball? Answer: We assume that momentum conservation holds and therefore determine the initial and final momenta of the system. The initial momentum of the system, (girl + bag + baseballs) is zero since the girl, baseballs and bag are at rest; pi = 0 The final momentum of the system is composed of two motions, the baseballs momentum and the momentum of the girl, remaining baseballs, and bag. We find the final momentum of the baseball first: pbf The final momentum of the rest of the system belongs to the girl, baseballs, and bag. But we must remember that the bag contains one fewer baseball. Thus, the mass of the remaining baseballs + mass of the bag is 1.70 kg?0.145 kg = 1.555 kg. The mass of the girl is 30-kg and therefore the total mass is 31.1555-kg. The final momentum of this part of the system is: pgf = (31.555 kg)vgf Using Conservation of Momentum, pi = pf we have: kg?m vgf =	s	=	s	= ?0.03216 ? ?0.0322m ? ?3.22cm Notice that the solution is a negative number. This indicates that the girl is moving opposite the baseball. Shes moving due east. The girls motion is, in principle, the same kind of motion that occurs when a spacecraft fires its thrusters in outer space. The thrusters eject mass (exhaust gases) in one direction, and the spaceship is propelled in the opposite direction, thus insuring that the momentum of the system is conserved. (The force on the exhaust gases and the force on the spacecraft are a Newtons Third Law pair of forces). Airplanes and jets use momentum conservation as well but they do not rely on the exhaust gases as a spacecraft must. Instead, the propellers of an airplane act to push air toward the back of the plane, thus pushing the plane forward. A jet does effectively the same thing, only it uses its turbine to move the air backward. Though ejection of the exhaust in each case gives the airplane and jet a bit of forward motion, this is not the primary cause of their forward motion as it is with a spacecraft. The resulting motion that occurs due to mass ejection is often referred to as recoil. A final comment on Example 7.3.4: It is clear that throwing one baseball did not give the girl an appreciable velocity. Had she kept throwing balls, her velocity would continue to increase. Even so, considering the very small increase in her velocity after throwing one ball, it seems clear that in order to increase her velocity appreciably, she would need to throw many baseballs. This highlights the enormous fuel requirements for spacecraft. The recoil needed for a spacecraft to leave earth is considerable. In fact, 90% of the mass of a spacecraft is fuel! It is an interesting problem, though, beyond the scope of this book, to show that ejecting mass continuously rather than all at once (for example, throwing one baseball at a time as opposed to all of them at once) will achieve a greater recoil velocity. Answer: It depends! (1) If she takes the ground as her reference frame she now has a nonzero momentum. In fact, her momentum (along with the remaining 9 baseballs and bag) has the same magnitude as the momentum of the first baseball that she threw: 1.015kgs?m (2) Nothing prevents her from assuming that she is at rest with an initial momentum of zero and the ground is in motion moving away from her with a speed of 3.22 cm/s. Answer: No, she must throw the baseball with a bit more force. Remember that she is moving 3.22 cm/s due west and she throws the baseball due east. If she threw the baseball exactly as before, its velocity relative to the ground would be a bit less: (3) The resulting velocity of the girl of Example 7.3.3 is quite small. However, should she keep throwing more baseballs, her speed relative to the ground will keep increasing 
Center of  Mass 	  The fact that momentum is conserved only if the net force on the system is zero has a rather interesting implication. Recall Newtons First Law: An object at rest stays at rest or an object in motion stays in the same state of motion, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force, that is, a net force not equal to zero. In other words, if the net force on the system is zero, the system must remain moving without change. At first glance this appears a strange statement in light of what weve seen in these examples. After all, the motion of the objects in the system clearly seemed to change in these situations. The car that was hit from behind in Example 6 certainly did not remain at rest, and neither did the girl in Example 7. The key to understanding that everything remains in the same state is to look at the system, not the parts of the system. In order to analyze the motion of the system, we must focus our attention on the center of mass of the system. It turns out that it is the center of mass of the system that obeys Newtons First Law. The location of the center of mass of a system can be thought of as the balancing point of the system. For example, if you place your figure at the 50-cm mark under a meter stick, the meter stick will balance on your finger. In effect, it is the point at which all of the mass of the system is concentrated. Say, we have two identical 5-g marbles placed 16 cm apart from each other. If we imagine a fine wire rigidly connecting the two marbles, we could balance the system by placing our finger at a distance of 8-cm from each marble. The 50-cm position of the meter stick and the 8-cm position between the two marbles are the center of mass of each system. For the simple case of two-mass systems where the masses are identical, the center of mass will always be at the geometric center of the system. If the masses are not identical, finding the exact location of the center of mass becomes a bit more challenging and we will not consider it here. 
Illustrative  Example 7.3.5 	  In Figure 7.13, block A with mass m is moving with a velocity 10 m/s and block B with the same mass m is at rest. The two blocks are initially separated by a distance of 100 m. (a) Where is the center of mass (CM) of the two-block system? (b) What is the velocity of the center of mass of the two-block system? Answers: a. Since both blocks have the same mass and are separated by a distance of 100-m, the center of the two-block system is located at the 50-m position. b. In order to determine the velocity of the center of mass we will allow an arbitrary amount of time to pass, say 2.0s, and then determine the new position of block A. Once we have this position we will find the new location of the center of mass of the two-block system and find the displacement of the center of mass. Then, the velocity of the center of mass can easily be determined. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand the difference between elastic and inelastic collisions. Be able to solve problems using both energy and momentum conservation. elastic collisions: Collisons in which we assume the kinetic energy is conserved. inelastic collisions: Collisions where kinetic energy is not conserved. 
Introduction 	  There is a common misconception in the study of the conservation of momentum. It is often believed that if the kinetic energy of a system is not conserved, neither is the momentum. This is not true. Kinetic energy can be lost in many ways. When objects collide, some of their kinetic energy invariably is transformed into heat and sound. However, if the losses are negligible we often assume that the kinetic energy is conserved. Collisions in which we assume the kinetic energy is conserved are called elastic collisions. Collisions where the kinetic energy is not conserved are called inelastic collisions. 
Elastic  Collisions 	  We have already encountered elastic collisions, but we havent used the term yet. The collision between the two marbles in a previous example was an elastic collision. The kinetic energy of the first marble was completely transferred to the second marble. As we have already seen, conservation principles are very useful in solving problems that would be very difficult to solve using Newtons Laws. It is much simpler if we need only concern ourselves with the initial and final state of a system rather than needing a detailed mathematical description of the intervening motion. 
Illustrative  Example 7.4.1 	  A cube of mass 10.0-kg moving with a velocity of 7.00 m/s along a frictionless horizontal surface collides elastically with a stationary ball of mass 4.00-kg as shown in Figure 7.14. What are the final velocities of the cube and the ball? Answer: There are two unknowns in the problem, vcf and vbf . We will therefore need a system of two equations to solve the problem. We can readily assume that the net force acting on the system is zero and therefore the momentum of the system is conserved. Additionally, we can further assume that the kinetic energy of the system is conserved since the collision is elastic. Thus, we can generate two equations and two unknowns using the Conservation of Momentum and the Conservation of Energy. It will be easier to solve this problem in general terms rather than using the given values at first. Using Conservation of Momentum: pi = mcvci +mb(0) pf = mcvcf +mbvbf pi = pf ? mcvci +mb(0) = mcvcf +mbvbf 
N 1 ? mcvci = mcvcf +mbvbf 	  Using Conservation of Energy: 
Ef	mcvcf mbvbf 2 	  KEi = KEf	mcvci	mcvcf 2 + mbvbf 2 ? mcvci2 = mcvcf 2 +mbvbf 2 
N 2 ? mcvci2 = mcvcf 2 +mbvbf 2 	  Equation 2 can be re-expressed as: mc(vci ?vcf )(vci +vcf ) = mbvbf 2 Equation 1 can be re-expressed as: mc(vci ?vcf ) = mbvbf By dividing Equation 2 on the left by mc(vci ?vcf ) and on the right by mbvbf we arrive at: vci +vcf = vbf ? EQUATION 3 The velocities vcf and vbf can be found by using Equation 3 and Equation 1. mc ?mb	10.0 kg?4.0 kg	m	m vcf =vci mc +mb 10.0 kg+4.0 kg s s Answers: You should be able to show that pi = pf = 70kgs?m and KEi = KEf = 245 J Answer: Yes. If the masses are identical, then vcf must be zero as the equation shows. The result of the collision is that all the momentum of mc is transferred to mb. Answer: No. The limiting value of vbf is 2vci. In principle, it can take on values in the range (0,2vci). (Hint: Consider what happens as mc grows infinitely large and mb remains constant in the equation for vbf .) URL 
Inelastic  Collisions 	  If the collision is elastic, then the sum of the kinetic energies of the objects after the collision must be equal to the kinetic energy of the moving object before the collision. 
Illustrative  Example 7.4.2 	  In Figure 7.15 block B is initially at rest and block A is moving with a velocity of 10.00 m/s. Both blocks have masses of 3.00-kg and move together after the blocks collide. Determine if the kinetic energy of the system is conserved, and if not, determine the amount of heat generated in the collision. Answer: 
Ef   	  Clearly, the kinetic energy is not conserved and, therefore, the collision is not elastic. In fact, 50% of the kinetic energy is lost in the collision and 75.0 J of kinetic energy is transformed into heat. Do you think it is possible to lose more than 50% of the energy is an inelastic collision? 
Illustrative  Example 7.4.3 	  Awesome Physics Man (A) and his evil twin brother Bad Physics Man (B) each have mass m and speed v. They approach each other at right angles as shown in Figure 7.16. The two collide in mortal combat and fly off together. What is their final momentum ~p immediately after the collision? We are asked for a vector quantity and therefore must provide both magnitude and direction. Answers: 
Magnitude of momentum 	  This example is a bit different than the previous ones we have encountered because it takes place in two-dimensions. Still, the net force on the system is zero, so the total momentum of the system remains conserved. A has momentum mv directed due north and B has momentum mv directed due west before they collide. After the collision, they must still have the same momentum north and the same momentum west (momentum must stay conserved). We have set up a coordinate system is Figure 7.16 showing the direction of motion after the collision. The final momentum must be composed of a northern-component of momentum of mvnorth and a western-component of momentum mvwest. Since the components are at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the magnitude of the? momentum. Dropping the subscripts on the velocities, we have p(mv)2 +(mv)2 =	2mv. 
Direction of momentum 	  Remember that in the absence of a net force, the center of mass of a system cannot change direction or speed. This implies that the center of mass must continue to travel along the black dashed line of Figure 7.16, both before and after the collision. Since the components of the resultant vector are equal in magnitude, the direction of the resultant vector must be a 45-degree angle. Using the orientation of the axes in Figure 7.16, the direction of the brothers after colliding is 90? + 45? = 135? counterclockwise as measured from the positive x?axis. We note that the orientation of the axes are arbitrary; the x?axis could just as well have been along the direction of motion of the center of mass. The solution could have also been found using any of the trigonometric functions. URL ?p = 0 (B) URL . CC BY 2.0 
Chapter  Outline 	  We have looked at circular motion using the same measures as linear motion.	To look at rotation in more detail, though, we need to work in rotational units measuring the angle rotated through, the angular sped, and angular acceleration. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand what angular momentum is and how to use it in solving problems. angular momentum: The product of rotational inertia and angular velocity. angular velocity: How quickly an object is turning. axis of rotation: The center around which an object turns, which might or might not be outside of the object. radian: The distance around the edge of a circle of radius 1. revolution: An object turning around a center that may or may not be outside of the object. rotation: An object turning without moving its center of mass, like a spinning top. rotational inertia: The difficult required to turn an object. 
Introduction 	  Besides moving through space in a given direction, a solid object can spin or turn. This requires new measures of motion beyond position, velocity, and acceleration  as well as some new terminology. Starting with the new terms: Rotation means an object turning without moving its center of mass, like a spinning top. Revolution means an object turning around a center (or axis) that might or might not be outside of the object. So what makes an object more difficult to turn? The difficulty it requires to push an object through space is called inertia or more precisely translational inertia. Inertia is equal to mass. The dificulty required to turn an object is called rotational inertia or sometimes moment of inertia. This is symbolized by the letter I (for inertia). Try this out. Take a long object like a broomstick or baseball bat. Lay it flat and try to spin it with one hand. This can be difficult. Now instead, stand it upright and just give a twist with your fingers to turn it around. The same object is more difficult to spin one way than the other. Rotational inertia depends on both the mass and the mass distribution of an object. Mass closer to the axis is easier to turn. Mass farther from the axis is harder to turn. Angular velocity is defined as how quickly an object is turning, and is symbolized by the Greek letter omega: ?. In physics, angular velocity is generally measured in one of two units: Revolutions per second, or rev/s. A complete rotation or revolution is equivalent to motion through 360degrees. An object that turns around 30 times in one minute has an angular velocity of 0.5 rev/s. Radians per second or rad/s. A radian is the distance around the edge of a circle of radius 1. It takes 2? radians to complete one circle, so 2??radians are equivalent to 1 revolution (360 degrees). Click the following link for a demonstration: URL isc/ . Linear momentum is defined as the product of mass and linear velocity (p = mv). In the same way, angular momentum is defined as the product of rotational inertia and angular velocity . The formula for angular momentum is stated as: L = I? where I is the rotational inertia (a term related to the distribution of mass) and the Greek letter omega ? is the angular velocity. Just like momentum in a given direction, objects undergoing rotation obey a similar conservation principle called conservation of angular momentum, which can be expressed as Ii?i = If ?f . An important difference is that in linear momentum, the inertia is always the same. In angular momentum, the rotational inertia I and the angular velocity ? can change. Perhaps youve noticed that when a spinning figure skater pulls in her arms close to her body, her rotational velocity increases. Or perhaps youve seen a high driver spring off the diving board, tuck his legs close to his body, and spin quickly. Whats going on? In each case the person brings more of their mass closer to the axis about which their body spins. The result is that their angular velocity increases. The conservation of angular momentum ensures that, should the mass in the system move closer to the axis of rotation, the system will spin (rotate) more quickly. A classic demonstration of the conservation of angular momentum is shown in the following video. As the student in the figure moves the weights inward toward his body, his angular velocity increases, but his angular momentum stays constant. The system (which includes the student, weights, and spinning seat) pictured in the video above has an initial rotational inertia Ii and an initial angular velocity ?i 2.00 rev/s. After the student pulls the weights toward his chest, the final rotational inertia of the system is only 80% of its initial rotational inertiathat is 0.800Ii. Assuming that the angular momentum of the system is conserved, find the final angular velocity of the system. Answer: 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand what torque is and how to use it in solving problems. axis of rotation: A line drawn perpendicular to the plane of the objects rotation through the point about which the object rotates. lever arm and moment arm: The handle/arm of a wrench. rigid bodies: Objects that do not undergo any deformation when subject to a force (or forces). Rigid bodies are in an idealized state. torque: The component of a force applied perpendicular to a lever arm. Torque is the product of the length of a lever arm and the force applied perpendicular to a lever arm. Torque is a scalar quantity and can have clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. 
Rigid  Bodies and  Torque 	  We define a rigid body as an object that does not undergo any deformation when subjected to a force (or set of forces). This is an idealized state since all objects deform a bit under the application of any force. Even a block of steel resting on a slab of concrete is deformed slightly by the force of gravityit tends to flatten. But unless the block is subject, for example, to a huge compressive force, the amount of deformation (flattening) is considered negligible under normal conditions, and the block is assumed a rigid body. With the introduction of rigid bodies, we also remove the restriction that the forces experienced by such bodies are applied at their geometric center. We will now consider forces applied at any point. For example, we might be asked to describe the resulting motion of a meter stick resting on a frictionless tabletop that is subject to a force F applied at its 10-cm mark, as in Figure 8.2. How do you think the meter stick will move? What does experience or intuition tell you? Even though we do not have a frictionless tabletop in our possession, we can certainly imagine what the motion would be like. Did you guess the meter stick would rotate about its center? The off-center force F in Figure 8.2 causes the stick to rotate about this point (we will ignore any possible translation). A line drawn perpendicular to the plane of the objects rotation through the point P about which the object rotates is called an axis of rotation (see Figure 8.2). As the force F moves closer to the point P, its ability to rotate the meter stick decreases. If the force F is applied at point P, the meter stick can only translate. Thus the point of application of the force F with respect to the axis of rotation determines the ease with which we can turn (rotate) an object. This brings us to the notion of torque. 
Torque:  Force and  Lever  Arm 	  The amount of force applied, as well as the location and the direction of the force with respect to the axis of rotation, determines the relative difficulty in causing a rotation. Have you ever seen someone extend the handle of a wrench in an effort to turn a stubborn screw or bolt? The longer the arm of the wrench the easier it is to turn the bolt. We call the arm a lever arm or a moment arm. The component of a force applied perpendicular to a lever arm produces a torque. The torque is the product of the length of the lever arm and the force applied perpendicular to the lever arm. In Figure 8.2 the force F is applying a torque. For our purposes, we will consider torque to be a scalar quantity possessing clockwise and counterclockwise directions. 
The  Direction of  Torque 	  We define the direction of the torque by noting clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) motion of an object as a result of an applied force. Whether the object actually rotates or not is unimportant. We ask how the object would move were it free to do so. For example, in Figure 8.2 the force F would rotate the meter stick in a counterclockwise direction. This is the same direction we turn a jar lid in order to loosen it. If a force F0 was applied parallel to F, but to the left of P (see Figure 8.2), in what direction would the meter stick turn? Answer: The meter stick would turn clockwise. You may be familiar with the expression: Righty tighty, lefty loosey. We define the counterclockwise direction as positive and the clockwise direction as negative. The sign of the direction is based upon the Right Hand Rule. To understand this rule, hold your right hand with your thumb pointed up and curl your fingers into a fist. Notice that the direction your fingers curl in is counterclockwise (youre looking down). We define the upward direction in which the thumb points as positive, and the corresponding counterclockwise torque as positive. If you turn your hand such that your thumb now points down and curl your fingers into a fist, youll see your fingers turn clockwise. We define the downward direction in which your thumb points as negative, and the corresponding clockwise torque as negative. (For those readers who have grown up using only digital clocks, the term clockwise originated from the rotational direction that the hands of an analog clock move; counterclockwise being the reverse rotational direction.) 
Mathematical  Definition of  Torque 	  We can state the magnitude of the torque in two ways: (1) The product of the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation r (to the applied force) and the perpendicular component of the force F sin?. (2) The product of the perpendicular distance rsin? to the direction in which the force acts, and F. Both (1) and (2) are equivalent to the product of r,F, and the sine of the angle between them. The symbol for torque is the Greek letter tau (?). Thus, we can write ? = rF sin?, where the angle ? is the angle between vectors r and F. If the angle between r and F is 90? then the torque is simply ? = rF. We can see by the definition of the torque that the units of torque are m*N though they are usually expressed as N*m but never as joules even though they are dimensionally equivalent. Answer: The lever arm is 30 cm and the angle between the force and the lever arm is 90-degrees. ? = Frsin? = (105N)(0.30m)sin90? ? 31.5 Nm URL 
Illustrative  Example 8.1.1 	  A door of width 0.810 m requires a minimum torque of 14.47 m*N in order to open. The door knob is positioned (a) What minimum force is required to open the door? (b) If the doorknob is moved to the center of the door, what is the minimum force required in opening the door? Assume that the force acts perpendicular to the plane of the door. See Figure 8.4. Answers: (a.) The force is perpendicular to the lever arm so ? = rF = 14.47 m?N. Since the doorknob is 5.7 cm from the left edge of the door, the distance from the axis of rotation is r = 0.81m?0.057m = 0.753m. The force required is then: 
F   	  (b.) Since the doorknob is now in the center of the door, it is 0.	m from the axis of rotation. Therefore, the force required is  N How much force would be necessary to open the door if the doorknob were placed along the axis of rotation? URL 
Illustrative  Example 8.1.2 	  In Figure 8.5, a force F of 95.0 N is applied to a hinged rod of length r = 2.2 m. The angle between F and r is 130-degrees. Find the magnitude of the torque that the force F exerts upon the rod. Answer: Once again, ? = r(F sin?), but this time since ? 6= 90?, the equation does not reduce to ? = rF. 
Therefore, ? = (2.20m)(95.0 N)sin130? = 160.1 m? 	  Answer: The cosine of the angle would give the component of force that acts to pull an object, not turn it. The components of F in Figure 8.5 are drawn with red dashes. It should be clear that the perpendicular component (Fy) is the component of force used for rotation. Hence, ? = r(F sin?) Answer: It helps to look at what is often referred to as the line of action of the force. The line of action is represented in Figure 8.6 as the black dashed line that represents the direction in which F acts. We can see from the figure that rsin? is the perpendicular distance to the line of action . Thus we can consider the torque as ? = (rsin?)F. URL 
Objective 	  The student will: Understand the necessity for two conditions of equilibrium to ensure static equilibrium. rotational equilibrium: A state in which net torque is equal to zero. static equilibrium: The state in which a system is stable and at rest. To achieve complete static equilibrium, a system must have both rotational equilibrium (have a net torque of zero) and translational equilibrium (have a net force of zero). translational equilibrium: A state in which net force is equal to zero. 
Introduction 	  The word equilibrium means balance. In particular, static equilibrium means that a system is stable and at rest. This means that the net force must be zero called translational equilibrium. However, to be complete the net torque must also be zero called rotational equilibrium. For complete static equilibrium, both of these two conditions must be fulfilled. Consider the Free Body Diagram (FBD) in the Figure 8.7. A meter stick is lying on a smooth flat surface with two equal and opposite forces acting upon it. It is clear that the horizontal forces ?Fx = Fnet x = 0 and the vertical forces ?Fy = Fnet y = 0, and therefore, the meter stick is either at rest or moving with constant velocity. We will assume that it is at rest. We will now apply the forces to the ends of the meter stick. As we can see in Figure 8.8, forces ?F and F will cause the meter stick to rotate with an increasingly angular velocity since both forces now act to turn the meter stick in the same counterclockwise direction. The meter stick has a net torque working on it equal to ? = 2rF sin90? = 2rF. It should be noted that just as an object in translational equilibrium can be at rest or moving with constant translational velocity, so too an object in rotational equilibrium can be at rest or rotating with constant angular velocity. Here, though, we will concern ourselves only with the special case of static equilibrium. Two conditions of equilibrium must be imposed to ensure than an object remains in static equilibrium. Not only must the sum of all the forces acting upon the object be zero, but the sum of all the torques acting upon the object must also be zero. That is, both static translational and static rotational equilibrium conditions must be satisfied. 
Objective 	  The student will: Use the conditions of equilibrium to solve problems. fulcrum/pivot: The point about which a seesaw rotates. 
Introduction 	  If youre planning to study structural engineering or have hopes of becoming an architect, then at some point in your education you will need to take up the study of statics. Structural engineers are involved in designing roads, bridges, and large buildings. Architects must have an understanding of what is structurally possible when they design a structure. It is not uncommon for beginning structural engineering students to design structures that fail. The forces necessary to maintain the structure they have designed are improperly balanced and the conditions for static equilibrium are not achieved. Fortunately, with the advent of computers, very fast feedback for students is possible with the dynamic mathematical modeling of computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) software systems. Students can quickly see if their designs are feasible. The study of statics also involves topics such as the strength of the materials. A building may be designed correctly and it may be in static equilibrium, but if the materials used in construction are of poor quality, failure may occur from a stress overload. Very bad weather conditions may also add too much weight in the form of ice to a structure, causing the structure to fail. Every once in a while, we hear about such tragedies on the news. In this section we look at some simple systems that we wish to keep in static equilibrium. In solving the problems of this section, we will always use the location of the center of mass of each object in order to determine the distance between the axis of rotation and the applied force. 
Illustrative  Example 1:  The  Seesaw 	  In Figure 8.9 Jessica has mass me of 27.0-kg and is located 0.500 m from the left end of the seesaw. Boris has a mass mb of 33.0-kg and is located on the right end of the seesaw. If the seesaw is to remain balanced as in Figure 8.9, how far from the center of seesaw must Boris be seated? The seesaw is 5.50 m long and has a uniformly distributed mass ms of 8.30-kg. Let us first draw a Free Body Diagram of the situation showing the forces on the seesaw. The point, P in Figure 8.10 is called the pivot, or the fulcrum. It is the point about which the seesaw rotates. The axis of rotation is perpendicular to your computer screen, through P. If we choose the pivot P, then the torque contributed by the seesaw will be zero since the center of mass of the seesaw is at the pivot P, thus simplifying our calculations. Since the problem has unknown distance, we will use the equilibrium condition ?? = 0. Let us first find the weights of Jessica, Boris, and the seesaw: meg = (27.kg)(10m/s2) = 270N mbg = (33.kg)(10m/s2) = 330N msg = (8.3kg)(10m/s2) = 83N Jessica is 0.50 m from the left edge and therefore 2.75m?0.50m from the pivot P. 
She contributes a (negative) clockwise torque about the pivot 	  P of ?E = ?rF sin? = (2.75m?0.50m)(270N)sin90? = ?607 mN 
Boris contributes a (positive) counterclockwise torque about the pivot 	  P of ?B = rF sin? = (x)(330N)sin90? = (x)(330N) ?? = 0 ? (?607mN)+(330N)x = 0 x m In order to balance the seesaw, Boris must sit 1.84 m from the pivot while Jessica sits 2.25 m from the pivot. Does this seem reasonable to you, given that Boris has a greater mass than Jessica? What is the value of FN in Example 1? Answer: Even though only one equation of equilibrium ?? = 0 was explicitly used to solve the problem, both conditions must still be satisfied. Therefore: ?F = Fnet y = 0 ? FN ?264.9?81.4?323.7 = 0 y 
Illustrative  Example 2:  The  Daredevil 	  A daredevil with mass md of 60.0-kg walks along a uniform steel beam with mass mb of 270.0-kg, and unknown length L. One-third of the length of the beam hangs over the edge of a tall building. How far can the daredevil walk along the beam without the beam tipping over the edge of the building? Express the answer in terms of the length L of the beam. See Figure 8.11. Answer: We begin by drawing a Free Body Diagram of the steel beam. Once again, there is only one unknown in the problemdistance. Therefore, we will use the equilibrium condition ?? = 0. Well take the pivot P as our point of rotation. The clockwise torque due to the weight of the beam must balance the counterclockwise torque due to the weight of the daredevil. The angle between r and F is 90? throughout the problem so write the torques as just rF. We must determine the distance, xb from the center of mass of the beam to the pivot, P. Since the location of the center of mass is L and the location of the pivot isL, (see Figure 8.12) the distance between the center of mass and the pivot is xb . The condition for rotational equilibrium gives ?? = 0 ? mbgL6 ?mdgxd = 0. 
After canceling g and substituting the givens we have 	  L Well, just how much of a daredevil is he? The result of Example 2 shows that the daredevil cannot tip the beam. The beam only extends one-third of its length beyond the building. Even at the very edge of the beam, there is no chance of it tipping, since he would need to beL beyond the point, P. What weight beam would he need in order to ensure that tipping begins at the end of the beam, thus making this feat a bit more worthy of a daredevil? Answer: We wish the beam to be on the verge of tipping when the daredevil reaches the end of the beam, that is, when he isL past the pivot point. At this point, the torque due to the weight of the beam must just balance the torque due to the weight of the daredevil. The distance between the center of mass of the beam and the pivotL is one-half the distance from the pivot to the edge of the beam; note,is one-half of . Therefore the beam must weigh twice that of the daredevil. 
Illustrative  Example 3  Trucking 	  A loaded 18-wheeler of mass mt = 3.6  104 kg is traveling across a flat bridge of length L, 75.0m and mass mb of 6.0  106 kg. The Free Body Diagram for the bridge is shown in Figure 8.13. At the point the truck is 10.0m from point P what forces, FA and FB must the supports provide in order for the system to remain in static equilibrium? Answer: There are two unknowns in the problem, so we will need two independent equations in order to solve for FA and FB. Equation 1 below maintains that the translational equilibrium condition is satisfied, that is, that the net force on the bridge is zero. Equation 1: ?F = 0 ? FA +FB ?mtg?mbg = 0 Equation 2 provides that the rotational equilibrium condition is satisfied, that is, that the net torque is zero. We will compute the torques about the point, P in Figure 8.13. Doing so, FA will provide a clockwise torque and the weight of the bridge and truck will provide counterclockwise torques. Again, the angle between r and F is 90?. 
Equation 2: ?? = 0 ? ? L+mtgxt +mbg L2 = 0 	  Equation 2 is used to solve for FA; use g = 10m/s2. FA =	2 =	txt +mb L2) g mtgxt +mbgL	(m = = 3107N We solve for FB using Equation 1. 
B = mtg+mbg? A = (mt +mb)g? 	  = (3.6104kg+6.0106kg)(10m/s2)?(3107N) = 3.107N thus FB = 3107 N. Does it seem reasonable that FA and FB should be the same to only one significant figure? In the Check you understanding section below, we do an example in which the support forces are very different. Choose your own pivot point and use g = 10sm2 . Forces FA and FB have the same magnitudes that scales A and B read. Answers: FA = 60 N and FB = 40 N (Hint: use the same equations as in Example 3.) 1b. If the books were sitting on the plank over Scale A, what would each scale read? Answer: Scale A now sees all of the weight of the books and Scale B sees none of the weight. However, each scale still supports half of the weight of the plank. Therefore Scale A reads FA = 40 N + 30 N = 70 N and Scale B reads FB = 0 N +30 N = 30 N. The books in the above example are substituted with a remote-controlled toy tank with the same mass as the books. Assume the tank begins at Scale A and moves with a constant velocity of 0.50 m/s from one end of the plank to the other. Find an equation that gives the reading of Scale A as a function of time. Answer: The distance of the tank from Scale B can be expressed as L?x, where, x = vt. Thus, 
 	  FAL = mbg(L?x)+mpg	mbg(L?vt)+mpg	 ? FA =	2	? 
 	  Does the result satisfy the condition t = 0 in part 1b? How about when the books are on Scale B at time t = 6 s? URL 
Illustrative  Example 4:  A  Sign of the  Times 	  A sign of weight 100.0 N hangs from a rod of weight 80.0 N and length 1.2 m. A cable with unknown tension T at an angle of 60? from the horizontal and a hinge H supports the sign and rod. See Figure 8.15 and Figure 8.16. Find the components of the force FH that the hinge places upon the rod. Answer: The equations for the x and y forces in translational equilibrium are (see Figure 8.16): 
Equation 2: ? Fy = 0 ?  Hy + Ty ? Ws ? Wr 	  We can also write the equation for rotational equilibrium: 
Equation 3: ?? = 0 ?  Ty Ws L = 0 	  It will be more efficient to work with Equation 3 first since the only unknown in the equation is Ty. Solving for Ty, we have. Using Equation 2, we can use Ty to solve for Hy ? Hy +Ty ?Ws ?Wr = 0 ? Hy = ?168 N +100 N +80 N = 12 N Using Equation 1 we can solve for Hx by finding Tx. Let us resolve the components of the tension T: Ty = T sin? and Tx = T cos? or Ty = T sin60? and Tx = T cos60? 
Since  Ty = 168  N, we can solve for  	  Finally, using Equation 1 we have Tx = Hx ? T cos60? = Hx ? (194N)(0.50) = 97N Thus (Hx,Hy) = (97N,194N) URL i. Translational equilibrium: ?F = Fnet = 0 ii. Rotational equilibrium: ?? = ?net = 0 
Chapter  Outline 	  We know gravity as the force pulling downwards on everyday objects. The principles of gravity, however, apply on a much larger scale, and were discovered from study of the solar system. This chapter will cover Keplers Laws of Planetary Motion, Newtons Universal Law of Gravity, and the mechanics of circular orbits. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand Keplers Laws. Use Keplers Third Law to solve problems. epicycle geocentric: A model of the planets in which Earth is at the center of all other planets. heliocentric: The model of the planets in which all planets revolve around the Sun. This is the model that was eventually proven correct. period Johannes Kepler (1571 1630) ( Figure 9.1) was a German mathematician and astronomer. He read Nicholas Copernicuss De Revolutions, which proposed that both Earth and the other planets revolved around the Sun. The problem was that up until that point, there was no proof of Copernicuss ideas. In fact, the geocentric model, which placed the Earth at the center of the rest of the planets, gave better predictions. Copernicus had intriguing ideas, but he assumed that the orbits were perfect circles. It was up to Kepler, a superior mathematician as well as a profound thinker, to put his idea on a firmer basis. Keplers life story is one of triumph over adversity. He was born into a time when religious wars between Catholics and Protestants ravaged central Europe. Kepler held the very modern view that no one should be persecuted for their religious beliefs. In 1600, Kepler met Tycho Brahe (1546 1601) ( Figure 9.2), arguably the greatest naked-eye astronomer who ever lived (the telescope had not yet been invented). Tycho had accumulated a wealth of planetary data over a period of twenty years of painstaking observations. In particular, the data he collected on Mars was the most extensive ever compiled. Through a rather roundabout series of events, Kepler acquired Tychos Mars data, and eventually, after Tychos death, acquired (by theft) the remainder of the data. Both Tycho and Kepler were fascinating historical figures, and certainly deserve more time than this lesson can afford. Over the next twenty years Kepler used that data to fully establish the heliocentric model and overthrow the geocentric model of Ptolemy. Keplers work established what has come to be known as Keplers Three Laws of Planetary Motion. We state them below. all points that are equal distance from a single point. An ellipse is the set of all points where the sum of the distance to two foci is always equal. See Figure 9.3. For the time being, we can treat k as unity if we choose time in units of years and distance in units of astronomical units (AU) where 1.0 AU is the average distance between the sun and the earth). For example, since Mars is, on average, about one and one half times farther from the sun than the Earth, Mars is 1.5 AU from the sun, or, more precisely 1.52 AU. Keplers First Law: Planet P follows an elliptical path as it orbits the sun at focal point F2. Answer: Since the period of the Earth about the sun is one year and by definition it is a distance of one AU from the sun, we have: T2 = kr3 ? (1)3 = k(1)2 ? k = 1 Answer: Using Keplers Third Law: T2 = r3 ? T2 = (1.52)3 ? T = p(1.52)3 ? 1.874 ? 1.87 years Answer: r3 = T2 ? r3 = (248)2 ? r = p3 (2482) = 39.47 ? 39.5 AU. Keplers Third Law, in the form that we have presented it, is valid as long as the central body (the object that is being orbited) is much more massive than the orbiting object. For example, we could time the period for a moon of Jupiter and then use Keplers Third Law to find the average distance that the moon is from Jupiter (Jupiter would then be the central body). Or we can use Keplers Third Law to determine the period of a satellite in orbit about the earth if we knew its distance from the Earth (the Earth would now be the central body). Later we will learn that r represents the distance between the center of the orbiting body and the center of the central body. For the time being, though, we will simply accept this as true without explanation. URL 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  A satellite is to be placed in orbit about the Earth halfway between the Earth and the moon. The period of the moon about the Earth is 27.3 days. What is the period of the satellite? Answer: Let us call the distance between the Earth and moon R and the distance from the Earth to the satellite R2 . Using Keplers Third Law for the Earth and Moon, we first solve for k. T2	. Now that we know k we solve for the period Ts of the satellite. Ts2 = kR233 ? substitute for k	solve for Ts  days Two exoplanets (planets that orbit stars other than the sun), Close and Far, orbit their parent sun such that Close is b. n years c. 2n years d. More than 2n years Answer: This problem is, essentially, the same as Example 1. In that problem, two bodies orbited the Earth, one twice as far from the Earth as the other. We saw that the period of the moon which was twice as far away as the satellite had a period of 27.3 days and the satellite had a period of 9.65 days. Clearly, the relationship (which we can see from the equation) is not linear. Since the moons period is greater than twice the satellites period, in fact, almost three times as much, it will take Far longer than 2n years to orbit its sun. The answer is therefore, D. URL

Introduction 	  Humanity has always known that objects fall to the ground, but for many years, no one understood why gravity works. A key breakthrough came from the work of Isaac Newton (1642-1727), ( Figure 9.5). In 1687, Newton published his most important book, Philosophi Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which connected the falling of objects on Earth with the motion of the planets. Prior to his book, those two concepts were thought to be completely unrelated. The possibility that gravity extended beyond the Earth first occurred to Newton in 1666. According to his personal accounts, he watched an apple fall from a tree and wondered if the same force that acted upon the apple also acted upon the Moon and other bodies of the solar system. As he expressed it, gravity acts between all objects according to their mass. On Earth, only the force of gravity with the Earth itself is noticeable because the Earth is much more massive than all other objects. However, there is a tiny gravitational force between all other objects as well. Newton expressed the force of gravity as follows: What is the gravitational force between the two objects in Figure 9.6 if each object has mass of 10.0kg and they are separated by a distance r = 2.00m? According to Newtons Universal Law of Gravity, 
F =	= 1.667510 ? 1.6710  N r2	(2.00m)2 	  This is an amazingly small force. It is a little bit larger than one-billionth of a Newton or about four-tenth of onebillionth of a pound. Gravity is a very weak force unless there is a huge amount of mass involved, or the distance between the masses is very small. In fact, gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces we discussed earlier. A natural question at this point isHow did Newton arrive at this equation describing the forces between objects? No doubt, Newton was a genius, but even a genius seeks reassurance. We will see that Keplers work helped to convince Newton that his final form for the Universal Law of Gravity was quite reasonable. URL 
Newtons  Verification of  His  Inverse  Square  Law 	  In order to understand why Newton believed in the validity of the Universal Law of Gravity, we need to go back to an earlier lesson in which we learned that the acceleration of an object in circular motion is directed toward the center of the circle it travels in and has acceleration, a, of magnitude a = vr2 . We will assume the orbit of the moon is circular in the example below (it is really slightly elliptical), that the distance between the Earth and Moon from center to center is R, that the magnitude of the Moons velocity is v, and that the period of the Moons orbit about the earth is T. Recall that the circumference of a circle is C = 2?R. See Figure 9.7. Since x = vt, we can substitute C, the distance the moon travels during one orbit about the Earth, for x, and substitute (2?R)2 If we now replace v with 2T?R in a = vr2 and r with R, we have, a = R ? 4T?22R, thus a = 4T?22R. This is the centripetal acceleration of the Moon relative to the Earth. The force that the Earth exerts upon the Moon, according to Newtons Second Law, is ?F = mma = mm 4T?22R, (Equation 1), where mm is the Moons mass. On the other hand, according to the Universal Law of Gravity, the F in Equation 1 (see Figure 9.7) is the same as the F as in F = GmRm2me , Equation 2, where me is the mass of the Earth. Thus, we can equate the two forces: Gmmme = m 4?2R and solve for T2 ? T2 = 4?2R3 . m 
R2	 T2	 Gme 	  The derived expression, not coincidentally, looks a lot like Keplers Third Law (applied to circular orbits), where the constant k mentioned above is equal is k = Gm4?2e . The fact that the Universal Law of Gravity yielded Keplers Third Law gave a good deal of support to its validity. It also explained that Keplers Third Law had the form it did as a result of an inverse square force law. It is important to note that the mass in the denominator of k is the mass of the central body. In the work above, it is the mass of the Earth. The mass of the orbiting body does not enter the equation. It is beyond the scope of this book, but a more general statement of Keplers Third Law does use both masses. URL 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  Note, G	kg	, the distance between the centers of the Earth and Moon is R = 3.84  105 km and the mass of Earth is me = 5.971024 kg. Answer: From the above we have T2 = Gm4?2e R3. We must remember that the SI system of units uses meters and seconds, and therefore we must convert R = 3.84105 km ? R = 3.84108 m. Substituting into the above equation we have: 
 	  ? T2 = 5.6141012 ? T = 2.369106 s Let us go one step further and represent this result in days instead of seconds. One day has 86,400 seconds, therefore Answer: For an object of mass m at rest upon the surface of the Earth, the object experiences a force F due to the Earth, of F = mg. But force F must be the same as that given by the Universal Law of Gravity, namely F = GmR2em, where R is the radius of the Earth. Thus, mg R GmR2e . This is why in all of our work so far we have always made the statement that g = 9.81sm2 near the Earths surface. Try substituting the values for G,me, and R in the above equation for g to show that g = 9.81sm2 . What gravitational acceleration does an object experience at the instant it is released at one Earth radius above the surface of the Earth? See Figure 9.8. Answer: Since g = Gmr2 e , we substitute r = 2R 
Gme	 Gme	 Gme	1  Gme	1	1	m	m 	  g = = = = = g = (9.81 ) = 2.45 r2 (2R)2 4R2 4 R2 4 4 s2 s2 Remember that the distance r is measured from the center of the Earth! 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  Another support for the Universal Law of Gravity comes from computing the acceleration of the Moon toward the Earth. The distance from the center of the Moon to center of the Earth is 60.27 Earth radii (Re), so the acceleration of the Moon toward the Earth should be (60.127)2ge, where ge = 9.81sm2 the acceleration of gravity at the Earths surface. a. Find the acceleration of the Moon (gat moon) relative to the Earth using the equation a = vr2 . Answer: We have already shown that a = 4T?22R, that the period of the Moon about the Earth in seconds is T = 2.369  106 s, and the distance between their centers in meters is R = 3.84  108 m. Substituting these values into a = 4T?22R, we have a sm2 b. Find the acceleration of the Moon relative to the Earth if the distance between their centers is 60.27Re using Newtons Universal Law of Gravity. As discussed above, the Universal Law of Gravity gives the acceleration of the Moon at a distance of 60.27Re as . Answer: m s2 A more complete solution is: 
Gme	 Gme	 Gme	1	 Gme	1 	  gat moon =	=	=	=	? gat moon = (60.27)2 ge (60.27)2	s2	s We see the results are same, to three significant figures, using the equation for the centripetal acceleration we derived earlieir and Newtons Universal Law of Gravity. 
Another  Inverse  Square  Law 	  It often happens in Physics that the form of an equation which describes one phenomenon is found describing a seemingly different phenomenon. This is the case with static electricity. Fifty-eight years after the death of Isaac Newton, in 1785, the French physicist, Charles Augustin de Coulomb (1736 1806), Figure 9.9, published a work giving the force of attraction between two charge particles as F = kqr12q2 . In this equation, q1 and q2 are two charges measured in units of coulombs (C), k is a constant of proportionality, and r the distance between the two charges. You can very quickly get an idea of the force of electric charges by ripping a small piece of paper into even smaller, tinier pieces. If you then have a plastic pen, try rubbing the pen on your shirt and then hold the pen over the tiny pieces of paper. You will probably see some of the tiny pieces attach themselves to the pen. This is the result of an electrical attraction. Clearly, the force of gravity was unable to keep the tiny bits of paper from sticking to the pen and therefore we can conclude that the electrostatic force involved in this activity is greater than the gravitational force. Electrostatics will be discussed in much greater detail later. We will note, however, that the force between a positive and negative charge of 10?6 C, the typical unbalanced charges produced by the kind of action described above, at a distance of 2.00 m, gives rise to an attractive force of 2.5  10?2 N. Recall that the gravitational force between two 10.0-kg objects was of the order of 10?9 N. In other words, the electric attraction is of the order of ten million times larger in comparing these two examples. Had we used the actual masses of 10?6 C and computed the gravitational attraction, we would have found that the electric force is some 40 orders of magnitude (1040) greater than the gravitational force! Even though mathematically Newtons Universal Law of Gravity and Coulombs Law are similar, the forces they describe have different natures and, usually, very different magnitudes. Also, whereas gravity is always an attractive force, the electrostatic force can either attract (opposite charges) or repel (like charges). 
Objective 	  The student will: Use Newtons Universal Law of Gravity and Keplers Third Law to solve problems. geosynchronous: An orbit where the satellite remains over the same position on the Earth. orbit: The path of one object revolving around the other, such as the Moon around the Earth, or the Earth around the Sun. Orbits can be circular or elliptical. 
Introduction 	  Putting together the principles of gravity and the principles of circular motion allows us to solve problems relating to circular orbits. The planets and their moons do not have circular orbits, but many artificial satellites do. The first artificial satellite was the Russian satellite Sputnik, which was launched October 4, 1957 and successfully orbited the Earth at an altitude of 228 km, circling the Earth every 98 minutes. Sputnik was considered a challenge to American military and technological dominance, and thus started the Space Race. Since 1957, the United States has landed twelve men on the Moon, had an active Space Shuttle program, been a partner in building the International Space Station, and has been one of several countries to send robotic probes all over the solar system. Currently, the US maintains numerous artificial satellites in Earth orbit for the purposes of navigation, communication, monitoring the weather, scientific studies, and spying. Solving problems with a circular orbit combines centripetal acceleration and universal gravity. An object moving at constant speed has acceleration toward the center of a circle of ac = vr2 . Any object has the force of gravity from another object of F = Gmr12m2 . Putting these together with Newtons Second Law, F = ma, we can solve problems regarding orbits. When dealing with the Earth, we can simplify gravity because we know the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth: 
F			81m/s2 	  e In orbital calculations, we use the more exact figure for the acceleration due to gravity g. Answer: With this height above the surface of the Earth, the satellite has a distance from the center of the Earth of 1.5Re. The force of gravity is then 
Gmme	1	 Gmme	1 	  F = ma = = = mg (1.5Re)2 1.52 R2e 1.52 a Answer: In this case, the acceleration due to gravity is the centripetal acceleration. v	? v = 5.27103m/s 
Orbital  Altitudes 	  Satellite orbits are typically split into three groups: low, medium, and high. Low orbits extend to a height of 2000 km, while medium go up to approximately 20,000 km. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  The satellite in Figure 9.11 is in orbit at a height h of 250 km above the surface of the Earth. The radius of the Earth varies. For this, use Re = 6370km. A satellite in orbit about the Earth. a. What is the orbiting satellites acceleration due to gravity gs at this location? Answer: Using a familiar formula for gs we have, gs = Gmr2 e . But what value should we use for r? The distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite is: r = Re + h = 6370km+250km = 6620km. We can express this in terms of a ratio to the radius of the Earth, Rre 	Re. Substituting into the equation for gs we have:

We also know r = 6630 km = v = ?ar = q(9.08m/s2)(6.63106m) = 7.76103m/s This is about 17,353 miles per hour, a typical near-Earth orbital velocity. c. We often see pictures of astronauts floating within their spacecraft. It is not unusual for their craft to have a similar orbit about the Earth as the satellite in this example. Sometimes youll hear someone claim that the reason the astronaut is floating is because there is no gravity up there, or because the astronaut is weightless. Is it true that the astronaut no longer experiences a gravitational force and is, by extension, weightless? Answer: No, it is not true. As we can see from part A, the gravitational acceleration is close to 93% as much as it is on the surface of the Earth 6%. If we were on a planet with a gravitational acceleration of 9.08sm2 , an astronaut who weighs 600 N on Earth would weigh 555 N on this planet. She would hardly be weightless. The same 600 N astronaut does indeed have a 555 N force acting on her within the spacecraft. The gravitational force from the Earth is what maintains her orbit about the Earth. If gravity were somehow to turn-off while she was in orbit, the astronaut would move off tangentially to the orbit that she had been followingnote the dashed red line in Figure 9.12. The fact that she does not fly off tangentially reinforces the notion that a force must be present to maintain her circular motion path (recall Newtons First Law). In fact, the distance h in Figure 9.12 represents the distance she effectively has fallen in her orbit about the Earth. Astronauts are in a perpetual state of free fall about the Earth and this is why they float. They have an apparent weight of zero, only in that a scale reading of their weight, while in orbit, would read zero. You can see an example of apparent weightlessness in free fall by trying a simple experiment. Get an empty soda can and poke a hole in the side of the can, small enough so your finger can easily cover it, but large enough so water can easily flow out. Fill the can with water, holding your finger over the hole to prevent the water from flowing out. Now, hold the can at arms length and remove your finger for a moment to convince yourself the water will freely flow. Then release the can. As soon as the can is in free fall the water will stop flowing out. The apparent weight of the water is zerothere is no normal force on the water and there is no apparent water pressure. The can and water, however, still have a force of gravity acting on them, because that is, of course, the force causing the can to fall in the first place! URL 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  A geosynchronous satellite is one which remains above a fixed point on the Earths surface in its revolution about the planet. What distance Rs from the surface of the earth must a satellite be placed in order to achieve such an orbit? Answer: First, we must ask ourselves, what period T must a satellite have in order to remain positioned over the same point on the Earths surface? Since the satellite appears fixed in space as seen from the surface of the Earth, it must have a period of revolution equal to the period of rotation of the Earth, that is Te = 1.00 days ? 24.0 h ? 86,400 s.

What isthe gravitational acceleration at the surface of Gliese 1214b? Answer: We use Newtons Universal Law of Gravity. We know that the acceleration at the surface of the Earth is ge = GmRe2e , and therefore, in general, the acceleration of gravity on the surface of any planet is g = GmR2 . In this case, the mass m and the radius R is of Gliese 1214b. We are given that mgliese = 6.35me and Rgliese = 2.78Re. Substituting, we have ggliese GmR2ee ? 0.8216(9.81) = 8.059 ? 8.06sm2 . b. What would a person who weighs 700 N on Earth weigh on Gliese 1214b? Answer: Lets solve this two ways. i. Use the persons mass and multiply it by the acceleration of gravity on Gliese 1214b. The mass of the person is m = Wge = 9. s2 . Therefore, the weight of the person on Gliese 1214b is W = mg = (71.36)(8.06) = 575.1 ? 575N ii.

Periodic  Motion 	  Periodic motion is any motion that repeats itself. This chapter covers a particular case of such called simple harmonic motion for motion back and forth in a straight line such as a pendulum. The properties of simple harmonic motion include the basics of wave properties. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand periodic motion. Understand simple harmonic motion. periodic motion: Motion that repeats the same path at a regular time. simple harmonic motion: A kind of one-dimensional (back-and-forth) periodic motion in which the farther the object moves from the center, the more it is pulled back toward the center. 
Introduction 	  The word periodic simply means something that repeats at regular intervals, such as days of the week (weekly), birthdays, and holidays (yearly). Periodic motion is motion that repeats the same path round-and-round, backand-forth, or similar. Familiar cases of periodic motion include the Earth orbiting the Sun ( Figure 10.1) and an elastic collision of a ball rebounding off of a flat surface ( Figure 10.2). Two very important vibrating motions discussed in this chapter are objects vibrating on the end of springs and pendulums. A special case of periodic motion is simple harmonic motion (SHM). This is a particular kind of back-and-forth motion, in which the farther the object moves from the center, the more it is pulled back. Two common cases of SHM are: A pendulum on a string (called a simple pendulum). The farther out the pendulum swings, the more gravity pulls it back. A mass vibrating on a spring. The more the string is stretched or squashed, the more force it exerts. SHM is especially important because it serves as a model for related processes. Similar vibrations of molecules are responsible for sound, and similar vibrations of electrically-charged particles at a microscopic scale are responsible for radio waves, light, and x-rays. 
Simple  Harmonic  Motion from  Uniform  Circular  Motion 	  An object vibrating back and forth on the end of a spring is an example of simple harmonic motion (SHM). For such motion, the force responsible for the vibration is directly proportional to the objects displacement. Other examples of objects performing SHM are the tuning fork in Figure above, a lightly plucked taut string, some forms of molecular vibrations, and pendulum motion close to the bottom of its swing. It is by no means obvious but as we shall see, SHM is related to uniform circular motion. Recall that in uniform circular motion, an object travels with a constant speed around a circle. If the objects motion is projected onto a vertical or horizontal line, it resembles the motion of a vibrating object on the end of a spring. In other words, it is equivalent to SHM. 
Projected  Motion 	  Imagine viewing one of the cars (shown as blue dots below) of a Ferris wheel edge-on as in Figure 10.3. The car appears to move up and down. Effectively, we are projecting the circular motion of the car onto a vertical line. If we were watching from above, we would be projecting the motion onto a horizontal line. In either case, the projected motion of the car would appear as an up-and-down or back-and-forth motion. URL URL Though the typical (calculus-based) mathematical derivation showing the relationship between the projection of uniform circular motion and simple harmonic motion is beyond the scope of this book, we will nonetheless give a plausible mathematical argument for it later. 
Conditions for  Simple  Harmonic  Motion 	  For the moment, we state without proof that the motion of a mass (the block in Figure 10.4, for example) moving back and forth on the end of a spring, is the same as the projected motion of the Ferris wheel car in Figure 10.3. In Figure 10.4, the equilibrium point of the mass on the spring is labeled 0. The spring is assumed to have negligible mass and the mechanical energy of the mass-spring system is assumed to be conserved. (Unless otherwise stated, we will always assume that the mass of the spring is negligible and the mechanical energy of the system is conserved.) When the mass is pulled sideways and released, the spring will cause the mass to move back toward its equilibrium position. The tension force Fa of the spring upon the mass is, therefore, directed toward the equilibrium position and is proportional to the displacement of the mass (recall Hookes Law). The mass will pass through the equilibrium position and as it does, the spring will begin to slow the mass down until it is brought to rest at positionx, opposite to where the mass started. After the mass passes its equilibrium position, force Fb of the spring upon the mass changes direction so that it keeps pointing toward the equilibrium position. In other words, the force on the mass by the spring is always directed toward the equilibrium position of the mass. We call this force a restoring force. These observations lead us to the conditions for simple harmonic motion: An object performing SHM must have a restoring force acting upon it that seeks to return it to its equilibrium position. The magnitude of that force is directly proportional to the objects displacement. That is, F = ?kx where the negative sign indicates that the restoring force and displacement are oppositely directed and k is a constant of proportionality. 
Motivating the  Conditions for  Simple  Harmonic  Motion 	  Let us return to uniform circular motion. Figure 10.5 shows an object P in uniform circular motion along with its acceleration a and radius r indicating the location of the object P along the circle. We have dropped the subscript on the centripetal acceleration ac we used earlier. We see in Figure 10.5, the acceleration a and position vector r have components in the x?direction and y?direction. We have not bothered to label the y?components, though everything that is true for the x?components is equally true for the y?components. Notice that when the object is in the first quadrant, the x?component of the acceleration ?ax is negative whereas the x?component of the displacement +x is positive and that when the object is in the second quadrant, the x?component of the acceleration is positive +ax and the x?component of the displacement ?x is negative. Since F = ma,Fx and ax must be in the same direction, and therefore Fx is oppositely directed to x as we have insisted for SHM. We have also shown that the acceleration for uniform circular motion can be expressed as a = 4T?22r. But we can write the acceleration ax as ax = acos? and rearranging write a = cosax?. Substituting cosax? for a in a = 4T?22r yields a . Since rcos? = x substitution yields, ax = 4T?22x. But ax and x are oppositely directed thus ax T T (Equation 1). The quantity 4T?22 is a constant and so a is directly proportional to the displacement ?x. But the force F is directly proportional to the acceleration a as well since F = ma. Therefore, the force is directly proportional to the opposite of the displacement. We have shown two conditions for uniform circular motion: (1) the force and displacement are oppositely directed and (2) the force and displacement are directly proportional. These are the same conditions for SHM. URL

Introduction 	  A mass on a spring is the simplest case of simple harmonic motion (SHM). In Figure 10.6, the equilibrium point of the mass on the spring is labeled 0. This is the rest position of the spring, when it is neither contracting or expanding. When the mass is pulled sideways and released, the spring will cause the mass to move back toward its equilibrium position. The tension force Fa of the spring upon the mass is, therefore, directed toward the equilibrium position and is proportional to the displacement of the mass (recall Hookes Law). The mass will pass through the equilibrium position and as it does, the spring will begin to slow the mass down until it is brought to rest at position x, opposite where the mass started. After the mass passes its equilibrium position, force Fb of the spring upon the mass changes direction so that it keeps pointing toward the equilibrium position. In other words, the force on the mass by the spring is always directed toward the equilibrium position of the mass. We call this force a restoring force. These observations lead us to the conditions for simple harmonic motion: An object performing SHM must have a restoring force acting upon it that seeks to return it to its equilibrium position. The magnitude of that force is directly proportional to the objects displacement. That is, F = ?kx, where the negative sign indicates that the restoring force and displacement are oppositely directed and k is a constant of proportionality. Examples of such a spring pendulum would include a bungee jumper or just a large spring, as shown in the video below: 
The  Period for a  Mass on a  Spring in  	  The amount of time it takes an object to repeat its motion is called the period of the oscillations, written as T. Imagine stretching the spring with the attached mass of Figure 10.6 to some position +x and releasing it. The period is how much time is required for the mass to once again arrive at position +x. Since we have shown that the projection of uniform circular motion is SHM and that a mass vibrating on a spring is in SHM, we can use the results of uniform circular motion to answer this question. We know that the magnitude of the force on the mass is F = kx when the spring is stretched a distance x. But we also know that Fx = max, and so max = kx (Equation 2). The x-component of the acceleration, however, is ax = 4T?22x (Equation 1). Substituting for ax from Equation 1 into Equation 2, we have m T	T	.	Solving for the period, T	T	k	k . Assume the block in Figure 10.6 has a mass of 1.50-kg and is attached to a spring with spring constant 25.0 N/m. What is the period T of the block? Answer: We know T = 2?pmk . Substitution into this equation gives us T . In the study of vibrational motion, it is useful to define two other quantities in addition to the period T. 
Frequency 	  The frequency of periodic motion is defined as the reciprocal of the period f = T1 . For example, if an object requires a quarter of a second, 0.25 s, to complete one cycle of its motion, it has a frequency of f	0 Hz. The unit Hz is Hertz, named after the German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (1857-1894), who we will discuss again later. The Hertz is used in place of revolutions per second, as well as cycles per second. Hertz is equivalent to s , cycle and revolution and has no SI units. A block attached to the end of a spring, displaced from equilibrium and released, has a period of 5.00 s. a. What is the frequency of the blocks vibrations? 
Answer: f	20  Hz 	  b. How many times has the blocked passed its equilibrium position, from the time of its release, if it is permitted tovibrate for only 6.00 s? Answer: The block will pass its equilibrium position twice each cycle. Since one cycle of its motion takes 5.00 s it will have completed only one cycle during 6.00 s and therefore it will pass its equilibrium position 2 times. Regardless of where the block is released from equilibrium it will take 1.25 s to reach equilibrium (why?). Since the block returns to its release position in 5 s, it will not have enough time to pass its equilibrium position a third time. 
Amplitude 	  The amplitude of an objects periodic motion is defined as the maximum distance from equilibrium. We usually use the symbol A for amplitude. A horizontal spring with a block attached is stretched 8.40 cm beyond its equilibrium position. What is the maximum compression of the spring after passing through its equilibrium position? Answer: A block initially stretched 8.40 cm beyond its equilibrium position will have amplitude 8.40 cm. Since the motion of the block is symmetric about the equilibrium position, the spring will have a maximum compression of 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  a. A 5.00-kg block in Figure 10.7 is attached to a spring with a force constant of k = 75.0Nm. The spring is stretched +0.35m beyond its equilibrium position 0 and released. Use the conservation of mechanical energy to find the velocity of the block when it is at position 0.15 m. Answer: The law of conservation of mechanical energy states that Ei = Ef . Let us choose the initial state at which the block is located at the 0.35 m position and the final state when the block is located at the 0.15 m position. At the position 0.35 m, all of the energy of the block-spring system is stored as potential energy in the spring. The initial energy of the block-spring system is Ei = 21kA2. In its final state, the block-spring system will have both potential and kinetic energy since the spring is still stretched at the 0.15 m position and the block now is in motion. If the final position of the block is x and the final velocity of the block is v, the final energy of the block-spring system can be written as Ef = 12kx2 + 21mv2. 
Solving, we have  Ei =  Ef 	  v2 = 0.100 ? v = 0.316 ? 0.32m s Notice there are two solutions to the problem. Since the block is moving toward the left, the correct solution is v = ?0.32ms . b. What is the blocks speed when it passes through its equilibrium position? Answer: This occurs at the position where the spring is no longer stretched, that is, when it is at equilibrium. Taking the initial energy at the blocks maximum extension (its amplitude A = 0.35 m) and the final energy at equilibrium x = 0.00 m, the conservation of mechanical energy Ei = Ef gives v2 = 75.0(0.35)2 ? v = 1.36. The speed of the block is therefore 1.4m. c. What is the period of oscillations T of the block? 
Answer: T  s 	  d. How much time does it take the block to go from its maximum extension of 0.35 m to its equilibrium position Answer; We will solve the problem in two different ways: i. Since SHM is the projection of circular motion, the time for an object to travel from its maximum extension toequilibrium is the same time it takes the object to travel one-fourth of a revolution about a circle. Click on the link to see this idea animated. URL 
T	1.62 s 	  s ii. Using kinematics, we see that the total displacement of the block between the extremes of its motion is ?0.35 m? (+0.35 m) = ?0.70 m. We can safely assume that the time it takes to travel from 0.35m to -0.35m is half the period T, since other than the direction of the blocks motion, the second half of its cycle is identical to the first half of its cycle. (The same reasoning would lead us to assume the time from maximum extension to equilibrium must be onefourth of the period). The time of travel is t  s. The average velocity is then v ?0.864 ? ?0.86ms and the time to travel from +0.35m to equilibrium 0.00m is t	s	s vf Why cant we also use the good old kinematic equation x	t where the distance x vi+vf Answer: The equation x = 2 t is only true if the acceleration is constant. Since the force on the block is F = ?kx ? ma = ?kx, the acceleration a varies with x and is therefore not constant. The period would be: a. The same. b. Half as great. c. Twice as great. Answer: The answer is A. The farther the spring is stretched, the greater the force on the object attached to the spring (recall that F ? ?x ? a ? ?x) and so the greater the average speed of the block. The larger average speed makes up exactly for the greater distance the block must travel during one cycle. 1c. If the spring constant is increased, the period is: a. The same b. Decreased c. Increased Answer: The answer is B. The spring constant is in the denominator, so a larger value must make the result T smaller. This is reasonable, since the larger the spring constant, the stiffer the spring and so the more force pulling on the object, shortening the time needed to complete a cycle of motion. What effect do you think increasing the mass would have on the period? Would twice the mass double the period? We end this section with an example of an object attached to a vertical spring. 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  A 3.50-kg block stretches a vertical spring 9.50 cm beyond its unstretched length L0 ( Figure 10.8) as shown at position A. If the block is pulled down, stretching the spring an additional amount d (position B), and released, with what frequency will the block vibrate? Answer: At first glance it may seem that we dont have enough information to solve the problem, since we require both the mass of the block and the spring constant in order to find the period of the block and eventually the frequency. But we must remember that the block is in equilibrium at position A in Figure 10.8. The Free-Body-Diagram of the block is drawn at position A. The weight of the block mg is balanced by the force that the spring exerts in the upward direction kx. The net force on the block at position A is zero, so ?F = kx?mg = 0 ? k = mgx . We may then use the equation T = 2?pmk . We will use this equation in order to write a useful equation for the frequency: Since the frequency is f = T1 , substituting 2?pmk for T gives f	mk (Equation 3). 
Substituting k = mgx	into  Equation 3, we have 	  f  Hz Notice the additional distance d the spring was stretched did not enter into the calculation for the period of frequency. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand a simple pendulum. Solve problems involving a simple pendulum. simple pendulum: Constructed by attaching any object to one end of a string and attaching the other end of the string to a fixed point, allowing them to swing back and forth. 
Introduction 	  A simple pendulum consists of any object (called a pendulum bob), and a length of string. The dimensions of the bob are small compared to the length of string. The pendulum is constructed by attaching the bob to one end of the string and attaching the other end of the string to a fixed point. The bob and string can now swing back and forth. The effective length of the string is measured from the point at which the string is fixed to the center of mass of the bob (see Figure 10.9). Does a simple pendulum perform simple harmonic motion (SHM)? It does, as long as certain assumptions are met. The string cannot stretch or twist, and the angle of swinging cannot be too great. If the bob moves through as wide an angle as shown in Figure 10.9, then the condition that the restoring force be proportional to the displacement is not well obeyed (consider the Figure 10.10). The component of the bobs weight, Fx is responsible for the back and forth motion of the pendulum and acts as the restoring force, which tries to bring the pendulum back to it equilibrium position at the bottom of its swing. But as we can see in Figure 10.10, the restoring force is not parallel to the displacement of the bob. It dips below the x?axis rather than being along the x?axis, and the restoring force is therefore not proportional to the displacement of the bob. However, if the angle ? is made small enough as in the case of the green bob, then the restoring force will, indeed, be approximately proportional to the displacement, x. Under the conditions stated above, we can set up an approximate proportionality when the angle between the pendulum string and the vertical is small (less than 15 degrees). In Figure 10.11 we assume that mg is almost equal to the tension T in the string. The bob is hanging almost vertically. We can form one triangle composed of the weight mg of the bob and the component of weight Fx and another triangle composed of the displacement x of the bob and the length L of the pendulum. The triangles are almost similar, so mamgx =? Lx . Note that the symbol ?= stands for approximately. Uniform circular motion, which we are approximating, holds near the bottom of the swing of the pendulum, thus ax = 4T?22x. Substituting 4T?22x for ax in the approximate proportionality above and eliminating the mass m, we arrive at 4T?22gx = x L. qL The period of the simple pendulum, T = 2?	g is therefore proportional to the square root of the length of the pendulum. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  a. What is the period of a simple pendulum of length 40.0 cm? Answer: Since L = 40.0 cm ? 0.400 m, the period is T  s b. How long of a string would be necessary for a pendulum with a period of 2.00 s?

Since the gravity on Mars is smaller than on Earth, identical pendulums will swing slower on Mars than on Earth.

The answer is A. The mass of the bob has no effect on the period of the pendulum. We can see this by looking at the equation for the period of the simple pendulum. There is no dependence on mass in the equation.

Be able to recognize the behavior of waves. diffraction: The bending and stretching of waves. longitudinal wave: Consists of vibrations that are parallel to the wave direction. reflection: The process of light bouncing off boundaries between two media. refraction: The process of light bending. transverse wave: Consists of vibrations that are perpendicular to the wave direction. 
Introduction 	  Energy is an abstract concept, defined as the ability to do work (force times distance), as opposed to more directly measured phenomena such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, and mass. Often, work is being done through wave motion. It is not uncommon to hear about the devastation brought about by a tsunami. Waves transports energy. You may have heard of the devastating effects at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant complex caused by the Tohoku earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Figure 10.12 and Figure 10.13 show some of the remarkable effects of the energy transported by waves. Energy can also be transported by waves during an earthquake. The Richter Scale (invented in 1935 by Charles Richter and Beno Gutenberg) is used to measure the energy released during an earthquake. The waves that carry the energy away from the center of an earthquake are called seismic waves. Seismic waves contain several different kinds of waves. Two in particular are P-waves and S-waves. The links below demonstrate how P-waves and S-waves travel. URL URL A wave from the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami crashing through palm trees in Thailand. The aftermath of a tsunami. 
Longitudinal waves 	  A longitudinal wave consists of vibrations that are parallel to the wave direction. Examples include sound, or an earthquake P-wave. Such a wave is generated by pressing back and forth in the direction that the wave goes. How does a longitudinal wave transport (or propagate) energy? Imagine a long coiled spring stretched out several meters in length. If several coils of the spring are compressed and then released, you will see a pulse move through the spring as in Figure 10.14. If coils are continually compressed and released, a train of compressions and expansions (a set of vibrations, or a wave) will appear to move through the spring. The energy propagating through the spring results in the vibrations of the spring coils. The vibrations cause the coils of the spring to oscillate about their equilibrium positions. It is important to realize that there is no net transfer of mass through the spring. Only energy is transferred. The properties of the spring such as its mass, tension, and force constant will determine at what speed the energy is propagated. In a longitudinal wave the medium (the spring in this case) vibrates parallel to the direction of travel of the wave (v). URL 
Transverse  Waves 	  A transverse wave consists of vibrations that are perpendicular to the wave direction. Examples of transverse waves include cracking a whip, earthquake S-waves, and light (as well as other electromagnetic radiation). How does a transverse wave transport (or propagate) energy? Imagine a long rope held at one end by a person and the other end anchored as shown in Figure 10.15. If the person moves the rope in an up-and-down motion, parts of the rope will move up and down as the energy is propagated along the rope. The motion of each portion of the rope will be perpendicular to the direction of propagation of energy (that is, the direction of the wave). In a transverse wave the medium (the rope in this case) vibrates perpendicular to the direction of wave travel (v). URL Just as in the case of longitudinal waves, there is no net transfer of mass in transverse waves. In the example above, each piece of the rope will vibrate up and down about its equilibrium position as the energy propagates through the rope. Similar to the longitudinal example, the speed with which the energy propagates through the rope depends upon the properties of the rope, for instance, its linear density and tension. 
Waves  Undergo  Reflection 	  It is easy to see that light waves can reflect. That is, they can bounce off the boundaries between the two media, as shown in Figure 10.16. When we look into a mirror, the light travels from our face to the mirror and back to our eyes and the light waves reflect off the mirror. It may not be obvious, but all waves can reflect. Water waves that come up along the shore are partially reflected. Drop a pebble into still water as in Figure 10.17 and youll see the wave eventually reflect. These waves will eventually reflect off the sides of the pond. Sound waves reflect and cause echoes. If you go to a concert, youll notice that there are heavy drapes positioned around the concert hall. The heavy material helps to absorb the sound energy, thus reducing the amount of reflected sound which can negatively affect your listening pleasure! The fact that the drapes can absorb some of the sound energy implies that some of the wave energy can be transmitted to another medium. We will study wave transmission later. 
Waves  Undergo  Refraction 	  To refract means to bend. We usually associate the refraction of a wave with light, as in Figure 10.18, but, again, all waves can refract. It is very fortunate, indeed. If light waves could not be refracted, we could never form images with microscopes or telescopes. Eye glasses could not exist. All of the optical phenomena we associate with lenses would be impossible if light did not refract. We will study refraction and lenses in greater detail later. An interesting phenomenon illustrating the bending of sound involves the temperature difference between a warm road (asphalt) and the cooler air above the road. For our purpose, we state without explanation, that sound travels faster through a warmer medium than through a cooler medium. Those sound waves closer to the road will move faster than those sound waves farther from the road. The sound waves will therefore refract, as shown in Figure 
Waves  Undergo  Diffraction 	  Not only do waves undergo reflection and refraction, but they can also bend around objects and spread through openings, changing their shape and the direction of their motion ( Figure 10.20). The bending and spreading of waves is called diffraction. Its not too difficult to accept that waves are subject to diffraction as they travel around obstacles or through openings. Consider the fact that youre able to hear sound through a small opening even when youre not in line with the opening or that youre able to listen to a conversation two people are having around a corner from you. Light that passes through a small opening can illuminate an entire room. It is more difficult to detect the diffraction of light than that of sound. You might try having a thin object cast a shadow on a very bright day. If you look at the edges of the shadow, you may be able to see that edge is not sharp. The lack of sharpness is due to the light bending about the object. All waves diffract around objects and spread out through any openings available to them as in Figure 10.20. There is a relationship between the size of the opening and the nature of the wave that determines the degree to which the wave spreads that will be discussed later. Notice in the leftmost diagram the possibility of a shadow zone, an area behind the obstacle where the waves are less pronounced. qL (a) Waves transmit energy but not mass. 
Chapter  Outline 	  Waves are periodic motion that induces motion beside it. One model for this is a crowd wave, where you stand up and sit back down when the person beside you does. A similar transfer happens when a rope is snapped or sound emitted. This chapter covers the properties of waves as they move through a physical medium, focusing on sound in particular. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Describe how mechanical waves are transmitted. Explain what is meant by the superposition of waves and interference. Explain and evaluate sound intensity. amplitude: The magnitude of the greatest departure from the equilibrium position or density of the wave disturbance. frequency: The number of times a specified periodic phenomenon occurs within a specified interval. intensity: The intensity of any wave is the time-averaged power it transfers per area through some region of space. superposition: The superposition principle, also known as superposition property, states that, for all linear systems, the net response at a given place and time caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses which would have been caused by each stimulus individually. wave interference: A phenomenon in which two waves superimpose to form a resultant wave of greater or lower amplitude. constructive interference: Occurs when waves are superimposed and form a wave with a larger amplitude than either of the original waves. destructive interference: Occurs when waves are superimposed and form a wave with a smaller amplitude than either of the original waves. wavelength: The distance between one peak or crest of a wave and the next corresponding peak or crest. 
Introduction 	  What is sound? How does sound travel from one location to another? Sound is a wave composed of vibrations. We can feel the vibrations if we put a hand in front of a speaker playing loud music, and we can see the vibrations if we put a cup of water in front of the speaker. If we were to look at sound being produced very slowly, we would see the speaker push forward and compress the air in front of it. This compressed air then presses against the regular air past it, and the compression moves forward as a wave (specifically a longitudinal wave). Like simple harmonic motion, sound waves have a number of basic properties. The Figure 11.1 shows the wavelength and amplitude of a physical wave. We will use such wave representations for both longitudinal and transverse waves. The Greek letter lambda (?) is used to represent wavelength. The wavelength of a wave is the distance between two successive crests or troughs, or, for that matter, any two identical points on the wave. The amplitude, as Figure 11.1 shows, is the maximum distance the wave extends beyond the equilibrium line (0). It is measured either from the equilibrium to the crest or peak (highest point) of the wave, or from equilibrium to the trough (lowest point) of the wave. The distance from crest to trough is twice the amplitude (2A). The maximum is the highest peak above the equilibrium line, occurring at positions 0.50 m and 2.5 m, as shown in Figure 11.1. The minimum is the lowest point below equilibrium, occurring at positions 1.5 m and 3.5 m, in Figure 11.1. The period T, as with simple harmonic motion, is the time required for each vibrating point to complete a full cycle. 
Wave  Interference 	  Waves can interfere with each other so that their resulting amplitude can be either greater or smaller than the amplitude of either wave. If two waves overlap crest on crest and trough on trough, they are said to be completely in phase and the amplitude of the combined wave will be twice that of either wave (A+A = 2A). The same is true if two waves are of different amplitudes. As long as the crest (or trough) of both waves overlap, their combined amplitude will equal the sum of the maximum amplitudes. This is called completely constructive interference, Figure 11.2 A. Conversely, if two identical waves are completely out of phase, their resultant amplitude is zero (A+?A = 0). This is called completely destructive interference, as shown in Figure 11.2 B. Waves may produce various degrees of constructive or destructive interference, as shown in Figure 11.2 C. The process of adding two or more waves together is called superposition. The superposition of two or more waves is the sum of their respective amplitudes at their corresponding x?values. You can experience the effect of the superposition of sound waves if you listen to music from two different sources. Lets use the example of two speakers. If you change your position relative to the speakers, you will notice that there are places where the sound is louder and softer. This effect can be attributed to the distance (called the path length) over which the sound travels from each speaker. When the sound sources are equidistant from the listener, as in Figure 11.3, or a multiple of whole-wavelengths, the superposition of the waves is constructive. But when the path length difference between the waves is a multiple of odd half-lengths (the crest of one wave overlaps with the trough of the other wave), the superposition of the waves is destructive, as shown in Figure 11.4. We associate the volume of the sound with the amplitude of the resultant wave. The larger the amplitude, the louder the sound. URL URL a. What is the maximum amplitude of their superposition? Answer: The positive sum of their amplitudes is 4.0 cm+3.0 cm = 7.0 cm. b. What is the minimum amplitude of their superposition? Answer: The absolute value of their difference 4.0 cm?3.0 cm or |3.0 cm?4.0 cm|= 1.0 cm Answer: Correctly employing significant digits, we find that two complete wavelengths of an f-note will fit into the path difference. So the f-notes undergo complete constructive interference. path dif ference	2.0 m =	= 2.04 ? 2.0 wavelengths wavelength	0.98 m 
Beats 	  Another result of wave interference is the phenomenon of beats. When two sound waves have frequencies very close to each other we can hear a wobbling sound of the vibrations of the waves, as represented in Figure 11.5. The maximum amplitude of the green wave (or envelope) corresponds to the maximum sound of the wobble. Essentially, some segments of each wave interfere constructively while others interfere destructively. The wobbling sound mentioned above is louder as the waves interfere constructively. Conversely, the sound is softer as the waves interfere destructively. The frequency with which the sound alternately increases and decreases its volume is called the beat frequency. When tuning forks of frequencies 261 Hz and of 268 Hz are struck, you will hear the characteristic beat frequency. If you have ever listened to someone tune a guitar by striking one string and slowly changing the tension in another string, you may have heard a beat frequency when the two strings were nearly tuned. In fact, hearing the beat frequency is a sign that the tuning is proceeding correctly! The beat frequency is found by subtraction: fbeat = f2 ? f1 ? In the example of the two tuning forks above, the beat frequency is fb = 268 Hz? 261 Hz = 7 Hz. Of course, a beat frequency exists in principle between any two frequencies, but the human ear has difficulty hearing the beat beyond several hertz. Instead, we hear the two frequencies separately.

Sound  Intensity 	  The intensity of a wave is defined as the average power produced by some source (a horn and a light bulb are two examples) divided by the surface area over which the energy is transmitted. The equation for the intensity is: I = WA I represents intensity, W power (the wattage), and A the area over which the energy, in a given amount of time, has spread. Intensity I has units of watts per square meter. Recall that a watt is joule per second, or SJ . Since power is a measure of energy per unit time, the intensity depends upon the rate at which the energy is produced. The intensity is dependent upon the frequency of vibration of the source, as well as the density of the medium. Perhaps the most obvious factor determining the intensity, though, is the amplitude of the source. We stated earlier that the amplitude of a sound is associated with the loudness of that sound. Strike a tuning fork gently and the displacement (the amplitude) of the prongs is small and the sound is soft. Strike the tuning fork harder and the amplitude of the prongs is larger and the sound is increased. We state without proof, for spherical waves, if only the amplitude of a wave varies, than the intensity of a wave is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the energy source. We can understand intuitively that a sound is louder the closer we are to it and softer the farther we are away from it. If a sound source is suspended in midair so that its sound is transmitted equally in all directions, the sound energy will spread out spherically. If the sound source is limited to a short burst, it will die out quickly. The sound is gone. But of course, this is impossible. Once produced, the sound exists forever. But because a finite amount of sound energy spreads over a larger and larger volume of space there is less energy per square meter. As shown in Figure 11.6, after the energy has traveled from R1 to 2R1, the sphere of energy will be spread out over four times the area. The energy passing through each per square meter at 2R1 will have only one-fourth the energy it did after passing point R1. After the energy has traveled a distance from the source three times as great, 3R1, the energy will be spread out over nine times the area. The energy passing through each square meter will have only one-ninth the energy it did after passing point R1. The energy continues to spread until the amount of energy passing through each per square meter is too small to be detected by the human ear. a.	How far would a third person need to be from the conversation in order not to hear any sound from the conversation? Answer: An intensity of 10?6 mW2 is one-million times greater than an intensity of 10?12 mW2 since one million. If the intensity diminished as 1r , we would need to be one million times farther away or one million meters away. But the intensity diminishes as r12 so r2 = 106 ? r = 103 or a factor of one thousand ? (1 m)103 = This is a rather astounding result. A third person one kilometer away will be on the verge of still hearing sound emanating from the conversation. If a person is any farther away, no sound is detectible. It must be understood that this is possible under very controlled conditions with no other distracting or overwhelming sounds and that our answer, in the real life, is considerably less. The human ear is an amazing organ. The lowest intensity sound that we can hear corresponds to a vibration of amplitude 0.3 billionths of a centimeter. Of course, there are a huge number of molecules being displaced by this distance inside the auditory canal. 
Frequency  Range of  Human  Hearing 	  When we listen to a piece of music we speak of pitch, loudness and quality. We have already said that the loudness of a sound is associated with the amplitude of the wave. Pitch is associated with the frequency of the sound, or the number of cycles per second of the vibration. High pitch sounds can be painful and annoyingthink of a finger nail moving across a chalk board. The human ear is responsive to a frequency range of about 20 Hz 20,000 Hz (20 Kilohertz = 20 kHz). Most people cannot hear at the very low end or the very high end of this range. Most human speech occupies the range between 500Hz 5000 Hz. Consonant sounds are most important in distinguishing one word from another. In the English language, distinguishing words like slides and flies can be challenging to the hard-of-hearing. The s-sound in English is a high-frequency sound, about 10 kHz. Its also the sound we associate with electrical static. People who become hard-of-hearing usually lose the ability to hear well at higher frequencies and many s-sounds are either lost or misheard. The ear can also distinguish between the sounds that have the same frequency and intensity. For example, most people can tell the difference between a c-note played on two different musical instruments. This is called the quality or timbre of the sound. This is a result of resonance, which will be discussed later. 
Frequencies  Beyond  Human  Hearing 	  Modern technology has found ways of using sounds that the human ear is incapable of hearing. You may be familiar with the term sonar, which stands for "sound navigation and ranging." Sonar uses ultrasonic sound (sound waves beyond human hearing) ranging infrequencies of 20 kHz to 100 kHz. Sonar has been used extensively in the military in dealing with submarine warfare, see Figure 11.7. Sonar signals can detect submarines and determine their location. Since the velocity of sound in water is known, half of the round-trip time of travel of the signal is the distance to the submarine. Sonar is also used in mapping the ocean bottom, commercial fishing, determining the extent of icebergs under water, and mapping geologic strata. Higher frequency ultrasonic waves are used in medicine. Figure 11.8 shows an ultrasound of a baby. 
Objective 	  The student will: Solve problems involving wavelength, wave speed, and frequency. wave equation: Relates wavelength and wave speed. Distance is speed times time, x = vt, so wavelength is wave speed times period ? = vT. wave speed: How quickly the peak of each wave is moving forward. 
The  Wave  Equation 	  Simple harmonic motion, moving back and forth in place, has amplitude along with period and frequency. Wave motion means that the back-and-forth change is also moving through space. This means that there are two further qualities of a wave. The wavelength is the distance between two compressions in the direction of motion of the wave, and is represented by the Greek letter lambda, ?. For an ocean wave, it would be the distance in meters from the top of one wave to the next. The wave speed is how quickly the peak of each wave is moving forward, and is represented by v (for velocity, although for our current purpose the direction is not important). These two are related by the period T of the wave. The period is the time it takes for a wave to complete one cycle, which is the time it takes for a peak to move forward one wavelength. The wave equation expresses this. Distance is speed times time, x = vt, so wavelength is wave speed times period ? = vT. This can alternately be expressed in terms of frequency. Suppose there are three waves every second. This is frequency f = 3.0 Hz, equivalent to period T =s. This means that during one second, three waves come out from the source. Since each peak is one wavelength, ?, ahead of the other, this means that during that one second, the lead wave has gone ahead three wavelengths. The distance the wave goes in one second is the wave speed. So, the wave speed is equal to the frequency times the wavelength, v = ?f . Because f , these are mathematically the same: f The wave equation says distance wavelength is equal to wave speed multiplied by period T. URL 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  a. The ripple tank arm in Figure 11.9 has a period of 0.25 s and the length of the arrow in the figure is 3.76 cm. What is the wavelength of the water waves if the picture is to scale? Answer: There are four wavelengths from the start to the end of the arrow. Wavelength is:	94cm b. What is the velocity of the wave? Answer: Since the period is T = 0.25 s, the frequency is , f 0 Hz or four cycles per second. So the velocity is v = ?f = (0.94 cm)(4.0 Hz) = 3.76 cms . 
Answer: v  m/s 	  This result is true for any electromagnetic radiation traveling in a vacuum, including visible light. Answer: Well assume that the velocity of light vL = 3.0  108 ms is approximately the same through the air as it is through a vacuum. Number 1 above gave the velocity of sound for a temperature of 20?C as vs = 343.0ms . Answer: VVLs = 874,635.57 ? 8.7105. The velocity of light is indeed a good deal greater than the velocity of sound in air. In fact, the velocity of light in vacuum is the greatest velocity that exists. No material object can travel at this velocity! We will discuss these ideas in Chapter 22 (The Special Theory of Relativity). Answer: Well assume that the sound travels at a velocity of 343 m/s.	In seven seconds the sound has traveled x	s	. Answer: The time for the signal to reach the sub is half of the total time of travel, s. Using x  m or 3.2 km. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand the conditions for resonance. Solve problems with strings and pipes using the condition for resonance. beat frequency natural frequency: The frequency at which a system vibrates normally when given energy without outside interference. resonance: Timing force to be the same as natural frequency. sympathetic vibrations 
Introduction 	  Many systems have a tendency to vibrate. When the forced vibration frequency is the same as the natural frequency, the amplitude of vibration can increase tremendously. A well-known example of this situation is pushing a person on a swing, Figure 11.10. We know from study of simple pendulums that without being pushed, the person in the swing rocks back and forth with a frequency that depends on gravity and the length of the chain. f	Lg This is one example of a natural frequency the frequency at which a system vibrates normally when given energy without outside interference. Pushing on the person in the swing will affect the amplitude of the swinging. This is called forced vibration when a periodic force from one object (the person pushing) affects the vibration of another object (the person swinging). To get the most effect, the person pushing will start just at the very back of the swing. In other words, the frequency of how often they push is exactly the same as the frequency of the swing. Suppose they do not push at the right time, but instead push at some other frequency. That would mean that sometimes they are pushing forward when the swing is still going backward. In that case, the swing would slow down i.e. the amplitude of the swing will be reduced. Timing the pushes to be the same as the natural frequency is called resonance. For this reason, the natural frequency is also known as the resonant frequency. If the pushes are timed just right, then even if each individual push is small, the vibration will get larger with each push. A classic example of an unfortunate consequence of a forced vibration at resonant frequency is what happened to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, in 1940. See the link below. URL In Figure 11.11, the bridge is beginning to resonate, in part, due to the frequency of vibration of the wind gusts. In Figure 11.12, we see that the bridge is no longer able to respond elastically to the tremendous amplitude of vibration from the forced vibration of wind energy (at its resonant frequency), and it is torn apart. Modern bridges are built to avoid this effect, but through history there are a number of documented situations where a forced vibration at resonance had dire results. The Broughton Suspension Bridge (1831) and the Angers Bridge (1850) are two examples of bridges believed to have collapsed due to the effect of soldiers marching at a regular pace that caused resonance. The Albert Bridge in West London, England has been nicknamed The Trembling Lady because it has been set into resonance so often by marching soldiers. Though soldiers no longer march across the bridge, there still remains a sign of concern as shown in Figure 11.13. 
Sympathetic  Vibrations 	  There is a typical classroom physics demonstration where one tuning fork is set into motion and an identical tuning fork, if placed closed enough, will also be set vibrating, though with smaller amplitude. The same effect occurs when tuning a guitar. One string is plucked and another, whose length is shortened by holding it down some distance from the neck of the guitar, will also be set into vibration. When this condition is met, both strings are vibrating with the same frequency. We call this phenomenon sympathetic vibration. URL In Figure 11.14, a set of pendulums are fixed to a horizontal bar that can be easily jostled. Pendulums A and E have the same length. If one of them is set swinging, the horizontal bar will be forced into moving with a period equal to that of the pendulum, which, in turn, will cause the other pendulum of the same length to begin swinging. Any pendulum that is close in length to pendulums A and E, for example, pendulum D, will also begin to swing. Pendulum D will swing with smaller amplitude than pendulums A and E since its resonant frequency is not quite the same as pendulums A and E. Pendulums with lengths dramatically different from pendulums A and E will hardly move at all. You can try a similar demonstration out yourself with the following simulation: URL Resonance is a very common phenomenon, especially with sound. The length of any instrument is related to what note it plays. If you blow into the top of a bottle, for example, the note will vary depending on the height of air in the bottle. This plays an important role in human voice generation. The length of the human vocal tube is between 17 cm and 18 cm. The typical frequencies of human speech are in the range of 100 Hz to 5000 Hz. By using the muscles in their throat, singers change the note they sing. A dramatic example of this is breaking glass with the human voice. By singing at exactly the resonant frequency of a delicate wine glass, the glass will resonate with the note and shatter. URL The resonance of sound is also a mechanical analogue to how a radio set receives a signal. The Figure 11.16 shows one of the earliest radio designs, called a crystal radio because the element which detected the radio waves was a crystalline mineral such as galena. In modern times, the air is filled with all manner of radio waves. In order to listen to your favorite radio station, you must tune your radio to resonate with only the frequency of the radio station. When you hear the tuning number of a radio station, such as 101.3 FM, that is the measure in megahertz, 101.3 MHz = 1.013108 Hz. The coiled wire (called an inductor) and the capacitor in Figure 11.16 act together to tune in a specific radio station. Effectively, the capacitor and inductor act analogously to a pendulum of a specific length that will only respond to vibrations of another pendulum of the same length. So when tuned, only a specific radio frequency will cause resonance in the radio antenna. 
Strings  Fixed at  Both  Ends 	  A case of natural frequency that you can observe plainly is when you pluck a string or stretched rubber band. Normally, the string will vibrate at a single widest point in the middle. This is called the fundamental or first harmonic resonance of the string. This is the same as the natural frequency of a simple pendulum or mass on a spring. Because it vibrates all along its length, though, the string also lets us see further patterns of resonance. By vibrating the end of the string rather than just plucking it, we can force vibration at frequencies other than the first harmonic. When the string is set into vibration, energy will travel down the string and reflect back toward the end where the waves are being generated. This steady pattern of vibration is called a standing wave. The points where the reflecting waves interfere destructively with the generated waves are called nodes. The points where the reflecting waves interfere constructively with the generated waves are called anti-nodes. If you compare the wave shape of the first harmonic to the wave shape of Figure 11.17, it will be apparent that the first harmonic contains one-half of a wavelength, ?. Therefore L, the length of the unstretched string, is equal to one-half the wavelength, which is . The second harmonic contains an entire wavelength  L as shown in Figure 11.18. And the third harmonic contains one and one-half wavelengths . If the pattern continues then the fourth harmonic will have a wavelength of L. Looking at the expressions for the length of the string in terms of the wavelength, a simple pattern emerges: L . We can express the condition for standing waves (and of resonance, as well) as L = n2?n or L, where L is the length of string and n = 1,2,3.... Answer: There are three nodes and two anti-nodes. 
Strings  Fixed at  One  End and  Opened at  One  End 	  A string fixed at one only end displays a different standing wave pattern. In this case, the unbounded end of a string of length L is an antinode. The fundamental mode (the first harmonic) for the length L of string contains only one-fourth of a wavelength as shown in Figure 11.20. Therefore L, the length of the unstretched string, is equal to one-quarter the wavelength, which is . The second harmonic contains three-quarters of a wavelength L as shown in Figure 11.21. The third harmonic contains five-fourths of a wavelength L as shown in Figure 11.22. If the pattern continues, then the fourth harmonic will have a wavelength of L. Looking at the expressions for the length of the string in terms of the wavelength, a simple pattern emerges . We can express the condition for resonance as L = n4?n or ?n = 4nL, where L is the length of string and n = 1,3,5.... As long as the tension in the string remains fixed, the velocity of the wave along the string remains constant. Does it seem reasonable that a sagging string will not support the same wave velocity as a taut string? Since v = ?f product ?f is constant as long as the wave velocity remains constant. Therefore, for a string vibrating in many different modes, we have v = ?1 f1 = ?2 f2 = ?3 f3 .... 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  Answer: We know that ?n = 2nL and v = ?f . Combining, we have v  2nLv. But v can be expressed v = ?1 f1 = 2Lf1 and substituted into fn = 2nLv, giving fn  nf1 
Answer:  Since 	  fn = nf1 ? 2(261 Hz) = 522 Hz fn = nf1 ? 3(261 Hz) = 783 Hz All whole number multiples of the first harmonic (the fundamental) are called harmonics. String instruments, as well as non-string instruments, can actually vibrate with many different frequencies simultaneously (called modes). For example, a string may vibrate with frequencies 261 Hz, 522 Hz and 783 Hz simultaneously. One of attributes of the quality or timbre of musical instruments depends upon the combination of the various overtones produced by the instrument. Answer: Yes, it is. The tuning fork may be producing harmonics, in which case the student may be hearing frequencies in multiples of 512 Hz, such as 1,024 Hz and 1,536 Hz. Answer: v = ?f but f = 3 f1 = 3(220 Hz) = 660 Hz, so ? = 0.60 m v = (660 Hz)(0.60 m) = 396 m/s . 
Open and  Closed  Pipes and  Tubes 	  In our discussions of pipes, the length of the pipe will be assumed to be much greater than the diameter of the pipe. An open pipe, as the name implies, has both ends open. Though open pipes have antinodes at their ends, the resonant conditions for standing waves in an open pipe are the same as for a string fixed at both ends. Thus for an open pipe we have: for n n, or ?n = 2nL. There is a simple experiment your instructor may have you do in class that demonstrates resonance in an open tube. Roll two sheets of long paper into two separate tubes and use a small amount of tape to keep them rolled. Have the diameter of one tube just small enough to fit inside the other tube so the inside tube can freely slide back and forth. Hold a struck tuning fork (your instructor will make sure the frequency is adequate) close to the end of the outer tube while the inside tube is moved slowly. When the total length of the tubes is the proper length to establish resonance, youll hear a noticeable increase in the volume of the sound. At this moment, there are standing waves present in the tubes. A closed pipe is closed at only one end. Closed pipes have the same standing wave patterns as a string fixed at one end and unbound at the other end. They therefore have the same resonant conditions as a string fixed at only one end, for n n or ?n = 4nL. A closed pipe supporting the first harmonic (the fundamental frequency) will fit one-fourth of the wavelength, the second harmonic will fit three-fourths, and so on, as shown in Figure 11.23. Compare these pictures to those in the figures above for a string fixed at only one end A standard physics laboratory experiment is to find the velocity of sound by using a tuning fork that vibrates over a closed pipe as shown in Figure 11.24. The water level in a pipe is slowly changed until the first harmonic is heard. URL 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  Resonance is established in a hollow tube similar to that shown in Figure 11.24 with a tuning fork of 512 Hz. The distance from the tube opening to the water level is 16.8 cm. a. What is the velocity of sound according to this experiment? Answer: The wave velocity equation is v = ?f . One-fourth of the wave occupies the length of the tube for the first harmonic. So the wavelength of the resonant wave must be four times the length of the hollow tube. That is, ?1 = 4L = 416.8 cm = 67.2 cm = 0.672 m v = (0.672 m)(512 Hz) = 344 m/s b. The velocity of sound changes with temperature as given by the formula v = 330+0.6T, where T is the temperature in degrees centigrade. Using the result of part A, determine the temperature at the location the experiment was conducted. Answer: We simply set the result of part A equal to the given equation:

Introduction 	  Have you ever heard a car honking its horn or ambulance blaring its siren as it zooms past you at high speed? It has a distinctive sound, like eerrrrrrrroooooooom. It is not just that the sound gets louder, but it changes pitch, as well. In other words, it changes in both amplitude and frequency. The sound is illustrated in the video below: The car horn distinctly sounds like it has a higher pitch as it is getting closer, and a lower pitch as it goes away. Why does this happen? 
Moving  Source,  Stationary  Observer 	  Sound is a vibration that travels through the air. Once the sound leaves the car, it travels at its normal wave speed through the air, regardless of how the car is moving. So if the car is moving quickly, it is catching up to the sound waves that it is sending forwards. This means that the wavelength is effectively shorter by exactly how far the car moves over one period. When the car passes the observer and is moving away, then the car is moving away from the sound waves it sends out, so the wavelength is longer. See Figure 11.25. When the wavelength is shorter, as seen to the right in the Figure 11.25, the waves arrive together more frequently. The higher frequency means a higher note or pitch, When the waves are farther apart, as in the left of the Figure 11.25, the waves arrive less frequently. Frequency decreases, meaning a lower note or pitch. This matches what we know from the wave equation: v v = ?f	? ? = f Double the frequency means half the wavelength, and vice versa. The pitch sounds high as the car approaches, and low after it goes past. Using this, we can figure out exactly what the change is. When the car is going away, the wavelength is longer by exactly how far the car moves during the time of one period, T = 1f . As before, we will call the wave speed v The car is the source of the wave, so its velocity is labeled vs for velocity of the source. Then the effectively longer wavelength ?0 (called lambda prime) is: v+vs ?	? f	f	f This can alternately be expressed by what the effective new frequency f 0 is compared to the original frequency f . f = ?0	v+vs	= f v+vs The denominator here is larger, so this longer wavelength means a smaller frequency. It will be heard as a lower pitch or note. If the car is approaching us, then the new wavelength is shorter by the same amount. We can use the same equation, but put in a negative value for the velocity of the source vs. Positive vs is the source moving away for longer wavelength. Negative vs is the source moving closer for shorter wavelength. 
Moving  Observer,  Stationary  Source 	  A similar effect is true if you are in a car going past a source of sound. There is a small but important difference, though, because we assume that the air is stationary and the sound moves at a fixed speed through the air. Therefore, the actual wavelength of the sound in the air is the same. The difference is that as we move toward the source, we move past more waves per second. So the wavelength is unchanged, but the effective wave speed is different. In this case, the car is the receiver of the sound rather than the source, so we will call the cars speed vr for velocity of the receiver. If the car is heading toward the source, then the waves are effectively moving faster. v0 = v+v	?	f 0	v0	v+vr r The effect is similar. Moving toward the source means that there is a higher frequency, so a higher pitch or note. As before, the opposite is true if the car is moving away from the source. Because the car is moving away, the waves have to catch up to the car, so their effective speed is slower. We can represent this by putting in a negative number for vr in the equation above. Positive vr is the receiver moving toward the source for faster effective wave speed Negative vr is the receiver moving away from the source for slower effective wave speed 
Source and  Observer in  Motion 	  Now let us consider if we are in a car that is chasing after an ambulance. In this case, the source of sound is moving away with velocity vs, making a longer wavelength. The receiver is moving toward the sound with velocity vr, making an effectively higher wave speed. f = ?0 = ?+vsT = vT +vsT	T	v+vs	v+vs Here both the velocity of the source and the velocity of the receiver are defined as before. URL a. The siren of an ambulance produces a sound of frequency 700 Hz. If the ambulance approaches a person standingby the road with a velocity of 31.0 m/s, what is the frequency heard by the person? Take the velocity of sound to be v = 343 m/s. Answer: The ambulance is the source of the sound moving towards a stationary receiver. The source moving toward is an effectively shorter wavelength, so negative vs. f 0 = f 	 770 Hz v+vs 343 m/s+(?31 m/s) b. The ambulance passes the person standing. The siren of an ambulance produces a sound of 700 Hz as it moves away from a stationary receiver with a velocity of 31 m/s. What is the frequency perceived by the observer? Answer: The source is moving away for an effectively longer wavelength, so vs is positive. f 0 = f 	642 Hz v+vs 343 m/s+31.0 m/s c. The ambulance is now stopped by the side of the road still blaring its siren at 700 Hz, and a driver is approachingthe ambulance at a velocity of 31 m/s. What frequency does the car driver hear? Answer: The receiver is moving toward the source for an effectively higher wave speed, so vr is positive. f		 = 763 Hz d. The car has now passed the stopped ambulance, and is moving away from the ambulance at 31 m/s. What frequency does the driver hear? Answer: The receiver is moving away from the sound, so effective wave speed is smaller and the velocity of the receiver vr is negative. f		637 Hz f 0 = A source moving at vs changes the wavelength. The source moving away stretches out the wavelength, giving positive vs. A receiver moving at vr changes the effective wave speed. The receiver moving towards the source makes the waves arrive faster, giving positive vr. 
Fluid  Mechanics 	  Fluid dynamics is the study of how liquids act. Instead of working with distinct objects, we must look at how the fluid behaves as a unit including pressure, density, and motion. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand density and be able to solve problems with density. Understand pressure and be able to solve problems with pressure. density: The ratio of an objects mass divided by its volume. pressure: Force per unit area. 
Introduction 	  In the language of physics, density is defined as the ratio of the mass of an object (or a material) m divided by the volume V. It is represented by the Greek letter rho written ? and pronounced row . m ? = 
 	  This is different than in everyday English, where we tend to use dense only to describe heavy or thick objects. In physics, a massive object may have a small density, and a very light object may have a large density, depending on volume. For example, an empty aluminum soft drink can is very light compared to a full one. However, aluminum is 2.7 times denser than water. The typical mass of an empty soda can is about 15 grams, but the soft drink in it has a mass of about 336 grams. So, a small amount of a denser material can easily have a smaller mass than a large amount of a less dense material. The typical units for density are kilograms per meter cubed kg/m3 or grams per centimeter cubed g/cm3. In the language of physics, pressure is defined as force per unit area. F P = 
 	  This is also different than in everyday English, where we often use pressure to mean the same as force (i.e. he was pressured to sign is like he was forced to sign). The SI unit of pressure is called the pascal, abbreviated Pa and defined as one Newton per square meter, mN2 . It is named after the French mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), pictured in the Figure 12.1. We will use both N2 and Pa in this text, but they have exactly the m same meaning, so 1 N2 = 1 Pa. m 
Density and  Specific  Gravity 	  Measured in these grams per cubic centimeter, density is the same as specific gravity, defined as the ratio of the objects density to the density of water. The density of water (at 4.0?C) is ? water = cm3 =	m3 So, the specific gravity of water is 1.00, and the specific gravity of aluminum is 2.7. There are no units for specific gravity, because it is defined as the ratio of one density to another. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  a. A United States 25-cent coin (a quarter) is composed of copper sandwiched between two coatings of nickel, Figure 12.2. The copper in a quarter occupies a volume of 5.84 cm3 and has a mass of 5.198 g. What is the density of copper? Answer: m 5.198 g	3 ? copper = V = 0. 3 = 8.90g/cm 584 cm . b. What is the specific gravity of copper? Answer: United States quarter seen on edge. density of material	8.90 g/cm3 sg =	=	= 8.90 density of water	1.00 g/cm3 Answer: m 0.4723 g	3 ? copper = V = 0.0530 cm3 = 8.91 g/cm The densities of copper and nickel are almost the same (see Example 1). Does this surprise you? By comparison, the density of silver is 10.5 g/cm3, and the density of gold is 19.3 g/cm3. 
Total value of nickel  cents 	  Total value = 4.394 cents+0.8941 cents = 5.288 cents. This is not too surprising when you consider that it takes the same amount of paper to print a one-dollar bill as it does a 100 dollar bill! Answer: 7.8 g/cm3. Do you see why this is so? Try the link below! URL 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  Lets consider the crate in Figure 12.3. The crate has a weight of 1500 N and it is initially placed on the ground. The area of the crate that rests upon the ground is 0.750 m2. The pressure on the crate (and the ground under the crate) is P . If the crate is now turned on its narrow side, Figure 12.4, the area which rests upon the ground is 0.40 m2 and the pressure is P mN2 A woman of weight 540 N stands on the floor. The area of the bottom of each of her feet is 0.0135 m2. What is the pressure on each of her feet? 
Answer:  Each foot supports half of her weight, so 	  . Does the answer seem rather large to you? Remember, the answer is given in units of N2 . A square meter is a large m area when compared to the area of a persons foot. In Newtons per square centimeter, the answer is 2.00 N2 . cm 
Hydrostatic  Pressure 	  Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure produced by a fluid under gravity when at equilibrium. Under hydrostatics pressure, a fluid remains motionless. For example, a vertical column of water confined behind a dam experiences hydrostatic pressure. Try this simple experiment! Poke a hole near the bottom of an empty soft drink can and another hole in the center of the can. Fill the can with water and water will flow out of each hole. But will the flow out of each hole have the same horizontal extent? No. The flow will resemble what we see in Figure 12.6. Water will flow out of the bottom hole at a greater pressure (and velocity) than the top hole. The reason for this and the reason why dams are reinforced more at their base is hydrostatic pressure. Pressure increases with depth. Consider the pressure at the bottom of each cube. Using the definition of density, we can rewrite the mass m in terms of the volume V and density ? as m = ?V. The volume of each cube is d3 and the area of the any side of the cube is d2. Substituting m = ?V = ?d3 and d2 for A in each pressure equation we have P1 = FA = ?dd32 g;P2 = FA = 2?dd23 g;P A d gd;P2 = 2?gd;P3 = 3?gd. In each case, d,2d,3d represent the depth of the water as measured from the top of the column where P0 = 0. We can replace d,2d,3d with ?h, where ?h represents the height difference in any two positions along the column. We can then express the corresponding difference in pressure as P2 ?P1 = ?P = ?g?h. If we arbitrarily set P1 = 0, we can write P = ?gh. The pressure depends on the density and height (or depth) of the column of fluid. We will always assume that g is constant. If the density is constant, the pressure varies only with the height h. Follow the link below for a demonstration. URL a. What is the average pressure at the bottom of the lake? Answer: 
P  m N2 	  b. A tall thin tank of water has dimensions of radius 30 cm and height 4.5 m. Compare the pressure at the bottom of the tank to the average pressure at the bottom of Lake Pontchartrain. Answer: The pressure at the bottom of the tank is greater. No calculation is necessary since the depth of the water tank is greater than the depth of Lake Pontchartrain. Remember that pressure gives force per unit area (how much force a given area experiences). The fact that Lake Pontchartrain has 6.4 billion cubic meters of water compared to the 1.3 cubic meters of water in the tank is irrelevant. The question to consider is: How much force does each square meter at the bottom of Lake Pontchartrain experience? 
Illustrative  Example 3 	  A campsite has an open water storage tank whose bottom is elevated 3.00 m above a water faucet.The depth of water in the tank is 1.25 meters. a. Determine the water pressure at the bottom of the tank. See Figure 12.9. Answer: 
Since the water depth in the tank is 1.25 m 	  P2	m	s	mN2 , b. Determine the water pressure at the faucet. Answer; The hose that runs between the water tank and the faucet has a vertical displacement of 3.00 m. The pressure at the faucet is therefore no different than the pressure 4.25 m directly beneath the water level of the tank. (Imagine the hose extending to the water level of the tank as in Figure 12.10.) The total elevation from the water surface to the faucet is 1.25 m+3.00 m = 4.25 m. The pressure at the faucet is difference in pressure P2 ? P1.	We set P1 = 0 since h = 0.00 m and P2 = ?gh = 
Objectives 	  The student will know: How atmospheric pressure is measured. How gauge pressure is defined. atmospheric pressure: The pressure from the Earths atmosphere. barometer: The oldest design for scientifically measuring pressure. gauge pressure: The pressure above the current atmospheric pressure. 
Introduction 	  We live at the bottom of an immense ocean of air. The air high up is pulled down by gravity, pressing on the air below it, which also presses on the air below it. The weight of all the air above above you combines to exert atmospheric pressure, the pressure from the Earths atmosphere. This constantly presses on all sides of things in contact with open air, and is what makes suction cups stick to walls, lets vacuum cleaners suck up dirt, and lets people drink through straws. At sea level such as a coastal city like New Orleans or New York, the typical atmospheric pressure is 101,325 pascals the equivalent of a three-story high (10.3 meter) column of water. This is also known as one standard atmosphere of pressure, abbreviated 1 atm. m2 Calculating pressure from gas is different than pressure from fluids, because gases change their density easily. The Earths atmosphere is denser close to sea level, and gets less dense the higher you go. Thus, there is no simple relationship between the height of air and pressure. Indeed, the actual pressure at sea level often changes with the location, climate, and current weather. Human beings can detect the differences in air pressure when our altitude changes a few hundred feet. This is most noticeable when your ears pop when driving up or down a mountain, or taking a plane flight. The oldest design for scientifically measuring pressure is the barometer, invented in 1643. The main part of it is just a glass tube closed at one end and open on the other, filled with liquid and put open side down in a dish. The closed end can hold liquid up, just like when you put your finger on the end of a straw, it lets you hold water in the straw. The open end has full atmospheric pressure pressing on it, while the sealed side has no pressure. The Figure 12.11 shows a mercury-filled barometer. If the tube is filled with mercury and has no air, then the atmospheric pressure pushes on the top of the dish, lifting up the mercury in the tube that has no air pushing down on it from above. All suction works this way it is really atmospheric pressure pushing, rather than the vacuum pulling. The mercury is stable when the atmospheric pressure on the mercury in the dish is equal to the hydrostatic pressure which the column of mercury exerts at the bottom of the tube. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  We can calculate the height of mercury lifted up by one standard atmosphere of pressure, Patm. Mercury has a density of ? = 13.6103 kg/m3. So, if the hydrostatic pressure from this mercury is equal to Patm, we have: . So the pressure of one standard atmosphere hold a column of mercury with a height of 0.76 meters. As the atmospheric pressure changes, the height of the column of mercury changes. In the above experiment, if water had been used rather than mercury what would the height of the column of water have been? Answer: Mercury is 13.6 times denser than water. So the atmosphere can support a column of water 13.6 times higher than a column of mercury. Height of water column: (0.76 m)(13.6) = 10.34 ? 10.3 m A column of water 10.3 m high has the same weight as a column of mercury 0.76 m. Mercury barometers are therefore much more practical than water barometers. 
Gauge  Pressure 	  In practice, most examples of pressure happen inside atmospheric pressure. When a faucet pushes out water, that water is pressing out against atmospheric pressure. The gauge pressure is the pressure above the current atmospheric pressure. For example, a completely deflated tire still has pressure on it. Atmospheric pressure is pushing on both the inside and outside of the tire. What matters is how much additional pressure we put in when the tire is inflated. When dealing with liquids, we typically refer to the pressure P = ?gh as the gauge pressure Pg. The total pressure Pt is therefore Pt = Patm +Pg = Patm +?gh. Answer: Atmospheric pressure is 101,325 Newtons per square meter. To convert, we use: 
Patm = 101,325 m2 	4.45  N		in2 	  lbs	lbs	lbs Pt = Patm +Pg = 14.7	2 +32	2 = 46.7	2 in	in	in . of 1.0 atm.

Objective 	  The student will: Understand and be able to solve problems using Pascals Principle. Pascals Law: Increasing the pressure of fluid anywhere in a system increases the pressure everywhere in the system. 
Introduction 	  Pressure is defined as force divided by area, but this does not explain in itself how pressure transfers. Blaise Pascal, after whom the metric unit of pressure is named, also clarified a useful physical principle that is now named after him. Pascals Law states that any confined incompressible fluid under pressure will transmit pressure equally throughout the system. In other words, increasing the pressure of the fluid anywhere increases the pressure everywhere. If you have ever been to an auto repair shop, youve probably seen cars raised high enough above the ground so that the mechanics can perform their repairs. The device that raises the car is called a hydraulic lift ( Figure 12.12). A hydraulic lift can create a very large force to lift the car with only a small force. How does it work? The diagram in the Figure 12.12 shows a cross-section of a hydraulic lift with square pistons. The pressure applied at the narrow piston of surface A is transmitted to the bottom of the wide piston of surface area A0 = 9A. If, for example, the pressure is P at the narrow piston is 1000 mN2 , the bottom of the wide piston will have the same pressure applied to it, but over nine times the area. The total force on the wide piston will be nine times greater, for a total of F0 = PA0 = P(9A) = 9000 N. The force is multiplied in proportion to the ratio AAnarrowwide . More formally, we can write Pnarrow = Pwide ? AFnarrownarrow = AFwidewide ? AAnarrowwide = FFnarrowwide ; it is often the case that narrow is replaced with in and wide is replaced with out. It may seem that we are getting more out of the system than were putting into it. After all, in the example above we only needed to input 1,000 N in order to output 9,000 N. As you may suspect, this is not the case. If we wish to raise the car, work must be done. And energy conservation tells us that we can never get more energy out of a system than we put into a system. In fact, because of friction, we always need to put more energy in than we get out. If we wish to raise a 9,000 Newton car by 10 centimeters, it requires 900 joules of energy. 
W =  Fx = (9,000  N)(0.10 m) = 900  	  Therefore, we will have to move the narrow piston nine times farther than the distance that the wide piston rises. By the Law of Energy Conservation (assuming no energy is transformed into heat by friction): 
Ei =  Ef	?  Winput = Woutput 	  (1,000 N)(0.90 m) = (9,000 N)(0.10 m) URL The input force of a hydraulic lift is 800 Newtons and the output force is 16,000 Newtons. What is the ratio AAoutin ? Answer:

Objectives 	  The student will: Understand buoyancy and how it applies to Archimedes Law. Be able to solve problems using Archimedes Law. buoyancy: The force that pushes upward on an object that is partially or wholly submerged in water. 
Introduction 	  Objects float in water or sink based on their density. Buoyancy is the force that pushes upward on an object that is partially or wholly submerged in water. This happens because the water lower down has higher pressure than the water around the top, so the bottom of the object is pushed up more than the top of the object is pushed down. For an object of irregular shape, calculating the force as pressure times area, F = P  A, could potentially be difficult. However, there is a simple principle for how much force comes from buoyancy, attributed to the ancient Greek engineer and physicist Archimedes (287 BC 212 BC). Archimedes principle states the following: The force of buoyancy on an object immersed in liquid is equal to the weight of liquid displaced by that object. Expressed mathematically, the buoyant force FB is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced, and we know that weight is mg. The mass of the liquid displaced is equal to mass times density, ?V. This gives us: 
B = mg = (?liq V)g 	  This is phrased simply, but can be shown to have many immediate consequences. If an object is more dense than water, then water with equal volume to it has less mass. If so, FB is less than the objects weight, and it will sink. If an object is less dense than water, then water with equal volume to it has more mass. If so, FB is more than the objects weight, and it will float. We can derive this by looking at a case of a simple cube floating upright in the water. The pressure of the water is always P = ?gh, where h is the depth in the water. The cube has area A for all faces. It is pushed down by the pressure on the top, Ftop = PtopA, while is it pushed up by the higher pressure on the bottom, Fbottom = PbottomA. The difference between these is: 
Fbottom ? Ftop =  Pbottom A? Ptop 	  = (?ghbottom)A?(?ghtop)A = ?g (hbottom ?htop)A = ?gV Note that the area of a face times the height of the cube is equal to the volume of the cube V. Show that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Answer: Recall that the density is given by ? = Vm. Substitute Vm for ? into the equation Fb = ?gV. Fb  mg, where m is the mass of the fluid displaced and mg is its weight. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  a. A cube of iron with side length 25.0 cm is submerged in a tank of water with temperature 4?C such that the bottom of the cube is 1.00 m below the surface of the water Figure 12.13. Calculate the buoyant force on the iron cube. Answer: The volume of the cube is V = (0.25 m)3 = 0.015625 ? 0.0156 m3. This is the same volume as the displaced water. Recall that water at a temperature of 4?C has a density of 1,000mkg3 . The buoyant force is therefore Fb = mg . b. What is the minimum force required to hold the cube in equilibrium while it remains in water? The density ofiron is 7,860mkg3 . Answer: We begin with the Free-Body-Diagram of Figure 12.14. As the Free Body-Diagram in Figure 12.14 shows, the normal force equals the difference of the buoyant force and the weight of the cube. ?F = 0 ? FN +Fb ?mg = 0 ? FN = mg?Fb. A force equal to the normal force FN applied to the cube will keep the cube in equilibrium anywhere beneath the water surface. The weight of the iron block is mirong = ?ironVg  N ? FN = mg?Fb = 1,205?153 = 1,052 N. 
Floating  Objects 	  Archimedes principle is no different for objects that are only partially submerged. The weight of the volume of fluid displaced is still equal to the buoyant force. But since the object is in equilibrium while floating, the upward force on the object is the buoyant force. 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  a. The density of yellow pine is 420mkg3 . What volume of water at a temperature of 4?C does a cylindrical log of pine with dimensions r = 15.0 cm and length L = 7.60 m displace in order to float? See Figure 12.15. Answer: The weight of the log mlogg must equal the buoyant force (the weight of displaced water) mwaterg. mlogg = mwaterg ? mlog = mwater ? ?logVlog = ?waterVwater ? ?log 
Vwater =	 Vlog 	  ?water The volume of the log is Vlog = (?r2)L ? (3.14)(0.150 m)2(7.60 m) = 0.5369 m3 ? 0.537 m3. 
Vlog =(0.537 m 	  Vwater = ??waterlog	1000420 mkgmkg33	3) = 0.2255 ? 0.226 m3 The atmosphere is also able to exert a buoyant force, otherwise hot air balloons would not rise. See the link below to learn more. URL True or False: Steel cannot float because it is denser than water. Answer: False. Large ships are usually made of steel and other comparatively dense materials. It is true that a solid block of material with a density greater than water will sink. But if the block is molded into the shape of a boat (hollowed out), it will be able to displace a greater volume of water than when it was a solid block. The result is that the hollowed block will be able to displace a volume of water equal to its weight before sinking. It will float. 
Illustrative  Example 3 	  Lets return to King Hieros problem now that we have an understanding of Archimedes principle. Recall that the king commissioned the goldsmith to craft a crown of gold from a specific amount of gold given to him by the king. The king then became suspicious that the goldsmith had replaced some of the gold with a cheaper metal, perhaps silver. The problem was that the finished crown weighed the same as the gold given to the goldsmith. How could Archimedes determine if the crown was pure gold without damaging it? There is no way of knowing the exact amount of gold given to the goldsmith, nor is this particularly relevant. We seek only a method whereby Archimedes could have made a conclusive statement regarding the honesty of the goldsmith. There are several methods he could have used, none of which require any calculation. The most accurate was given by Galileo, which we will use. To make the problem interesting, well choose a 500 g mass of gold. Furthermore, well assume that the goldsmith kept 20% (100 g) of the gold for himself and replaced it with an equal mass of silver. Note that this method assumes that the volumes of gold and silver are additive. a. Calculate the volume of 100 grams of gold. Gold has a density of 19.3cmg3 . Answer: . cm3 b. Calculate the volume of 100 grams of silver. Silver has a density of 10.5cmg3 . Answer: cm3 cm3 c. What is the volume of 500 g of gold and 400 grams of gold alloyed with 100 grams of silver? Answer: The method below is one of many. 
Volume of 500 grams of gold  cm3 	  Volume of 400 grams of gold + 100 grams of silver =	(400 g)+	(100 g) = 30.244 ? 30.2 cm3 It seems clear the crown has a larger volume than the original volume of the gold given to the goldsmith. If a scale balance in air had the crown on one side and the original amount of gold on the other, it would balance since the weights are equal. But if the balance and its load were submerged in water, the buoyant force on the crown would be greater since it displaces a greater volume of water. And since the buoyant force is greater on the crown, the scale would sense a smaller weight on the side with the crown, and so this side of the scale would rise. It has often been said that Archimedes filled a tank of water to its brim and placed the crown in it. He then either measured the overflow or the amount the water level dropped in the tank compared to when it was full. He repeated the experiment for an identical quantity of gold given to the goldsmith. The problem with this method is that unless the original quantity of gold was substantial, the difference in volume would be difficult to measure. The difference for the problem above is only 4.3 cm3. Galileo reasoned that it would be more accurate to simply see if the scale became unbalanced. See if you can show that the buoyant force on the crown is 1.166 ? 1.17 times greater than the buoyant force on the original volume of gold given the goldsmith. URL 
Objective 	  The student will: Understand Bernoullis principle and be able to discuss its implications. Bernoullis Principle: A key principle connecting velocity and air. At those points in space where the velocity of a fluid is high, the pressure is low. At those points in space where the velocity of a fluid is low, the pressure is high. 
Introduction 	  Flying has always been one of the great goals of human engineering. The key question is, what moves the force upward on an airplane wing? We can measure air speed and show that the shape of a wing makes the air go faster over the top of the wing than below the wing. How does this create lift, though? A key principle connecting velocity and air was expressed by the Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (17001782). Bernoullos Principle states: At those points in space where the velocity of a fluid is high, the pressure is low. At those points in space where the velocity of a fluid is low, the pressure is high. The mathematical equation that Bernoulli derived based on this principle is stated below. Bernoullis Equation: P1 + 12?v12 +?gh1 = P2 + 12?v22 +?gh2 = constant where P is the pressure of the fluid, ? is the density of the fluid, v is the velocity of the fluid, and h is the height of the fluid. Though each term in the equation has units of pressure, Bernoulli derived the equation based on the conservation of energy. The equation is, in fact a statement of the conservation of energy. A demonstration of this principle can be seen with a device called a venture tube, Figure 12.17. Notice in the Figure 12.17 that where the fluid has a greater velocity, the vertical tube as a lower water level. This is the result of a lower internal pressure in the fluid at this point. If you have ever placed your finger partly over the opening of a garden hose, youve probably seen water velocity increase. The water sprays out! In the same way, in Figure 12.17, equal volumes of fluid must flow through the large cross sectional area (A1) and small cross sectional area (A2) of the tube. Therefore, the flow through the A2 must have a greater velocity than the flow A1. The mathematical equation that Bernoulli derived based on this principle is stated below. Bernoullis Equation: P1 + 12?v12 +?gh1 = P2 + 12?v22 +?gh2 = constant URL Car (diagram): URL /skoda-car-by-anonymous-23736 .

Introduction 	  Objects that appear to be motionless with the human eye still have motion inside them. Matter is typically found in three states: solids, liquids, and gases. Solids have their molecules rigidly bound together by electrical forces, but the molecules can still vibrate back and forth in place. Liquids have molecules that touch and attract each other, but can move freely around each other. Gases have almost no electrical attraction between their molecules, and can move freely in any direction. Temperature is a measure of the motion of the molecules of a substance. It is traditionally measured with a thermometer, which uses a liquid that can readily expand and contract in a tube. As the liquid gets hotter, it expands and shows a higher number on the tube. There are two closely related metric units of termperature  degrees Celsius, ?C, and Kelvin, K, as well as the common non-metric unit, degrees Fahrenheit, ?F. 
The  Fahrenheit  Scale 	  The first modern thermometer was invented by Daniel Fahrenheit (1686-1736), shown in the Figure 13.1. The Fahrenheit scale is common in the United States but rarely used elsewhere. The scale was originally based on the range between zero at the temperature of brine (an equal mix of ice, water, and ammonium chloride) and 100 at average human body temperature. The average is closer to 66.6 degrees above freezing (98.6 degrees). Since the freezing and boiling points of water make for good references, they were kept, and the average human body temperature was readjusted. 
The  Celsius  Scale 	  The two metric scales are based on the work of Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, shown in the Figure 13.2. His scale also was defined from zero to 100, but the scale was based on the freezing point and boiling point of water. Zero degrees Celsius, 0?C, is the temperature at which water freezes under standard conditions, and one hundred degrees Celsius, 100?C, is the temperature at which water boils under standard conditions. 
The  Kelvin  Scale 	  The other metric scale was invented later, after it was determined that temperature is based on motion. William Thomson, titled Lord Kelvin (1824 1907), Figure 13.3, was an Irish physicist and engineer who devised a temperature scale that had an absolute zero. Although he did not fully understand the nature of heat, his calculations predicted there was a minimum temperature where the object had absolutely no heat. The lowest temperature (0 ?K) on the Kelvin scale is equal to absolute zero or about -273 ?C on the Celsius scale. The relationship between the two scales is a simple one: If youre given a temperature Tc measured in the Celsius scale of x?C and wish to find the corresponding temperature TK in the Kelvin scale, then:TK = TC K or more simply ? TK = TC +273, where the answer is in units of Kelvin. URL 
Answer:  K =  C +273  K = 20+273 = 293 	  Answer: TK = TC +273 ? TK = ?300+273 = ?27K This answer is impossible. 0 K is the lowest possible temperature. There can be no temperature lower than ?273?C. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Describe the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy. internal energy:The total kinetic and potential energy associated with the motions and relative positions of the molecules of an object, excluding the kinetic or potential energy of the object as a whole. An increase in internal energy results in a rise in temperature or a change in phase. Kinetic Theory: A theory concerning the thermodynamic behavior of matter, especially the relationships among pressure, volume, and temperature in gases. It is based on the dependence of temperature on the kinetic energy of the rapidly moving particles of a substance. According to the theory, energy and momentum are conserved in all collisions between particles, and the average behavior of the particles can be deduced by statistical analysis. 
Introduction 	  James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879) determined a very important relationship between the motion of molecules and temperature within a gas in the mid-19th century. Kinetic Theory relies upon the following assumptions: Under these conditions, a gas is referred to as an ideal gas. When we ask what the temperature is outside, were indirectly asking for a measure of the average kinetic energy of the air molecules. Maxwell was able to show that the relationship between the average kinetic energy of a gas and its temperature is KE =m(vt)2 = kT, where vt is the mean translational velocity of the molecules, m is their mass, k the Boltzmann constant, is equal to 1.3810?23 KJ , and the temperature T is expressed in Kelvin. The equation states that the average translational kinetic energy, KE of the molecules is directly proportional to the temperature T of the gas. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  Determine the average velocity of random motion of an oxygen molecule at 22.0?C. The mass of an oxygen molecule is 5.3610?26kg, and the constant k = 1.3810?23 kgJ . Answer: Recall that the temperature must be expressed in degrees Kelvin. TK = TC +273 ? 22+273 = 295K.

Internal  Energy 	  The temperature of a gas is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles of the gas. But the total kinetic energy of the molecules of a gas is a measure of the internal energy, or thermal energy of the gas. The internal energy U of a gas is, therefore, the product of the number of molecules N of the gas and the average kinetic energy of each molecule: 
U =  	  But according to the kinetic theory, Therefore, the internal energy can be directly related to the temperature of a gas as 
U =  N  Nk 	  The internal energy is, therefore, dependent upon the temperature and the number of particles within a substance. This means that a small quantity of substance at a high temperature may have less internal energy than a large quantity of substance at a low temperature. For example, a boiling pot of water has a higher temperature than a large cool mountain lake. But the internal energy of the lake is considerably larger than the internal energy of the boiling water. Even though the average kinetic energy of the molecules of the lake water is smaller than that of the boiling water, theres a good deal more molecules in the lake. URL 
Objectives 	  The student will: Explain the relationship between heat and energy transfer. Describe how the calorie is a measure of energy. calorie: The amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 C at standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa). This is approximately 4.2 joules. heat: The sum of all the kinetic energies of all the molecules in an object or substance. 
Introduction 	  Heat is yet another common word that has a very specific meaning in physics. We place our hands in front of a fire and speak of heat. We step with bare feet onto a tiled floor in an unheated room during winter and our feet feel cold. We speak of losing heat. Human beings have expressed comfort and discomfort concerning the pleasant and unpleasant effects of heat since the advent of language. But an understanding of the nature of heat was not a simple affair. Even as late as the 18th century it was still not properly understood. For example, it was still commonly accepted that if two objects had the same temperature then they contained the same amount of heat. We know today that this is not true. During the latter half of the 18th century, the idea that heat was a form of matter called caloric became generally accepted. This, too, was proven incorrect. It was not until the 19th century that physicists were finally able to explain the nature of heat. 
Understanding  Heat 	  By the mid-19th century, R.J. Mayer constructed the principle of the conservation of energy. He based his premise on an experiment comparing mechanical energy and heat. Mayers ideas were taken up by James Prescott Joule, whose work was discussed earlier. One of Joules famous experiments involved heating a fluid mechanically, using friction. In Joules experiment, a paddle wheel inside a container of fluid was rotated, resulting in an increase of the fluids temperature. The rise in the temperature of the fluid indicated that the work done in rotating the paddle wheel was equivalent to heating up the fluid (with a flame, for example). Heat could therefore be viewed as a transfer of energy, involving a temperature change. Thus the definition of heat is given as: Energy that is transferred from one object to another object due to a temperature difference between the objects. To restate: When we speak of heat, we do not mean a material substance, nor do we mean a form of energy. Again, by heat we mean a transfer of energy. 
The  Calorie 	  The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius is defined as one calorie, or, as it is sometimes referred to, one small calorie. The calorie is therefore a measure of energy. It is equal to about 4.186 J. Using the definition above, the caloric content of the average banana is 80,000 calories. A more useful unit to measure food calories is called the big calorie, which equals 1000 small calories. Thus, the average banana contains 80 big calories, or 80 food calories. Your doctor recommends an average caloric intake of 2,000 calories per day. How many joules is this? Answer: Since 1 food calorie equals 4186 J: (2000 C)(4186CJ ) = 8,372,000 ? 8.372106 J 
Illustrative  Example 13.1.1 	  a. How long can a 60 W light bulb burn if supplied with 8.372106 J? Answer: 60 W is the same as 60Js . Thus ,a 60 W lightbulb uses 60 J every second. If 8.372  106J are available, then 8.	.	Since there are 86,400 seconds in one day,  days, or close to 39 hours. b. To what height could a 70.0 kg person climb using this much energy? See Figure 13.4 Answer: We know that 2,000 kcal equals 8.372106J. So, 20% of this is 0.208.372106 = 1.674106 J Recall that the net work done by a climber of weight mg over a vertical displacement of ?h is equal to the change in his potential energy: ?PE = mg?h (Assuming the change in his kinetic energy is zero.) Therefore: mg ! Most of the calories (energy) that we consume are used by our bodies even if we do not exercise or otherwise exert ourselves physically. For example, they are used to maintain a constant body temperature and keep our heart pumping. It turns out that about 80% of our caloric intake is used just to keep us alive. The remainder of the energy is used to perform work, such as climbing a flight of stairs, taking a walk, eating, talking, or anything else that requires you to use energy in your daily routine. If you use more than the remaining 20% of the energy youll lose weight, since your body uses your stored fat to make up the difference. On the other hand, if you dont use up the remaining 20%, the excess is converted to fat and youll gain weight. 
Illustrative  Example 13.2.2 	  a. A dieting person decides to eliminate the cream from his coffee. If he typically drinks two cups of coffee per daywith one serving of cream added to each cup, how many calories would be saved over the course of a year? One serving of cream (about 15 grams, or one tablespoon) contains about 20 calories. Answer: b. Assuming the persons metabolic rate remains fixed while dieting, (highly unlikely, actually) what maximum weight loss can be expected? One kilogram of fat contains about 8,800 calories (one pound of fat has about 4000 calories). From part A we know that 14,600 cal were saved, therefore pounds). 
Objectives 	  The student will: Describe how energy is transported through the processes of conduction, convection, and radiation. conduction: The transfer of heat through matter by communication of kinetic energy from particle to particle (molecular collision), with no net displacement of the particles. convection: The transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids, also known as convective heat transfer. heat: The sum of all the kinetic energies of all the molecules in an object or substance. radiation: Energy emitted in the form of electromagnetic waves and covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum, extending from the radio-wave portion of the spectrum through the infrared, visible, ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma-ray portions. 
Introduction 	  Energy can be transferred as heat in three ways: through conduction, convection, and radiation. 
Heat  Conduction 	  Conduction occurs when a temperature difference exists, causing the molecules of an object to transmit energy throughout the object. We usually associate conduction with solids. The atomic structure of a solid is more rigid than a liquid or gas, and thus better able to communicate atomic vibrations caused by heating. Conduction is the transfer of kinetic energy from one molecule to another by molecular collision. Conduction occurs, for example, when a metal spoon is put into a hot cup of tea and the handle of the spoon gets hot. We mentioned above that some of the food energy we consume is used to maintain a constant body temperature. What happens on a hot day when our body temperature is the same as the outside temperature? No energy will be transferred, since the temperatures are equal and therefore well feel uncomfortably warm since we wont be able to shed our heat. In contrast, when it is very cold, the temperature difference between our body and the outside temperature can be considerable and thus energy is transferred (rather quickly, if were not dressed warmly) from our body to the outside environment. We interpret this rapid transfer of energy as feeling cold. On a cold day, an object made of metal typically feels colder to the touch than wood, because energy leaves your hand more quickly when touching metal than wood. We say that metal has a higher conduction rate than wood. For example, for the same temperature difference, the conduction rate of copper is over 3,000 times greater than that of wood. Energy will flow from your hand 3,000 times more quickly if you hold a piece of copper, compared to holding a piece of wood of the same temperature. This means, of course, that you dont want to grab the handle of a copper (or any metal) pot when its being heated on your stove. Heat conduction assures that the energy from the flame under the pot is conducted to the handle of the pot and to your hand should you touch it. Ouch! The relationship between the rate of heat flow (heat conduction) ??Et and the temperature difference ?T is ??Et = kA?tT . The rate of heat flow ??Et , is measured in Js ,k is the thermal conductivity that depends upon the properties of the object, A is the cross-section of the object, and t is distance over which the heat is conducted between the two temperatures ?T = T2 ?T1. Note: Typically when we discuss heat flow, the letter E is replaced with the letter Q. We will use Q in the section on specific heat below. URL 
The  Direction of  Heat  Flow 	  There is a misconception regarding heat flow that we should dispel at this point. Under normally occurring conditions, heat flows only from a hot environment to a cold environment, never in reverse. An open door on a very cold day does not let the cold in. It permits the heat to flow more readily to the outside. On a cold day, even in a warm room, if you put your hand on a window pane inside your home, it will feel cold. The room temperature may be comfortable, but heat is flowing from the inside of the room to the outside through the glass pane. The air close to the glass pane inside the room has a lower temperature than the average temperature of the room because of its proximity to the outside. Conversely, the layer of air on the outside of the window pane has a higher temperature than the air farther from the window. On windy days, this effect is considerably lessened. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  The temperature very near a glass window pane on the inside of a house is measured as 13?C and the temperature on the outside near the window is measured as 10?C. The window has dimensions 1.25 m by 0.90 m. The thickness t of the window is 4 mm, and its thermal conductivity k is 0.80 sJm?C. Find the rate at which energy is transferred from the inside of the room to the outside environment. Answer: Remembering that the area A = (1.25m)(0.90m), and substituting the givens into the equation ??Et = kA?tT we have: This amount of energy transfer is equivalent to seven-and-one-half incandescent 60-W light bulbs. And this is through only one window! Installing energy-efficient windows in your home saves a good amount of money and helps the environment since most people still use fossil fuels to heat their homes. 
Convection 	  Convection typically arises from the movement of gases or liquids over large distances. Convection takes place throughout the Earths atmosphere all the time. Heated air is less dense than cooler air, so it rises. As the air rises, it cools down and becomes denser. The air then falls back to the ground where it is heated again, and the process repeats. A convection cell, which is a circulating pattern of moving energy, is created. The Figure 13.5 shows how the convection cell reverses direction from day to night due to the ground giving off the heat in the evening that it absorbed during daylight hours. Imagine the air that is heated by the asphalt and the concrete within a city rising, cooling, falling back, and being reheated by the asphalt and concrete, over and over again. Many atmospheric conditions are the result of convection. reverses direction at Convection	cell night. In hot climates, convection is used to cool homes. Ducts within the house provide pathways for the warm air to circulate. As the sun goes down and the temperature drops outside, the warmer air in the house flows through the ventilation ducts and to the cooler environment outside. Convection is not restricted to earthly phenomena. The interior region of the sun is in a constant state of convection, which is seen in photographs showing what astronomers call granulation. The granulation represents an innumerable amount of convection cells "boiling to the suns surface. See Figure 13.6 for a diagram of the suns interior and a photograph of the convection cells (granulation). 
Radiation 	  Both conduction and convection rely upon moving matter. Radiation does not. Radiation is energy transferred by electromagnetic waves (or photons). We will say more about radiation when we discuss the electromagnetic spectrum. Energy transferred by radiation from the sun travels millions of kilometers through the vacuum of space before reaching the Earth. Some of this energy is visible radiation (sunlight, for example), while other energy is invisible. Heat radiation is an example of invisible radiation. It belongs to a part of the electromagnetic spectrum below the threshold of human sight. Just as there are sounds we cannot hear, there is light we cannot see. When you sit next to a campfire or a fireplace and feel all warm and cozy, thank radiation! If the only heating we could experience was through convection, we would not be warmed. We would benefit very little from a convection cell up a chimney or directly above a campfire. It is the flow of radiation from the fire that warms us. What form of energy transfer is the most likely cause of sunburn? a. conduction b. convection c. radiation Answer: The answer is C. If its a hot day and you touch any metal on a car, you might suffer a burn. This happens through conduction. If you feel a warm breeze, this is through convection. But sunburn is caused by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. As with infrared radiation, ultraviolet radiation is also invisible. It is, however, just above the threshold of human vision. And just as some animals can hear higher frequency sounds than we can (dogs, for example), other animals can see higher frequencies of light than we can (bees can see ultraviolet light). URL 
Objective 	  The student will: Solve problems involving specific heat. specific heat: The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one Celsius degree. 
Specific  Heat 	  We know that when we heat an object, its temperature increases. But a given quantity of heat will not produce the same temperature change for every object. Recall that it requires 4.186 J of energy to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. It can be determined experimentally that the same 4.186 J, if transferred to one gram of copper, will raise its temperature by 10.7 degrees Celsius. For a given mass, experiments show that the temperature rise due to a fixed amount of energy transfer depends upon the material heated. The specific heat c of a material is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one kilogram of a particular substance by one-degree Celsius. The change in temperature ?T of an object depends upon the amount of mass m of the object being heated, the specific heat c of the material the object is composed of, and the amount of energy ?Q transferred to the object. It can be shown experimentally that: ?T = ?mcQ ? ?Q = mc?T The SI units of specific heat are kg C. The Table 13.1 gives specific heat values for some common materials. TABLE 13.1: 
Substance	 Specific heat  at standard atmospheric pressure 	  and at 20C 
Silver 	  URL One kilogram of the each of the substances in table 13.1.1 has 100 J of energy transferred to it at an initial temperature of 20C. Which substance experiences the largest increase in temperature? Answer: Since silver has the smallest specific heat, it has the largest temperature rise. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  A United States penny, Figure 13.7, is made almost entirely from zinc. The penny has a mass of 2.5 g and an initial temperature 20C. a. Find the temperature increase of the penny if 380 J is transferred to it. Answer: Since the SI units of the specific heat contain kilograms, we must express 2.5 grams in kilograms: . We should expect the temperature to increase to be greater than 1C. T ? b. What is final temperature of the penny? Answer: Since the penny was initially 20C and the change in temperature was 390C, the final temperature of the penny is 410C. This is ten degrees away from its melting temperature. a. Equal amounts of zinc and silver, at the same initial temperature, absorbed the same amounts of heat. For everyone degree increase in the temperature of the zinc, find the increase in the temperature of the silver. Answer: The ratio of the specific heats of zinc to silver is	J	= 1.696 ? 1.70. Therefore, the temperature of the silver will go up by 1.70?C for every 1.00?C increase in temperature of the zinc. b. The temperature of a zinc coin increases from 20.0?C to 25.0?C after absorbing heat. What is the final temperature for a silver coin of the same mass at the same initial temperature which absorbs the same amount of heat? Answer: (5.0?C)(1.696)= 8.48 ? 8.5?C increase in the temperature for the silver. The final temperature is 28.5?C. 
Calorimetry 	  If a system is insulated well for a period of time so that no appreciable energy is transferred beyond the system, we can think of such a system as being nearly isolated. This means for an isolated system composed of two objects with unlike temperatures, the hotter object will transfer energy to the colder object until the temperatures of both objects are identical. Since energy must be conserved, we can find the final temperature of an isolated system. The energy lost by some of the objects must equal the energy gained by other objects. That is, ?Qlost = Qgained,Qlost < 0 The energy lost by the hotter object is equal to the energy received by the colder object. 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  Let us imagine an isolated system consisting of a 30-g block of zinc heated to 300.0?C which is placed into contact with a 30-g block of silver initially at a temperature of 20.0?C. What is the final temperature of the system, after equilibrium is reached? Answer: The energy transferred by the zinc block is ?Qlost = ?czincmzinc?Tzinc and the energy received by the silver block from is Qgained = csilvermsilver?Tsilver. Thus, ?czincmzinc?Tzinc = csilvermsilver?Tsilver. But mzinc = msilver, so we can write: ?czinc?Tzinc = csilver?Tsilver ?Tzinc = Tf ?300.0?C and ?Tsilver = Tf ?20.0?C ?czinc(Tf ?300.0?C) = csilver(Tf ?20.0?C) ? czincTf +csilverTf = (20.0?C)csilver +(300.0?C)czinc ? (20.0?C)csilver+(300.0?C)czinc Tf =	czinc+csilver	= ? 196.13 ? 196?C TK = TC	C	K or more simply ? TK = TC +273 it is equal to about 4.186 J. Definition: 1000 small calories = 1 food calorie = 4186J ? 1.00kcal = 1.00kC = 4186J a. Conduction occurs when a temperature difference exists causing the molecules of an object to transmit energythroughout the object. b. Convection typically arises from the movement of gases or liquids over large distances. c. Radiation is energy transferred by electromagnetic waves (or photons). The change in temperature ?T of an object depends upon the amount of mass m of the object being heated, the specific heat c of the material the object is composed of and the amount of energy ?Q transferred to the object. It can be experimentally shown that ?T = ?mcQ ? ?Q = mc?T 
Objectives 	  The student will: Explain the Ideal Gas Law. Solve problems using the Ideal Gas Law. Avogadros number: The constant, 6.022  1023, representing the number of atoms in a gram atom, or the number of molecules in a gram molecule. Boyles Law: States that the absolute pressure and volume of a given mass of confined gas are inversely proportional, if the temperature remains unchanged within a closed system. Thus, it states that the product of pressure and volume is a constant for a given mass of confined gas as long as the temperature is constant, PV = k when T = k. The law was named after chemist and physicist Robert Boyle, who published the original law in 1662. Charless Law: An experimental gas law which describes how gases tend to expand when heated. A modern statement of Charles Law is: At constant pressure, the volume of a given mass of an ideal gas increases or decreases by the same factor as its temperature on the absolute temperature scale (i.e. the gas expands as the temperature increases). V = kT Guy-Lussacs Law: The pressure of a gas of fixed mass and fixed volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. TP = k Ideal Gas Law: A law that describes the relationships between measurable properties of an ideal gas. The law states that P  V = n  (R)  T, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of molecules, T is the absolute temperature, and R is the gas constant (8.314 Joules per degree Kelvin or 1.985 calories per degree Celsius). A consequence of this law is that, under constant pressure and temperature conditions, the volume of a gas depends solely on the number of moles of its molecules, not on the type of gas. This is also called the Universal Gas Law. mole: A unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance. A mole is defined as an amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities (e.g., atoms, molecules, ions, electrons) as there are atoms in 12 grams of pure carbon-12 (12C), which is the isotope of carbon with atomic weight 12. This corresponds to a value of 6.022141791023 elementary entities of the substance. It is one of the base units in the International System of Units, and has the unit symbol mol. molecular mass: The mass of a molecule. 
Introduction 	  In the chapter covering temperature and heat, we discussed the kinetic theory of temperature for an ideal gas. The kinetic theory stated that the temperature of such a gas is directly related to the kinetic energy of the molecules of the gas, which, in turn, is equal to the internal energy of the gas. The more we heat a gas, the faster the random motion of its molecules and the greater the increase in temperature and pressure. This seems perfectly reasonable if the gas is confined so that its volume cannot increase. Heat an empty glass bottle with a cork at the top for a sufficiently long time and the molecules of the air in the bottle gain enough kinetic energy to eventually pop the cork out of the bottle. In other words, the pressure (force per unit area) becomes great enough to force the cork out of the bottle. But what happens if we heat a gas and allow the volume to increase, or compress a gas while cooling it? In this chapter, we explore the relationships between the mass, volume, pressure, and temperature of ideal gases which are confined, compressed, and expanded. 
Atomic  Mass  Units 	  Before we continue, it will be helpful to discuss how the masses of different atoms (and molecules) are compared to each other. The idea that all matter is composed of tiny building blocks called atoms goes back to antiquity. It was only during the last two hundred years or so, however, that some measurements could be made suggesting the truth of the idea. Measurements made when different substances combined led to the conclusion that the ratios of atomic masses tended to be simple proportions and that hydrogen had the smallest mass of all atoms. Compared to a hydrogen atom, for example, a carbon atom had 12 times the mass, an oxygen atom-16, and nitrogen-14. Today we define the mass of one-twelfth of a carbon atom as one unified atomic mass unit (amu) or (u) Using this definition, a carbon atom has a mass of 12.0000 u, and a hydrogen atom has a mass of 1.0078 u. 
The  Mole 	  A basic unit in SI system is the mole (mol). The mole is defined as the amount of a substance that contains the same number of atoms or molecules as exactly 12 grams of carbon-12. For example, it is found that 16 grams of oxygen contains the same number of atoms as does 12 grams of carbon-12. Note that carbon-12 is the most common isotope of carbon. Well have more to say about isotopes later. 
Molar  Mass 	  Molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance. Using the atomic mass of a compound, we can quickly determine the mass of one mole of the compound. For example, carbon monoxide (CO) is a chemical compound composed of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom. The unified atomic mass of carbon is 12 and the unified atomic mass of oxygen is 16. The total unified atomic mass number for carbon monoxide is therefore: The molar mass of carbon dioxide is numerically equal to the atomic mass number, but in grams. Therefore, carbon dioxide has a molar mass of 28 grams. Another definition of the mole can be stated as: The number of grams of a substance that is equal to its molar mass. The atomic mass of aluminum oxide Al2O3 (2 aluminum atoms and 3 oxygen atoms) is 102 u. a. What is the mass of one mole of aluminum oxide? 
Answer: 102 grams 	  b. What is the molar mass of aluminum oxide? Answer: By definition, the mass of one mole of a substance is its molar mass: 102 grams c. You are given 230 grams of aluminum oxide. How many moles n of aluminum oxide do you have? 
Answer:  mol 	  mol d. What is the atomic mass of aluminum? Answer: As cited above, one atom of oxygen has atomic mass 16 u. 
Avogadros  Number 	  In 1811, Amedeo Avogadro (1776-1856), in the Figure 14.1, published a paper hypothesizing that equal volumes of different gases gas at equal pressure and temperature would have an equal number of molecules. Today we know that a volume of 22.4 liters of an ideal gas at standard atmospheric pressure and 20C contains one mole of gas. The number of molecules in one mole was not determined until the early 20th century. The number is known today as Avogadros Number NA = 6.0221023 and is defined as one mole. URL Answer: One mole (abbreviated as mol), by definition, contains 6.0221023 particles. In this case, it is 6.0221023 atoms of silver. 
Answer:  mol 	  mol Answer: There are 6.0221023 particles in every mole. Therefore, one mole of pennies is 6.0221023 pennies. pennies) = 1.5055  10 pennyg24 ? 1.51  1024 grams or 1.51  1021 kg. This is the mass of Plutos moon, Charon, see Figure 14.3. Clearly, a mole is a very large number. By comparison, the amount of zinc in about 23 pennies is equivalent to one mole of zinc atoms. Clearly, atoms are very small. 
Three  Laws 	  In the three laws that follow, we assume an ideal gas, as described by the Kinetic Theory. The mass of the gas is held constant, and that the pressure of the gas remains fairly low. 
Boyles  Law 	  Robert Boyle (1627-1691), in the Figure 14.4, is regarded as the first modern chemist. In the early 1660s he stated what has become known as Boyles Law, which states that if the temperature of a gas is kept constant, then the volume V and pressure P form an inverse relationship. , or PV = constant. Let us try to understand why it happens. If the temperature does not increase, then the average velocity of the gas molecules does not increase. As we showed earlier, a change in momentum (?p = F?t) is proportional to force. Recall that pressure is force per unit area. If the volume decreases, then more molecules impact a smaller surface 
Plutos largest moon  Charon is 1,200 km in diameter 	  area, thus there is more force per unit area. In an 1802 paper, scientist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who we shall have more to say about shortly, credited Jacques Charles (1746-1823), Figure 14.6, with what is now known as Charless Law. According to Charless Law, if the pressure of a gas is kept constant, the volume V of a gas varies directly with the absolute temperature T (expressed, as you may recall, in Kelvins), V ? T Figure 14.7. Close to absolute zero, all gases will liquefy. The graph in Figure 14.7 is therefore extrapolated for temperatures close to absolute zero. We note that experimentally reducing the temperature of any substance to zero K is not possible. 
Guy- Lussacs  Law 	  Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850), Figure 14.8, is also credited with stating that when the volume of a gas is held constant, the pressure P is directly related to the temperature T(Kelvin), P ? T Figure 14.9. This graph is also extrapolated for temperatures close to absolute zero. 
The  Mass of a  Gas 	  For the three laws above, we assumed that the mass of the gas was constant. But the mass of a gas can increase or decrease. Fill a tire with air (a gas) and there is an increase in mass. If the air flows out of the tire, the mass decreases. In both cases, the volume of the tire will change. Once a tire is close to its rated pressure, however, filling it with more air will hardly increase the volume. But the pressure can still increase a good deal. The increase in pressure is due to the increase in mass of the gas because there are more molecules hitting the inside of the tire. Both volume V and pressure P, therefore, increase with mass in direct proportion m ? P ? m and V ? m. 
The  Ideal  Gas  Law 	  The three gas laws we have previously discussed in addition to the relationship between volume, pressure, and mass, lead to a more general statement of proportionality ? PV ? mT. We can write this as an equation ? PV = CmT, but we can show that if the mass m is used in the equation, then the constant of proportionality C depends upon the particular gas. If however, the mass is expressed using the number of moles n, a constant of proportionality (known as the universal gas constant) R = 8.314molJ?K , is applicable for any gas. Under these conditions the Ideal Gas Law can be expressed as PV = nRT, where the temperature T must be in Kelvins. No gas exactly follows the Ideal Gas Law. But if the assumptions made for the kinetic theory of gases are valid (that is, if the gas has high temperature and low pressure), then the Ideal Gas Law is applicable. Unless stated otherwise, throughout this chapter we will assume that we deal with an ideal gas. URL

Answer: If NRA is substituted for k in U =kNT, then U = 32 NNA RT. But NNA = n, since N is the total number of particles divided by the number of particles in one mole NA. We can therefore state that U =nRT. URL

Introduction 	  The word thermodynamics puts together thermo-, meaning heat, and dynamics, meaning change. Thermodynamics is the study of processes by which energy is transferred by heat and work. When studying thermodynamics, we will often refer to the system," which is often a gas within some sort of container. There are three types of systems: isolated, closed, and open. Mass and energy cannot enter or leave an isolated system. Only energy may enter or leave a closed system. Both mass and energy may enter or leave an open system. Heat as explained earlier is the transfer of energy due to a temperature difference. Work is a transfer of energy when there is no temperature difference. James Joule showed that mechanical work was equivalent to heat. A given amount of work done on a system could raise the temperature of the system the same as if a flame had transferred energy to the system (as if the system was heated). But we know from the Kinetic Theory that when energy is transferred to a system, the molecules gain kinetic energy. If we restrict our attention to ideal gases, then the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules is equal to the internal energy of the substance. The internal energy of a system can increase or decrease by heat flowing into or out of the system. The internal energy of a system can also increase or decrease when work is done on the system or the system does work on the environment (we will describe how work is done on the system and how the system does work on the environment later). The relationship that was established in the 19th century among internal energy, heat, and work is now known as the Law of Conservation of Energy. Though we have made use of conservation of energy in our work on mechanics, it was not until the concept of heat was understood that a formal statement on the conservation of energy was proposed. This formulation is now known as the First Law of Thermodynamics, stated below: The change in the internal energy of a closed system is equal to the heat delivered into (or out of) a system, plus the work done on the system (or by the system). URL It is represented symbolically as ?U = Q+W, where ?U is the change in internal energy (U),Q is heat, and W is work. It is important to follow the proper sign conventions in using the First Law: One further definition will be useful. It is often the case that we wish to transfer energy into or out of a system or maintain a system at a constant temperature. To do so, we put the system in contact with a heat reservoir. The reservoir is considered large enough so that any heat that flows into it or out of it does not affect its temperature. It is incorrect to think of the heat reservoir as something that is necessarily hot. It is a reservoir that can accept or deliver heat. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  a. What is the sign of Q? Answer: Since the heat flowed into the system, Q is positive. b. What is the sign of the W? Answer: Since the piston did work on the environment, W is negative. c. What is the change in internal energy of the system? Answer: ?U = Q+W ? ?U = +500J ?300J = 200J 
Four  Definitions 	  It is possible to carry out a thermodynamic process under several special conditions: A thermodynamic process that takes place at constant temperature is called an isothermal process. A thermodynamic process that takes place at constant volume is called an isochoric, or isovolumetric, process. A thermodynamic process that takes place at constant pressure is called an isobaric process. A thermodynamic process in which no heat enters or leaves the system is an adiabatic process. This condition can be realized by a system that is well insulated, like a thermos bottle, or if a process occurs rapidly enough so that heat does not have time to enter or leave the system (see example 14.2.5). 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  In example 14.2.1, the thermodynamic process is isobaric. The load is lifted at a constant velocity and the mass of the piston is negligible in comparison to the load (mg) lifted. Show that the work done in lifting the load is equal to the product of the pressure P inside the cylinder and the change in volume ?V of the gas inside the cylinder, that is, P?V. Recall that work is equal to the product of the displacement x and the force F in the direction of the displacement. The force F acting on the piston is in the direction of the displacement x, see Figure 14.10. The work done on the load is W = Fx, where F = mg, since the load is lifted at constant velocity and x is the displacement of the load. The volume of the cylinder at any instant is the product of area of the piston A and the height h of the piston within the cylinder. Vcylinder = Ah = ?r2h. Recall that the pressure P is given by P = FA . The product P?V = FA(Vf ?Vi) = ?Fr2(?r2hf ??r2hi) = F((h+x)?h) = Fx We might have expected this result had we bothered to investigate the units of PV. 
V ?  A( Ax) =  Fx ? work or 	  PV ? FA which are, clearly, the units of kinetic energy, the product of mass and velocity squared. 
Illustrative  Example 3 	  A thermodynamic process is carried out isothermally. What is the change in internal energy ?U? Answer: The internal energy of a gas can be expressed as U =kNT, where k is the Boltzmann constant, N the total number of molecules (or atoms) and T the temperature of the gas. For an isothermal process, the internal energy must remain constant since the temperature remains constant, therefore ?U = 0. 
Illustrative  Example 4 	  A gas-filled cylinder with a movable piston is put in contact with a heat reservoir so that the temperature of the gas remains constant. If 400 J of heat are transferred out of the system, describe whether work was done by or on the system. Answer: The sum Q+W = 0 because ?U = 0 ? 0 = Q+W ? W = ?Q. The work is equal to ?Q, but since heat left the system Q < 0, that is, Q = ?400J ?W = ?(?400J) = +400J. Work is, therefore, done on the system. 
Illustrative  Example 5 	  a. An isochoric process transfers 1,500 J of heat to a gas inside a cylinder with a fixed piston. How much work isdone by the gas in the process? Answer: Since the process is isochoric, the volume of the gas must remain constant. If the gas does not expand or contract, no work can be done by the gas on the environment or by the environment on the gas, since the displacement of the piston is zero ?W = P?V = F?x = F(0) = 0 (see example 14.1.1). b. How much does the internal energy of gas change? Answer: ?U = Q+W ? ?U = Q+0 ? ?U = Q ? ?U = 1,500J 
Illustrative  Example 6 	  Explain why a system may experience a temperature decrease during an adiabatic process. Answer: The heat cannot enter or leave the system (Q = 0). By the First Law, we have ?U = Q+W = 0+W ? ?U =W. If we assume that the system does work on the environment, then W < 0. In cases when the work is less than zero, the internal energy of the system must decrease, since ?U = Uf ?Ui < 0 ?Uf <Ui. The internal energy of a gas is directly related to the temperature of the gas U =nRT. The smaller the internal energy U, the cooler the temperature T. URL

Introduction 	  The first law of thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy. But not all processes that conserve energy are physically possible. For example, it would not violate the law of conservation of energy if a glass of water at room temperature were to freeze. Nothing in the first law prevents the molecular motion of the water molecules from transferring heat through the glass to the atmosphere and therefore lowering the water temperature enough for it to freeze. But this never happens. The second law of thermodynamics describes the direction in which physical phenomena can occur. One statement of the second law is: Heat can flow spontaneously from hot to cold but never from cold to hot. URL There are certain processes that we know can never happen in reverse: A tea cup falls and shatters after hitting the floor. But it does not put itself back together again and float back up from where it fell. All natural processes are irreversible. Even after one swing, a pendulum is not back to the height from where it was released. Friction ensures that some of the gravitational potential energy of the pendulum is converted into heat. On the other hand, heat does not spontaneously convert into potential energy: the pendulum would never start to swing wider while cooling down, will it? Natures tendency is to go from a more ordered state to a less ordered state. 
Heat  Engines 	  Any device that uses heat (thermal) energy to produce mechanical work is called a heat engine. One of the first heat engines was the steam engine. Wood or coal was burned, and the thermal energy released by the fuel was transferred to water and produced steam. The steam was then directed into a cylinder with a movable piston which turned a crank of some sort that was attached to another mechanical device which turned a paddle wheel. Thus, work was performed. But plenty of thermal energy was also transmitted to the environment (the engine room on a steamship gets pretty hot!). Using thermal energy to produce mechanical work led to the question of efficiency: How much of the energy input to a system can be used to produce a given amount of work? It is never the case that all of the thermal energy can be converted to mechanical energy. Here is another way of stating the second law of thermodynamics: no heat engine can be 100% efficient. There is a simple way to appreciate this fact. If you have ever felt the hood of an automobile after its been running for a while (do this carefully) youll notice that the hood is very hot. The engine has grown hot while performing work and heated the hood of the car. The heat engine in this case is the internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine is not very efficient. About two-thirds of the energy of the gasoline used to power an automobile is converted to heat. That is why automobiles have cooling systems composed of radiators, water pumps and fans. As the water circulates through the system, heat is transferred from the hot engine to the cooler water. The water is then cooled by the radiator fan (and the wind through the grills of the car). Briefly, the internal combustion process is as follows. During the internal combustion process, some of the thermal energy produced by burning gasoline is used to perform work (to move the car!) but a good deal of the thermal energy is used to heat the engine as well as the exhaust gases which do not perform work. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that only some of the chemical energy of the gasoline is available to perform work. Figure 14.11 explains how the typical heat engine works. The quantity QH is the initial thermal energy transferred to the system and W is the work done by the system. (In the case of the internal combustion process, QH is the heat produced when the spark ignites the gasoline-air mixture.) The remaining thermal energy QL leaves the engine at a lower temperature. The efficiency of a heat engine e is defined as e = QWH 100 (Multiplication by 100 expresses the efficiency as a percentage.) 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  a. Use the conservation of energy to express the relationship between, QH the high (H) temperature thermal energy, the low (L) temperature thermal energy, QL and the work performed W by a heat engine. Solution: Let QH be the initial energy of the system, QL the energy of the spent gases, and W the work output. Conservation of energy states Ei = Ef ? QH = QL +W b. Use the result above to express the efficiency e in terms of QH and QL. Solution: Since QH = QL +W ?W = QH ?QL substitution into e = QWH 100 gives W QH ?QL QL QL e =  100 =  100 1 100 1 100. 
H	 H	 H	 	  At high temperature (Ignition) an engine transfers 8.52  104 J into the system and at low temperature (Exhaust) transfers 5.96104 J out of the system. What is the efficiency of the engine? 
The  Carnot  Engine 	  Maximizing the efficiency of a heat engine was an important topic during the early 19th century. The Frenchman Sadi Carnot (1796-1832), analyzed the characteristics of an ideal heat engine. Such an engine assumes that each process the engine preforms is reversible. The Carnot engine, as it is called today, belongs to the same idealized category as the frictionless inclined plane. (Such an engine is a mathematical abstraction conceived by assuming physical processes that are impossible. Carnot was able to establish the upper limit of a heat engines efficiency by using his idealized model. He assumed his reversible engine could perform with maximum efficiency if an ideal engine made use of isothermal and adiabatic processes only. All processes were assumed to occur infinitely slowly, having the engine move from one approximate equilibrium state to the next, thus ensuring that the processes could be reversed. Such an engine of course could never exist. The idea of constructing infinitely slow processes is impossible. The Carnot engine, as we will see, is just a useful conceptual idea for establishing the upper limit of a heat engines efficiency for a given pair of high and low temperatures. Carnot was able to show that at maximum efficiency the high QH and low QL energy transfers were proportional to the high TH and low TL temperatures under which the engine operated. We can therefore write e	100% where T is in kelvins. This was a very important result because it showed, all things being equal, that those substances that could produce the highest temperature when burning would produce greater efficiency. URL Answer: Since there is no temperature difference between the outside environment (the room) and the environment inside (the steam engine) the efficiency would be zero; the engine could perform no work. e Answer: The temperature must be expressed in Kelvin so TL = 20+273 = 293?K and TH = 125+273 = 398?K e	4% Answer: If TL is the low temperature of the heat engine then high temperature is 
H =  L +0.75 L = 1.75 	  e	9% 
Entropy and the  Second  Law of  Thermodynamics 	  Building on the work of Sadi Carnot, the German physicist Rudolf Clausius (1822-1888), formulated the second law of thermodynamics in 1865 by introducing the concept of entropy. Consider an isolated system composed of a box containing a hot object and a cold object separated by a layer of air. As heat flows from the hot object to cold object, a pinwheel placed between them will turn (work is done on the pinwheel) due to the movement of the warm air. Eventually, the hot and cold objects will reach the same temperature. The heat will stop flowing and the pinwheel will no longer turn. Work will no longer be possible, yet the energy of system has not changed. How can it be that the same energy is available but work can no longer be performed? It is not the energy that matters here; it is the difference in energy levels. In general, when there is a difference in energy levels there is a difference in the how ordered the system is. The order of a system is a measure of entropy of the system. The most general statement of the second law is: For all natural processes the total entropy of a system increases. It may be that certain parts of the system may become more ordered, but this order will be more than offset by an increase in disorder in other parts of the system. The sun supplies the necessary energy for flowers to grow, thus sustaining a very ordered biological system. But the disorder the sun suffers in releasing enormous amounts of energy will eventually cause its demise (dont worry, we still have at least a billion of years left... as far as the sun is concerned). The result is an increase in entropy (disorder) for the flower-sun system. Generally, a solid is a more ordered system than a liquid, and a liquid more ordered than a gas because of the arrangement of the atoms in these states of matter. A solid has a very rigid (orderly) arrangement of particles, a liquid not quite as rigid (less orderly) and a gas the least orderly arrangement since there is almost no binding of the particles to each other. Yet we can still speak of a gas with increasing disorder. For example, a hot gas dispersing into the space around it goes from a more concentrated orderly arrangement to a more disorganized less concentrated arrangement. But entropy need not be restricted to the physical arrangement of real particles. The amount of entropy in a system (or more properly, the change in entropy) is also a matter of probability which we discuss below. Entropy can be expressed also as the information a system has (or loses). The link between entropy and information theory is quite complicated and beyond the scope of this book. 
Entropy as  Probability 	  There is a statistical explanation of entropy which says that the most disorder state is the most probable one. Suppose you flip two coins at once. Lets list the possible outcomes. Well use T = tails and H = heads One possibility for two tails: TT 
One possibility for two heads:  	  Two possibilities for one head and one tail: TH or HT There are a total of four possible outcomes with a 25% chance of getting two tails and a 25% chance of getting two heads. But there is a 50% chance of getting one head and one tail. The more organized states (those above with a 25% probability) have a lower probability of occurring. The most probable outcomes in the natural world are those with the greatest disorder. A tea cup falling and shattering is a disordered state and much more likely to occur than is a shattered tea cup reconstructing itself into a more ordered state. Similarly, stars (highly organized objects) transfer energy to the near-absolute-zero vacuum of interstellar space until all that remains are burned out cinders and a slightly warmer interstellar vacuum. One cosmological possibility is that the highest probable state of universe is the so-called heat death of the universe: A universe with one low (uniform) temperature. ?U = Q+W,?U is the change in internal energy of the system, Q is the heat, and W the work. Statements describing the second law: a. Heat can flow spontaneously from hot to cold but never from cold to hot. b. No heat machine is 100% efficient. The most general statement of the second law: For all natural processes, the total entropy of a system increases. 9. The efficiency of an actual heat engine can be expressed as e The high temperature thermal energy is QH and the low temperature thermal energy is QL. The high operating temperature of the Carnot engine is TH and the low operating temperature of the Carnot engine TL. 
Electrostatics 	  Most people have experienced some form of static electricity, but it is difficult to connect this to electricity that we use every day in the modern world. In this chapter, we will study how electrical charges are split and transfered, the force that electrical charges exert on each other, and how that force can be expressed as an electric field. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how an imbalance of electric charge is produced. Understand that there are two different kinds of electric charge. Understand that electric charge is conserved. Understand that electric charges hold atoms together. Understand the difference between conductors and insulators. conductors: Any material that permits electrons to readily move. electric charge electron: A particle that carries negative charge and resides in the center of an atom. Electrons attract protons and are in motion around the nucleus. ion: An atom that has gained or lost an electron.	Ions do not have an equal number of positive and negative charges. insulators: Materials that do not conduct electric current, also known as non-conductors. negative charge neutron: A neutral particle that has no electric charge. Neutrons reside in the center of an atom. positive charge proton: A particle that carries positive charge and resides in the center of an atom. Protons attract electrons. static electricity: An imbalance of one kind (positive or negative) of charge. It can be caused by friction between two materials or placing objecs in contact. 
Introduction 	  People have always experienced the effects that electrical charges produce, especially in dry climates and cold weather. Some examples of this include: Rub your hand against animal fur (ex. pet a cat) in dry weather, as in Figure 15.1. Your cat may get an unwelcome electric shock! Use a plastic comb on your hair in a dark room and you may see electric sparks. Rub an inflated balloon against your shirt and then place it against a wall in your home. The balloon will stick to the wall. Plastic shrink wrap from the casing of a CD or DVD sticks to your hands after you open it. In cold or dry weather, you may get a painful shock when you reach for a doorknob after walking on a carpet. Warning: On dry days your cat may take issue with being petted. The intrinsic property of objects that helps describe all these and many other phenomena is known as electric charge. Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter, because every atom is composed of both positive charge and negative charge. If enough positive and negative charges attract one another, an electric discharge may occur. In an electric discharge, negative charge moves rapidly to an area of excessive positive charge and the separate charge distributions neutralize. We will describe below how the properties of electric charges. 
Static  Electricity 	  An imbalance of one kind of charge is called static electricity, and it can be caused by friction between two materials or simply placing two objects in contact. If enough static electricity builds up, then it can discharge, resulting in a shock or spark as the electric charge jumps to another object. The American statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) assigned the terms positive and negative to the two different kinds of electrical charges. We will describe a demonstration below which aids in substantiating the Law of Charges, which states that opposite charges attract, but like charges repel. Franklin correctly believed that during an electrostatic interaction between two objects, an apparent increase of one form of charge (say, positive charge) on one of the objects meant there must be an apparent increase of the other form of charge (negative charge) on the other object. The number of both positive and negative charges remained the same, but their distribution was altered. Today, we call this principle the law of conservation of electric charge and state it as: The total charge remains constant in a closed system. URL For example, when the cat in Figure 15.1 is petted, it is now known that the negative charge from the cats fur is transferred to your hand (a brush even works better at accumulating negative charge). Because of a loss of negative charge, the cat has become positively charged. No new charge has been created. The work done in petting the cat has redistributed the negative charges. It will be explained below that it is the negative charge that moves when an electric shock is experienced. If enough negative charge accumulates on your hand (the best chance of this is on a dry day), the electrostatic attraction between the negative charge on your hand and positive charge on the cat will result in a discharge of the negative charges. The cat (and your hand) experience an electrical shock. 
A  Simple  Model of the  Atom 	  During the 20th century, it was discovered that atoms are composed of three types of particles: the electron, the proton, and the neutron. The electron and proton are oppositely charged particles without which atoms could not be held together; the electrons and the protons attract each other. The neutron has no electric charge (it is neutral). Protons and neutrons reside at the center of an atom (in the nucleus) and the electrons, in the simplest atomic model, travel around the nucleus like planets around a star. We know today that this model is vastly oversimplified. The charges of the electron and the proton are of exactly equal magnitude but of opposite polarity (sign). The smallest unit of electric charge (an elementary charge), found on an electron and a proton, has a magnitude of The symbol C represents the fundamental unit of electric charge, coulomb, which we will discuss later. By convention, we say that electrons carry negative charge and protons carry positive charge. An atom is always neutral, having the same number of protons in the nucleus as electrons in orbit about the nucleus. Though the magnitudes of their charges are equal, their masses are quite different. The proton has about eighteen hundred times more mass then the electron. The atoms of solids remain in relatively fixed positions due to the electrostatic bonds between their atoms. Electrons, as we have stated, are in motion about the nucleus of an atom. Some of the farther (outer) electrons in an atom are held very weakly by the electrical attraction from the nucleus. Friction (or merely contact if the other substance strongly attracts electrons) provides enough energy to completely free some of the electrons from their atoms. These electrons are then able to transfer from one object to another. When an atom loses or gains electrons we call the atom an ion. Ions do not have an equal number of positive and negative charges. 
Conductors 	  The fact that electrons can easily move gives rise to what is known as an electric current, or a flow of electrons. We will further discuss electric current later. Some materials allow electrons to move more easily than others. In metals, for example, Figure 15.2, electrons can move very easily. The metals are considered to be the best conductors of electric current. Any material that permits electrons to readily move is called a conductor. You may be familiar with the fact that current is conducted by wires. The wires of electrical devices such as lamps, computers, and TV sets conduct electrons. We will discuss the flow (current) of electricity later. How do free electrons distribute themselves on a conducting sphere? Common items that conduct electric current: aluminum foil, paper clips, coins,and nails. Answer: Since like charges repel each other, they distribute themselves in a symmetrical fashion as far from each other as possible on the surface. 
Insulators 	  Materials that do not conduct electric current are called non-conductors, or insulators. Glass, wood, plastic, and rubber are examples of insulators, as shown in Figure 15.3. Insulators are very important in protecting us from the dangers of electricity, since they do not permit a current to pass through our bodies. Common insulators; a glass rod, red plastic insulation on a hand tool and a piece of wood. Why do you think the hand tool has insulating handles? URL If similar charges are placed on a spherical insulator, will they move as far from each other as possible? Answer: They wont move at all. They will remain wherever they are since they cannot move freely on an insulator. Now that we know a bit about the structure of the atom and about conductors and insulators, we can describe some simple demonstrations involving objects that have contain an unbalanced amount of charge, called a charged object. 
Charging by  Friction:  Demonstrating that  Like  Charges  Repel 	  We have already explained that an imbalance of charge can be achieved by rubbing one material against another. In any such exchange, both objects are oppositely charged. One object will gain negative charge and the other object will gain positive charge (by losing the negative charge the other received). Try this experiment: Inflate two balloons and tie each one with strings measuring about 50-cm long. Give one balloon to a friend and keep one for yourself. Have your friend rub her balloon with her hair while you do the same with yours. Whatever charge the balloons now have will be of the same kind. Holding the balloons by the strings, slowly bring them together until they are a few centimeters apart. You should see the balloons move away from each other. The balloons now both carry an excess of the same type of charge and repel each other, which helps confirm to us that like charges repel. (Note: If the air has too much moisture, our efforts may not succeed. The charges will be attracted by the water molecules in the air and leak off the balloons. Electrostatic experiments work best when the air is dry, not humid.) URL 
Charging by  Conduction 	  Charging by conduction is the same as charging by contact. For example, if a neutral (uncharged) metal object, say a coin, is brought into contact with a coin that is positively charged, electrons will move from the uncharged coin to the charged coin, see Figure 15.4 and Figure 15.5. The positively charged coin in Figure 15.4 lacks electrons. The neutral coin in Figure 15.4 has weakly held electrons that move to the charged coin upon contact, Figure 15.5. Using this very simplified example (typically there would be many trillions of electrons), four electrons from the neutral coin move to the charged coin. The coin on the left has a final charge of (+8)+(?4) = +4 elementary charges ? 4(1.610?19 C). The coin on the right has lost four electrons and now has a net positive charge 0 ?(?4) = +4. After contact, both coins have the same charge. Do you think both coins would have the same charge if they were not identical? Conduction charges neutral coin. A reasonable question at this point would be: How do we know both coins are charged? For that matter, how could we have known the first coin was charged? 
The  Electroscope and  Charging by  Induction 	  The electroscope is a device that can detect the presence of excess charge on an object through a process known as induction. The first gold-leaf electroscope was constructed in 1787 by Abraham Bennet (1749-1799), Figure 15.6. He used the gold leaf for several reasons. Gold is an excellent conductor, gold leaf can be made very thin and light-weight, and gold is very malleable. Consider the coin in Figure 15.7. In order to ensure that the coin retains its charge (assuming we were able to apply the charge in the first place) we suspend it by an insulating thread, Figure 15.7. An electroscope, Figure 15.8, is typically contained within glass. A metal rod or disk (see figure) protrudes through the top of the glass. Attached to the metal disk (in this case) within the glass is a very thin, light-weight folded foil the leaves of the electroscope. When a charged object is brought close to the top of the disk, the electrons in the rod and the leaves of the electroscope will either move toward the charged object or away from the object. If the object is positively charged as in the case of the coin in Figure 15.8, the electrons are attracted toward the coin. This produces a surplus of positive charges on the two leaves. Since both leaves have the same charge, they repel each other. We can be certain now that the coin is charged. If the object is negatively charged, the electrons are repelled and move away from the object. The two leaves now are negatively charged and still repel each other. Notice that the two leaves have the same charge as the object which caused the induction. The net charge in the rod and the leaves has not changed. What did change was the distribution of charges. Electrostatic induction is a process in which the charges of opposite sign (polarity) are separated without direct contact. We define electrostatic induction more completely below. Electrostatic induction is an electrostatic redistribution of charges caused by the introduction of a charged object. No contact is made in the process of electrostatic induction. URL URL 
Two  Ways to  Charge  Using  Induction 	  If the charged object is withdrawn from the electroscope, the charges will no longer remain separated. The electrons will move back into the leaves and the leaves will collapse. No permanent charging of the electroscope will have occurred. What if we did wish to charge the electroscope? 
Method 1:  Charging by  Induction and  Conduction 	  Allow the coin to touch the metal plate in Figure 15.8. Electrons on the plate would then transfer to the coin. The electroscope would be left with a deficiency of negative charge, and the leaves of the electroscope would remain positively charged and separated even after the coin was withdrawn. 
Method 2:  Charging by  Induction through  Grounding 	  In order to properly describe the second method, we must first explain what is meant by electrically grounding an object. The Earth can act as a huge reservoir for charge. It can readily accept a flow of electrons or it can deliver a flow of electrons. An object that is grounded is connected to the earth by a conductor. A pathway is established which allows electrons to flow freely between the object and the Earth. The symbol for electrical grounding is shown in Figure 15.10. In Figure 15.9, Disk A is negatively charged and Disk B is neutral. When Disk A is brought close to Disk B (without touching it), the negative charges on Disk B move as far away as possible from the negative charges on Disk A. If a conducting wire is attached to Disk B and to the Earth as shown in Figure 15.10, the negative charge on Disk B will move to the ground. Removing the conducting wire between Disk B and the Earth, Figure 15.11, while Disk A remains in place, ensures a permanent loss of negative charge from Disk B. Disk B is now positively charged. 
Disk  A (blue) on the left and  Disk  	  (green) on the right. Permanently charging with induction by grounding: Answer: The leaves would separate more, since additional negative charges would be repelled into the leaves, increasing the repulsion. Answer: The leaves would move closer together since the negative charges on the leaves would be attracted to the positively charged object, leaving the leaves less negative. Removal of grounding wire ensures Disk B is positively charged. Answer: Positively charged ions may also move (in gases or liquids, for example) but not in solid objects. When we speak of a positively charged object, the object has lost electrons and has become positively charged. It has not experienced an actual transfer of positive ions. There is a fourth state of matter called plasma, which is a highly ionized gas typically formed at high temperatures and consisting of freely moving ions and electrons. The suns solar wind is an example of plasma which interacts with the earths atmosphere. The plasma from the sun is responsible for ionizing the upper atmosphere of the earth, contributing to the plasma found in the earths radiation belts. 
Charge on  Metallic  Conductors 	  It has been shown experimentally that any excess electrons on a metal conductor will migrate to the outside surface of the conductor. For example, if electrons are deposited inside an open tin can, the electrons will migrate to the outside of the can. No free electrons will remain inside the can. This is very useful information. It means we would be safe from an electrical discharge (such as lightning) inside of a metal cage since all the charge is conducted to the outside of the metal cage. So, stay inside your car during a lightning storm! Electronic components are protected also from electrical discharges by enclosing them inside metal containers. 
Objectives 	  The student will: 
Understand how to solve problems using  Coulombs law 	  Coulombs constant: A constant of proporitonality equal to k  . 
 	  Coulombs law: The force between two charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distnace between the two charges. 
Introduction 	  We know that opposite electric charges attract each other, and like electric charges repel each other. The question is, what is the amount of that force? Recall that Newtons universal law of gravity described how masses attract and how to calculate the force of attraction, F = Gm1r2m2 . In 1785, fifty-eight years after the death of Isaac Newton, the French naval engineer and physicist Charles Augustin de Coulomb (1736-1806), Figure 15.12, published a work stating the force between two charged particles was based on a similar law. Coulombs law: The force between two charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two charges. The amount of charge is measured in a new unit, called the coulomb after the physicist himself. It is abbreviated C (capitalized because it is based on his name). Using units of coulombs, the force of the charge is expressed as q1q2 
F = k 	  r2 , where q1 and q2 are two charges measured in units of coulombs, k	C	is a constant of proportionality called Coulombs constant, and ris the distance between the two charges. The coulomb is a fairly big charge. Only a small fraction of a coulomb will be in most static electricity, like a balloon sticking to a wall. A high power light bulb will pull around 1 coulomb of charge per second. Like other metric units, coulombs are also measured in smaller units, like the millicoulomb mC = 10?3 C, or the microcoulomb C = 10?6 C. The smallest unit of electric charge is the charge on electrons and protons. The charge of an electron is approximately qe? = ?1.6010?19 C and the charge on a proton has the same magnitude, but is positive. URL 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  a. What is the magnitude and direction of the electrostatic force between two electrons separated by a distance of Answer: For Coulombs law, r must be in meters 1.00 cm = 0.0100 m = 1.0010?2 m Since were dealing with like charges, we know the force is repulsive. We will, therefore, ignore the sign of the charges. q1q2 
F = k 	  r2 = 2.3010?24 N The forces are of equal magnitude and directed away from each other. Since like charges repel, see Figure 15.13. b. The mass of an electron is me = 9.11  10?31 kg. What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two electrons? Answer: meme 
F =  	  r2 = 5.5410?67 N c. What is the ratio of the electrostatic force to the gravitational force for the electron? 
Fe	2.3010?24  N	42 	  g =	?67 N = 4.1510 F	5.5410 This is an enormous ratio! All things being equal, the electrical force is some 40 orders of magnitude greater than the gravitational force! 
Illustrative  Example 2 	  A ?5.0 C point charge is placed between a positive point charge of +10.0 C and a negative point charge of ?6.0 C, along a horizontal line, as shown in Figure 15.14. What is the net force on the ?5.0 C point charge? The prefix  stands for micro and represents one-millionth, therefore  = 10?6. Answer: Let us first draw a Free-Body-Diagram (FBD) for the ?5.0 C charge. Here, F1 represents the force of the +10.0 C point charge on the ?5.0 C point charge. It is an attractive force toward the left. F2 represents the force of the ?6.0 C point charge on the ?5.0 C point charge. It is a repulsive force toward the left. The net force acting on the ?5.0 C charge is the vector sum of the two forces. It is best not to include the sign of the charges in the calculation, since the resulting sign indicates only whether the force is attractive or repulsive. The FBD can be used to determine whether the magnitudes of the forces must be added or subtracted, as well as the direction of the net force. 
F1   	  The distance between the ?5.0 C charge and the ?6.0 C charge is 0.65 m?.25 m = 0.40 m. 
F2   	  The net force on the ?5.0 C charge is therefore F1 +F2 = +7.2 N +1.7 N = 8.9 N, directed toward the left. 
Illustrative  Example 3 	  Three charges form a right triangle as shown in Figure 15.15. Determine the net force acting on the 20 C point charge. Answer: The forces acting on the 20 C point charge are displayed in Figure 15.15. Since the forces are not collinear, it is necessary to use vector resolution. The distance between the ?80 C point charge and the 20 C point charge can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem p(0.30 m)2 +(0.40 m)2 = 0.50 m. The FBD below show the forces on the 20 C point charge along with the vector resolution of force F1. The force F1 is an attractive force placed on the 20 C point charge by the ?80 C point charge. 
F1   	  The force F2 is a repulsive force placed on the 20 C by the 60 C point charge. 
F2   	  The angle ? must be determined in order to find the components of the force F1. Using the tangent function we have tan. The components of F1: F1x = F1 sin? = 67.4sin37.9? = 41.4 ? 41 N F1y = F1 cos? = 67.4cos37.9? = 53.2 ? 53 N The net force on the 20 C point charge in the x?direction is ?Fx = F1x = 41 N. The net force on the 20 C point charge in the y?direction is ?Fy = F2 ?F1y = 67 N ?53 N = 14 N. ? The net force on the 20 C point charge is the Pythagorean sum of the components	412 +142 = 43.3 ? 43 N The direction of the force is tan. The final result can be written as < 43 N,19? >. Does the graphical sum of the vectors F1 and F2 in the FBD above agree with the mathematical result? (The vectors are not quite to scale!) 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand what a field is. Understand how to solve electrostatic field problems. electric field: The field that surrounds a charged particle. electric field line: A simple way of representing an electric field, also known as electric lines of force. test charge: Used to measure an electric field. The electric field is defined as the ratio of the force acting on the positive test charge, at some point in space, to the magnitude of the test charge. 
Introduction 	  Even though Isaac Newton felt confident about the universal law of gravity, he wondered just how the Earth reached across the empty space and exerted a force upon the Moon. It was one thing to speak of contact forces. Hitting a baseball, kicking a can these forces made intuitive sense. But gravity was a force that acted through a distance like some invisible hand extending over a limitless space. The same is true of the electrical force. Both equations suggest that there is no end to the reach of this invisible hand. (The denominators of the equations show that regardless of the distance between two objects, a force remains present.) It wasnt until the 19th century that Michael Faraday (1791-1867), Figure 15.16, proposed the field concept, which stated that the space between two electrical charges (or two masses) was permeated by a field. This field communicated each objects presence. The field distorted the space around each object such that the forces experienced by the objects obeyed an inverse square law. Faraday conducted experiments to measure the intensity of the field surrounding charged objects, thus supporting the field concept. 
The  Electric  Field 	  The field that surrounds a charged particle is called an electric field. The electric field is measured by observing the force on a small positive  test charge placed within the field. (The test charge has to be small so it would have no effect upon the charges which have created the field we wish to measure.) The electric field is then defined as the ratio of the force acting on the positive test charge, at some point in space, to the magnitude of the test charge. That is,	q . The electric field is a vector quantity (also called a vector field) since force is a vector quantity and charge is a scalar quantity. We will not always use the vector notation throughout our discussion. It is helpful to express the analogous quantity for the gravitational case as . A small test mass m placed two Earth radii from the center of the earth experiences a gravitational field only one-fourth as strong as the field at the Earths surface. 
Answer:  krq2 	  Answer: Since E  the units of E can be expressed as CN . 
Electric  Field  Lines 	  The force that a small positive test charge experiences at various positions in an electric field can be represented by the common vector representation of an arrow indicating the instantaneous magnitude and direction of the electric force. The magnitude is shown by the length of the arrow. The electric field which produces the force could be represented as a series of arrows in space proportional in length to the force vectors (E ? F). This would be rather tedious. A simpler way of representing the electric field is with electric lines of force, or electric field lines. 
Electric  Field  Lines for  Isolated  Positive and  Negative  Charges 	  The force experienced by a test charge in the presence of a positive charge is directed away from the positive charge, since like charges repel. The electric field lines would therefore be drawn pointing away from the positive charge. Similarly, the force experienced by the test charge in the presence of a negative charge is directed toward the negative charge, since unlike charges attract. The electric field lines would therefore be drawn pointing away from the negative charge. The electric field lines for an isolated positive charge and an isolated negative charge are shown in Figure 15.17. Notice that the field lines for both charges radiate out in straight lines. The positive charge has field lines that point away from the positive charge. The negative charge has field lines that point toward the negative charge. (left) The field lines for a positive charge. (right) The field lines for a negative charge. Rules for Drawing Field Lines when More Than One Charge is Present Field lines are also referred to as lines of force, because they indicate the direction of the force on a positive charge q. The electric field ~E = Fq can be rewritten in the form . The charge q in this case is not restricted to a positive point charge. 
Answer:  The magnitude of the electric field is  E   	  The electric field is directed radially outward. The field pattern for a pair of opposite charges of equal magnitude (known as electric dipole) is shown in Figure Answer: A positive test charge would be repelled by the positive charge in Figure 15.18. The electric field lines point in the same direction as the electric force. Answer: A positive test charge would be attracted by the negative charge in Figure 15.18. The electric field lines point in the same direction as the electric force. 
Illustrative  Example 15.3.1 	  A positive test charge q0 is placed in the field of the positive charge +Q and negative charge ?Q as seen in Figure Answer: The charge ?Q attracts q0 with a smaller force than +Q repels it, since it is farther from the test charge q0 than the positive charge +Q. The forces that ?Q and +Q place upon q0 are shown dashed. The net force, drawn solid, is shown as the vector sum of the two dashed vectors. The curved line represents one of the lines of force between the positive and negative charges. ?q?V. The work done by an external force is Wexternal force = q?V. 
Chapter  Outline 	  If there is a strong enough electric field, sparks form in the air where the electricity jumps from one object to another. In this chapter, we discuss electrical energy and electric potential. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand gravitational potential. gravitational potential: The potential energy per unit mass, represented by Vg. 
Introduction 	  Earlier, we compared Newtons law of universal gravity with Coulombs law. In this chapter, we will use gravitational potential energy to draw an analogy with electrical potential energy. Let us begin by reviewing gravitational potential energy. 
A  Review of  Gravitational  Potential  Energy 	  If we remain close to the surface of the earth, the gravitational acceleration g is considered constant. The gravitational potential energy of an object then increases if we lift it higher. We have done work on the object and increased the potential energy of the object. The Earth, however, has done negative work on the object, because as the object is lifted, the force on the object due to gravity is opposite to the objects displacement, Figure 16.1. Conversely, if the object is dropped, its potential energy decreases, but the work done by gravity is positive, because the force on the object due to gravity is in the same direction as the objects displacement, Figure 16.2. If the object has mass m, then the change in potential energy when it is lifted is ?PE = mghf ?mghi . The change in potential energy is positive, but the work done by gravity is negative. We can therefore write W = ??PE. The negative sign ensures that the work done by gravity is negative when the object is lifted. The equation is true regardless of whether the object is lifted or dropped. When the object is dropped, its change in potential energy is negative and the work done by gravity is positive (the gravitational force and the displacement are in the same direction when the object falls). If the object is lifted at a constant velocity, the work W that an external force does on the object is W = ?PE (no negative sign). The external force is in the same direction as the displacement of the object when lifting it, and opposite to the displacement when lowering it. a. An object of mass 10.0 kg falls from a height of 8.00 m to a height of 3.00 m. What is the change in potentialenergy of the object? Answer: ?PE = mghf ?mghi	s	J b. How much work has the gravitational force done on the object? 
Answer:  W = ?? E = ?(?4.91102  J) = 4.91102  	  c. Assuming the object was lifted at a constant velocity, how much work would be done on the object by the liftingforce to move it from 3.00 m to 8.00 m? Answer: W = ?PE ? ?PE = mghf ?mghi	s	J 
Gravitational  Potential 	  Though gravitational potential is not often discussed in introductory physics books, it may be helpful to define the concept as a comparison to the electric potential which we will discuss soon. Let us rewrite the equation expressing the gravitational potential energy (PE = mgh), as PEm = gh. We define the quantity gh as the gravitational potential (the potential energy per unit mass) and represent it with the symbol Vg. Hence, 
Vg = gh 	  Since potential energy and mass are scalar quantities, so is the gravitational potential Vg. If g is constant, as it is near the surface of the Earth, then the gravitational potential Vg is directly proportional to the position h of the mass. Recall that only differences in potential are meaningful. Therefore we define the gravitational potential Vg = 0, when h = 0. URL 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how to solve problems using electric potential energy. Understand how to solve problems using voltage differences. Understand how to solve problems in a uniform electric field. electric potential: Energy per unit charge. electric potential difference: The difference in electric potential between two points within an electric field. voltage: The amount of work done by the electric field per unit charge in moving a charge between two points in the electric field ?V = Wq , also known as a change in potential energy. 
Introduction 	  In order to draw an analogy between gravitational potential energy and electrical potential energy, we liken the electric field E to the gravitational acceleration g and the mass m of a particle to the charge q of a particle. Of course, g is assumed constant (uniform) when we remain close to the surface of the Earth. As of yet, we have not encountered an example of a uniform electric field E. But that wont stop us from making a prediction! Since the gravitational potential energy of a mass m in a uniform gravitational field is PEgravity = (mg)h, we predict the electric potential energy (PEelectric) of a charge (q) in a constant electric field is PEelectric = (qE)h. Furthermore, the electric potential (the energy per unit charge) can be defined as Ve = PEelectricq (The subscript e will be dropped from now on.) We will discuss electric potential later. It must be understood that, just as with gravity, the electric potential energy and the electric potential are measured at the same point. If a point charge q has electric potential energy PEx1 at point x1, the electric potential at x1 is Vx1 
Ex1 = q Vx1 ? Vx1 =	1 	  q Again, only differences in electric potential and electric potential energy are meaningful.	That is, ?PE or ?V ? Vf ?Vi = PEq f ? PEq i . The unit of electric potential is called the volt and from the definition above we see that the volt is equivalent to CoulombJoules ?V = CJ . 
Electric  Potential  Difference 	  The electric potential difference is the difference in electric potential between two points within an electric field. For example, a 1.5-volt battery has a potential difference of 1.5 volts (written 1.5 V) between its positive and negative terminals. 
Parallel  Plate  Conductors:  A uniform  Electric  Field 	  The equation E = krq2 for the electric field holds for point charges or for a charge distribution that effectively acts as a point charge. It turns out, however, that if opposite charges are placed on two parallel conducting plates, the electric field between the plates is more or less uniform as long as the distance between the plates is much smaller than the dimensions of the plates. The plates can be charged by connecting them to the positive and negative terminals of a battery. A battery contains a substance (called an electrolyte) which causes two dissimilar metals to acquire opposite charges. The two dissimilar metals form the positive and negative terminals of the battery. If a metal plate is connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and another metal plate is connected to the negative terminal of the battery, and the two plates brought closely together, a parallel plate arrangement (parallel-plate conductors) can be constructed with a uniform electric field between the plates (seen edge on) in Figure 16.3. We will see later that parallel plate conductors are also referred to as capacitors. Just as in the case of the battery, one of the plates of the parallel-plate conductor will be at a higher potential than the other plate. Think, for example, of a standard AA battery with a voltage rating of 1.5V, Figure 16.4. See the link below to learn more about how a battery works. URL 
Electrical  Potential  Energy 	  In our gravitational analogy, the energy that a charge possesses at the plate with the higher potential is analogous to the energy a mass possesses above the ground. Additionally, now that we have found a way to create a uniform electric field, we have an analog to a uniform gravitational field. If a positive charge +q is placed at the positive plate in Figure 16.5, it will be repelled by the positive charges on the plate and move toward the negative plate. (Think of +q as the object m falling toward the ground.) What is the force acting on the +q charge? Recall that the Coulomb force on a charge placed in an electrostatic field is F = qE. The work that the electric field does on the charge is equal to the negative change in the potential energy of the charge, just as in the gravitational case. We can find an expression for the electric potential energy by finding the work that is done on the charge. Recall that W = F?x. We write Wfield = F?x = (qE)?x = ??PE ? qE(xf ?xi) = ??PE ? qExf ?qExi = ??PE The expression for the electric potential energy is thus: PEelectrical = qEx. Recall that the equation for the gravitational potential energy is PEgravitational = mgh. We can compare the terms in the gravitational and electrical cases as follows: m ? q g ? E h ? x Thus, we see that our prediction for the equation of electric potential energy stated in the introduction of the lesson, was correct! The positive plate has position 6.00cm = 6.0010?2 m according to Figure 16.5. 
Answer:  Epositive plate = q Ex	 C	 	  Answer: Just as in the case of a change in gravitational potential energy, the charge must lose potential energy, since it gains kinetic energy. The charge moves from the position xi = 6.0010?2 m (1.5 V) to the position xi = 4.0010?2 m (1.0 V). ?PE = qExf ?qExi = qE(xf ?xi) = J. Answer: 
Wfield = ?? E = ?(?7.50106) = 7.50106  	  Notice that the electric field does positive work on the charge, since the electric force and the displacement of the charge have the same direction. We should recall a very important point: It is only the change in potential energy that is meaningful, whether we are discussing the gravitational potential energy or the electrical potential energy. 
B.  Increases 	  C. Remains the same. Answer: The correct answer is A. The electron is repelled by the negative charges of the conducting plate and therefore gains kinetic energy. Just as an object that is dropped gains kinetic energy and loses potential energy, so does the electron. Recall our discussion of the conservation of energy. As long as the total energy remains conserved, the sum of the initial kinetic and potential energies must equal the sum of the final kinetic and potential energies: 
Ei + Ei =  Ef + Ef ? ? E = ?? 	  The gain in kinetic energy occurs due to the loss in potential energy. In order for the charges of the same sign to be brought together, as in the example above, positive work must be done by an external force against the electrostatic repulsion between the charges. The work increases the potential energy stored in the electric field. When the charges are released, the potential energy of the field is converted into the kinetic energies of the charges. The link below may be helpful in learning more about the work done upon charges in electric fields. URL 
Electric  Potential  Difference in a  Uniform  Electric  Field 	  In working with the change in potential energy above, we wrote the equation ?PE = qExf ?qExi = qE(xf ?xi) ? Let us call this Equation A. PEx Recall that the electric potential was defined at a specific point Vx1 =	q 1 . We therefore see that PEx1 = qVx1 ? Let us call this Equation B. Comparing Equation A and Equation B, we see that the electric potential can be expressed as Vx1 =Ex1. If the electric potential is defined as V = 0 at x = 0, then the potential at any point in the electric field is V = Ex. (Assuming that vector E is directed along the x?axis). Note: It is common to write V = Ed, where V is understood to mean the voltage (or potential difference) between the plates of a parallel-plate conductor, and d is the distance between the plates. Verify that the potential difference between the plates in Figure 16.5 is 1.5 V. Recall that the electric field is E = 
Work 	  We state again: 
Ex 	  It is often useful to express the voltage in terms of the work done on a charge. From Vf ?Vi = PEq f ? PEq i , we have PEf ?PEi = q(Vf ?Vi) ? ?PE = q(Vf ?Vi). But the work done on a charge by the field is Wfield = ??PE. Combining ?PE = q(Vf ?Vi) and Wfield = ??PE gives Wfield = ?q(Vf ?Vi). An external force that does work on a charge in an electric field exerts a force in the opposite direction to the field (just as the external force acting on a spring acts opposite to the spring force). The work that an external force does is therefore Wexternal force = q(Vf ?Vi). The voltage can be thought of as the amount of work done by the electric field per unit charge in moving a charge between two points in the electric field ?V = Wq . We often refer to a change in potential as simply the voltage. In computing the work, it is often easier to ignore the sign in the equation and simply see if the force and displacement on the charge are in the same direction (positive work) or opposite to one another (negative work). Recall that the force and displacement need not be in the same direction or oppositely directed. In general, work is expressed as W = Fxcos? URL 
Other  Units for the  Electric  Field 	  The electric field has units CN , since	q . But the electric field has been also defined using the scalar equation V = Ex. Transposing terms, the electric field is E = Vx . So the units of the electric field can be also expressed as volts per meter metervolts ? Vm. If we compare the units for the electric field CN and Vm, we see that a (N ?m) is equivalent to a (C?V). A Joule can therefore be expressed as a Coulomb-Volt. Recall that work, measured in Joules, is the product of charge and voltage W = q?V. 
Illustrative  Example 16.2.1 	  All questions refer to Figure 16.5. a. What is the potential at x = 2.0 cm? The electric field is E = 25.0CN . Answer: The potential V varies directly with the position x between the plates (V = Ex). Thus, V = 25.0CN (2.0  10?2m) = b. Sketch a graph showing the relationship between the potential and the position. Answer: c. How much work is done by an external force F moving a ?2.0  10?6 C charge from the positive plate to the negative plate? Answer: An external force must pull the charge away from the positive plate so the force will be in the same direction as the displacement. 
W = q( Vf ? Vi) = (?2.010?6 C)(0.00 V ?1.50 V) = 3.010?6  	  d. What is the magnitude of the Coulomb force acting on the charge? Answer: W = F ? 3.010?6 J = F(6.0010?2 m) 
Illustrative  Example 16.2.2 	  a. A particle of mass m of 2.00  10?5 kg is has a charge q of +3.00  10?3 C. If the particle is released from the positive plate of a parallel-plate conductor with an electric field E of 1.30105 CN , determine the acceleration of the particle, see Figure 16.6. Answer: If we ignore gravity, the only force acting on the particle is the electric force F = qE. Using Newtons Second Law, the net force on the particle is equal to ?F = ma ? qE = ma.

The  Electron- Volt 	  It is often convenient when dealing with small particles such as electrons, protons, and ions to express the energy of these particles with a smaller unit of measure. The electron-volt is defined as the change in potential energy that an electron acquires when moving through a potential difference of 1 V, or equivalently, its change in kinetic energy after moving through a potential difference of 1 V. That is, PE = eV = (1.6010?19 C)(1.00 V) = 1.6010?19 J. The energy 1.6010?19 J is defined as one electron-volt. We write one-electron-volt as 1 eV = 1.6010?19 J. Answer: The electron is repelled at the negative plate and therefore gains kinetic energy (and loses potential energy). The change in KE is positive and equal to =	? x = 3,500 eV ?KE = 3,500 eV It is simplest to think that for every one volt of potential difference the particle experiences, it gains (or loses) 1 eV. Answer: Protons are the only charges inside the nucleus of an atom and so the alpha particle must be positively charged. A helium nucleus contains two protons (and two neutrons) with a total charge of 2(1.6010?19 C). The alpha particle must slow down due to the electrostatic repulsion from the positive plate. It must, therefore, lose kinetic energy and gain potential energy. Each proton loses 1,500 eV of kinetic energy. ?KE = ?3,000 eV. True or False: Their speeds must be the same, since they both gained the same amount of energy. Answer: False. The mass of a proton is nearly 2000 times greater than the mass of an electron. Remember that kinetic energy depends on both the speed and mass of an object. Therefore, the final speed of the electron will be much greater. 
Illustrative  Example 16.2.5 	  a. An electron and a proton both gain kinetic energy of 1 eV. What is the ratio of the electrons speed to the protonsspeed? Answer: As discussed above, though both particles gain the same kinetic energy, their speeds will not be the same, since they have different masses. The mass of the proton is nearly 2000 times as great as the electrons so: KEe	1221mmpevv2e2p	?	2	2 ? ve2 = mp = 2000me = 2,000 ? =	= 1	meve = mpvp	2	me	me 
Ep	vp 	  ve p =	2,000 = 44.7 ? 45 vp The electron will move about 45 times faster than the proton. b. What is the speed of a proton which has a kinetic energy of 37 MeV? The mass of a proton is 1.6710?27 kg. Answer: Because the electron-volts are a very small unit, they are typically expressed in KeV (1000 electron-volts) and MeV (one million electron-volts). The electron-volt is a convenient unit of measure but it is not an SI unit. In order to find the velocity of a particle if its energy is given in units of eV, we must convert back into Joules. mpv m v = 8.4 s 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand capacitance. Understand how to solve problems involving capacitance. capacitance: The constant ratio of charge to voltage, which is a property of all capacitors. capacitor: Common name for a parallel plate conductor. farad: The unit of capacitance, which equals coulombs per volts. We begin our study of capacitors with the study of capacitance, a property of all capacitors. In order to do this, we must consider the physical dimensions of a capacitor. What is the area of the capacitor plates? What is their separation distance? It will be shown that the physical dimensions of a capacitor are very important in determining capacitance. 
Capacitance 	  As was mentioned earlier, a parallel plate conductor is often referred to as a capacitor. The charge on either plate of the capacitor is referred to as Q. It should be kept in mind that the net charge on the capacitor is zero. Consider a capacitor charged by a voltage source, in this case a 12-Volt battery as shown in Figure 16.8. Experiments show that the charge Q acquired by a capacitor is directly proportional to the voltage V of the source. If the voltage is increased, each plate acquires more charge, but the ratio of charge to voltage remains constant 
 	  ? constant(C) ? Q =CV V . The constant of proportionality C is called the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is coulombs per volts, which is given the name farad (F) in honor of Michael Faraday, the great 19th-century British physicist and chemist. 
Understanding  Capacitance 	  Imagine a constant-voltage source charging two small conducting plates (a small capacitor) that are placed a distance d apart. Imagine also the same voltage source charging two large conducting plates (a large capacitor) placed a distance d apart. Do you think both capacitors will eventually acquire the same charge on their plates? If your intuition tells you no, youre right! It is certainly reasonable to assume that larger plates would hold more charge than smaller plates. Heres why: The smaller the area of a plate, the less charge the plate can hold because of the electrostatic repulsion between like charges. However, a larger number of like charges can be separated by the same distance as a smaller number of charges, over a greater area. We than can say 
C ?  	  (Note: With enough charge, the electrostatic repulsion can become so great that electrical breakdown or discharge occurs. The negative charge crosses the gap between the plates and the potential difference between the plates goes to zero. The battery must then recharge the plates. In all likelihood, though, the capacitor is ruined.) Now imagine two capacitors with the same-size plates. The plates of one capacitor are very close together and the plates of the other capacitor are very far apart. Each capacitor is connected to the same voltage source. Do you think both capacitors will acquire the same charge on their plates? The answer is once again, no. Heres why: We know that the farther apart the charged particles are from each other, the more weakly they interact (Coulombs law). Fewer charges will therefore be attracted to each plate. 
 	  d The capacitance C is, therefore, directly proportional to the area of the plates and inversely proportional to the distance between the plates of the capacitor. 
 	  C ? d Experiments show that if the charge Q and voltage V of a capacitor are measured, along with its area A and separation d, a constant of proportionality (denoted as the Greek letter Epsilon ?0) is found by considering that

The latter set of units can be shown to be the reciprocal of Coulombs constant k, and the numerical value of Epsilon is ?0 = 4?k = 8.85	N ?m2 Notice that the capacitance C is independent of the charge or voltage of the capacitor. It is only dependent upon the physical dimensions of the capacitor, and, as we shall see, upon the type of the insulator placed between its conducting plates. Answer: C = ?0 A ? A = Cd ?

We often find it more practical to express capacitance in terms of microfarads (F ? 10?6 F) and picofarads (pF ? 10?12 F). What is the capacitance of the capacitor? Answer: C = ?0 A = (8.8510?12)(3.0010?2 m)(2.?003 m10?2 m) = 5.3110?12 ? 5.31pF d	1.00 10 a. What is the maximum amount of charge deposited on each plate if the capacitor is connected to a 9.0 V battery? Answer: Q =CV ? Q = (25010?6 F)(9.00 V) = 2.2510?3 C Do not get confused in thinking that the capacitor has twice (2Q) the amount of charge since each plate has charge Q. The battery has transferred electrons (amounting to charge Q) from the positive plate of the capacitor to the negative plate of the capacitor. The total charge of the capacitor is actually zero. The charged capacitor, is, technically, neutral. b. What is the electric field between the plates of the capacitor? Answer: 
Capacitors 	  If you open the back of almost any electronic device, youre bound to see numerous capacitors. Figure 16.9, Figure 16.10, and Figure 16.11 show some of the common commercial capacitors. Capacitors are very useful components in the electronic circuits. They are able to store and release energy innumerable times during their working lifetime. You may wonder why it is important to do so. By storing charge, voltage differences can be sustained in computers. Voltage differences mean a computer can store information digitally in the form of zeros and ones. A capacitor in a camera can control the discharge of electricity, providing the characteristic light flash or electrical spark. Most timing circuits make use of the stored charge (and discharge) in a capacitor. A device that can discharge at various rates is well suited for such a task. It is not uncommon to see the power light remain on after an electronic device is shut down. Stored charge on electronic components does not instantly disappear. Just as inertia always exists, there is always a capacitance in electronic circuits. Your teacher may show you a demonstration where a light-emitting diode (LED) is connected to a capacitor that was charged by a battery. The capacitor lights the LED as it discharges through it. In this instance, a capacitor functions like a battery. URL 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand what a dielectric is and how it affects the capacitance of a capacitor. Solve problems involving capacitors with dielectrics. dielectric constant: The factor by which the dielectric increases the capacitance. The dielectric constant is particular to each dielectric material. dielectric material: An insulating material placed between the conducting plates of a capacitor. polarization: A process simular to induction, in which the molecules of the inductor align such that the positive end of the molecules will be attracted to the negative conducting plate and the negative end of the molecules will be attracted to the positive conducting plate. An electric field is created inside the dielectric that is opposite to the electric field between the two conducting plates of the capacitor. 
Introduction 	  We mentioned earlier that electrostatic repulsion can cause an electrical breakdown or discharge across the plates of a capacitor. Generally, this is not something that we wish will happen. We also mentioned that the capacitance was dependent upon the physical dimensions of the capacitor and the insulator placed between its plates. The insulator is called a dielectric material, Figure 16.12. We now investigate how the capacitance is affected by a dielectric. 
Dielectrics 	  As we have just mentioned, a dielectric material is an insulating material inserted between the conducting plates of a capacitor. Let us consider the effect of inserting a dielectric between the plates of a charged capacitor. We assume the capacitor is charged and then disconnected from the charging source (a battery, for example), Figure 16.13. A process similar to induction occurs, called polarization. When an insulator is inserted between the conducting plates of the capacitor, the molecules of the inductor will align such that the positive end of the molecules will be attracted to the negative conducting plate and the negative end of the molecules will be attracted to the positive conducting plate, see Figure 16.14. An electric field is therefore created inside the dielectric that is opposite to the electric field between the two conducting plates of the capacitor, Figure 16.15. The net effect is that the electric field of the capacitor is reduced along with the voltage across the capacitor, since V = Ex. By decreasing the voltage, the plates acquire more charge once they are reconnected to the battery. A dielectric, therefore, increases capacitance. The amount of increase depends upon the material of the insulator. The dielectric material increases the capacitance C of the capacitor by a factor of k, called the dielectric constant (particular to each dielectric material). The resulting capacitance of the capacitor is then ? C = k?0 Ad . The permittivity of the material is typically defined as ? = k?0, where k > 1. 
A  Mathematical  Explanation of 	  The charge Q0 on each side of the capacitor remains constant since the capacitor is disconnected from the battery. Thus, if C0 is the original capacitance and V0 is the original voltage of the capacitor, then Q0 =C0V0 (Equation A) After the dielectric has been inserted into the capacitor, the new voltage is less than the original V0 ? V voltage, where V < V0. But the product of capacitance and voltage must equal the same charge Q0. Thus, if the voltage decreases, the capacitance increases, since Q0 remains constant. Q0 =CV (Equation B) Setting Equation A equal to Equation B and solving for C: C0V0 =CV ?C =C0VV0 (Equation C) We define V = ?V0, where ? < 1, and substitute ?V0 for V in Equation C. C	V, ? since 
Define= k, and therefore 	  C = kC0, and recall that C0 = e0 Ad , and finally, C = e0kAd . 
Reconnecting the  Voltage  Source to the  Capacitor 	  An increase in capacitance means the capacitor can acquire more charge without an electrical breakdown, since there is less electrostatic repulsion. The induced charges on the insulator have reduced the net electric field, and we now can have a greater Q for the same V. Consider the following example: A capacitor is charged by a 12-Volt battery. The battery is now removed and a dielectric is inserted between the plates of the capacitor. We now measure the new potential difference between the plates and it found to be 4 V. The 12-V battery is now reconnected to the capacitor and the potential difference between the plates of the capacitor quickly increases to 12 V. The plates have now acquired more charge. The same amount of charge on an air-gap capacitor could result in an electrical breakdown. There would be too much electrostatic repulsion between like charges, and the plates would discharge. One of the uses of capacitors is to block the flow of charge in order to protect delicate circuitry. If a sudden increase in current were to occur in an electrical circuit, a capacitor with a dielectric would have a much better chance of handling the increase in voltage without an electrical breakdown. Table 16.1 gives dielectric constant values for some common dielectrics. To learn more about dielectrics, follow the link below. URL TABLE 16.1: 
Titanium  Oxide	100 	  A capacitor has a layer of rubber inserted between its conducting plates while connected to a battery. By what factor will the charge on the capacitor increase? The voltage on the capacitor remains constant. Answer: We can answer this by just looking at the table above. The capacitance of rubber is 2.8 times greater than air, so we should expect the charge on the capacitor to be 2.8 times greater, as well. Using the equation Q0 = C0V, where C0 is the capacitance of air and Q0 is the original amount of charge on the capacitor, Q0 =C0V ?C = KC0 = 2.8C0 ? Q = 2.8(C0V) ? 2.8Q0 ? Q = 2.8Q0 . 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how energy is stored in a capacitor. Solve problems involving energy stored in capacitors. 
Introduction 	  A capacitor stores electrical energy within the electric field between its plates. Otherwise, there would be no energy for the electrical discharge for such things as camera flashes. The ability of capacitors to store and release energy is one of their most important attributes and is directly related to the functioning of most electronic devices. Recall that we described the effect of electrical resonance between a capacitor and a coiled wire in a crystal radio set, Figure 16.16. The effect occurs because the capacitor is able to store and release energy many hundreds of thousands of times (for AM radio) per second through the coiled wire. The same effect is true for modern radios, televisions, computers, and cell phones. Any electrical device that receives a signal requires that capacitors store and release energy. 
How  Energy is  Stored in  Capacitors 	  Energy is stored in a capacitor when work is done by the battery in removing electrons from one plate (the positive plate) and depositing them on the other plate (the negative plate) of the capacitor. A capacitor cannot be charged instantaneously. As more charge is added to each plate of the capacitor, the battery must do increasingly more work per unit charge, because like charges repel. This is analogous to stretching a spring. The farther the spring is stretched, the more force is required to stretch it further. The total energy stored within the spring is equal to the work done in stretching the spring. The work W is the product of the average force F and displacement of the spring x. Analogously, the work done to charge the capacitor is W = Fx = (QE)x = Q(Ex) = QV QVf . The total charge placed on the capacitor is Q and the initial voltage Vi of the capacitor is assumed to be zero. The work can equally be expressed as W QV	 by substituting Q =CV or as W = QV2 = 12 QC2 . The subscript has been dropped on the voltage ?V =Vf . The potential energy stored within the capacitor is the same as the work done by the battery, that is, PEcap =CV2 or PEcap = 12 QC2 . The symbol PE is often replaced with the letter U or U = 21 QC2 . 
Answer:  U   	  Which of the following is correct? a. The charge and voltage of both capacitors remain the same. b. Only the charge on the capacitors is different. c. Only the voltage of the capacitors is different. d. The charge and voltage of both capacitors are different. Answer: The correct answer is C. The charges on the capacitors are the same since both capacitors were charged under identical conditions and then disconnected from the battery. Work, however, was done on capacitor B, since a force was applied (through a displacement) in order to increase the gap to 5 mm. The work increased the potential difference between the plates. Consider the equation Q =CV. If the distance between the plates is increased, then the capacitance decreases, since C =?0 Ad , in this case d ? 5d so C	C. The voltage V0 therefore must increase Q . Similarly, the electric field E remains constant, because we have two conducting parallel plates V = Ed ? V0 = E(5d) = 5Ed = 5V. ?q?V. The work done by an external force is Wexternal force = q?V. 
U =  V2 	  U = Where Q is the charge on the capacitor and V is the voltage of the capacitor. 
Circuits 	  A circuit just means a completed loop. An electrical circuit can be as simple as a few wires held in place by hand. As long as the electricity can flow in a loop, the circuit is complete. This chapter covers electrical current, voltage, resistors and resistivity, resistors in series and parallel, and measuring both voltage and current.

Solve problems involving electric current 	  electric current: A flow of charges under the influence of an electric field, such as between the terminals of a battery. The rate I = ??Qt at which charges flow within a conducting wire past any point in the wire. 
Introduction 	  The term electrical current is familiar to most people. Many electrical devices have electrical specifications printed on them. Figure 17.1 shows a typical AC adapter (plug) with its specs. Can you guess what the terms 5 VDC and 500 mA printed on the adapter mean? 
Electric  Current 	  An electric current is a flow of charges under the influence of an electric field. A flow of charges can be established, for instance, between the terminals of a battery, as in Figure 17.2. The rate I = ??Qt at which charges flow within a conducting wire past any point in the wire is defined as the electric current. The unit of current is coulombssecond which is called the ampere or amp (named for the French physicist Andre-Marie Ampere, 1775-1836), Figure 17.3. The symbol A is used to represent the ampere. A rate of one coulomb per second is equivalent to one ampere: 11Cs = 1A One ampere is a very large current. The current of 1 A can easily kill a person. In fact, about 0.20 A can kill rather easily. Even relatively small voltage can produce these currents, which is why care must always be taken when dealing with all electrical appliances and any electrical device that is plugged into a wall outlet. A typical 12-V car battery can also be dangerous. Under the right circumstances, it does not take a huge voltage to cause deadly currents. It is common to express current in milliamperes 1 mA = 10?3 A, or microamperes 1 A = 10?6 A. URL

Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how conventional current is defined. Understand what is meant by electrical resistance. Understand how to solve problems using Ohms law. Ohms law: R = VI , meaning that resistance is equal to the proportion of velocity to current. resistance: The effect of the movement of electrons through a wire, which is not smooth. 
Introduction 	  We discussed voltage and electrical current earlier. At that time, we took for granted that a wire connected to the terminals of a battery should conduct an electrical current. As we will see, there is a very important relationship between current I and potential difference V which we shall shortly discuss. We begin with a few brief statements concerning batteries and current flow. 
Batteries and  Current 	  We often use the flow of water to model some of the properties of electrical current, although they are two very different things. Water may be stored in a tank just as electrical charge (and electrical energy) may be stored in a battery (or a capacitor). The first battery was constructed in 1800 by the Italian physicist Allessandro Volta (1745-1827), Figure 17.4. This was the first device that provided a continuous flow of electricity. Prior to this, the only type of electrical current created in the laboratory was the rapid discharge of an electrical spark. Voltas invention sparked the beginning of a new age. Voltas basic battery construction has not changed in the last two hundred years. Batteries are made of two different metals which react with a liquid called an electrolyte, and cause one of the metals to become positively charged and the other to become negatively charged. We refer to the positive and negative parts of the battery as the terminals of the battery. If one end of a conducting wire is connected to the positive terminal of a battery and the other end is connected to the negative terminal of the battery, a direct current will exist in the wire because of the potential difference between the terminals. The symbol DC is often used when referring to direct current. It was once assumed (incorrectly) that an electrical current in metals was a flow of positive charge. In spite of discovering the error, scientists have maintained that assumption. A positive flow of charge is referred to as conventional current flow. Diagrams showing conventional current have an arrow directed from the positive to the negative terminal of the battery (or whatever source is used to create a potential difference) as shown in Figure 17.5. The left side of the figure is shown in red, indicating that this terminal of the circuit is at a potential of 6 V. The right terminal of the figure is shown in blue, indicating that this side of the circuit is at a potential of 0 V. It is only the potential difference of the battery that is meaningful. Assigning one terminal a potential of 6 V and the other terminal is 0 V is arbitrary. We could just as well, for example, assign potentials of 20 V and 26 V to the negative and positive terminals of the battery, respectively (though this would be needlessly confusing). a. A small lightbulb has a 6V potential difference applied to it, as shown in Figure 17.5. If the wire at point a in the figure is disconnected from the positive terminal of the battery and reconnected to the negative terminal of the battery, and the wire at point b is disconnected from the negative terminal of the battery and reconnected to the positive terminal of the battery (that is, the wires are reversed), will the bulb remain lighted? Answer: Yes. As long as a potential difference remains across the bulb, the bulb remains lit. b. Is the current flowing through the bulb in the same direction? Answer: No. If the wires are reversed, the direction of current is reversed. The potential difference, which is responsible for the current, is often likened to water pressure. The pressure in a water storage tank makes it possible for the water to be transferred to connecting pipes and eventually to its destination. A battery puts forth electrical pressure called potential difference, or voltage. The voltage is responsible for conveying an electrical current. Care should be taken in extending mechanical analogies, like flowing water, to a flow of electricity, as explained below. Conventional current flow: A positive flow of current through a light bulb. The red wire is connected to the positive terminal of the battery. Water pipes may initially be full or empty of water. If the pipes are full, then the pressure is conveyed very quickly and water at any point within a pipe flows. If the pipes are empty, then there will be a noticeable time delay before the water can move from the tank through the pipes to its destination. Think of a long garden hose. On the other The red wire is now connected to the negative terminal of the battery; the motor runs in the opposite direction. hand, electrical wires are never empty. There is no such thing as a conducting wire that is empty of electrons Our analogy can be continued, however, with friction. An electrical current, just as a flow of water, encounters resistance. When potential difference is applied to the ends of a wire, electrons are compelled to move through the wire. But their movement does not happen in an orderly fashion like a troop of marching soldiers. Their movement is more like that of people running through a crowded train station. The effect produces an analogue to mechanical friction called electrical resistance. 
Ohms  Law 	  It was a French physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787-1854) Figure 17.8, who first proposed that a current I is directly proportional to a potential difference (voltage) V ? I ? V for metallic conductors, as long as the conductor does not heat up too much. Otherwise, the relationship does not remain linear. Ohms law is, therefore, only applicable if heating does not alter the characteristics of the circuit. In general, heating does have an effect on most circuits, and thus Ohms law has a very limited range of usefulness. Ohms law is not really a law, if by law we mean a universally correct brief statement explaining a broad expanse of phenomena. An electric current, as mentioned above, is subject to resistance. If the voltage remains constant and the resistance increases by a certain factor, the electric current decreases by the same factor. The current I is, therefore, inversely proportional to the resistance R 
I ?  	  If the resistance is defined with units VA, it can be shown that the proportionality constant is one. Therefore, 
Ohms law can then be stated as  R =  	  In honor of Georg Simon Ohm the unit of resistance is called the ohm. The ohm is represented using the Greek symbol capital omega ?. V?s) 
 	  If a potential difference of one volt produces an electric current of one ampere, then a resistance of one ohm is present in the circuit. Find the current in an electrical circuit with a voltage source of 12 V and a resistance of 30 ?.

Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how to solve problems involving resistivity. Understand how to read the resistor code. resistivity: A constant of proportionality which depends upon the material used to make the wire, expressed in units ??m. resistor: Electric components whose only purpose is to add resistance to a circuit. semiconductors: Materials that fall between the two extremes of conductors and insulators. Semiconductors permit a limited amount of electron flow and are very useful in constructing electronic devices. superconductors: Materials that lose resistance when cooled to near absolute zero. 
Introduction 	  If you have ever been in an electrical supply store, you may have noticed that some wires are very thin and some are very thick. The thickness (the diameter) of a wire is called the gauge of the wire. Wires with small gauge numbers have larger diameters than wires with large gauge numbers 
Resistivity 	  The resistance of a given wire depends upon its cross-sectional area and its length. One wire that has twice the diameter of another wire has four times the cross-sectional area of the smaller wire. It is four times easier for the electrons to travel through a wire that has twice the diameter of another wire. Conversely, the longer the wire is, the more resistance the electrons encounter. It is easier to move through a short tunnel filled with people than a long tunnel filled with people! We can sum up these statements mathematically as follows: The resistance R is directly proportional to the length L of a wire and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area A of the wire ? R = ?AL, where ?, a constant of proportionality, is called the resistivity which depends upon the material used to make the wire. The units of resistivity ? are ??m. A quantity called the conductivity expressed using the Greek letter sigma ? is defined as the reciprocal of the resistivity ? =. The greater the conductivity is, the smaller amount of resistance in the circuit; and therefore, the greater current in the circuit. The resistivity is determined experimentally. When the same voltage is applied to wires of different materials, but of identical cross section and length, different currents are measured. For example, under identical conditions, a copper wire conducts almost 60 times the current than a nichrome wire (an alloy of nickel, iron, and chromium). Which wire do you think has greater resistivity? Table 17.1 gives resistivity values for some common conducting materials at 20?C. Resistivity values are sensitive to changes in temperature and differ for different materials. TABLE 17.1: 
Illustrative  Example 18.2.1 	  A copper wire is to replace an aluminum wire of length 1.2010?1 m in an electrical circuit. The copper wire has a cross-sectional area which is 80% of the aluminum wire. The resistance of the circuit must remain the same. What length of copper wire must be used? Assume the temperature remains constant at 20?C in the circuit. Answer: 
Raluminum = ?al  Lalal and  Rcopper = ?c  Lcc 	  Since the resistances must be equal, 
Lal	 Lc	?al  Ac 	  ?al	= ?c	? Lc =	Lal ? Aal	Ac	?c Aal 
Semiconductors 	  As we mentioned earlier, charges move readily in conductors and do not move at all in insulators (nonconductors). There are materials, however, that fall in between these two extremes. They are called semiconductors. Semiconductors permit a limited amount of electron flow and are very useful in constructing electronic devices. Common semiconductors are silicon, germanium, and carbon. The resistors discussed below are often made from carbon. Semiconductors are used in the construction of electronic components such as transistors and diodes, to name just two. 
Superconductors 	  In the early 20th century, it was discovered that when certain materials were cooled to near absolute zero, they lost all their resistance. Materials displaying this attribute are called superconductors. Superconductors hold great promise in producing devices that require much less energy since electrical resistance, as we will see in this chapter, converts a good deal of electrical energy into unwanted heat. Of course, the practical use of superconductors is very limited by the necessity to keep them at extremely low temperatures. However, some advances have been made in recent years. Scientists have learned to manufacture materials that become superconducting at temperatures as high as 160 K(?113?C). 
Resistors 	  Every electrical device (and every circuit) has some amount of resistance. There are, however, circumstances when additional resistance is required in a circuit. Resistance can help protect delicate circuitry by limiting the current through a particular segment (branch) of a circuit. In order to add the required resistance to a circuit, electronic components are made called resistors (adding resistance is not their only purpose). Resistors have resistances that range from one ohm to millions of ohms. Figure 17.9 shows some common resistors found in electronic equipment. The colorful bands on the resistors are a code used to designate the amount of resistance of the resistor. For example, the fifth resistor from the left in Figure 17.9 has a sequence of colors: Green, Blue, Green, Silver: The first two colors represent 56 (see code) the third color represents the multiplier Green = 100 k. Therefore the resistor has 56  100 k ohms of resistance or 5.6  106 ?. The last color represents the tolerance of the resistor. This is a measure of accuracy. Silver is 10%, which means that the actual resistance of the resistor lies somewhere between ten percent above to ten percent below the stated value of ? 5.6106 ?(5.6105 ?) ? 6,160,000?5.040,000 ? 6.2106 ??5.0106 ?

Objectives 	  The student will: Be able to distinguish between a series and parallel circuit. Solve problems involving circuits with resistors. Joule heating: The rate at which the energy (power) is dissipated through a resistor. parallel circuit: A circuit in which the current has more than one pathway available. series circuit: A circuit in which the current has just one pathway between the positive and negative terminal of the battery. 
Introduction 	  An electrician who wires a house and an electrical engineer who is charged with constructing a complicated piece of electronic circuitry must both understand how to read a schematic. A schematic is a diagram showing the locations of the electrical components in electrical circuits. Schematics are usually very involved diagrams showing many different electrical elements interacting with each other. Our goal in this section will be to analyze a small part of what might be included in large schematic diagrams; well refer to these diagrams as circuit diagrams. 
Symbols 	  Circuit diagrams consist of symbols which represent power sources (we will use batteries), resistors, capacitors (see Chapter Applications of Electrical Energy) and many other components. The symbol for a battery: The longer line is taken as the positive terminal of the battery. The symbol for a resistor: The symbol for a capacitor: The symbol for a switch: 
Assumptions  Regarding  Wires and  Batteries 	  The wires used to connect the elements of a circuit are usually assumed to have much smaller resistance than the elements themselves. We will assume that the resistances of the wires are negligible unless otherwise stated. 
Voltage  Drop 	  The phrase voltage drop is used when a current passes through a resistor. Let us follow the conventional current from the positive terminal of the battery where the potential is highest (understanding that the current in an electrical circuit is established almost instantaneously). If a current passes through a resistor, there must be a drop in potential across the resistor. The drop in potential is analogous to the drop in gravitational potential for a series of descending stairs. The gravitational potential of the highest stair is similar to the potential at the positive battery terminal. Each descending stair signifies another drop in potential, analogous to a sequence of resistors over which the voltage drops as the current moves from one resistor to another. The ground level is the negative side of the battery-that is, the lower-potential terminal. 
Resistors in  Series 	  Resistors are connected in series if the current through them is the same, as shown in Figure 17.11. If any one element in a series circuit fails (or is no longer capable of conducting current), none of the other elements in the series circuit will conduct current either. Figure 17.11 shows two resistors in series. Notice how the current has no choice but to flow through each resistor. 
Computing the  Equivalent  Resistance of a  Series  Circuit 	  and another voltage drop across R2 (from orange to purple). The voltage drop across both resistors (red to purple) is 12V. What are the voltage drops across each resistor? Using Ohms law, we can find the voltage drop across each resistor. V1 = IR1 = I(10.0 ?) and V2 = IR2 = I(6.0 ?) 
The total voltage drop must be 	  V1 +V2 ? IR1 +IR2 = I(R1 +R2) ? Vtotal = I(Requivalent) ? R1 +R2 = 10.0 ?+6.0 ? = 16.0 ? In general, the total or equivalent resistance of a series circuit is the sum of the individual resistors. Rseries equivalent = R1 +R2 +... The circuit in Figure 17.12 is equivalent to a circuit with one 16 ? resistor. 
I =   	  URL 
Resistors in  Parallel 	  In a parallel circuit the current has more than one pathway available. The current encounters one or more junctions. A junction is a point at which two or more wires connect. Resistors will not necessarily have the same current passing through them. The voltage drop across each of the resistors in parallel, however, must be the same. Electrical devices connected in parallel (say, two light bulbs) permit one bulb to burn out and the other to remain lit. This is how homes are wired. If youve ever experienced the consequences of a burned-out fuse or tripped a circuit breaker (well discuss these in greater detail in the next section) then youre familiar with some electrical appliances remaining on, while others are off. The appliances (and lights) that wont turn on must be in series with a failed part of the circuitry. 
Itotal =  I1 + I2 or  Iin =  Iout 	  Notice that the voltage drop across each resistor (from red to purple) is 12 volts. 
Computing the  Equivalent  Resistance of a  Parallel  Circuit 	  Keeping in mind that the voltage drops are the same, we use V = IR. 
But  Itotal 	  And, Itotal = RequivalentV	?V . In general, the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance for a parallel circuit is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances. A little algebra will show that for two resistors the total, or equivalent, resistance is Rparallel equivalent = RR11+RR22 . 
The total resistance in  Figure 17.13 is 	  Rparallel equivalent . The circuit is equivalent to a circuit with one 3.75 ? resistor. The total current in the circuit is then: I = . The equivalent resistance for resistors in a series circuit is always greater than the resistance of any one resistor in the circuit. Conversely, the equivalent resistance for resistors in a parallel circuit is always smaller than the resistance of any one resistor in the circuit. In a series circuit, the current has but one pathway from the positive to the negative terminal of the battery. Its comparable to a traffic jam where there is no alternate route. The traffic moves very slowly. If the current is reduced, it is a sign that the total resistance in the circuit has increased. Conversely, if an alternate route becomes available, the traffic moves faster, since there is more than one pathway available. If the current increases, it is a sign that the total resistance in the circuit has decreased. The latter case is comparable to a parallel circuit where there are multiple branches through which the current can travel. URL URL Answer: The resistances are in series. The total voltage across the entire circuit is 12 volts. The sum of voltage drop V1 and of voltage drop V2 must equal 12 volts. The current through each resistor is the same (see above). The voltage drop across R1 is V1 = IR1. The voltage drop across R2 is V2 = IR2. 
V2 =  R2 = (0.75  A)(6.0 ?) = 4.5  	  Notice that the sum of the voltage drops is 12 volts. Note that series circuits are sometimes referred to as voltage dividers. Resistors provide for different voltages in different parts of the circuit, thus permitting for an array of voltage sources throughout the circuit. Answer: The resistors are in parallel. The voltage drop across each resistor is 12 volts. The sum of the currents in each resistor must equal the total current, 3.2 A (see above). The current in resistor R1 is I1 = RV1 . The current in resistor R2 is I2 = RV2 . 
I  	  Notice that the sum of the currents is 3.2 A. Note that parallel circuits are sometimes referred to as current dividers. In this case, resistors can provide different currents in different parts of the circuit. Answer: Do not be fooled by the intentionally confusing look of the circuit. The current has only one path through both resistors. The resistors are therefore in series. URL 
Electrical  Power 	  We used the term "power" earlier, when we discussed the rate at which energy is used or produced. The name for the unit of power is watt. Perhaps youve seen the word "watt on a package of incandescent light bulbs (perhaps 40Watt, or 60-Watt). That number indicates the power consumption of the light bulb. A 40-W light bulb, for example, draws from the electric grid 40 Joules of energy every second. The average power was defined earlier as the rate at which work is done, that is, Power = worktime ? P = Wt	Equation A. Recall that the work W done in moving a charge q across a potential difference V is W = qV. Substituting qV for work in Equation A, we have P = Wt = qVt = qt V = IV ? Pelectric power = IV Recall that charge per unit time is current qt = I the current. Thus, In the case of the plug mentioned earlier, the power output is the result of a steady (not alternating) voltage of 
The power is therefore 	  P = IV = (20010?3 A)(7.5 V) = 1.5 W. A 60-W incandescent light bulb is powered by a typical 120V AC household electrical outlet. What average current passes through the bulb? Note: 120 VAC is an average value. 
Illustrative  Example 17.4.2 	  a. Utility companies charge customers in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh). Do utility companies charge for energy consumption or power consumption? Answer: 
Unit analysis gives k Wh = energytime time = energy 	  b. How much energy is 1.0 kWh? Answer: c. What is the cost for running a 1,500-W heater for 10 hours, if the cost per kWh is 12 cents? Answer: Energy used equals: E = kWh = 1.5 kW 10 H = 15 kWh ? During a cold winter month, if this heater is used for 10 hours per day for an entire month, the cost is $54.00 for the month, just for this one device! 
Joule  Heating 	  The equation P = IV is true for any electrical device. We can therefore use this equation to compute the power dissipated through a resistor. The rate at which the energy (power) is dissipated through a resistor is referred to as Joule heating. Using the equation V = IR, the Joule heating for a resistor is P = IV = I(IR) = I2R, assuming the resistance is constant, or P = IV = VRV = VR2 , assuming the resistance is constant. The rate of energy transfer can be so high, that unless care is taken, a resistor will not be able to transfer the heat quickly enough to the air before overheating and burning out. Installing a resistor with a low power rating when one with a higher rating should have been used can ruin an expensive piece of equipment. You can easily see the effect of Joule heating with an incandescent light bulb. It has a thin tungsten filament which heats ups very quickly. You dont want to touch an incandescent bulb even if its only been turned on for a minute. Why? Because 90% of the energy used to light an incandescent bulb is given off as heat. Incandescent light bulbs are very inefficient (if youre interested in the light from the bulb and not the heat!). The Joule heating of energy-efficient light bulbs is considerably less, and therefore requires a smaller amount of energy to produce the same amount of light. 
Illustrative  Example 18.3.1 	  a. A 10? hasW rating. Meaning, any power greater than this will burn the resistor out. Will the resistor burn out if it is connected to a 6.0V battery? Solution: The current through the resistor must be found in order to answer the question. Using Ohms law we have: 
P =  V = (0.60  A)(6.0  V) = 3.6  	  The resistor will definitely burn out. b. What is the maximum current that the resistor can handle without burning out? Answer: 
P   	  c. What is the maximum voltage drop across the resistor? Answer: V = IR = (0.158 A)(10 ?) = 1.58 ? 1.6 V 
Illustrative  Example 18.3.2 	  a. Determine the equivalent resistance of the circuit below. Answer: After the current passes through the 10? resistor, there is a junction in the circuit where the current splits up. The current I12 passes through the 12? resistor, and the current I24 passes through the 24? resistor. The 12? resistor and 24? resistor are in parallel and experience the same voltage drop. 
The equivalent resistance for the parallel resistors is 	  Requivalent = RR11+RR22 =  = 8 ? The circuit can be redrawn as seen below. The 10? resistor and the 8? resistor are in series. The equivalent resistance of the circuit is therefore, Requivalent = 10 ?+8 ? = 18 ? The final circuit is drawn below. b. What is the battery current in the circuit? Answer: V = IR ? 20 V = I(18 ?) ? Itotal = 1820 V? = A c. What is the current through each resistor? Answer: The 10? resistor: The current has not split up until after passing the 10? resistor, therefore: 
Itotal =  	  The 12? resistor: We need to determine the voltage drop across the 12? resistor. This is done by determining the voltage drop across the 10? resistor. 
 	  The voltage drop across the 12? resistor must be V. The current through the 12 ? resistor is, therefore: 
V  	  The 24? resistor: We will solve this two ways: 
V  	  Notice that the current in the 24? resistor is half of that in the 12? resistor. Since the resistors are in parallel, the voltage drop across each resistor is the same, thus: 
I12 R12 =  I24 R24 ?  I1224 =  R2412 	  Therefore, a resistor with twice the resistance will have half the current. If a very large resistance is in parallel with a very small resistance, most of the current will pass through the small resistance. This may present a danger to the electronic element with the small resistance from joule heating. d. What joule heating does the 24? resistor experience?

Capacitors in  Electrical  Circuits 	  In an earlier discussion, we mentioned that capacitors can store and release energy. A camera flash was given as an example of a discharge of energy by a capacitor. The capacitor becomes fully charged (not instantly, of course) after the switch S1 is closed. The time for the capacitor to fully charge depends upon the capacitance of the capacitor and the resistor R in the circuit. When the capacitor is fully charged, the current will cease, and the potential difference between the plates of the capacitor will equal the voltage of the battery, V. If the switch S1 is now open, disconnecting the battery from the capacitor, and the switch S2 is closed, the capacitor will discharge through the lamp L. The lamp will initially glow very bright and then begin to dim as the current from the capacitor diminishes. This is the way a camera flash operates. URL 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how an ammeter is used. Understand how a voltmeter is used. ammeter: A device used to measure currents. voltmeter: A device used to measure voltages. 
Introduction 	  There are two basic devices used to measure the currents and voltages of electrical circuits. The ammeter is used to measure currents and a voltmeter is used to measure voltages. 
The  Ammeter 	  An ammeter is always inserted in series with other electronic components, since it is used to measure the current in a circuit. Ammeter A1 reads the battery current through the circuit. Since Figure 17.15 is identical to the diagram of Example Ammeter A2 reads the current through the 12? resistor: A2 = A. Ammeters must have a very small resistance. Otherwise, they would add a significant amount of resistance to the circuit and affect the very current they are meant to measure. It is very important not to connect an ammeter in parallel in a circuit. As stated above, a small resistance in such circumstances draws a large current. The ammeter may well be damaged from the resulting joule heating. 
The  Voltmeter 	  A voltmeter is always connected in parallel with other electronic components since it is used to measure the potential difference across a circuit element. Voltmeter V1 reads V1 = V and Voltmeter V2 reads V2 =	V. See Example 18.3.2. A voltmeter must have a very high resistance, which means it draws a very small amount of current from the battery and therefore does not add a substantial amount of current to the circuit while performing its task. That way, the voltmeter is able to read the voltage across an electronic component without affecting the circuit. If a voltmeter were placed in series in a circuit, it would not be in danger of burning out like an ammeter in parallel, but it would seriously reduce the amount of current in the circuit, and be of no use. 
Electrical  Safety 	  What would happen if a wire were connected to the positive terminal and the negative terminals of a battery? The resistance of a typical wire is very small and therefore a huge current would result. The battery would soon discharge and become useless. However, there is also the chance that the Joule heating of the wire may cause an electrical fire. The insulation covering the wire could melt and then perhaps burn. The battery may even explode! A situation where the positive and negative terminals of a power source are directly connected or a component of a circuit is bypassed, is called an electrical short or a short circuit There are times in a household when too many electrical appliances are connected to a circuit and draw too much current. This also can cause too much heating in the wires, which may lead to an electrical fire. To protect against too much current (amperage) in the circuit, fuses or circuit breakers are placed in series within the circuit. Fuses enclosed in glass, which were once used in home service panels, had a thin wire that melted if a certain amount of current was going through (usually, 15 A or 20 A). Most automobiles fuses are still enclosed in glass. All new buildings today are equipped with circuit breakers. They are much more convenient than the older glassenclosed fuses, which needed to be replaced once they burned out. Circuit breakers use an electromagnetic switch, opening the circuit when there is too much current. Circuit breakers can be flipped back into the proper position and the current will flow once more. Nothing needs to be replaced. Another very important safety precaution is making sure that an electrical circuit is grounded. A circuit that is grounded provides a path for current from the metallic casing of an electrical appliance to, literally, the ground (or metal connected to the ground). If you look at most electrical power cords, youll see three prongs. One prong is at an average potential of 120 V (the live wire), the other at 0 V (the neutral wire). These two prongs provide for a potential difference of 120 V in order for an appliance to draw current. The third prong (the ground wire) is not a part of the circuit. It is connected to the metal casing of the appliance and to ground. Under normal conditions, the third prong carries no current. An electrical short occurs when the intended path of the current bypasses the appliance and goes directly back to the voltage source, or directly to ground. For example, if the wire connected to the 120 V prong loses insulation and comes into contact with the casing of an appliance, anyone who touches the appliance provides a shortened path for the current back to ground, unless the appliance is grounded by the third prong. If the appliance is properly grounded, the short circuit will now be between the casing and the ground, and the person will be protected. V = IR, which is often referred to as Ohms Law

Magnetism 	  We are familiar with magnets mostly as devices to stick to a refrigerator, or perhaps as the inner working of a compass. Magnetic fields really are related to electricity. A permanent magnet like a refrigerator magnet or a compass needle creates a magnetic field from the inner motion of its electrons. However, any moving charge can create a magnetic field, however, small. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Know how to determine the direction of a permanent magnetic field. Know that a current-carrying wire creates a magnetic field. Know how to determine the direction of the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire. magnetic domains: Certain regions of a material that align with the Earths external magnetic field. These regions are responsible for the magnetic properties of the material. magnetic poles: The two end of a magnet, known as the north pole and the south pole. Like poles repel each other, and opposite poles attract each other. Magnetic poles always come in pairs. magnetism: Certain materials, because of their atomic structure, will have their atoms align parallel to an external magnetic field. right-hand rule: Used to determine the directio of the magnetic field around a wire. Point the thumb of the right hand in the direction of the (conventional) current and then curl the fingers into a fist. The fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field around the wire. 
Introduction 	  Magnets are common items in our daily lives. Playing around with some magnets, we can see some basic features: Magnets exert force on each other, as well as on certain metals. This force is strongest when they are touching, but also acts at a distance. Magnets can either attract or repel each other, depending on how they are held. A bit of playing around with real magnets will show that there are two faces to the magnet. Held one way, two magnets attract each other, but if you flip one of them around, the magnets then repel each other. We call the two ends of the magnet the magnetic poles. Each magnet has a north pole and a south pole. Similar to electric charges, like poles repel and opposite poles attract. Unlike electric charges, though, magnetic poles always come in pairs. Every magnet has one north pole and one south pole. If you break a magnet in half, each half will have its own pair of two poles. 
Magnetic  Compasses 	  The basic properties of magnets have been known since ancient times, based on observations of natural lodestones. The first person to describe a magnetic needle compass was the Chinese scientist Shen Kuo (10311095), who described that when a magnetic material is freely suspended, it tends to align itself in a north-south direction. Since magnets line up with each other, this fact led to the reasonable conclusion that the Earth itself behaves as a magnet. By convention, we define the north magnetic pole of a compass needle as the pole that points northward, and the south magnetic pole of a compass needle as the pole that points southwards. In 1269, the Frenchman Pierre de Maricourt used a magnetic needle and a spherical magnet, inspired by the shape of the Earth, to map out the shape of what we know today as the magnetic field lines of the Earth. It is important to know that the north geographic pole and the south magnetic pole are not located at exactly the same spot (same goes for the south geographic pole and the north magnetic pole). The magnetic poles of the Earth are not fixed, but migrate all over the globe. We know today that magnetism is the result of the atomic alignment of large numbers of atomic magnets. By this we mean (roughly) that certain materials, because of their atomic structure, will have their atoms align parallel to an external magnetic field. This process is very similar to an array of compass needles aligning in the same direction, in parallel, with in the Earths magnetic field. The entire material does not have its atoms align. Only certain regions of the material called magnetic domains align with the external field. These regions then are responsible for the magnetic properties of the material. During volcanic eruptions, molten rock containing magnetic materials is very susceptible to having magnetic domains form. The alignment of the atoms within the magnetic domains indicates the direction of the Earths magnetic field at the time the rock solidified. Thus, they offer a record over many thousands and millions of years of the orientation of the Earths magnetic field at different moments in time. Such rocks indicate that the magnetic field of the Earth is very dynamic and does not stay in one place. In fact, we know that within a few decades, the magnetic field of the Earth will be a good deal off from its present location. It wasnt until 1750 that a mathematical relationship was determined, much like Newtons universal law of gravity and Coulombs law for electrostatic charges, for the forces that one magnetic pole exerted upon the other. It was Coulomb who determined it. One of the major difficulties with a mathematical description of the magnetic force is in the determination of exactly where the pole of a magnet resides. As tempting as it is to think of magnetism in the same terms as we think of electrostatics, it would be incorrect. Isolated electric charges do exist in nature. As far as we know, there is no such thing as an isolated magnetic pole. One or more north magnetic poles cannot be separated from one or more south magnetic poles. Magnetic poles always remain in pairs. Break a bar magnet in half and youll have two smaller bar magnets with two poles each. 
A  Magnetic  Field 	  Michael Faradays description of the lines of force surrounding an electric charge is also useful when we discuss magnetic phenomena. Just as we imagine an electric field E surrounding electrical charges, we also imagine a magnetic field B surrounding a magnet. The field lines of the magnetic field, however, do not begin on the north pole of the magnet and end on the south pole of the magnet. Because magnetic poles come only in pairs, the magnetic field lines between the poles of a magnet form closed loops. However, the magnetic field, like the electric field, has a magnitude and a direction at every point in space, and thus is a vector quantity. 
The  Earths  Magnetic  Field 	  The magnetic field surrounding the Earth is similar to the field produced by a permanent bar magnet, Figure 18.2. (The magnetic field of the Earth is more complicated, but the model is a useful starting point.) A compass needle that is moved from the north-pole to south-pole of a bar magnet shows the same alignment as a compass needle that is moved near the surface of the Earth (illustrated in the top half of the figure). Your teacher may show you a demonstration using iron filings which dramatically outline the field lines of a bar magnet (illustrated in the lower half of the figure). URL 
Magnetism from an  Electric  Current 	  During the early 18th century, physicists were looking for possible connections between electrical and magnetic phenomena. In 1820, Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851), made the discovery that a current-carrying wire created a magnetic field. Oersted arranged a long straight conducting wire and a compass as shown in Figure 18.2 to show the magnetic field around the wire. Figure 18.3 shows iron filings aligned with the magnetic field around the wire. As soon as a current was initiated in the wire, the compass needle deflected. A magnetic force must be present, produced by an electric current! The compass needle aligned itself perpendicular to the direction of the current. Moving the compass in a plane perpendicular to the wire showed that a magnetic field circled around the wire as in Figure 18.2 and Figure 18.3. 
The  Direction of the  Magnetic  Field for a  Current- Carrying  Wire 	  The direction of the magnetic field around a wire can be found using the right-hand rule. Point the thumb of the right hand in the direction of the (conventional) current and then curl the fingers into a fist. The fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field around the wire. Figure 18.4 shows the magnetic field represented as a series of circles around the wire. If the current were in the opposite direction, the field would circle around the wire in the opposite direction. URL 
Magnetic  Field of a  Current- Carrying  Loop/ Coil of  Wire 	  Imagine forming a loop from a long, straight wire. What would the magnetic field of the loop of wire look like? Using the right-hand rule, point your thumb in the direction of the current and imagine your hand moving around the wire. Your fingers would curl, showing the magnetic field as circles through and around the wire as shown in Figure 18.5. Of course, a compass would work just as well for a loop of wire as s straight wire in showing the field. Now, imagine multiple turns of wire, as shown in Figure 18.6.	The magnetic field through the loops would be greatly increased.	The coil shown in Figure 18.6 is often called a solenoid.	Another name for a solenoid is an electromagnet. If the north pole of a bar magnet (or a thin iron rod) is brought close to bottom of the solenoid, it will be attracted (pulled) into the solenoid. If the solenoid is disconnected from the battery (say, by a switch) the magnet will no longer be attracted to the solenoid. Solenoids have many practical applications. The first telegraph system operated by turning an electromagnet on and off which, in turn, attracted a magnetic object (the telegraph key). The key produced a series of clicks as it struck the electromagnet. Nowadays, solenoids are used, for instance, as electromagnetic switches in the ignition system of automobiles. URL 
Objectives 	  The student will: Know under which conditions a current-carrying wire experiences a force when placed in a magnetic field. Use the right-hand rule to determine the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. Solve problems involving the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. 
Introduction 	  If a current-carrying wire is able to exert a force upon a magnet, is it possible for a magnet to exert an equal and opposite force on a current-carrying wire? Newtons Third Law suggests this should be so. 
Current- Carrying  Wires in  Magnetic  Fields 	  In Figure 18.7, a current-carrying wire with current I is placed between the south and north magnetic poles of a magnet. The magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the direction of the current in the wire. Under these circumstances, the wire is observed to be pushed toward the reader (out of the page). If the current in the wire is reversed, the wire is observed to be pushed away from the reader (into the page.). We use a slightly different version of the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. Aim your fingers in the direction of the current I and curl your hand toward the direction of the magnetic field B as shown in Figure 18.8 and Figure 18.9. The direction your thumb points is the direction of the force F on the current-carrying wire. The symbol with the circle and the dot below represents a vector with the force directed out of the page. The symbol with the circle and the cross below represents a vector with the force directed into the page. Notice that the force F is perpendicular to the plane formed by the current-carrying wire and the magnetic field. The result is a rather unintuitive one. The force is not in the direction of the magnetic field. It is perpendicular to it! URL The magnitude of the force is found experimentally to equal the product of the current, I the length of wire L, the magnetic field B, and the sine of the angle between the vector L (in the direction of the current) and the direction of the magnetic field. When the current is parallel to the magnetic field lines, the force is zero, and when the current is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines, the force is at a maximum. The magnitude of the force on a straight current-carrying wire within a magnetic field is given by F = ILBsin?. The magnetic field B can then be expressed as B = ILsinF ?. The units of B are, therefore, AN?m. We define the derived unit AN?m as a tesla (T) in honor of the physicist and inventor Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), Figure 18.10. For more information on the magnetic forces between current-carrying wires, see the link below. URL A wire of length 0.600 m carrying a current of 2.50 A, placed perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, experiences a force of 2.75 N. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field where the wire is located? Answer: 
Illustrative  Example 19.2.1 	  A rectangular current-carrying loop of wire with constant current I is placed in a uniform magnetic field B such that the plane of the loop is perpendicular to the magnetic field, Figure 18.11. What is the net force acting on the loop? Answer: Using the right-hand rule, we find that the force FCD on segment CD is directed away from the reader. The current direction in segment AB is opposite the direction of the current in segment CD, so the right-hand rule shows that the force FAB on segment AB is directed toward the reader. The magnitudes of FCD and FAB are the same, since the lengths of both segments of wire are equal. Applying the right-hand rule to segment BC of the loop, we find that a force FBC on the wire is directed to the right. The direction of the current in segment DA of the loop is opposite to that in segment BC of the loop. The right-hand rule shows that the force FDA is directed to the left. The magnitudes of FBC and FDA are the same, since the lengths of both segments of the loop are equal. The net force on the loop of wire is, therefore, zero. The above argument can extend to non-rectangular loops, as well. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Know under which conditions a moving electric charge experiences a force when placed in a magnetic field. Use the right-hand rule in order to determine the force on a moving electric charge in a magnetic field. Solve problems involving the force acting on a moving electric charge in a magnetic field. 
Introduction 	  Electrically charged particles are everywhere. The sun sends forth an array of ionized particles into our solar system and into deep space, Figure 18.12. Some of the particles are trapped by the Earths magnetic field and are responsible for interfering with electronic communication. Others initiate a chain of events culminating in the eerie and beautiful Aurora Borealis (the northern lights seen in high northern latitudes), Figure 18.13, and Aurora Australis (the southern lights seen in high southern latitudes). In the next section, we will investigate the effect that magnetic fields have on moving charges. The Force on a Moving Electric Charge in a Magnetic Field The force on a single charge moving through a magnetic field can be found by considering the force on a currentcarrying wire. A current is just the movement of many charged particles within a conductor. Using the definition of current, we have I = ??Qt = Nq?t , where N is the total number of charges within the conductor, and q is the electric charge. Substituting I = Nq?t into F = ILBsin? gives: F = Nq?t LBsin? (Equation A). The displacement of a charge can be considered the length of the wire L, and therefore L = v?t, where v is the velocity of the charge. 
Substituting v?t into  Equation  A gives 	  F = Nq?t v?tBsin? = NqvBsin?. The force per charge is, therefore, NF = qvBsin? ? Fon one charge = qvBsin?. The subscript above is dropped and it is understood that the force experienced by a charged particle moving through a magnetic field is F = qvBsin?. The angle ? is the angle between the vectors representing velocity and the magnetic field. 
Determining the  Direction of the  Force on a  Charged  Particle 	  The right-hand rule can be used in order to determine the direction of the force acting on a charged particle as it moves through a magnetic field. As with a current-carrying wire, we point our fingers in the direction of motion of the charged particle (the direction of its velocity), and curl our fingers into the direction of the magnetic field. The outstretched thumb gives the direction of the force acting on the particle. The particle is assumed to have positive charge. If the particle is negatively charged, the force will be opposite to the direction the thumb points. The force is always perpendicular to the plane formed by the velocity vector of the charge and the magnetic field direction. For a practical example of how magnetic fields can be used with moving charges see the link below. URL A proton moving with velocity 8.5 106 ms enters a constant magnetic field of 2.15 T at an angle of 30? to the field as shown in Figure 18.15. What is the magnitude and direction of the force acting on the proton? Answer: The charge of the proton is 1.610?19 C. 
F = qv B  	  The direction of the force is into the v?B plane away from the reader (note that a proton is a positively charged particle, so we apply the right-hand rule without flipping the final result). 
Illustrative  Example 19.3.1 	  An electron moves in a plane perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field. a. The magnitude of the force it experiences is: Answer: The answer is 3. Since the electron moves perpendicular to the magnetic field, it experience the maximum force because the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field is 90? ? sin90? = 1 ? Fmax = qvB. b. What is the path of the electron as it moves through the magnetic field? Answer: Remember that since an electron is negatively charged, the force we determine from the right-hand rule must be reversed. At any instant, the velocity and magnetic vectors are perpendicular to each other, as shown in Figure 18.16. Since the magnetic field is uniform, the magnitude of the force on the electron is constant. The force, by the righthand rule, remains perpendicular to the velocity of the electron and therefore cannot change the electrons speedonly its direction. When a constant force acts perpendicular to the velocity of an object, the object follows circular motion. The force shown below points toward the center of the circle in which the electron travels. c. The magnetic field has magnitude 0.045 T, the velocity of the electron is 9.40  106 ms , and its mass is 9.11  10?31 kg. Find the radius of the circle in which the electron travels. Answer: Since the electron travels in a circle, it experiences a force of F = mac = mvr2 . This force is, of course, the force the electron experience due to the magnetic field Fmax = qvB. Thus, mvr2 = qvB. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand the basic operation of an electric motor. brushes: commutator electric motor: A device which converts electrical energy into mechanical work. 
Introduction 	  The electric motor is arguably, the most important invention based on the understanding that a magnetic field could exert a force on a current-carrying wire. The average person uses many electrical appliances every day that depend upon an electric motor. There are motors in washing machines, dryers, air conditioners, electric lawn mowers and electric chain saws, electric blenders, electric can-openers, electric fans, DVD players, and in many childrens toys, just to name a few. How does an electric motor work? 
The  Rectangular  Current  Loop  Revisited 	  In Example 19.2.1, a rectangular loop was placed perpendicular to the field lines of a uniform magnetic field. In such a position we showed that the net force on the loop was zero. We now consider the forces on a rectangular current-carrying loop of wire with constant current I, when placed in a uniform magnetic field B, such that the plane of the loop is parallel to the magnetic field. With such an arrangement, the magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the side (b) of the loop and parallel to the side (a) of the loop as seen in Figure 18.17. By the right-hand rule, the force on the left side ~F1 of the loop is toward the reader, and the force on the right side is away from the reader. We treat the result as a scalar quantity. F1 = ILBsin? = ILBsin90? = ILB ? F1 = ILB F2 = ILBsin? = ILBsin90? = ILB ? F2 = ?ILB Since the forces are in opposite directions, ~F1 is taken as positive and ~F2 is taken as negative. These are the only forces on the loop, since the angle between the magnetic field and the remaining sides of the current-carrying loop is zero degrees. 
F =  Bsin? =  Bsin0? = 0 	  Let us imagine that the coil is free to rotate about the dotted line shown bisecting the coil in Figure 18.17. The forces ~F1 and  both place counterclockwise torques upon the loop. Recall that the torque is defined as ? = rF sin?, where ? is the angle between the moment arm r and the force F. The angle between r and F is 90?, and therefore the net torque on the loop is ? = rF sin90? +rF sin90? = 2rF ? ? = 2rF. By substituting Equation 1 into Equation 2 the net torque can be expressed as: 
Equation 3: ? = 2r 	  The moment arm has length r = a2, and the side of the wire where the force is applied has length L = b. Upon substitution into Equation 3 we have, ? = 2rILB = 22aIbB = I(ab)B = IAB ? ?maximum = IAB, where A is the area of the loop. This is the maximum torque that the loop experiences. Once the loop begins to rotate, the angle between the moment arm 2a and the forces ~F1 and  is decreased until reaching zero degrees. This occurs when the loop in Figure 18.17 has rotated out of the page and is facing the reader. The forces ~F1 and  at this point are both parallel with the moment arm, and therefore the net torque on the loop is zero. The torque the loop experiences as it turns is therefore ? = IABsin?. 
A  C  Motor 	  In the situation above, once the loop has rotated ninety-degrees,3 the net torque is zero. The loop stops turning, see Figure 18.18. If the loop could be kept in motion, we would have an electric motor. This can be done if, at the moment the net torque on the loop is zero, the current is reversed. Then the forces ~F1 and ~F2 would point inward. The loops inertia carries it slightly past the point of zero net torque, but since the forces are now acting inward, the loop continues to turn. The process repeats thousands of times per second and we have a motor. The secret to reversing the current is shown in Figure 18.19. After the loop rotates a quarter turn, it encounters a split ring commutator (see Figure 18.19). At this instant the voltage source (a battery) no longer provides current to the loop because of the split ring. But the inertia of the coil carries it farther around and a connection is immediately re-established with the battery. The right-hand side of the coil (which had been connected to the low side of the battery) is now connected to the high side of the battery and the current through the coil is reversed. The carbon brushes provide the contacts for the battery. Attachments can be made to coil in order to perform mechanical work. Indeed, a motor is a device which converts electrical energy into mechanical work. Motors typically have thousands of coils. A greater torque can be established with numerous coils. The motor, in turn, can perform more mechanical work. The direction of the force is found using the right-hand rule: The force is perpendicular to the plane formed by the current-carrying wire and the magnetic field direction. The direction of the force is found using the right-hand rule but must be reversed if the particle is negatively charged. The force is perpendicular to the plane formed by the velocity vector of the charge and the magnetic field direction. r = mqB?

Introduction 	  We learned earlier that a current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field and that a magnetic field exerts a force on a current-carrying wire. Physicists in the first half of the 19th century believed the converse might also hold, and that a magnetic field should therefore produce an electric current. This was discovered simultaneously by two scientiststhe American physicist Joseph Henry (1797-1878) and the British physicist and chemist, Michael Faraday (1791-1867). 
Electromagnetic  Induction 	  What experiment can show that the magnetic field creates electric current? It was already known that a static (unchanging) magnetic field did not induce an electrical current within a stationary conducting wire. The thought, then, was that perhaps a changing magnetic field might cause a current. Below, we describe two experiments designed with that thought in mind. In Figure 19.1 and Figure 19.2, a bar magnet is being moved toward a loop of wire and away from a loop of wire, respectively. In each case, the loop of wire is connected to a galvanometer. (A galvanometer is a device that detects the presence of electric current. It is, essentially, a very sensitive ammeter.) While the magnet is in motion, the galvanometer detects a few microamperes of current in the loop of wire, first in one direction (right), Figure 19.1, and then in the other direction (left), Figure 19.2. Note the directions of the velocity vector (in red) of the magnet in both diagrams. How do we explain these results? When the magnet is moved toward the loop of wire, the number of magnet field lines passing through the loop changes (the magnetic field changes), and a current is registered by the galvanometer. The current is called an induced current. Notice that the direction of the galvanometer needle is to the right in the Figure 19.1, and note the direction of the induced current in the loop, as well! If the magnet is now moved away from the loop as in Figure 19.2, the magnetic field through the loop changes once again and the galvanometer needle deflects to the left. The induced current in the loop is directed opposite to the one in Figure 19.1. If the magnet is stationary (that is, if there is no change in the magnetic field), the galvanometer measures no current. The experiment would have the same set of results had the magnet been stationary and the loop of wire moved toward and away from the magnet. In this way the magnetic field as experienced by the loop would still change. It is relative motion between the magnet and loop of wire that matters. 
Faradays  Experiment 	  In Figure 19.3, a coil of wire (the primary coil) is wrapped around an iron ring. The iron ring increases the magnetic field when a current flows through the wire. The coils ends are attached to a battery. The primary coil is always attached to the battery. The other coil (the secondary coil) is wrapped around the same iron ring, its ends attached to a galvanometer. The switch is initially open and there is no current in the circuit. When the switch is closed, a current is established in the primary coil, and a magnetic field is created around the coil. The galvanometer needle deflects for an instant and quickly returns to a zero current reading, indicating that a current was established in the secondary coil for a brief moment. If the switch is opened, the current in the primary coil is turned off. As a result, the magnetic field drops to a zero. The galvanometer briefly deflects, again, but this time in the opposite direction, and returns to a zero current reading. The experiment is, essentially, the same as the one conducted with the magnet, Figure 19.1 and 19.2. In this experiment, however, the magnet was created by a current in the primary coil and the magnet was moved by closing and opening the switch. By closing the switch, the secondary coil was exposed to a changing magnetic field (the induced magnetic field lines pass through the secondary coil). The changing magnetic field produced a current in the secondary coil. As soon as the current in the primary coil became constant, the magnetic field also became constant, like a stationary magnet, and the current in the secondary coil ceased. When the switch was opened, the magnetic field collapsed, and a current was induced in the secondary coil in the opposite direction. We stated earlier that a current is produced when a potential difference (a voltage) exists between the ends of a conductor. A potential difference was established by using a battery. Faraday, however, was able to show that a voltage (and current) could be induced across a secondary coil by a changing magnetic field. No battery needed to be connected directly to the secondary coil in order to produce a voltage or current in the coil. A voltage or current created by the changing magnetic field are called, respectively, an induced voltage and an induced current. Both of the above experiments confirm that: A current may be produced by a changing magnetic field. A voltage may be produced by a changing magnetic field. 
These phenomena are typically called electromagnetic induction. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w Gf Gj B8&feature=related 	  Faraday realized that the rate at which the magnetic field changed would have an effect on the induced voltage. He also realized that the number of lines of magnetic force which crossed the coil (or loop) also needed to be taken into consideration. In order to calculate the number of field lines that pass through a loop, we define a new term called an area vector ~A, as shown in Figure 19.4. The area vector has the magnitude equal to the area enclosed by the loop (or any other enclosed surface) and the direction perpendicular (normal) to the plane of the loop (or surface). We will use the term flux to describe the number of magnetic field lines that pass through a surface. The product of the magnitude of the magnetic field vector ~B, the magnitude of the area vector ~A, and the cosine of the angle ? between them, is called the magnetic flux, represented with the Greek letter phi (?), as shown in Figure ? = BAcos? For an interactive activity involving magnetic flux, follow the link below. URL We can see from the definition of the flux that the units of flux are T ?m2. The unit of flux is called the weber, for the German physicist Wilhelm E. Weber (1804-1891), Figure 19.5. The flux is ?a = BAcos0? = BA. At point (b) the loop is rotated 45? and the number of field lines passing through the loop is smaller than in (a). The flux is ?b = BAcos45? = 0.707 BA. And at point C the loop is rotated 90?, and the number of field lines passing through the loop is zero. The flux is ?c = BAcos90? = 0. Faradays discovery is called the law of induction, which we give below: Faradays law of induction applied to a coil of N turns: The average induced voltage in a coil is equal to the product of the number of loops N(or the number of turns) in the coil, and the time rate of change in the magnetic flux ??t through the coil. ? 
 	  The negative sign indicates that the induced voltage produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the direction of the original change in the magnetic flux. This statement is known as Lenzs law. For more information on Faradays law of induction, follow the links below. URL URL 
Lenzs law 	  Lenzs law is named for the 19th century physicist Heinrich Lenz (1804-1865). In order to understand Lenzs law, consider Figure 19.1. As the north pole of the magnet is inserted into the loop, the induced current in the loop produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field (as indicated by the right-hand rule) must be equivalent to the field produced by a magnet with its north pole facing the incoming north pole of the magnet. Two north poles will, of course, repel. Thus, the induced current has set up a magnetic field to oppose the motion of the magnet. What if the reverse occurred? If the induced current were to set up a magnetic field that attracted the magnet, the flux through the loop would increase, and therefore the induced voltage would increase. But a larger voltage would produce yet a larger induced current and an even larger flux. Such a process would lead to ever-increasing induced voltages and currents, violating the law of conservation of energy. The smallest work done in pushing the magnet toward (or away from) the loop would result in more and more energy generated within the system. Instead, Lenzs law ensures that the induced current always acts to keep the flux constant by opposing whatever change in the magnetic flux that has brought the induced current to life. If the magnetic flux decreases, the induced current produces a magnetic field to increase the flux, and vice versa. Answer: This is a bit of a tricky question because specific values were cited, but none were required to find the answer. There is no relative motion between the coil and the magnetic field. Since the coil is stationary, the flux through the coil is constant. The rate of change of the flux is therefore zero, as is the induced voltage. Answer: According to Lenzs law, the induced current must produce a magnetic field that would prevent the flux from increasing. The magnetic field must be equivalent to the field of a magnet with its south pole facing the incoming south pole of the magnet. To determine the direction of the induced current, we position the right hand so that the thumb would point away from the incoming magnet. The direction of the current would be the same as the direction in which the fingers are curled. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  a. Magnetic field lines pass perpendicularly through a circular loop of wire of radius 15 cm. If the magnitude of the magnetic field changes from 3.6 T to 5.8 T in 0.18 s, what is the average induced voltage in the loop? Answer: The area of the loop is A = ?r2 = ?(1.510?1m)2 = 0.0707 ? 0.071 m2. Since the magnetic field lines pass perpendicularly though the loop, the angle between the area vector and the magnetic field is zero degrees. Thus, ? = BAcos0? = BA. The induced voltage is therefore V = ?N?(?BAt ) = ?, since there is only one loop (N = 1). According to the problem, the magnet field changes, but the area of the loop remains constant V . The negative sign indicates that the induced voltage produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the direction of the original change in magnetic flux. b. If the resistance of the loop is 16 ?, what is the induced current in the loop? Answer: Using Ohms law, I . 
Objective 	  The student will: Understand how a generator produces an electric current. alternating current: The induced current reverses direction at regular intervals. Electric generators produce an alternating current. Generating alternating current is much more energy efficient (and therefore cheaper) than using direct current. electric generator: A device which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. 
Introduction 	  We learned earlier how a motor works. Recall that a rectangular loop of wire was placed between the opposite magnetic poles so that the magnetic field lines passed through the loop. A voltage source (a battery, in our case) provided an electric current through the rectangular loop of wire. The magnetic field exerted opposite forces on the sides of the loop, creating a torque, and the loop turned. What would happen if we disconnect the battery from the motor and turn the spindle of the motor by hand, as in Figure 19.7? In such a case, the magnetic flux through the loop would change, and an induced current would be produced in the loop as shown in Figure 19.8. If the wires which were connected to the battery are now connected to, say, a small lightbulb, the bulb would light up if we spin the loop fast enough. We have effectively turned a motor into a generator! Your teacher may show A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, whereas a motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. you a demonstration of this phenomenon in class where a hand crank is attached to the motor spindle to allow for easier (and more rapid) turning. A generator is a device which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. In very simple terms, turning a coil in a magnetic field is the basis for an electric generator. It is also the way most of the electrical energy is generated around the world. The voltage provided by the electrical outlets (such as the ones found in your home) is an induced voltage, created by a generator of some sort. One of the greatest challenges nowadays is in finding cheap, renewable, and clean energy sources with which to power the generators. An example of clean energy is hydroelectric power. Falling water from dams is used to turn turbine generators, Figure 19.9. Wind is sometimes used to turn turbines as well. But most generators are driven by steam. Steam is produced by heating water. The energy used to heat the water is primarily from nonrenewable, polluting, fossil fuels and nuclear energy. 
Generators  Produce  Alternating  Current 	  Notice that as the loop turns toward the north pole of the magnet in Figure 19.8, the flux is reduced through the loop. This is analogous to moving the north pole of a magnet away from a stationary loop. As the flux decreases, the induced current produces magnetic field lines in the same direction as the permanent magnet in the figure obeying Lenzs law. However, after the loop has passed the point where there is zero flux through it (red sides parallel to the magnetic field lines), the flux through the loop begins to increase. This is analogous to moving the north pole of a magnet toward the loop. The induced current, therefore, reverses direction, producing magnetic field lines opposing the permanent magnet field, again obeying Lenzs law. We can see, then, that every half-turn of the loop reverses the direction of the induced current. Electric generators typically produce alternating current (AC). Most of the alternating current produced in the United States has a frequency 60 Hz. That is, the induced current reverses direction twice each cycle or 120 times per second. In Europe, the standard frequency is 50 Hz. Generating alternating current is much more energy efficient (and therefore cheaper) than using direct current. However, many electrical devices require DC voltages and currents in order to operate. Power transformers are used to solve this problem. 
Objective 	  The student will: Understand how transformers operate. transformer: A device that transfers electrical energy between two circuits using electromagnetic induction, usually with a change in voltage. 
Introduction 	  Utility companies have large generating stations that produce potential differences of thousands of volts. The voltage of a typical electrical outlet in the United States is either 120V or 240V (for larger appliances). By what means, then, are the large potential differences, generated at power stations, reduced to accommodate consumers? 
Transformers 	  A transformer is a device that transfers electrical energy between two circuits using electromagnetic induction, usually with a change in voltage. A typical transformer is composed of two coils wrapped around an iron ring or iron core. Both coils in the diagram seem to have the same number of turns. This need not be the case. In fact, it usually is not. Figure 19.10 shows a transformer with a primary coil with four turns and a secondary coil with eight turns. Faradays law of induction states that V . The voltage in the primary coil is then Vp . The voltage in the secondary coil is Vs . The rate of change of the magnetic flux ???t is the same for both coils. We have: 
Vp	 Np 	  Vs = Ns (Transformer Equation A) Thus, the ratio of the voltages is equal to the ratio of the number of turns in each coil. The ratio is effectively a statement of how the input voltage Vp is related to the output voltage Vs. If Ns > Np, we have a step-up transformer, in which the secondary voltage is greater than the primary voltage. Taking Np = 4 and Ns = 8 as in Figure 19.10, we see that secondary voltage is twice the primary voltage. 
Vs = 2 Vp 	  Thus, this transformer is a step-up transformer. If Ns < Np, we have a step-down transformer, in which the secondary voltage is less than the primary voltage. It may seem like were getting more out of the step-up transformer than were putting into it and less out of the step-down transformer than we put into it. This is not the case, however. Keep in mind that only energy is expected to be conserved, not voltage. Energy conservation implies that, if no energy is transformed into heat, then the output power of the primary coil must be equal to the input power of the secondary coil. Recalling that P = IV: IpVp = IsVs (Transformer Equation B) We see that in a step-up transformer, if the voltage increases by a factor of n, then the current must decrease by the same factor of n. Similarly, in a step-down transformer, if the voltage decreases by a factor m, then the current must increase by the same factor of m. (All that is true assuming no energy loss due to Joule heat, which is, of course, impossible in real life.) Using Equations A and B, we see: 
Vp	 Is 	  =	? 
Ip	 Ns 	  =	(Transformer Equation C) 
Is	 Np 	  Thus, the ratio of the currents is equal to the inverse ratio of the number of turns in the corresponding coils. a. A generating station step-up transformer has an input voltage of 12,000 V with 100 turns on the primary coil. Ifthe secondary coil is to have an output voltage of 300,000 V, how many turns must the secondary coil have? Assume no energy is transferred to heat. Answer: 
Vs =  Ns ?turns 	  b. If the current in the primary coil is 1,000 A, what is the current in the secondary coil? Answer: Since the output voltage is 25 times larger than the input voltage, the output current must be 25 times smaller than the input current. IpVp = IsVs ? 
Vs	 Ip	1,000 	  = ? 25 =  ? Is = 40 A Vp Is	Is Power stations actually use step-up transformers at the beginning of the power transfer process (as in the Check Your Understanding above). A high-voltage transmission line then transfers the energy to local substations where the voltage is reduced using the step-down transformers. From there, the energy is stepped-down using transformers which can easily be seen on utility poles, such as the ones you may see near your house. See Figure 19.11. A typical residential transformer. a. What is the output power of the transformer? Answer: The voltage is V = 7.5 V and the current is I = 200 mA = 200  10?3 A = 0.200 A.	Thus, P = IV = (0.200A)(7.5V) = 1.5 W b. The input power is given as 6 W. According to the specifications on the transformer, there is four times morepower input than output. What has happened to the remaining energy? Answer: Feel the transformer and youll have a hint! The heat you feel is Joule heating. The transformer is not very efficient. In fact, 75% of the available energy appears transformed into heat. A good many of the small transformers found in everyday electrical iterms, such as radios, televisions, and home computers, are power transformers. These transformers are used to convert the alternating voltage and current from a wall outlet into direct voltage and current. Many common electrical items use only direct voltage and current. For example, a portable radio which uses batteries operates on DC voltage and therefore also requires a DC voltage when plugged into an outlet.

Introduction 	  The nature of light has, for most of human history, been a mystery. Galileo was one of the first scientists who attempted to measure its velocity. He positioned two assistants with shuttered lanterns on high ground several kilometers apart. At the first sight of light from one lantern, the other assistant was to open his lantern. Knowing the distance between the two lanterns and measuring the time interval between the light signals, Galileo assumed he could calculate the velocity of light. Galileos results were inconclusiveand no wonder! Indeed, the time interval between the light signals was less than a hundred-thousandth of a second, and he had no clock! The best timing tools of the age were the pendulum and water and sand clocks. 
The  Speed of  Light 	  In 1675, thirty-three years after the death of Galileo, the Dutch astronomer Ole Roemer (1644-1710) made the first successful estimate of the speed of light. He noticed that the period of Jupiters moon Io (revolving about Jupiter) seemed to vary. He reasoned that when the Earth was farther (or closer) in its orbit from Jupiter, the light reflecting off the surface of Io would take longer (or shorter) time to reach the Earth. Using Roemers data, the Dutch physicist Christian Huygens calculated the speed of light as 2.3108 ms . Though this is more than 23% less than the accepted value today, calculating it was a major achievement at the time. It was the first substantial evidence showing that the speed of light was finite. It was not until 1849 that the French physicist Armand H. L. Fizeau (1819-1896) devised an experiment which gave the speed of light to within a little more than the 3% of the modern value. Fizeaus experiment relied upon a rotating gear. A beam of light was directed between the spaces of the gears teeth. For example, the light passing through one opening traveled to a distant mirror and was reflected back through an adjacent gear opening. Knowing the rotation rate of the gear and the distance the light traveled, the speed of light could be determined. In 1862, the French physicist Jean Foucault (1819-1868) improved upon Fizeaus method by replacing the gear with a rotating mirror (described below). His result for the speed of light came within less than one percent of the present-day value. About thirty years later, the American physicist Albert A. Michelson began a series of experiments using Foucaults method. Michelson used a rotating eight-sided mirror. Light was reflected off one of the mirrors to another mirror far away. As the mirrors rotated, the reflected light returned. If the returning light fell upon one of the rotating mirrors just right, it would further reflect into a narrow tube along which an observer could detect the light. Again, knowing the rotation rate of the mirrors and the distance the light traveled to the distant reflecting mirror, the speed of light could be calculated. Michelsons final experiment in 1926 gave the speed of light (in a vacuum) to within of the current accepted value of c = 2.997792458108 ms . Unless more precision is needed, we will use the value for the speed of light in a vacuum as c = 3.00108 ms . Note that the symbol c is used to denote the speed of light. As far as we know today, nothing travels faster than light through a vacuum. The speed of light plays a fundamental role in physics. 
Electromagnetic  Waves 	  But what is light? A satisfactory answer to this question had to wait until the mid-19th century, despite the best efforts of Newton, Huygens, Young, and others. In our discussion of electromagnetic induction, we concentrated on the induced voltages and currents produced by changing magnetic flux. We explained those phenomena using wires and magnets. It turns out, however, that neither wires nor magnets are necessary in order to produce electromagnetic induction. The famous Scottish theoretical physicist, James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879), Figure 19.13, showed that electric and magnetic fields were the fundamental constituents of electromagnetic induction. We briefly state some of his conclusions: wave propagating An electromagnetic through space. Maxwells determination that light was an electromagnetic wave involved a good deal of mathematics. But perhaps he wasnt entirely surprised with his result. Light, as we have discussed, has a definite speed, which is a fundamental property of all wave phenomena, along with frequency and wavelength. Since Maxwells work, electromagnetic waves with frequencies and wavelengths differing from visible light have been detected. These waves have all the properties of visible light. They can be reflected and refracted, and they can be focused, just like a magnifying glass focuses the sunlight. They can have wavelengths both much longer and much shorter than visible light. The entire range of eletromagnetic waves is called the electromagnetic spectrum, Figure 19.15. URL As you can see from the figure, human vision is limited to a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum, with the wavelength range of about 400 to 750 nm. We have, however, built instruments capable of detecting all segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Infrared goggles (also known as night goggles) work by detecting the heat produced by various objects, including people and animals. Astronomical instruments make use of every part of the electromagnetic spectrum. There are radio telescopes, microwave telescopes, infrared telescopes, x-ray telescopes, gamma ray telescopes and, of course, optical telescopes that detect visible light. Some of these telescopes are located on Earth and some in outer space, where the atmosphere does not obscure the part of the spectrum detected by the telescope. On a more mundane note, microwaves can cause water molecules to oscillate at their resonant frequency and therefore a microwave oven can heat (cook) any substance containing water.

 	  The negative sign indicates that the induced voltage produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the direction of the original change in the magnetic flux. This statement is known as Lenzs Law.

Chapter  Outline 	  Optics is the study of light. Geometric optics is the classical science of mirrors, glass, and lenses. It explains how light bends in water, and how images are formed in mirrors, telescopes, microscopes, and other devices. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Explain the ray model of light. Describe the Law of Reflection. Explain how images are formed from flat mirrors. angle of incidence:  angle of reflection: incident ray: Makes an angle ?i with the normal, N. light ray: Light traveling in straight lines. normal: reflected ray: Makes an angle ?r with the normal, N. virtual image: An illusion created by the brain because light travels in straight lines. 
Introduction 	  Among other things, the sun provides a source of light for us, as does the moon, Figure 20.2. The sun sends light that is generated by thermonuclear fusion in its core. The moon shines only by the light it reflects from the sun. Nearly all the objects we see in daily life are reflecting light that shines on them, rather than producing their own light. This concept covers the case of true reflection. 
Light as a  Ray 	  Today, we know that light is a transverse wave that passes by the periodic motion of electric charge. The vibrations are so fast and the wavelengths so small, however, that to our eyes, light functions like a ray traveling in a straight line. Sunlight shining through clouds, for example, often gives this impression, as in the Figure 20.3. Indeed, our entire visual orientation is predicated on the notion that light travels in straight lines. When light does not travel in a straight line, this produces an image to our eyes in a different place than where the true object is. The study of geometrical optics depends upon light traveling in straight lines, called light rays. We usually think of light as traveling rays. 
The  Law of  Reflection 	  One of the simplest cases is true reflection on a flat mirror. Figure 20.4 shows a diagram of two light rays reflecting off a flat (plane) mirror. The dashed line N is the normal to the plane of the mirror M. The incident rays make an angle ?i with the normal N. The reflected rays make an angle ?r with the normal, N. The Law of Reflection states: The angle of incidence (?i) is equal to the angle of reflection (?r). ?i = ?r The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal are also coplanar. 
Forming images using the  Law of  Reflection 	  An apple is seen by an observer in the mirror in Figure 20.5. Since light rays travel in straight lines, the observer sees the image of the apple emanating from somewhere along the reflected ray as shown by dashed red lines. Where two or more dashed lines (appear to) intersect, the eye (brain) will see an image. Of course, a very large number of light rays form the image. We only show a few rays in order to avoid confusion. Two important conclusions can be drawn from the figure. An image formed with a plane mirror. Diagrams such as Figure 20.5 are called ray diagrams. Ray diagrams are visual aids showing the objects position, some of the rays forming the image, and the image itself. To further investigate how a plane mirror forms images see this link: URL Bc True or False: When standing straight, in order to see your reflection (from your head to your toes), you need a mirror that is at least equal to your height. Answer: False. Using the Law of Reflection, we can deduce that a mirror the height of your body is not needed. In the figure below we see that a ray of light from your toes will reflect from a point about half the height of your body. It is actually half the distance from your toes to your eyes. See if you can convince yourself that a mirror exactly half your height is sufficient to see your entire body. Dont forget to consider the rays of light from the top of your head to your eyes!

Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how to draw ray diagrams for concave mirrors. Understand how to solve problems involving concave mirrors. Understand how to draw ray diagrams for convex mirrors. Understand how to solve problems involving convex mirrors. concave mirror: A mirror that curves inwards, like the inside of a bowl. convex mirror: A mirror that curves outwards, like the top of a dome. focal point (or focus): The point from a spherical mirror or thin lens where parallel rays of light converge. real image: An image formed from rays of light converging, that can be projected onto a screen or paper. spherical mirror: A curved mirror formed that matches the shape of a slice from a larger sphere. 
Introduction 	  Amusement parks often have Fun Houses with mirrors that distort your image in various funny ways. Even more commonplace curved mirrors are rear-view mirrors for cars. As the warning shown above states, "Objects in mirror are closer than they appear." The mirror is curved to allow drivers to see more of the road, but this also distorts the image. Using diagrams of the position of the mirror and the object, we can calculate how large the image is, and in what position it appears to be. 
Concave mirrors 	  A concave mirror is a mirror that is rounded inwards, like the inside surface of a bowl. Specifically, we will be dealing with spherical concave mirrors, so the bowl shape comes like the a slice off the edge of an even sphere. The Figure 20.7 shows the shape. The reflecting surface is on the left, while the back of the mirror is on the right. To form an image, the slice must be a very small part of the sphere, near flat in appearance. Rear view mirror with warning statement. This curvature means that the reflection in this bowl-like mirror seems smaller or closer than it really is. The Figure below shows how a concave mirror reflection differs from a flat mirror. In the flat mirror, the parallel red lines show the center of the reflection. The reflected rays are symetrical about each of these. In the concave mirror, the same red lines are at angles perpendicular to the curved surface. This creates an image that is larger than the original object. Curved surfaces always produce these distortions of size depending on how they curve, as seen in the Figure 20.9. What follows is the procedure of how to calculate the image height and distance, based on the height and distance of the original object. 
Focus and  Focal  Length 	  A concave mirror has a focal point (or focus), which is where parallel rays of light shined into it converge.	This is illustrated in Figure 20.10, showing rays of light coming in from the left. Because of the curvature, these rays will all intersect at a common point. The terminology of this is as follows: The focus: A common point (also called the focal point) where the reflected rays cross (intersect) each other. Reflection on a shiny curved spoon. Focal length (f): The distance from the center of the mirror to the focal point. The principal axis (P): A straight line drawn perpendicularly to the plane of the mirror which passes through the mirrors center. The radius of curvature (RC): The radius of the sphere (from point c to the mirror) from which the mirror was made. In order for the reflected rays to have a (nearly) common focus, the incidence angles must be small. This condition is met as long as the radius of curvature of the mirror is small compared to the distance that the light travels from the object to the mirror. For example, rays of sunlight are effectively parallel since the sun is so far away. The image of the sun would therefore form at the focal point f of the mirror in Figure 20.11. We can demonstrate, with a bit of geometry, that the radius of curvature is twice the focal length. r Constructing ray diagrams for concave mirrors: object located beyond the focal point We begin with a definition. Images that appear on a screen are called real images. Such images are formed by actual rays, not extensions of rays as in the case of virtual images. Images formed with concave mirrors when the object is located beyond the focal point are real images. The Law of Reflection is the basis for constructing ray diagrams for mirrors. However, it is rather time-consuming and difficult to construct rays by measuring their incidence and reflection angles. Three principal rays can be drawn to construct ray diagrams for concave mirrors. See Figure 20.11 for rays labeled 1, 2, 3 as given below. Ray 1: A ray parallel to the principal axis will, after reflection, pass through the focal point. We can assume that the direction of the ray is reversible. In other words, if an object (imagine a small light bulb) were placed at the focal point of the mirror, all rays would reflect off the mirror parallel to the principal axis. Ray 2: A ray passing through the focal point will reflect parallel to the principal axis. Ray 3. A ray that reflects perpendicularly off the mirror (along the normal) will pass through the center of curvature, since all radii are perpendicular to tangents to the circle. The point where the rays intersect is the location of the image. Definitions: object distance (do): Distance from the object to the mirror. image distance (di): Distance from the image to the mirror. Notice that the image formed in Figure 20.11 is inverted. Again, with a bit of geometry, we can demonstrate that the object distance do, the image distance di, and the focal length f are related by the mirror equation: 
Concave mirror-objects placed in front of the focal point 	  When an object is placed closer to the concave mirror than the focal point, a virtual image is formed. The same principal rays are used to construct the diagram, but the construction is not quite as straightforward as before. Figure 20.12 shows the ray diagram for this situation. To the eye in the figure, the rays appear to converge to a point behind the mirror shown by the dashed lines. Ray 1: A ray that is parallel to the principal axis and is reflected through the focal point. Ray 2: A ray continued backward from the object, is in line with the focal point, and so reflects off the mirror parallel to the principal axis. Ray 3: A ray continued backward from the object, is in line with the radius of curvature, and so reflects back upon itself. 
Sign conventions for spherical mirrors 	  There are several sign conventions which must be followed when working with spherical mirrors. m = hhoi = ?ddoi In Figure 20.11, the image is on the reflecting side of the mirror, reduced, and inverted. As a consequence of these results, hi is negative and di is positive. Thus, the magnification equation yields consistent results, regardless of whether the heights or the distances are used. 
Concluding remarks for concave mirrors 	  An object placed closer to the mirror than the focal point always produces an upright, enlarged, and virtual image. An object placed beyond the focal point always produces an inverted, real image. URL 
Illustrative  Example 21.2.1 	  An object of height 10.0 cm is positioned 30.0 cm from a concave mirror with a focal length 8.0 cm. a. Find the image position. Solution: We are given ho = 10.0 cm,do = 30.0 cm, and f = 8.0 cm Using the mirror equation: +	=	?	+	=	?	=	?	=	? do di f 30.0 cm di 8.0 cm di 8.0 cm 30.0 cm 240 cm di = 10.91 ? 10.9 cm; di = 10.9 cm Since the image distance is positive, the image is real. b. What is the magnification? Solution: di	10.91 cm m = ? = ? = ?0.3636 ? ?0.364 do 30.0 cm m = ?0.364 The image is inverted and reduced, since m is negative and has absolute value smaller than 1. c. What is the height of the image? Solution: hi	hi m =  ? ?0.3636 = ho	10 cm hi = ?3.64 cm d. The object is now positioned 5.3 cm from the mirror. Find the image position. Solution: We are given ho = 10.0 cm,do = 5.3 cm and f = 8.0 cm Using the mirror equation: i _i = ?15.7 cm Notice the result is negative. The image is, therefore, 15.7 cm behind the mirror, and is virtual. An object placed between the mirror and the focal point, as in this case (5.3 cm < 8.0 cm), will always produce a virtual image. e. What is the magnification of the object? di	?15.7 cm m = ? = ? = +2.96 ? +3.0 do 5.3 cm m = 3.0 Solution: The image is upright and magnified; its height is 30 cm. See Figure 20.13. Concave mirrors are often sold as beauty aids for applying makeup, since the image of an object placed close to the mirror is magnified. If you hold one of these mirrors at arms length, youll see your image as inverted and reduced. However, as you bring the mirror slowly toward your eyes, your image will grow larger, vanish, and then reappear upright and magnified (and not always flattering, many people say!). Try doing this with a shiny spoon! If an object is placed at the focal point of a concave mirror, where does the image form? Answer: Using the mirror equation and do = f : +	=	?	+	= di ? ? The image would form at "infinity. No image is formed since the rays would never converge. They reflect off the mirror parallel to the principal axis. This is why your image would vanish in going from inverted to upright as stated above. 
Convex  Mirrors 	  A convex mirror is shown in Figure 20.13. Convex mirrors give wide views. They reduce the object size, and therefore can fit large views into small areas. Convex mirrors are often placed in stores above customers heads, and are also used as side-view mirrors in cars. 
Constructing ray diagrams for convex mirrors 	  Three principal rays can be drawn to construct ray diagrams for convex mirrors. Ray 1: A ray that would pass through the focal point is reflected parallel to the principal axis. Ray 2: A ray that is parallel to the principal axis reflects as if in line with the focal point. Ray 3: A ray that would pass through the center of curvature is reflected back upon itself. Sign Conventions for convex mirrors. 
Concluding remarks for convex mirrors 	  An object placed anywhere (farther or closer than the focal point) in front of a convex mirror always produces a reduced, upright, and virtual image. 
Illustrative  Example 21.2.2 	  An object of height 10.0 cm object is placed 20.0 cm from a convex mirror of focal length -12.0 cm. a. Where does the image form? Solution: We are given ho = 10.0 cm,do = 20.0 cm, and f = ?12.0 cm Using the mirror equation we have, di = ?7.50 cm Since the image distance is negative, it appears on the opposite side of the mirror (as in Figure 20.13) and is virtual. b. What is the magnification? Solution: m = ? di = ??7.50 cm = +0.375 do 20.0 cm m = 0.375 The object is reduced in size and is upright. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how the index of refraction is defined. Solve problems involving the index of refraction. Understand Snells Law. Solve problems involving Snells Law. angle of incidence angle of refraction incident ray index of refraction: The ratio of the speed of light through vacuum c to the speed of the light through a particular medium v. refracted ray: Light rays change direction when they pass through different material. Snells Law: Expresses the relationship between the angle of incidence ?1 and the angle of refraction ?2 at the interface of two media. 
Introduction 	  Light will change direction when it passes through different material. This is called refraction, as the word refract means "to bend." You can see how light bends when you look through a glass of water, as shown in the Figure 20.14. It looks like the straw is broken in two pieces, but this is because the part of the straw inside the glass is not really in the same position it appears to be. We will show that this bending matches up to the change in how fast the wave moves. Any kind of wave can refract if it changes speed and has room to change direction. 
Refraction of light makes the straw appear 	  broken. 
The index of refraction 	  We define the ratio of the speed of light through vacuum c to the speed of the light through a particular medium v as the index of refraction of the medium (n): n = cv Since c > v, the index of refraction is always greater than 1 when traveling through any medium other than vacuum. Table 20.1 gives the indices of refraction for several common media. 
Medium 	  Index of Refraction (n)

Snells  Law 	  URL n Answer: Using Snells Law and the fact that the speed of light in air is 3.00108 ms , we have: v2 sin?1 = v1 sin?2 ? v2 sin30? = csin21.6? ? v m v2 = 2.21 s 
A  Special case of  Snells  Law 	  If the angle of incidence in Snells law is 0?, we have n1 sin?1 = n2 sin?2 ? n1(0) = n2 sin?2 ? sin?2 = 0 ? ?2 = 0 We conclude that light incident perpendicular to the interface of two media will pass through the second medium without refracting. 
Total internal reflection 	  So far we have discussed light passing into media with a greater index of refraction. Let us consider what happens if we have a light source under water with the light passing into the air, as in Figure 20.16. We see there is a point at which the light is refracted at 90? from the normal (the red normal and black rays). The angle of incidence at which this occurs is called the critical angle and it is labeled ?c in the Figure 20.16. Rays incident to the normal that are larger than the critical angle do not pass into the air. They are reflected back into the water as shown by the ray labeled TIR in the figure. We call this condition total internal reflection (TIR). A critical angle will always exist when light passes from a medium with a greater index of refraction to one with a smaller index of refraction. We can use Snells Law to determine the critical angle in terms of the indices of refraction of the two media involved n1 sin?1 = n2 sin?2 ? n1 sin?c = n2 sin90? = n2 ? n1 sin?c = n2 ? sin?c = n2 ? ?c = sin?1 n2 ; where n1 > n2 n1	n1 
Illustrative  Example 21.3.1 	  a. What is the critical angle for the light source in Figure 20.14? Solution: 
Using the equation derived above, we have 	  with n1 = 1.33 and n2 = 1.00 b. Any light that is incident to the normal with an angle greater than 48.8? will be internally reflected back into the water as demonstrated in Figure 20.16. An observer above the water will, therefore, see a circle of light. If the light source in Figure 20.16 is positioned 3 meters below the water surface, what is the radius of the circle of light seen? Solution: A diagram of the situation is shown below. We can see from the diagram that m An important technological use of total internal reflection today is in the field of communications. Fiber optic cables are quickly replacing much of the copper wire used to carry cable television and telephone signals. Light signals in fiber optics are used in place of an electrical current in a copper wire because of their low energy losses and their ability to transmit much more information. There is practically no transmission of the light wave to the air because of the tiny fiber and index of refraction of the fiber optic cable. Almost all of the light is internally reflected as it is transmitted. A small amount of energy is absorbed by the cable and there is a very small amount of light that is lost at the ends of the cable. Fiber optic cables are also used in medical applications to transmit video from difficult-to-access areas during surgery and as diagnostic probes. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how to draw ray diagrams for convex lenses. Understand how to solve problems involving convex lenses. Understand how to draw ray diagrams for concave lenses. Understand how to solve problems involving concave lenses. concave lens: A lens that is thinner at the center than its edges. Diverging lenses make rays parallel to the principal axis (P) diverge as shown below. convex lens: A lens that is thicker in the center than its edges. Converging lenses make rays parallel to the principal axis (P) converge at the focal point as shown below. focus/foci: The point(s) at which rays parallel to an axis converge. optical center: The center of the lens. principal axis: A straight line passing through the center of the lens and perpendicular to its surfaces. 
Introduction 	  A lens is a piece of transparent material, cut into a particular shape. Its purpose is to refract light in useful ways. Lenses come in many shapes, as shown in Figure 20.17. We will be interested in convex (converging) lenses and concave (diverging) lenses. There are several kinds of these lenses: A lens can be considered thin if it has a much greater diameter than its maximum thickness. You probably see convex lenses and concave lenses every day. People who use reading glasses use convex lenses. Convex lenses are also used as magnifying glasses. People who use glasses to see distant objects use concave glasses. When a lens refracts light, it can alter the point in space where an image forms. The manner in which a lens refracts light determines which lens to use in which pair of glasses. All ray diagrams for lenses can, in principle, be constructed using Snells Law. But as is the case with mirrors and the Law of Reflection, there is a much simpler way to approach ray construction than measuring angles and using tedious constructions. 
Terminology for converging and diverging lenses 	  principal axis: A straight line passing through the center of the lens and perpendicular to its surfaces. optical center: The center of the lens. focal point: Rays parallel to the principal axis converge at a point called the focal point as long as the rays pass close to the optical center of the lens. Each lens has two focal points (two foci): one on each side of the lens. Focal length: The distance from the center of the lens to either focal point. convex/converging lens: A lens that is thicker in the center than its edges. Converging lenses make rays parallel to the principal axis (P) converge at the focal point as shown below. concave/diverging lens: A lens that is thinner at the center than its edges. Diverging lenses make rays parallel to the principal axis (P) diverge as shown below. In this case, the focal point is the location where the extensions of the refracted rays converge, to the left of the lens. 
Drawing ray diagrams for converging lenses:  Real images 	  Three principal rays can be drawn to construct ray diagrams for convex lenses, as shown in Figure 20.18. The intersection of the rays shows where the image is formed. Note the similarities in ray construction between the concave mirror and the convex lens. Again, with a bit of geometry, we can demonstrate that the object distance do, the image distance di, and the focal length f are related by the Lens Equation, shown below: d1o + d1i = 1f This is the same equation as the Mirror Equation. All distances are measured with respect to the lens. 
Drawing ray diagrams for converging lenses:  Virtual images 	  Ray 1: A ray parallel to the principal axis is refracted through the opposite focal point. Ray 2: A ray that passes through the focal point on the left, as shown in Figure 20.19, refracts parallel to the principal axis. Ray 3: There is no refraction of a ray passing through the center of the lens. The ray passes straight through the lens. The intersection of the rays shows where the image is formed. Sign conventions for converging lenses (single lens system) A convex lens with the object in front of the focal point, F. 
Concluding remarks for converging lenses 	  An object placed beyond the focal point will always form real and inverted images. An object placed closer to the lens than the focal point will always form virtual, upright, and enlarged images. 
Illustrative  Example 21.4.1 	  An object of height 12.0 cm is placed 30.0 cm from a converging lens of focal length 10.0 cm (see Figure 20.18.). a. Find the image position.

Solution: + = ? + = ? do di f 7.0 di 10.0 = ? = ? di 10.0 7.0 70 cm di = ?23.3 cm Since the image distance is negative, the image is formed on the same side of the lens as the object, and therefore is virtual. See Figure 20.19. e. What is the magnification? Solution: m = ?ddoi = ? The image is upright and magnified. 
The diverging lens 	  A lens that is thinner at its center than its edges is a diverging lens. 
Constructing ray diagrams for diverging lenses 	  Three principal rays can be drawn to construct ray diagrams for diverging lenses. Ray 1: A ray parallel to the principal axis refracts so that its extension (the dashed line) passes through the focal point F in Figure 20.20. Ray 2: A ray heading toward focal point F0 refracts parallel to the principal axis, as in Figure 20.20. Ray 3: A ray passes through the center of the lens with no apparent refraction.

URL The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal are also coplanar. n = cv Since c > v, the index of refraction is always greater than 1 when traveling through any medium other than vacuum. The index of refraction n1 is the medium from which light originates and n2 is the index of refraction of the medium to which light passes. Angle ?1 is measured with respect to the normal at the interface of the first medium and angle ?2 is measured with respect to the (same) normal at the interface of the second medium. Snells Law can be expressed in terms of the velocities of light in the respective media as, v2 sin?1 = v1 sin?2, where v1 is the speed of the light in the first medium, and v2 is the speed of light in the second medium. m = hhoi = ?ddoi Since c > v, the index of refraction is always greater than 1 when traveling through any medium other than vacuum. The index of refraction n1 is the medium from which light originates and n2 is the index of refraction of the medium to which light passes. Angle ?1 is measured with respect to the normal at the interface of medium 1 and angle ?2 is measured with respect to the (same) normal at the interface of medium 2. Snells law can be expressed in terms of the velocities of light in the respective media as v2 sin?1 = v1 sin?2 where v1 is the speed of the light in medium 1 and v2 is the speed of light in medium 2. 
Physical  Optics 	  A rainbow is an example of physical optics, where light shows properties like a wave. Physical optics, also called wave optics, is the study of phenomena where light behaves like a classical wave and not like a ray or particle. A rainbow is a classic example of this, where different colors of light separate based on their wavelength. This also includes dispersion, the double-slit experiment showing interference, thin films, and polarization. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand the definition of dispersion and its causes. Understand the dispersion of light through a prism. Solve problems involving dispersion. dispersion: The spreading of light through a prism. 
Introduction 	  A rainbow is one of the oldest mysteries of nature. We know that white light has many different wavelengths, but what is the mechanism that causes those different wavelengths to separate? The principle of refraction is that light and other waves change direction when they change speed at an angle, similar to how a car may change direction when it starts to drive over sand. In geometric optics like thin lenses, we assume that all light travels at the same speed. However, the speed of light in a medium like glass really depends on its wavelength. Some wavelengths of light slow down more, and some slow down less. This is most clearly seen through a prism, which is a glass with a triangular cross-section. The triangular shape means that refraction continues as light exits. When white light passes through glass prism, a rainbow of colors, called the visible spectrum, exits the prism. The spreading of light in this manner is called dispersion, see Figure Dispersion reveals three very important attributes of light: It is well known that the color of light depends upon its frequency. In the visible spectrum (and within a vacuum), red light has the smallest frequency, of about 4.01014 Hz and the longest wavelength, about 750 nm. Violet light has the largest frequency, of about 7.51014 Hz and the shortest wavelength, about 400 nm. Since the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, the product of frequency and wavelength remains constant. Recall the Wave Equation: c = f? or v = f? The frequency of light is f , the wavelength of light is ?, and the velocity of light in vacuum is c. If, however, light passes through any other medium, its velocity is given as v. We know that light travels slower than c in any medium other than a vacuum. When light travels from one medium into another, the frequency of the light does not change. However, its velocity, as we learned from Snells Law, does. Since n = vc, we can see that red light, for example, having the greatest speed through the prism in Figure 21.3, has the smallest index of refraction through the prism. Thus, as v increases, n must decrease. URL URL Which light has the greater index of refraction: green or yellow? Answer: We can see from Figure 21.3 that green light is refracted more than yellow. It follows, then, that the index of refraction for green light is greater than yellow light.

Objectives 	  The student will: Understand the Double-Slit Experiment. Solve problems involving the Double-slit Experiment. monochromatic: Describes a light source in which all the light has exactly the same single wavelength. spectroscope: Designed for the purpose of wavelength determination. wave interference: A situation in which two waves overlap each other. 
Introduction 	  In geometric optics, we assume light acts like a ray or particle.	In other ways, however, it acts like a wave.	The Double-Slit Experiment is a specific case that looks at how light behaves as a wave, following the principle of superposition. The Double-Slit Experiment was first conducted by the British physicist Thomas Young (1773-1829) as convincing experimental evidence that light was a wave. He demonstrated how superposition led to interference using ripples in a tank of water. He showed that the same principle also applied to light in the Double-Slit experiment. Youngs experimental setup is shown in Figure 21.6. A single monochromatic light source is to the left, so all the light has exactly the same single wavelength. The waves are light, shown as ripples in this diagram. The waves come to the screen in the middle that has two small slits in it (hence the name Double-Slit Experiment). The light waves then proceed like ripples out from the screen in the middle, until they reach the far side on the wall. Each wave line can be thought of as the top of a ripple. The places where two ripples overlap is a point of constructive interference. Two points of constructive interference are pointed out below. What determines these points of constructive interference is the difference in path length from the slits. If the two paths are exactly the same distance, then the two waves will both be high and low at the same times, a case of constructive interference. If one path is exactly one-half of a wavelength shorter than the other, then the first will be high when the other is low and vice-versa, a case of destructive interference. If one path is a multiple of one wavelength, then the two waves will both be high and low at the same times, q case of constructive interference. We can represent the wave fronts (W) using a ray diagram to determine the path difference between the waves from each slit. Constructive and destructive interference occurs for path differences of whole wavelengths and path differences of odd multiples of half-wavelengths, respectively. The result is a series of light (constructive) and dark (destructive) fringes, as shown in Figure 21.6. The Figure 21.7 is used to determine an equation in terms of the wavelength ?, the distance d between the double slit, and the angle of diffraction ?. Figure 21.8 shows an enlarged view of the two slits and the path difference, d sin?. Our assumption is that slit width d is much less than the distance L from the slits to the screen, and therefore, the rays of light are nearly parallel, each making an angle ? to the horizontal. Complementary angles show that the angle 6 acb is ?. Then sin? is equal to the ratio of the path difference (PD), shown in red in Figure 21.8, to the distance between the slits d. sin? = PDd ? PD = d sin? The path difference required for the constructive interference (bright fringes) can be expressed as d sin? = m?, m = 0,1,2,... For example, for m = 0, a bright fringe appears on the screen in Figure 21.7 at point A, since the path difference between the two rays is zero. Rays from each slit to the screen at point A are equidistant. We refer to m as the order of the interference fringe. For m = 0, it is order zero. These fringes are also called maxima or minima. A bright fringe is called a maximum and a dark fringe is called a minimum. And for destructive interference (dark fringes), d For the integer values of m, the equation yields odd multiples of half-wavelength. For more information about the Double-Slit Experiment follow the links below. URL URL In order for the light to diffract and create interference, the wavelength ? of the light must be a. Smaller than the distance d between the slits. b. Equal to the distance d between the slits. c. Larger than the distance d between the slits. Answer: The correct answer is A. 
Mathematically, we can see that (for constructive interference), d 	  The order is given as m ? 0. Thus, only for m = 0 is the relationship between the wavelength of the light and the distance between the slits irrelevant. Otherwise, the wavelength must be less than the distance between the slits (? < d) or the sin? will not have a solution. We will ignore the case where ? = 90? since the image would never appear upon the screen. 
Illustrative  Example 22.2.1 	  In an experiment, light incident upon two slits 0.013 mm apart produces a bright third-order fringe at an angle of a. What is the wavelength and color of the light used in the experiment? Solution: d sin? = m? ? (1.310?5 m)(sin8.7?) = 3? ? m = 660 nm ? = 660 nm (red light) b. If the third fringe appears 30.25 cm (Z) from the center fringe (m = 0), what is the distance L between the double slit and the screen? See Figure 21.7. Solution: We use the angle 8.7?, the length L, and the distance Z. The tangent of the angle (see Figure 21.7) is tan8.7? = Z = 3.02510?1 m ? 
L	 	  L =	tan8.7?	= 1.98 m ? 
Diffraction from a single slit 	  Recall that when a wave passes through an opening, such as in this case of a light wave passing through a slit, diffraction occurs. If we restrict our attention to only one slit, we can see that different parts of the diffracted wave will be subject to constructive and destructive interference, just as we observed with two slits. Figure 21.9 shows the path of light rays diffracting through one slit. In other words, when we observe the interference pattern for a double-slit, there is yet another interference pattern present due to each slit. More advanced texts will have more to say on this topic. If you would like to learn about this, see the link below. URL 
Diffraction gratings 	  Diffraction gratings are composed of many equally spaced slits instead of two slits. They produce much sharper and better separated maxima and minima, and therefore are very useful in determining the wavelength of a particular color. Diffraction gratings are an important component in astronomical spectroscopes which are designed for the purpose of wavelength determination, see Figure 24.6. When heated and observed through a spectroscope, each chemical element has a unique line spectrum (a specific set of colors in specific locations), as shown in Figure 24.6. Light from the sun, as seen through a spectroscope, shows that the sun has many of the same elements present on the Earth. (We will discuss this in greater detail later.) A spectroscope, therefore, enables us to determine the chemical composition of the sun, stars, and planets. Diffraction gratings are typically of two kinds: transmission gratings, where the light passes through the grating, and reflection gratings, where fine lines are etched into a metallic substance which reflects the interference pattern. The equation describing the interference pattern is the same as for the double slit grating. A simple model of a spectroscope. A common (though unintentional) example of a reflection grating is a CD or DVD. If a CD is slowly moved as light is reflected off its surface, (or if the CD is held stationary and ones head is moved) light waves of different wavelengths (colors) interfere constructively and destructively. Figure 21.11 shows the spectrum observed as a result of diffraction from a CD Notice that on the left side of the CD, mostly shorter wavelengths of light constructively interfere.

Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how thin films recreate constructive and destructive interference. Solve problems involving thin films. phase change: Occurs when a beam of light is reflected from a medium with a greater index of refraction than the medium in which it travels. 
Introduction 	  From our discussion of CDs, we can see that we do not need elaborate equipment to witness the effects of light interference. In fact, everyday phenomena such as soap bubbles or a thin layer of oil on the surface of the water provide for an array of colors reminiscent of the rainbow (see Figure 21.12 and Figure 21.13). Different wavelengths of light are subject to constructive interference and destructive interference after reflecting off the top and the bottom of a thin layer of oil. Try putting a drop of oil onto water in a bowl. Look at it from different angles and see what patterns you can make of it. The Figure 21.14 shows how the light reflecting from the top and bottom of a thin film (a soap bubble or a layer of oil, for example) constructively interferes. The figure is exaggerated in order to see the effect clearly. For simplicity, well assume that all rays are essentially perpendicular (normal) to the air, oil, and water surfaces. Compared to the distance the black reflected ray travels in air, the extra distance that the green ray travels through the oil is, then, 2d. If the path difference 2d is equal to an integral number of wavelengths, then the reflected wave from the water-oil interface will be in phase with the reflected ray from the air-oil interface. The wavelengths refer to the wavelength of the light in the oil. Recall that the wavelength in air is longer than the wavelength in oil since the index of refraction of air is less than oil. We may, therefore, write as the condition for constructive interference: And the condition for destructive interference: We can see that constructive and destructive interference occur for specific wavelengths of light. If the path difference changes, for example, as we move farther away from the perpendicular condition we assumed, then light of different wavelength will constructively and destructively interfere. This is one reason that you see different colors when changing your line of sight (you move your head!). Another factor influencing interference effects occurs when the thickness of thin layer changes, which is a most probable event. 
Phase changes 	  When a beam of light is reflected from a medium with a greater index of refraction than the medium in which it travels, it undergoes a phase change of 180? upon reflection, as shown in Figure 21.15 and Figure 21.16. The effect is analoguos to a wave that is traveling along a rope that is fixed at the end. The reflected wave flips upside down at the fixed point. Conversely, if the wave is free to move at the end, the reflected wave reflects back without a phase change. In our example above, both the reflections from the air-oil interface and the oil-water interface underwent a phase change. Thus, both waves remained in phase. In Figure 21.17, you can see the view of two glass plates, separated at one edge by a fine wire, thus creating a thin air gap between the slides. (The thickness of the wire and the gap have been greatly exaggerated.) We can show that the light refracted through a flat piece of glass travels undeflected through the glass for any angle of incidence (see the link below). URL You may remember that this was also the case for light traveling through the center of a converging or a diverging lens . Again, assuming that the rays travel perpendicular to the surface of the slides, and the air gap width where the rays reflect is d, we can write for the condition of destructive interference. The light ray (black) shown reflecting at the bottom of the top slide does not undergo any phase change, since the index of refraction of air is less than the index of refraction of glass. However, the light ray (green) shown reflecting from the top of the bottom slide does undergo a 180? phase change, since the ray reflects off a medium (glass) with a higher index of refraction than which it was traveling (air). 
Thus the condition for constructive interference for this case is 	  What thickness of oil is required in order to see green light of wavelength 525 nm constructively interfere for order m = 1 (light is normal to the surface), as shown in Figure 21.14? Answer: According to the figure, noil = 1.20 and nwater = 1.33. Therefore, the phase change for the reflected wave off the oil-water interface (as we described above) is 180?, but the phase change for the reflection at the air-oil interface is also 180?. Thus, the net effect amounts to no phase change, and we can use the equation for constructive interference . Recall, however, that we must use the wavelength of light in the oil and, therefore ?air ?n = noil ?	?	525 nm n	2n	2(1.20) 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand the meaning of polarization and its mechanism. Understand polarization by transmission and reflection. polarized light: Light with electric field vibrations in only one direction, also known as linearly polarized light. 
Introduction 	  Light is a transverse wave. Unlike sound, which pushes back and forth, it is instead comparable to a pulse or wave that travels down a length of string. How do we know this? The key difference is that a transverse wave can vibrate in different directions, like side-to-side compared to up-and-down. We can see this difference in light when the direction of how we look at something changes. An example of this is shown below. The light is blocked only when the glasses are held in a particular way because of polarization. 
Polarization by transmission 	  All electromagnetic waves come from vibration of electric charges. Just like a wave in a string or whip, they have a direction, like up-and-down or side-to-side, as shown in Figure 21.18. The transverse orientation of the wave is the direction of the electric field variation. Light produced by most common sources, from stars to light bulbs to candles, has a mix of many different transverse wave direction up-and-down, side-to-side, and all diagonals. Polarized light (also known as linearly polarized light) is light with electric field vibrations in only one direction. 
Vertical and horizontal transverse waves 	  Ordinary non-polarized light can be made polarized by two methods: polarization by transmission and polarization by reflection. Polarization by Transmission. Certain transparent materials (called polarizers) have long chains of parallel molecules that act like the slots described above. For instance, the mineral tourmaline is a known polarizer. However, most polarizers used in everyday life are synthetic plastic. A polarizer only allows through the vibrations that occur in a particular plane. Figure 21.19 shows how a polarizer permits a particular plane of the vibrating electric field to pass if it is aligned with the chains of molecules (top figure) and how a polarizer that is oriented perpendicular to the vibrations (bottom figure) block the vibrating electric field. Note that the direction of those molecular chains, defining the direction of polarization, is called the axis of polarization. To help clarify the idea, consider an example of polarized mechanical waves, such as a rope that is moved up and down in a vertical plane. Under this condition, the rope can be considered a vertically polarized wave. A set of vertical slots as shown in Figure 21.20, can serve as a polarizer. If the rope is shaken in the vertical plane, the vibrations will pass through the slots. If the rope is shaken horizontally, the vibrations will not pass through the slots. Conversely, if the slots are horizontal, then the vertical vibrations, as shown in Figure 21.21, are prevented from Vertically oriented transverse waves pass through vertical slots. passing. If, of course, the rope is shaken in a horizontal plane, the vibrations would pass through the slots. Vertically oriented transverse waves are blocked by horizontal slots. Polarizers that permit only horizontally polarized light through are said to have a horizontal axis of polarization. So-called 3-D glasses are usually composed of polarizers that permit vertically polarized light to reach one eye and horizontally polarized light to reach the other eye. The result is that each eye sees a slightly different view, which creates the illusion of three dimensions. It may not seem too surprising that all the light that first passes through a polarizer with a vertical axis of polarization is blocked when it encounters a polarizer with a horizontal axis of polarization. Consider, however, a third polarizer, with any axis of polarization other than vertical or horizontal, inserted between a polarizer with a vertically polarized axis and one with a horizontally polarized axis. Inserting the third polarizer enables some light to pass through the arrangement. Can you guess why? As a hint as to why this happens, consider only the electric field of the electromagnetic wave and recall that the electric field is a vector quantity that can be resolved into vertical and horizontal components. Perhaps your teacher will show you a demonstration of this. Follow the link below for more of an explanation. URL 
Polarization by reflection 	  Light that reflects off of nonmetallic surfaces, such as water, glass, or pavement, is also polarized. The axis of polarization is in the same plane as the surface off which the light reflects. For example, the light that reflects off of a horizontal pavement is polarized parallel to the plane of the pavement. Light reflected off of the surface of the ocean is polarized horizontally as well and accounts for most of the annoying glare we experience on sunny days. Polarized sunglasses have a vertical axis of polarization in order to block the horizontally polarized light and reduce that glare. Camera lenses can be fitted with polarizers to minimize the effects of glare, as shown in Figure 21.22. Notice how the picture on the left shows the glare off of the water, but the picture on the right, taken with a polarizer, does not. Light polarized by reflection is also a clue to astronomers who are searching for planets about other stars (extrasolar planets). The light from extrasolar planets is often obscured by the much brighter light of the star it orbits. However, the reflected light from the planet is polarized while the star light is not. Thus, astronomers have a polarized light signal with which to search for extrasolar planets. (color). 
Chapter  Outline 	  A GPS satellite travels at 14,000 kilometers per hour, and needs corrections for relativity to stay accurate. Physics at the usual speeds found on Earth mostly follow our intuitive understanding of time and space. However, in the 20th century, very accurate measurements of the speed of light found that these could not be true. This puzzle was solved by a new theory of time and space by Albert Einstein, called the Special Theory of Relativity. This chapter covers the paradox of the speed of light, time dilation, length contraction, simultaneity, and the General Theory of Relativity. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand the apparent contradiction between Galilean principle of relativity and the invariability of the speed of light. Understand that the equations of Galilean relativity must be changed to remain consistent with Maxwells equations. ether Galilean relativity: The Galilean equations of motion. inertial frames of reference 
Introduction 	  The basic principle of relativity is this: If you are moving at a constant speed, all physical laws should work the same as if you are at rest, and everything else is moving relative to you. This was true of classical physics, known as Galilean Relativity. However, it ran up against a very difficult paradox with the results of experiments in the speed of light. The resolution to that paradox was formulated by Albert Einstein, and is known as the Special Theory of Relativity, along with the General Theory of Relativity. 
Galilean  Relativity 	  Earlier, we discussed the concepts of Galilean relativity and relative motion. A simple example of relative motion is sound waves. Sound waves travel at a fixed speed relative to the air, roughly 340 meters per second. Consider these cases: A person standing still who shouts will see the sound wave travel off at 340 m/s. A person who is driving at 40 m/s will feel a wind blowing at 40 m/s at them. If they honk their horn, the sound wave travels at 340 m/s with respect to the air, which is only 300 m/s ahead of the car. An airplane travelling at 350 m/s will create a sonic boom. The sound from the plane travels at 340 m/s relative to the air, which means that it is slower than the plane. In Galilean relativity, the result are very intuitive. The velocities are simply added together. 
The  Speed of  Light  Paradox 	  Towards the end of the 19th century, there was growing evidence of a paradox that threw this into doubt. The essence of the paradox is simple: No matter how fast you are moving, light always appears to move away at the same speed, equal to c = 3.0108 m/s in a vacuum. This appears simple, but the consequences of this discovery were enormous. The principles are illustrated in the diagram below, which ignores the effect of air on the speed of light. 
How light moves in different frames of reference 	  This appears on the surface to be logically inconsistent. In the ground frame of reference, the car is traveling in the same direction as the light, and so their relative motion is less than c. However, in the car frame of reference, the light is moving away at exactly c. 
How the  Paradox  Was  Proven:  The  Michaelson- Morley  Experiment 	  Physicists carried out experiments in order to determine the Earths motion through the ether. The most famous of these experiments, designed by Albert Michelson (1852-1931) and Edward W. Morley (1838-1923), called the Michelson-Morley experiment, was performed in 1887 at what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Using the interferometer, developed by Michelson, discussed earlier, they attempted to measure the relative velocity of the earth with respect to the velocity of light through the ether. It is important to remember that, like the velocity of sound, the velocity of light is independent of the velocity of the source. Therefore, the thinking was: if we move through the air while sound is traveling toward us in one instance and away from us in another instance, we should be able to measure ourselves moving at different speeds relative to the sound. Similarly, if we move through the ether while light is traveling toward us in one instance and away from us in another instance, we should be able to measure the speed of the Earth relative to the light. The results, of course, would need to be indirectly determined since the experiment relied upon using an interferometer. The interferometer, as you recall, is based upon the constructive and destructive interference of light waves. A very small difference in the time of travel between two light waves separating and recombining would be detected in the interferometer as a shift in the position of bright and dark fringes. One light wave traveled in the direction of the Earths motion through the ether while the other light wave traveled perpendicular to the Earths motion through the ether. Michelson thought that there should be a time difference in the light traversing the two paths. Here is his reasoning in his own words, used as an explanation to his daughter: Two beams of light race against each other, like two swimmers, one struggling upstream and back, while the other, covering the same distance, just crosses and returns. The second swimmer will always win if there is any current in the river. With the help of E.W Morley, Michelsons interferometer, Figure 22.4, was calibrated so that it could detect a shift of one part in a hundred in the position of a fringe. The shift they anticipated due to the Earths velocity through the ether was some forty times that! Clearly, the effect was measureable. Curiously, though, there was no discernible shift in the interference fringes. Diagram of the Michelson Interferometer. The null result of the experiment, from the point of view of measuring the relative velocity between the Earth and the velocity of light through the ether, can be understood as follows: The velocity of Earth in orbit about the sun is, on average, about 30kms . Using that velocity, Michelson calculated the expected shift in an interference fringe. Thus, the experiment should show a shift in fringe corresponding to that speed. When the Earth moves in the same direction as the light in the ether, the shift in fringe should verify the velocity of light with respect to the ether as vrel to earth = c? 30kms . When the Earth is moving toward the light, a shift in fringe should verify the velocity of light as vrel to earth = c+ 30kms . The predicted fringe shift would confirm the velocity of the Earth in orbit about the sun and establish the absolute reference frame of the ether. However, regardless of which way the light moved through the ether (and, therefore, through the interferometer), it never indicated a change in velocity relative to the Earth. There was no way to detect the Earths motion through the ether. That result was absolutely shocking. What would the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment imply if the results of this experiment applied to everyday objects, such as the ball that the girl on the skateboard had thrown in the example above? (Imagine the ball playing the role of a beam of light, like a flashlight being turned on.) It would mean that a stationary observer would measure the speed of the ball as 6.0ms ,regardless of the direction the ball was thrown or the motion of the girl! This meant that the Galilean relativity failed to provide the correct results when applied to light (and therefore any form of electric and magnetic phenomena). Were Maxwells equations incorrectly stated, perhaps? Or, maybe, Galilean relativity did not apply to light? 
Resolving the  Paradox 	  Many explanations were proposed to explain the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment. Two prominent late 19th century physicists, Hendrick Antoon Lorentz (1853-1928) and G.F. Fitzgerald (1851-1901 ), independently suggested that the arm of the interferometer, when parallel to the motion through the ether, was shortened (contracted) by an amount just enough to account for the smaller round trip time of the light. Lorentz suggested that the forces between the molecules of matter, being electrical, would perhaps explain the effect. No evidence supported that conjecture, however. The physics community was flabbergasted. Finally, in 1905, Albert Einsteins famous paper containing whats now known as the special theory of relativity was published, giving a much better explanation for the Michelson-Morley experiment. The mathematics which Lorentz (and Fitzgerald) developed in order to explain the apparent length contraction was the same developed by Einstein in his special theory and is now called the Lorentz transformation. What Lorentz (and Einstein) transformed was Galilean relativity (the Galilean equations of motion), in order that electromagnetic phenomena be described properly. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand the two postulates of the special theory of relativity. Understand what is meant by time dilation and length contraction. Understand the twin paradox. length contraction: Shortening of distance. time dilation: Clocks moving relative to an observer run more slowly compared to the clocks that are at rest relative to the observer. twin paradox: Illustrates questions of the relativity of time. 
Introduction 	  The surprising results for the speed of light were counter to all logic. Einsteins special theory of relativity was a resolution to this, which started from two postulates: Postulate 1: The laws of physics must have the same form in all inertial frames of reference. Postulate 2: The speed of light through a vacuum is constant, regardless of the motion of the source or observer. The first postulate means that we cannot solve the paradox by saying that the ground observer correctly sees how the light moves, and the observer in the car or plane measure the speed wrong for some reason. It has to be that the observer in the plane is correct when they see light move away at the same speed. A space ship traveling with velocity v = 0.4 c approaches a space station housing a light beacon. When the ship is still some distance away, the station turns on the light beacon, as shown in the diagram below. According to the special theory of relativity, as the beam of light passes the space ship, an observer in the space ship will measure the velocity of the light beam as a. 0.6 c b. c c. 1.4 c Answer: The correct answer is B. The second postulate of special relativity asserts that the velocity of light in a vacuum will always be measured as c regardless of the motion of the source or observer. 
Time dilation 	  The first result of relativity is that time is not the same for all frames of reference. The simplest case for relativity is light traveling independently of the direction of motion. To answer the question, we will describe a rather simple clock. The clock functions when a beam of light (shown in orange) is emitted from a source/clock and travels to a mirror. Upon striking the mirror, the light is reflected back, directly opposite the mirror, and both observers A and B record the event, as in Figure 22.5. From the point of view of observer A, the light goes straight up and down, while the ground and observer B are moving off to the left at velocity v. If the distance between the mirror and the source is d, then the round-trip distance the light travels is 2d. Since the light travels with speed c, the one-way travel time tA as measured by observer A is d tA = c The light arrives back at the clock in time 2tA. What time interval will observer B see? Since the mirror moves with velocity v, to the right, observer B will see the light move in a diagonal path as shown in Figure 22.7. From their point of view, the light is travelling a longer distance, but it is still travelling at the same speed, c, from Postulate #2 of relativity. Einsteins answer to the puzzle was that time works differently in this other frame of reference. For observer B, the time for the light to go one way is a different time, tB. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance the light travels one way is: (vtB)2 +d2 = (ctB)2 d2 = (ctB)2 ?(vtB)2 p 2 ?v2 d = tB	c d tB = ? c2 ?v2 This is the time to go one way from the source to the mirror. The return time is the same, so the total time is 2tB. We can relate this back to the time in As frame of reference. tA tB Since the denominator is smaller than 1, the time interval measured by observer B will be longer than the time measured by observer A. We can, therefore, define time dilation as follows: Clocks moving relative to an observer run more slowly compared to the clocks that are at rest relative to the observer. This slowing down of time called time dilation. For example, Earth-bound observers will measure time moving more slowly (than their own time) when observing a space ship moving with velocity v. The situation is symmetric, with each inertial frame seeing the others time as slower. We will shortly see, however, that the symmetry is not preserved if the space ship returns to earth. URL We will see in this chapter that the postulates of special relativity suggest that space and time are not independent of each other, but are interdependent. We refer to this interdependence, today, as space-time. 
Illustrative  Example 1 	  a. A futuristic space ship leaves the Earth traveling at a speed 0.75 c. A clock on board the ship reads an elapsed time of 1.00 h since the take-off. What time interval does an Earth-bound observer measure at that instant? Solution: Proper time is measured in the space ship, thus tp = 1.00 h. t	1.00	h	= 1.51 h t b. The ship slows to a speed of 100,000kmh . Again, if the clock on board the ship measures 1.00 h, what is the amount of time measured on Earth? Solution: Let us first convert into 100,000kmh into kms . A speed of 100,. The speed of light is c = 300,000kms . Therefore, the speed of the space ship in terms of c is . Also, 1.00 h = 3,600 s. Thus, t . This represents a difference in time between inertial frames of 1.5  10?5 s, which from an everyday point of view is negligible. The fact that t depends upon the ratio vc22 shows that when v 1. Clearly, the common speeds that we experience are smaller than 100,000kmh , so there can be no question that t and tp can be considered essentially equal for day-to-day occurrences. To date, the speed of the ship given in part B is about 40% greater than that achieved by any space ship or space probe. You may wonder if the effects of time dilation only apply to clocks. The answer is no! Clocks measure time differently because time itself is different in moving frames of reference. Everything happens slower in such circumstances. Biological systems, for instance, are affected. The process of aging, the beating of ones heart, the pace of breathing, are all subject to the effects of time dilation. The heart rate of a person traveling in a space ship compared to what is measured on earth is slower. Recognition of this fact suggested what called today as the twin paradox. 
The twin paradox 	  Lets say one of two twins decides to take a relativistic trip (a trip where the effects of time dilation cannot be ignored). If the traveling twin leaves when she is 20 years old, traveling at about 0.87 c, she will age half as slowly as her twin who remains on earth. If, after 10 years, as measured by a clock aboard her ship, she returns, shell find that 20 years will have passed on earth. When the two twins meet again, the traveling twin will be 30 years old and the stay-at-home twin will be 40 years old. Does this seem reasonable? The objection is sometimes raised that since all inertial frames are equivalent, the stay-at-home twin could make the same argument and thus she should be younger than the traveling twin. There are several arguments showing that special theory of relativity does not create a paradox and, indeed, it is the twin on the ship who ends up younger. Its important to recall that the special relativity equations above are valid only for the inertial frames of reference, or frames that do not accelerate. In order for the traveling twin to return to the Earth, she must turn around. Any change in direction indicates a change in velocity and, therefore, acceleration. Even though the situation has an interval of acceleration, one can still use special relativity to correctly determine the result. The inertial frame returning may not be the same inertial frame when leaving, but they are both still inertial frames. And if the traveling twin never returns, thus introducing no acceleration, the paradox becomes moot, since there is then no way for the twins to compare ages. Of course, nothing prevents one from arguing that it was the Earth that had undergone the acceleration, and the space ship that had remained motionless. But how would the Earth do this? The only way the Earth could move back and forth is to suppose the entire universe must be moving back and forth. And even with this assumption it can be shown using Einsteins general theory of relativity, which deals with accelerating reference frames, that the results of special relativity are still correct. The situation between the Earth and the rocket ship is not symmetrical. Only the traveling twin has experienced acceleration. Therefore, the twins situations are not equivalent, and the home-bound twin will, in fact, be older. Hey, you cant expect to find eternal youth by staying home, right? URL 
Length contraction 	  We made mention earlier that as a result of special relativity absolute space and absolute time do not exist. Rather, the two are interdependent, and any change in time must cause a change in space (length or distance) and vice versa. How can this be explained? The fact that speed is the ratio of length to time means that both length and time must change, in just the right proportion, in order to ensure the speed of light remain constant. We, therefore, can determine the change in length by using the result we found for time dilation. Let us suppose Earth-bound observers watch a spaceship that travels with velocity v between two distant points. The distance between the two points as measured by an Earth-bound observer is Lp, and the time for the trip is t We can then state Lp = vt (Equation A). t However, t(Equation B). Substituting t in Equation B into Equation A gives us, Lp = v	, but vtp is the distance L measured in the spaceship, so L . The distance the observers in the space ship measure compared to the distance that observers on Earth measure is therefore shorter, since The shortening of distance is called length contraction and it is not limited to the space between two points. The same contraction occurs for material objects. For example, if one inertial frame, moving with a velocity v, passed another inertial frame containing a meter stick, the observers in these frames will not agree on the length of the meter stick. Those at rest relative to the meter stick will claim it does measure one meter. The occupants of the moving frame, on the other hand, will claim it is shorter than one meter. It must be noted that length contraction is observed only in the direction of motion of the moving object. In our example with a meter stick, the width of the meter stick does not change, only its length. URL Answer: 
L   Ly 	  Answer: We can see that the time and length in special relativity are changed by a factor of . In the case of length, we get the rather amazing result that from the point of view of light, all material objects contract to zero length since v = c. Therefore, the meter stick, as well as any object, has zero length as measured by our perceptive photons. From a photons point of view, then, it takes zero time to get anywhere. Youll never convince a photon that theyre not on time! 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand what is meant by simultaneous events. Understand the twin paradox. proper time simultaneity: A thought experiment used to illustrate the relative nature of time. 
Simultaneity 	  If the velocity of light is constant regardless of the motion of the source or observer, we can demonstrate that Newtons idea of absolute time cannot hold. Observers in different inertial frames will measure unequal time intervals when observing the same event. The classic example of this is a thought experiment suggested by Einstein. The example involves a railroad embankment and a very long train. The rails are attached to Earth, which we assume represents an inertial frame, and the train moving with velocity v relative to the rails is another inertial frame. We can define what we mean by simultaneous in this manner: We mark points A and B on the rails and in the train as shown in Figure 22.8. At the moment the train is coincident with A and B, lightning strikes the rails at A and B. An observer O on the ground has positioned himself equidistant from A and B. He measures the arrival time of the two light flashes at his location, discovering that the times are identical. Under such conditions we claim that the lightning strikes occurred simultaneously at points A and B with respect to the ground observer. The question, however, is: Will an observer on the train, moving with velocity v, as shown, who is positioned exactly above O (in blue) at the instant of the lightning strikes, measure the arrival time of the lightning to be identical? As the train travels to the right in Figure 22.9, we can see that the light moving from B will reach the observer earlier than the light traveling from A, since the train is moving toward B and away A. The light from B has less distance to cover than the light from A. The observer in the train will, therefore, claim that the lightning strikes are not simultaneous. Thus, the Newtonian idea of an absolute and unchanging time will not hold if the velocity of light is independent of the source and the observer. URL Let us compare the classical Newtonian explanation of the above situation with the modern explanation. 
Classical  Newtonian view 	  The reason that an observer on the train moving with velocity v sees the lightning arrive from B sooner than from A is because the velocity of the light from B relative to the observer is c+v. Meanwhile, the velocity of light from A relative to the observer is c?v. A Newtonian, or classical, physicist would claim that the events were simultaneous in both inertial frames (the embankment and the train), and assert that time is an absolute quantity unchanged by motion. 
Modern view 	  According to a modern physicist the (actual) reason the observer on the train sees the light from point B sooner than the light from point A is because the distance the light must travel from B to reach the observer is smaller than the distance the light must travel from A. (The train is moving toward the light from B and away from the light at A.) The velocity of the light relative to the observer is c, regardless if the observer is moving toward or away from the light. This is the second postulate of the theory of special relativity, as counterintuitive as it may seem to be! 
The twin paradox 	  Lets say that one of two twins decides to take a relativistic trip, which we define as a trip where the effects of time dilation cannot be ignored. If the traveling twin leaves when she is 20 years old, traveling at about 0.87 c, she will age half as slowly as the twin who remains on Earth.

Mass- Energy 	  Using special relativity, force and momentum must also be altered with the multiplicative factor . The relativistic equations for force and momentum are: ma 
 	  mv p = mv ? p Using special relativity, Einstein was also able to show that mass and energy were not independent of each other, but rather, equivalent. In fact, energy could be converted to mass and vice versa. We state without proof that Einstein derived the relationship between energy and mass as E = qmc2	. The term mc2 is called the rest energy of the object. Einstein reasoned that since mass and energy were equivalent, a resting object of mass m would have an equivalent energy mc2. Thus, even when an object has no kinetic energy, it still has energy by virtue of the fact it has mass. The total energy E of the object can be rewritten as 
E = mc2 + 	  The total energy E of an object is equal to the sum of the rest energy of the object mc2, and the kinetic energy of the object KE. Notice that if the KEof the object is zero, the total energy of the object reduces to E = mc2, Einsteins iconic equation. We can also show that the relativistic equation E = mc2 +KE reduces to the Newtonian equation for the kinetic energy when v  c. We show this result in the following example.

Relative velocity 	  We began our discussion of relativity by stating that the results of Maxwells equations, that light must always travel at a constant velocity c in a vacuum, contradicted the results of Galilean relative velocity. Namely, relative velocity could not be calculated by the vector addition of velocities, that is~vr . We have seen that in order to preserve Galilean relativity, the expressions for both time and space needed to be changed. Since observers in different inertial frames measure different times and different lengths, the equation for the calculating Galilean relative velocity must also change. Einstein showed how the Galilean equation for relative velocities must be changed in order for light (and the theory of electromagnetism) to remain consistent with Galilean relativity. The correct relativistic addition of velocities equation which Einstein (and Lorentz) derived looks like this: vr = v1+v1vv22 , where v1 is the velocity of an inertial frame (S0) measured in the proper frame (S), and v2 is the velocity of an object (or light wave) measured with respect to (S0). The relative velocity vr is with respect to frame (S). For example, if the above equation is applied to the Michelson-Morley experiment, we have v1 = 30kms	,the velocity of the sun (S0) with respect to the earth (S) and the velocity of light v2 = c with respect to the sun (S0). If we wish to calculate the speed of light vr relative to the earth we have: vr = v	c	s cc	s	1	30 kmsc +c. 1+ c2	1+ c	c This is, of course, the actual result of the experiment: the velocity of light is c regardless of the motion of the Earth. Recall the example of the girl on the skateboard discussed earlier in the chapter. The girl has velocity 4.0ms relative to the Earth, when she throws a ball with velocity 6.0ms relative to herself. The velocity of the ball relative to the Earth, vr using the relativistic equation for velocity addition is (when the ball is thrown in the positive direction), Notice how small the factor vcv	is compared to 1. In this non-relativistic case we have vc. Unless the quantity vcv is comparable to 1, the relativistic equation will reduce to the old Galilean equation for relative velocity: vr . c2 In fact, all of the equations of special relativity will reduce to the classical ones when v  c. We typically regard Newtonian physics as a low-speed case of the special theory of relativity. This in known as the principle of correspondence.

Objectives 	  The student will: Understand the twin paradox. Understand the equivalence of mass and energy. principle of equivalence: An accelerating frame of reference is indistinguishable from the acceleration due to gravity. 
The general theory of relativity 	  The general theory of relativity, as mentioned earlier, deals with frames of reference undergoing acceleration. Einstein published this theory in 1916, eleven years after special relativity. The mathematics needed to understand general relativity is well beyond the level of this book, so we will mention just one of the most important consequences of the theory, the principle of equivalence. 
The principle of equivalence 	  The principle of equivalence states that an accelerating frame of reference is indistinguishable from the acceleration due to gravity. For example, imagine a person in an elevator in deep space far from any gravitational fields. If the elevator is accelerating at 9.81sm2 , every experiment conducted in the elevator would produce the same results as that same experiment would on Earth. If the person was not aware of the location of the elevator, they could reasonably assume they were standing stationary on Earth. Additionally, if the elevator were not accelerating, but just floating in deep space with no appreciable gravitational fields and a person held an object and released it, the object would remain floating in front of them. The same event would occur if the elevator was freely falling on the Earth. Again, the occupants of the elevator could not determine if they were accelerating (falling freely) due to a gravitational field, or motionless in deep space. The general theory of relativity can be thought of as a theory of gravity. Einstein was able to explain the nature of gravity without resorting to action at a distance. The general theory explained gravity as a curvature in space-time produced by mass. The more massive the body, the greater the curvature. The sun, for example, warps the space around it, and the planets follow paths along this warped space as shown in Figure below. There is no invisible force reaching out and holding the planets in their orbit. The difference between Newtons conception of gravity and Einsteins has been compared to observing a child rolling a ball upon the ground. Newton is pictured on a tall building observing the child from far away. He notices that when the child rolls the ball, it always moves toward the center of the pavement. Naturally, Newton assumes that a force must be pulling the ball toward the center. Einstein, however, is on the ground observing the child and sees that the pavement is sunken in the middle and this is the reason the ball always rolls toward the center. The sun warps space according to general relativity. To see the effect of mass warping space, see the link below. URL For a recap of special relativity, the link below may be of assistance. URL Postulate 1: The laws of physics have the same form in all inertial frames of reference. Postulate 2: The speed of light in vacuum is constant in all inertial frames of reference. Clocks moving relative to an observer who assumes himself at rest, run more slowly compared to the clocks in the at rest frame. Such a slowing of time is called time dilation. The transformation equation between the two frames is given by t t	v2 c2 The time tp is the proper time (also called the lab or at rest frame). Objects in motion with respect to a proper frame (or rest frame) of reference are contracted in the direction of their motion.

Quantum mechanics is the solution to what seemed like inconsistent behavior of atoms and light, that resolves dilemmas over what is a wave and what is a particle. Lasers create a precise wavelength due to quantum mechanics, and are increasingly found throughout everyday life. This chapter covers black body radiation and Plancks quantum hypothesis, photons and the photoelectric effect, and wave-particle duality. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how difficulty with blackbody radiation leads to the particle interpretation of light. Understand Plancks quantum hypothesis. blackbody radiation: Ideal approximation of the different spectra of different substances. Plancks constant: h = 6.62610?34 J ?s, used in Plancks equation. quantized: Not-continuous, discrete. 
Blackbody radiation 	  Glowing iron displays a range of colors between red, orange, and yellow As objects heat up, they generally begin to glow, giving off light like the hot iron in the picture above. As their temperature goes up, more light and a different spectrum of light results. Different substances have different spectra, but many approximate an ideal known as blackbody radiation. We call an idealized body that absorbs all energy a black body because black does not reflect any of the electromagnetic waves. Instead of reflecting the light that shines on it, a black body absorbs the light and its temperature goes up. From the motion of the temperature, the electrons in it are vibrating and produce electromagnetic waves. Higher temperature means faster vibration and higher frequencies. The sun acts very similarly to a black body, because it releases its internal energy as light from the surface and does not reflect incoming light. During the late 19th century, physicists were able to experimentally determine what the shape of the curve for blackbody radiation looked like for objects at different temperatures, including the sun. Figure 23.3 shows two blackbody curves, one where the greatest intensity is at a temperature of 3000 K (a red star) and the other where the greatest intensity is at 6000 K (a yellow star such as our sun). The blackbody spectrum of two stars. 
The  Classical  Prediction 	  The problem with this observed result is that it did not match with the theoretical results from classic electromagnetism. Classical electromagnetism treated the radiation as the smooth result of many different vibrations. With many different vibrations within the body, the classical prediction was that shorter wavelengths were always more common than longer wavelengths. There was no peak in the middle only a peak against the extreme of wavelength zero. This is known as Rayleigh-Jeans Law, after British physicist Lord Rayleigh (1842-1919) and Sir James Jean (1877-1946). The failure of this prediction was a puzzle for many years. The observed rate of different wavelengths of light from the Sun, compared to the classical prediction. 
Plancks  Equation 	  In 1900, at the same time as the classical prediction was made, the German physicist Max Planck (1858-1947) derived a mathematical equation that correctly matched the experimental results. However, at the time, he had no physical explanation for what the equation meant. The mathematics implied that the energy given off by a blackbody was not continuous, but given off at certain specific wavelengths, in regular increments. If Planck assumed that the energy of blackbody radiation was in the form 
E = nhf , where 	  nis an integer (now called a quantum number), h, a constant, (now known as Plancks constant), with the value h = 6.62610?34 J ?s and f is the frequency of the light emitted, then he could explain what the mathematics represented. This was indeed difficult for Planck to accept, because at the time, there was no reason to presume that the energy should only be radiated at specific frequencies. Nothing in Maxwells laws suggested such a thing. It was as if the vibrations of a mass on the end of a spring could only occur at specific energies. Imagine the mass slowly coming to rest due to friction, but not in a continuous manner. Instead, the mass jumps from one fixed quantity of energy to another without passing through the intermediate energies. To use a different analogy, it is as if what we had always imagined as smooth inclined planes were, in fact, a series of closely spaced steps that only presented the illusion of continuity. Nature, it seemed, was quantized (non-continuous, or discrete). If this was so, how could Maxwells equations correctly predict this result? Planck spent a good deal of time attempting to reconcile the behavior of electromagnetic waves with the discrete nature of the blackbody radiation, to no avail. It was not until 1905, with yet another paper published by Albert Einstein, that the wave nature of light was expanded to include the particle interpretation of light which adequately explained Plancks equation.

Introduction 	  The photoelectric effect describes how light gives energy to electrons, allowing them to jump across an electric field. The basic experimental setup is shown below. The photoelectric cell is a sealed glass chamber with a vacuum inside, and a gap between the wide metal plate on the negative side and the small metal plate on the positive side. The light source is set up to shine light on the wide metal surface. The ammeter on the circuit shows current results when light shines on the wide metal surface. It is understood that the light gives energy to the electrons, enabling some of them to jump across the vacuum gap to the other side. The Figure 23.6 shows the result when the light is turned on. It was clear that light somehow initiated a current, by causing electrons from the metal surface to jump across the gap to the anode.	The electrons crossing are shown as blue dashed lines. There are two fundamental parameters that can be varied in the effect: 
The intensity of the light 	  A simplified view of the photoelectric effect experiment setup. There are also two things that can be measured in the effect: The current, as measured in the ammeter, shows the number of electrons released. By varying the voltage in the circuit, a rough measure of the kinetic energy (KE) of the electrons can be obtained. Less voltage means that the electrons need more KE in order to jump the gap. 
Classical  Prediction 	  According to the classical theory, the intensity of a wave is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave. A higher amplitude will shake the electron to a greater degree. As the electrons are shaken, they will gain energy and eventually be pushed out of their orbit around the nucleus. We take these key predictions from that: If the intensity of the light wave was increased, not only would more electrons be ejected, but those ejected would have a greater kinetic energy. The photoelectric effect should occur for any light, regardless of frequency. Lower frequency or intensity will have less energy, and will take more time to transfer enough energy for electrons to escape. 
Experimental  Results 	  The actual results contradicted the classical prediction markedly. Increasing the intensity of the light increased the number of electrons (the current), but had no effect on the kinetic energy of the electrons released. Increasing the frequency of the light increased the kinetic energy of the electrons released, but not the current. For some materials, a low-intensity blue light would eject electrons, whereas the red or orange light, no matter how bright, would cause no photoelectric effect at all. 
Einsteins  Explanation 	  In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed that Plancks blackbody equation could be explained in terms of the particle, or photon, model of light, rather than the wave model. The particle model suggests that light can be thought of as particles called photons, rather than as waves. Einstein suggested an explanation for Plancks equation based upon a phenomenon called the photoelectric effect, which had been observed but never properly explained. Physicists had known since the late 19th century that when light was incident upon a metal surface, under certain conditions, electrons were ejected from the surface. However, until Einsteins proposed model, there was no adequate explanation for that mysterious phenomenon, which is known as the photoelectric effect. Einsteins assumption was that photons of light were responsible for ejecting electrons and creating the observed current. Furthermore, he claimed that the energy carried by each photon was given in terms of Plancks equation: 
E = hf 	  Therefore, the greater the frequency of the photon, the greater the kinetic energy of the ejected photon would be. Blue light, for example, should emit electrons with a greater kinetic energy then red light. Einstein went a step further and said that the photons must have a minimum frequency fo in order to eject electrons from the metal. This minimum frequency is known as the threshold frequency . The threshold frequency corresponds to the minimum energy (Eo)E0 = hf0 needed to overcome the electrical forces which bind the electron within the metal. We now call this minimum energy the work function of the metal (Wo), or Wo = hfo. Einsten gave the maximum kinetic energy of an ejected electron as: 
Emax = hf ?hfo or  Emax = hf ? Wo 	  This equation is known as Einsteins equation for photoelectric effect and is, essentially, a statement of the law of conservation of energy applied to photoelectric effect. Interestingly, the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons could be relatively easily determined by gradually reversing the potential difference V of the source shown in Figure 23.6. As the reversed potential is slowly increased, the current in the circuit eventually decreases to zero. The work done in stopping the ejected electrons (also known as photoelectrons) would equal their maximum kinetic energy. W = eVo = ?KE ? 0?KEmax = eVo ? ?KEmax = eVo But since the potential difference is reversed, 
Vo ? ? Vo 	  So KEmax = eVo, Where Vo is called the stopping potential or stopping voltage. Follow the links below for more information on the photoelectric effect.

Uranium 	  In the years 1913-1914, Robert A. Millikan (1868-1953) carried out an extensive set of photoelectric experiments that confirmed Einsteins predictions. The photoelectric effect has many practical applications. Automatic doors function by using a photoelectric current. When a person attempts to enter or leave a doorway, the photoelectric beam is interrupted, causing a drop in the current that triggers a switch of some sort (perhaps a solenoid, as discussed earlier) which opens the door. When the beam is no longer interrupted, the circuit is closed, as is the door. The photoelectric effect is used in many common devices from burglar alarms to smoke detectors to sophisticated electronic circuitry. In 1921, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) won the Nobel Prize in physics for his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. Interestingly, he never got one for his papers published on the special or general theories of relativity. In 1923, Robert Millikan won the Nobel Prize in physics for his experimental verification of Einsteins 1905 paper and for determining the charge of the electron.

Objective 	  The student will: Understand that light has both wave and particle attributes. wave-particle duality: The wave-particle nature of light. 
Introduction 	  In 1927, two physicists, C.J Davisson (1881-1958) and L.H. Germer (1896-1971), conducted an experiment on electrons scattering through a target made of nickel. Due to an accident in their procedure, the target was changed to the crystalline form of nickel, which had atoms in a very regular structure. They found was that the scattered electrons displayed a diffraction pattern, with peaks at certain heights that related to the spacing of the atoms. As it turned out, this was key evidence that confirmed the ongoing work of French physicist Louis de Broglie (18921987). 
Waves and  Particles 	  From the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, it was clear that light had unusual properties where it acted as both a wave and a particle. It had frequency like a wave, and displayed effects of interference such as the two-slit experiment, as well as the Doppler Effect. At the atomic scale, however, it acted in some ways as a particle as in the photoelectric effect. What appeared at first to be a smooth variation of wavelengths was actually a very finely grained set of distinct wavelengths, or quanta, as shown in blackbody radiation. This is known as the wave-particle nature of light, or wave-particle duality. Danish physicist Niels Bohr (18851962) suggested that one must choose whether an experiment is to be performed using the wave nature of light or the particle nature of light, but never both! So, what is light really? If modern physics teaches us anything, it is that the world of our senses is limited. Macroscopic phenomena such as rolling balls and splashing waves appeal to our everyday senses and behave and accord to the expectations of those senses. But in reality, the only things our senses are directly privy to are the net macroscopic effects of an untold number of atomic interactions. We have no first-hand appreciation of how the atomic world behaves. And we have no reason to assume that once we begin to get hints of this entirely different world, it would merrily conform to our perceived macroscopic notions. Light, we may say, is that thing which manifests its behavior as a wave or a particle. Perhaps, someday we will understand it as something altogether different, but probably not something simpler. The link below provides additional commentary on the nature of wave-particle duality. URL 
Matter as waves 	  It is not unreasonable to pose the following question: If light can behave as a particle, is it not possible that particles can behave as waves? This was the very question that French physicist Louis de Broglie (1892-1987) asked in his doctoral thesis in 1925. At the time, De Broglies side was received with skepticism, since there was no evidence which called for such an explanation. De Broglies thesis suggested that all material particles possessing momentum would have an associated wave. We can show that a photon of light carries momentum: p = Ec The wavelength of the light wave can be found by replacing E = hf in the above equation: hf Thus, De Broglie assumed that the wavelength of a matter wave would obey the same relationship as the wavelength of la ight wave. Substituting p = mv into Equation A, we have: mv  mvh Since De Broglies supplied the above equation in his doctoral thesis, it was then a matter of experimentation to see if his prediction was true. It was suggested a year later that a crystalline solid may act as a diffraction grating for a beam of electrons. Thus, if electrons had an associated wave, a diffraction pattern would emerge similar to a diffraction pattern that would be produced by the light passing through the crystal. In fact, that was the genesis of the idea. It had already been shown that x-rays passing through a crystal yielded diffraction patterns permitting physicists to measure the wavelength of x-rays. De Broglies prediction for the wavelength of electron matter waves could be tested at wavelengths comparable to those of x-rays. Such an experiment could confirm if De Broglies hypothesis was true. The experiment was performed by C.J Davisson (1881-1958) and L.H. Germer (1896-1971) and fully confirmed de Broglies hypothesis. It bears restating that De Broglies description is valid for all particles whether they are charged or uncharged, small or large, all material objects have associated matter waves. In 1929, De Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work. What is the associated wave for a baseball of mass 145 g traveling with velocity 40.0 ms ? Solution: ? = mvh = 6.62610?34 J?s = 1.1410?34 m Small wonder that the associated waves of macroscopic objects are not observable experimentally! The fact that Plancks constant is so tiny ensures that macroscopic events remain easily within the domain of Newtonian (classical) physics. 
Illustrative  Example 23.3.1 	  What wavelength is associated with an electron beam of kinetic energy 95 eV? (The mass of an electron is me = 9.111031 kg) Solution: We first must determine the velocity of the electrons: 
 	  s Thus, the wavelength is: ? = mvh = (9.11106.626?31kg10)(?534.776J?s106 ms ) = 1.25910?10 m = 0.126 nm 
The electron microscope 	  Proof of De Broglies hypothesis meant that wavelengths much smaller than light could be used to probe ever smaller and smaller structures. Using wavelengths larger or comparable to the size of an object you wish to see produces blurry, out-of-focus images. For example, the wavelengths of visible light are in the range 400 nm to 750 nm. Trying to observe objects smaller than the size of these wavelengths is not possible. The limit to which an optical instrument can focus properly is called the resolving power of the instrument. An analogy may be helpful to understand the role of wavelength and resolving power. Imagine closing your eyes and using your palm to recognize a chair, by touch. It will probably take only a moment to realize the object is a chair of some sort. The overall pattern will be recognizable to you. However, if the chair has some intricate patterns carved into the wood, your palm will not provide a distinct image of the pattern. Should you be permitted to use your finger rather than only your palm, you will be able to perceive the finer features of the chair. In the first instance, your palm was much smaller than the overall pattern, and so you were able to resolve the image (in your mind) of a chair. However, the finer details, being smaller than your palm, were lost or at best blurry to you. Perhaps your palm felt a slight indentation. By using the smaller probe of your finger, smaller details of the chair could be recognized. So, analogously, the smaller the wavelength, the better the resolution. Since matter waves of electrons have such small wavelengths, they can be used to resolve much finer images than visible light. It was not long after the first successful experiments confirming the existence of matter waves that scientists realized that better microscopes could be built, which used electron matter waves rather than light waves. The first electron microscope was built in 1931. Electron microscopes have many uses. They are an important diagnostic tool in medicine, a research tool in the field of biomedicine, and play a vital role in the analysis of materials, where defects and strengths of materials can be found and analyzed. The role of the electron microscope in science and industry cannot be overstated. 1. The Planck equation relates the energy E of a photon of light to its frequency f

This chapter covers modeling the atom and atomic spectra, the Bohr atom, and the Uncertainty Principle. 
Objective 	  The student will: Understand Rutherfords model of the atom. 
Introduction 	  The structure of the atom was first probed at the end of the 19th century, through study of radiation and radioactivity. Three of the first forms of radiation studied were: X-rays, discovered in 1895 by Wilhelm C. Roentgen (1845-1923). Radiation from uranium, discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) and further studied by Marie Curie (1867-1934). Electrons then called cathode rays were discovered decades earlier by German physicist Johann Hittorf, but their mass was measured in 1897 by British physicist J. J. Thomson (1856-1940), who is credited with their discovery. Soon after, British physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) and French physicist Paul Villard separated radiation into three types, which would eventually be named alpha, beta, and gamma. Radiation would prove to be a key probe of the inside of the atom. 
The  Gold  Foil  Experiment 	  Rutherford conceived an experiment to probe the structure of the atom with the help of Hans Geiger (1882-1945), who co-invented the Geiger counter. The actual experiment was carried out by a 19-year-old undergraduate student, Ernest Marsden, (1889-1970) and Geiger himself. The experiment was set up in an evacuated chamber watching alpha particles directed at an extremely thin metal foil, using a fluorescent screen as a detector, as shown in Figure 24.2. A deflected alpha particle would make a tiny flash on the screen visible through a microscope. Marsdens job was to sit in the dark and look for these tiny flashes on the microscpe at a spot on the screen, and record how many flashes he saw per minute for different angles and different types of foil. The general results were: Most of the particles, as expected, traveled straight through the foil. It was known that radiation would penetrate through solid matter. Some particles did scatter, and some even scattered back by more than 90 degrees. In these cases, the alpha particles were repelled backward! gold foil experiThe	Geiger-Marsden ment. It was the backwards scattering that was most remarkable, and the rate of these was the subject of Geiger and Marsdens first paper. Rutherford described the results with astonishment. "Its almost as incredible as if you fired a fifteen-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you, he wrote. 
Implications for the  Atom 	  This result can be considered with a simple parallel. Picture that you are outside of an area with black curtains around it, not knowing what is inside. You can throw a bunch of baseballs through the curtains, and see where they go. However, you cannot look inside. What happens is that nearly all of the baseballs go straight through, without any apparent deflection. However, a few deflect at different angles, and a tiny fraction even bounce straight backwards. What would you conclude? 
Thomsons  Model of the  Atom 	  At the time, the prevailing model of the atom was from J.J. Thomson, who had discovered the electron. Electrons were known to have very little mass compared to the atom as a whole. He had proposed an atomic model, Figure 24.4, where tiny electrons were evenly distributed within a fluid of positive charge throughout the atom dubbed the plum pudding model for its resemblance to pudding with raisins suspended in it. This model failed to explain Geiger and Marsdens discovery.	The soft pudding would not knock some particles straight back, while leaving most undeflected. 
Rutherfords  Model of the  Atom 	  Rutherford explained the Geiger-Marsden result by suggesting that the atom was mostly empty space, and that the mass of the atom was all compacted into a dense core at the center. A tiny, dense core would mean that most particles would pass through without being deflected. A few would be deflected to the side, and some would hit dead-on and head backward. The differences between Thomsons model prediction (top diagram) and Rutherfords explanation of the Geiger-Marsden result (bottom diagram) are shown in Figure 24.5. The top diagram shows Thomsons model and the bottom diagram Rutherfords interpretation of the atom having a densely packed positive nucleus. Rutherford decided that the results could only mean that the positive charge was confined to a very small part of each atom that he named the nucleus. The nucleus would, therefore, be a very small region of very dense positive charge containing almost 99.99 % of the entire mass of the atom. This could account for the scattering of the alpha particles that came close enough to the nucleus. For more information on Rutherfords experiment follow the link below. URL Rutherfords experiment suggested that the nucleus of an atom had a size between 10?15 m and 10?14 m. It was already known, however, that the size of an atom was about 10?10 m. Rutherford conjectured that the size of the electron orbits must be many thousands of times larger than the nucleus of the atom. Thus, the atom must have been composed of mostly empty space, which explained why most of the alpha particles easily traveled through the foil. Rutherfords model of the atom was similar to the scaled-down solar system a few comparatively small bodies (planets) in orbit about a massive central body (the sun). Rutherford published his paper in 1911. URL

Emission  Spectrum of  Hydrogen 	  Heating different elements creates different kinds of light. This is usually done by taking the gaseous form of an element, putting it in a sealed glass tube, and applying high voltage to the gas. The high voltage ionizes the gas and it gives off a distinct color depending on the element. For example, neon gas glows a bright red-orange color (the natural color of neon signs), while sodium vapor glows yellow and hydrogen glows pink. As discussed earlier, when sunlight is refracted through a prism, we see a rainbow spectrum. When the light from a heated element is refracted in a prism, however, we dont see a smooth rainbow spectrum. Instead, we see a distinct set of sharp bright lines, called the emission spectrum (or line spectrum) of that element. The diagram below shows a simple model of a spectroscope to measure the emission spectrum of hydrogen. In an actual spectroscope, a diffraction grating may be used instead of a triangular glass prism, but the effect is the same to separate colors in proportion to their wavelength. A detailed view of this is explained in the video in the link below. A simple model of a spectroscope. URL Hydrogen has only one electron per atom and possesses the simplest line spectrum. The spectrum is shown in detail in the Figure 24.7. Hydrogen gas emits line spectra. Each line is a specific color with a distinct, constant wavelength. TABLE 24.1: 
Faintest	 Violet, farthest left 	  In 1885, Swiss high-school teacher Johann Balmer (1825-1898) put forth a mathematical description of the line spectra of the hydrogen atom. He derived an empirical formula that describes the observed wavelength ? for each line in the hydrogen spectrum. A different integer n is associated with each emission line in the Figure 24.7, starting with n = 3 for the red emission line. , The letter R is known as the Rydberg constant, after Swedish physicist Johannes Robert Rydberg (1854-1919), who generalized Balmers empirical result. 
R = 1.097107 m?1 	  Balmers equation gives results for emitted hydrogen spectra known today as the Balmer series. See the simulation below to try the Balmer series. URL As n increases, nsmaller, so the lines must fall closer together. As n becomes increasingly larger, the separation between lines becomes so small that the spectrum begins to look continuous. It was later found that Balmers formula could be extended to include electromagnetic radiation of smaller and larger wavelengths (as anticipated by Rydberg) than those of visible light. The Lyman Series, for example, describes the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum for the hydrogen atom, and has the same form as the Balmer series, as shown below. The Paschen series, as well, describes the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum for the hydrogen atom, and also has the same form as the Balmer series, as shown below. 
Illustrative  Example 25.2.1 	  What line spectrum frequency of light does the Lyman series predict for n = 4? Solution: The formula for the Lyman series is: 
 	  R	? = 9.72310?8 m (97.2 nm) 
Bohrs  Model 	  A 27-year-old Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962) was working in Rutherfords laboratory, and attempted to explain inconsistencies in the model where electrons were in orbit around a tiny, dense, positive nucleus. According to classical electromagnetic theory, a charge spinning in a circle like an orbiting electron is being accelerated back and forth, and it should radiate out electromagnetic waves just by orbiting. This did not happen. Hydrogen by itself radiated no light. Instead, it gave off light when energized, but only in specific lines as described by Balmer. Bohr suspected that Rutherfords atomic model would require some form of quantization similar to the one described in the works of Planck and Einstein. He postulated (that is, stated without proof) that electrons could not lose energy in a continuous fashion but rather only when going from one energy state to another, as described by the Planck equation: 
E = nhf 	  The energy of the atom must, therefore, be quantized. Bohr also assumed that electrons could only take on specific (allowed) orbits about the nucleus, so the orbit radii must be quantized as well. Electrons radiate or absorb energy only when changing from one allowed orbit to another. He called the allowed orbits stationary states. An electron in each stationary state possesses a definite energy. Electrons, Bohr hypothesized, could jump from one stationary state to another when absorbing or emitting a single photon. Not just any photon would do, of course. A photon of a specific energy had to be absorbed by the electron in order for the electron to move into a stationary state of higher energy. The electron would then be in an excited stationary state and would quickly emit the energy it had absorbed and fall back into its previous lower stationary state. Energy could, therefore, be emitted or absorbed only in going from one stationary state to another within the atom. That idea could explain the reason for a discrete line spectrum and do away with Maxwells prediction that all accelerating charges must radiate electromagnetic energy. Bohr made several important assumptions in order to (mathematically) derive a model of the hydrogen atom based on quantization. We state his assumptions (postulates) below: Using these assumptions, Bohr was able to derive the following: The allowed radii for the hydrogen atom are rn = n2r1,n = 1,2,..., Equation A, where r1 is the smallest orbital radius of the hydrogen atom, commonly referred to as the Bohr radius. The Bohr radius is r1 = 0.52910?10 m. The result is in good agreement with the previous estimates of the radius of the atom. The allowable energy levels, or stationary states, of the Bohr atom are, E	En	, Equation B, where E1 is called the ground state of the atom. The ground state is the lowest-energy state of the atom. In the hydrogen atom, the ground state energy is about 
E1 = ?13.6 e 	  The negative sign indicates that the electron must absorb 13.6 eV in order to be ejected from the atom. This energy is called the ionization energy of the ground state of the hydrogen atom. Energies E2,E3, ... represent higher-energy, or excited states of the electron. Notice that the higher the energy level, the less negative is the corresponding energy. For example, 
The difference between allowable energy levels can be expressed as 	  hf = Eh ?El, where Eh is a higher energy state of the electron and El is a lower energy state of the electron. When an electron undergoes a change in energy, we often say it has undergone a transition. Bohr was able to derive the results of the Balmer, Lyman, and Paschen series based on his assumptions. A slightly more generalized version of these series given by Bohr is

Objectives 	  The student will: Understand the uncertainty principle. Solve problems involving the uncertainty principle. Heisenberg uncertainty principle: A fundamental constraint, upon any such set of measurements, made with any tool. The more narrowly we define the position ?x, the less well defined we know the momentum, ?p. Quantum mechanics: Changed the view of the atom from the orderly arrangement of the planetary atom to what is known today as an electron cloud model. 
Introduction 	  Bohrs model of the atom established the principle that electrons could only orbit the nucleus in a limited number of levels, or quantized levels. This matched previous evidence for quantum mechanics, such as: Black body radiation like heated iron was shown to have very many different tiny wavelengths. The photoelectric effect showed that light could act like a particle. Diffraction of electrons showed that electrons could act like waves. The essence of early quantum mechanics was two principles: There was no connection established yet between this and electrons in orbit around the nucleus. 
Electrons as  Standing  Waves 	  The connection between waves and electron orbits was only suggested more than ten years after Bohrs model of the atom, by French physicist Louis de Broglie (1892-1987). The reason that the properties of Bohr atom had to be quantized, according to de Broglie, was to accommodate a standing wave condition around the nucleus of the atom. From wave theory, a standing wave is also called a harmonic, and consists of a stable state with distinct numbers for how many wavelengths fit into the fixed length. De Broglie suggested that electrons orbiting around the nucleus could be acting as waves, forming circular standing waves based on the size of the orbit. Just as a string which could only support a discrete set of wavelengths between its fixed nodes, an integer number of electron waves would have to fit within an orbital. See Figure 24.8. With de Broglies hypothesis confirmed by the work of C.J Davisson and L.H. Germer, Bohrs atomic theory finally had a physical explanation to support it. Electron orbits as standing waves around the nucleus. This neatly connected the wave-particle duality and the observation that electrons would only occupy distinct orbits. However, it was still unclear what matter or energy really was waves or particles. 
The  Heisenberg  Uncertainty  Principle 	  German physicist Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) suggested an approach that treated matter as particles, but the exact position and speed of the particle was fundamentally fuzzy and uncertain. This uncertainty around the particle is continuous and results in wave-like properties. Take the case of light passing through a single narrow slit. In classical physical optics, we would treat this as a wave. In Heisenbergs formulation, though, we can look at the light as a set of particles photons that are flying at the slit. As the photons reach the slit, their position is precisely determined. Those that get through have a well-defined position. The Uncertainty Principle says that the more narrowly we define the position ?x, the less well defined we know the momentum, ?p. In principle, we could use very small-wavelength electromagnetic energy, say, gamma rays, and very accurately locate the electron by detecting where the collision between the photon and the electron took place. But any hope of determining the momentum of the electron at the time of the interaction is gone. It would be like slamming a fast-moving bowling ball into a Ping-Pong ball in an attempt to determine how fast the Ping-Pong ball was traveling before the collision. We call this the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It should not be thought of as an uncertainty due to the lacking effectiveness of the measuring tool used. Rather, it is a fundamental constraint, upon any such set of measurements, made with any tool. Heisenberg stated the uncertainty principle in mathematical terms. We will briefly explain his thinking. Heisenberg reasoned that the location of an object could be no more accurate than the wavelength of the light used to detect the object. Thus, if light of wavelength ? is used to detect the object, its location in space would have an uncertainty of ?x = ? Light coming through a single slit, treated as a wave. Similarly, the uncertainty in the objects momentum would be ?p = h since the momentum depends upon wave? length. The uncertainties would multiply if both measurements were attempted simultaneously. Thus, ?x?p ? h Heisenbergs more detailed calculation (which we will not do here) yielded the inequality ?x?p ? 2h? It is important to notice that the more precise one of the measurements, the less precise the other measurement. In principle then, one can measure either the position or the momentum of an object to any degree of precision, but not both. In fact: the more precise one measurement, the less precise the other measurement. Quantum mechanics changed the view of the atom from the orderly arrangement of the planetary atom to what is known today as an electron cloud model. The fact that an electron has wavelike characteristics means it is spread out in space. Thus, the notion of an exact location for an electron is incompatible with its very nature. Heisenbergs uncertainty principle essentially ensures that there can be no well-defined planetary model of the atom. At best, we can say that the location of an electron within an atom is probabilistic. The orbits we speak of today are the average values of probable locations of the electron within the atom. This video shows a demonstration and explanation of the effect: Treating light as an uncertain particle. URL 
Illustrative  Example 25.3.1 	  a. The uncertainty in the momentum of an electron is given as ?p = 1.54  10?27 kg?s m. What is the minimum uncertainty in its position if both measurements are attempted simultaneously? Solution: h	?27 kg?m	6.62610?34 J ? ?x?p ?x ? 6.84710?8 ? 6.8510?8 m Therefore, the minimum uncertainty is 6.8510?8 m. b. How many times larger is ?x compared to the radius of the Bohr radius? Solution: The Bohr radius is r1 = 0.52910?10 m. Thus, The uncertainty in the position of the electron is nearly 1,300 times greater than the Bohr radius, which reinforces the notion of the electron cloud model as opposed to the well-defined planetary atom. 
Illustrative  Example 25.3.2 	  The uncertainty in the velocity of a car of mass 1000 kg is 0.75 m/s. What is the minimum uncertainty in the cars position? Solution: 
The uncertainty in the momentum of the car is 	  kg?m = 750 s	s Therefore, ?	h	= 6.62610?34 J ?s = 1.4110?37 m ?x Therefore, the minimum uncertainty is ?x = 1.4110?37 m. Uncertainties this small make it clear why quantum mechanical effects are not seen for macroscopic objects. 
The  Schrdinger  Wave  Equation 	  De Broglie had given a fairly simple way to compute the wavelength and frequency of a matter wave. Computing the amplitude of the wave, however, was not as simple. In 1925, the physicist Erwin Schrdinger (1887-1961) succeeded in deriving what is known today as the Schrdinger Wave Equation. The equation provides a way to calculate the amplitude of an electron wave, and in doing so provides a mechanism that reconciles the particle and wave aspects of all material objects. If, using the Schrdinger equation, a particle (say, an electron) is treated as a wave, the equation allows one to find the amplitude of the wave. If, using the Schrdinger equation, the electron is treated as a particle, the interpretation of the amplitude of the Schrdinger equation is that the square of the amplitude gives the probability for the electron being at a specific location in space. These results are very important.

Introduction 	  The three common types of radioactivity were termed alpha (?) decay, beta (?) decay and gamma (?) decay by Ernest Rutherford. Alpha decay is easily absorbed, stopped by a sheet of paper. It was found to be heavy, with a positive charge. Beta decay is roughly 100 times more penetrating, stopped by a few millimeters of aluminum. It is very light-weight with a negative charge. Gamma decay is most penetrating, requiring four or more centimeters of lead to stop it. It has no electric charge, but always occurs in coordination with other decay. Detailed study of these and other radiation types over a period of twenty years led to a detailed picture of the nucleus. The key came when British physicist James Chadwick (1891-1974) identified a rare type of radiation as particles he named neutrons since they were electrically neutral (i.e. had no charge). This lead to a coherent view of atomic nuclei. All nuclei are made of a set of protons and neutrons. These two particles are collectively called nucleons. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus, expressed symbolically as Z. This uniquely defines the chemical symbol of the element. All hydrogen nuclei have one proton, which means atomic number Z = 1. All carbon nuclei have six protons, which means atomic number Z = 6. The atomic mass number is the total number of all nucleons in the nucleus, expressed symbolically as A. Nuclei of a given element may have different number of neutrons and hence different A. Mass number is an integer that is not the same as the exact mass. The different masses of nuclei of an element are called isotopes of that element, and are referred to by the element name followed by mass, like hydrogen-1 (one proton), hydrogen-2 (one proton and one neutron), or carbon-12 (six protons and six electrons). The nucleus is represented symbolically as AZX, where X is the chemical symbol of the element. For example, a nitrogen nucleus might be 147 N and oxygen-17 (an isotope of oxygen) is 178 O. Mass deficit: The difference in mass of an atomic nucleus and the sum of the masses of the atomic nucleus. Nuclear fission: The splitting of an atom with a large atomic mass into at least two relatively equal parts, with an accompanying release of energy. Nuclear fusion: The process in which the nuclei of lighter elements combine and form heavier elements, with an accompanying release of energy. a. How many neutrons are in the iron nucleus 5626Fe? Answer: The atomic mass number A is equal to the atomic number (number of protons) Z plus the number of neutrons in the nucleus. Therefore, the number of neutrons in the nucleus must be 56?26 = 30 neutrons. b. How many electrons are there in the 5626Fe atom? Answer: Since atoms are neutral, they must have an equal number of protons and electrons. Thus, there are 26 electrons in the atom. Answer: True. Both are nitrogen nuclei. Nitrogen 147 Nis the common form of nitrogen having an equal number of protons and neutrons, and Nitrogen 157 Nis an isotope of nitrogen having one more neutron than proton. 
Binding energy 	  Experimental evidence shows that the total mass of a stable nucleus is smaller than the sum of the masses of its constituent particles. The energy equivalent of this mass difference (?m), or mass deficit, is called the binding energy of the nucleus. Note: Most books give the mass of the atom which includes the mass of the electrons. This is of no concern as long as the mass of the electrons cancel out during the calculation. An example will help clarify this idea: Consider an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium . It is composed of one proton and one neutron and one electron. The mass of the deuterium atom is mD = 2.014102 u The mass of one neutron: 1.008665 u. The mass of one hydrogen atom (one proton and one electron): 1.007825 u. The total mass of the neutron and hydrogen atom: mtotal = 1.008665 u+1.007825 u = 2.01649 u Therefore, the mass deficit is: mtotal ?mD = ?m = 201649 u?2.014102 u = 0.002388 u. It can be experimentally verified that the excess mass (the mass deficit) is given off as energy when nucleons form a deuterium nucleus. We can compute the energy using the Einstein equation: E = ?mc2 ? First, we convert ?m into kilograms and then compute the energy. Lastly, we express the answer in millions of electron volts (MeV). ?m = (0.002388 u)1.660510?27 kg = 3.96527410?30 kg ? 
E = 3.96527410	kg	= 3.56161310?13  	  s We have used c = 2.997108 ms instead of c = 3.00108 ms for the speed of light in the above calculation. Recall: 1.610?19 J = 1 eV ? (1.610?19 J)(106) = (1 eV)(106) ? 1.610?13 J = 1 MeV 
E = 3.1561613.6010?1013 ? Me V13 J  J = 2.226 ? 2.23  Me 	  The result is the binding energy for deuterium. This is the amount of energy that is needed to separate the nucleons from each other. It is typical to express the total binding energy in terms of the average binding energy per nucleon. Since deuterium is composed of two nucleons, we have: 
Average binding energy per nucleon (see also  Figure   Me 	  There are 92 naturally occurring elements, and as stated before, the most stable atoms are those that have the same number of protons as neutrons. These atoms then have the greatest binding energies per nucleon, as shown in Figure Average binding energy per nucleon (MeV) vs. atomic mass number, A. Notice that the binding energy of the nucleus of an atom is much greater than the binding energy of the electrons held by the nucleus. Earlier, we saw that the energy needed to ionize a hydrogen atomthat is, to separate the ground-state electron was only 13.6 eV. 
The strong nuclear force and radioactivity 	  Physicists realized that another force must exist if protons could be in such close proximity within a nucleus and not fly apart due to electrostatic repulsion. Indeed, this force must be considerably stronger than the electrostatic force, or stable nuclei could not exist. We recognize this force today as one of the four fundamental forces in nature: the strong nuclear force. Many details about the nuclear strong force are not known yet, but we do know that it is a very short-range attractive force. It does not exist outside the nucleus. Within a nucleus, protons attract other protons, neutrons attract other neutrons, and they attract one another. As we say, the strong nuclear force is chargeindependent. The strong nuclear force is some hundred times greater than the electrostatic force, but only if the nucleons are no farther apart than about 10?15 m. For the nuclei of the elements that follow iron in the periodic table, neutrons outnumber protons. Generallythe heavier the nucleus, the greater the proportion of neutrons. Uranium, the largest naturally occurring atom, due to its many isotopes has about 5055 more neutrons than protons. Remember that the repulsive electrostatic force between the protons is countered by the attractive strong nuclear force between nucleons. But the strong force is very short-ranged, so its effect hardly extends beyond two adjacent nucleons. The electrostatic force, however, extends throughout the entire atom (in principle, out to infinity). Therefore, there is a limit to the number of protons that can exist within a nucleus before the stability of the nucleus is compromised. The more nucleons there are, the larger the nucleus becomes. As this happens, the short-range strong nuclear force weakens (very abruptly) and the repulsive electrostatic force dominates. Neutrons, however, are not subject to electrostatic repulsion but are subject to the strong force attraction. Thus, they help to keep the nucleus together without adding to the electrostatic repulsion. Still, almost all nuclei with more than 82 protons are unstable (exhibit radioactivity). We will soon see that unstable nuclei can be transformed into entirely different ones through a process called transmutation. Uranium, for example, can turn into lead through a sequence of multiple transmutations. The transmutation process occurs when a particle is captured by the nucleus and through different nuclear decay or disintegration processes. Nuclei which spontaneously decay are unstable and are called radioactive. The original nucleus of the radioactive atom is called the parent and the nuclei formed by the decay are called the daughters. Radioactivity was first discovered in 1896 by the French physicist Henri Becquerel (1852-1908). Becquerel was conducting research on phosphorescent substances (substances that remained luminous after exposure to light) when he discovered that rocks containing uranium darkened a photographic plate in the absence of light. He surmised that perhaps yet another new form of radiation (x-rays had been discovered the previous year) must be the reason. The new radiation occurred spontaneously, unlike x-rays which were produced when high-energy electrons impacted glass or metal. Shortly after Becquerels discovery, Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) discovered two new highly radioactive elements: polonium and radium. In contrast to a stable nucleus, the nucleus of a radioactive atom has a greater mass than the sum of the masses of its fission products. A greater mass in the nucleus means a smaller amount of binding energy available to hold the nucleus together (see Figure 25.2). The extra mass in the nucleus is converted into the kinetic energy of the daughters or into electromagnetic energy. 
Three types of radioactive decay 	  There are three spontaneous decay processes: alpha (?) decay, beta (?) decay, and gamma (?) decay. Two of the processes, ? decay and ? decay, result in transmutations. Some transmutations require only one step to produce a stable atom. Other transmutations involve multiple decay processes of different kinds, until a stable nucleus is eventually formed. We begin our discussion with ? decay. 
Alpha decay 	  Alpha decay, as the name implies, occurs when an ? particle (a helium nucleus 42He) is ejected from the nucleus of a parent atom. 
Illustrative  Example 26.1.1 	  a. What is the energy of the ? particle produced in the decay process: He? We will ignore the kinetic energy of the recoil of the daughter (lead) atom since it is very small compared to the kinetic energy of the alpha particle. (Conservation of momentum shows that the ? particles velocity is more than 51 times greater than the lead nuclei.) Useful information: mPo = 209.982848 u mPb = 205.974440 u m?=He = 4.002602 u Solution: We use a strategy similar to the one used in computing the binding energy. First, we find the difference between the mass of the polonium atom and sum of the masses of the lead atom and the alpha particle. ?m = mpo ?mpb ?m? = 209.982848 u?205.974440 u?4.002602 u = 0.005806 u ?

Beta decay 	  Beta decay occurs when a neutron within the nucleus changes into a proton by emitting an electron. This is not so remarkable since a neutron, removed from a nucleus, has a mean life-time of about 15 minutes. Free neutrons decay into a proton, an electron, and a subatomic particle called an antineutrino (ve). Neutrino (or antineutrino) means small neutral one, in Italian. It is an elementary particle with a mass much smaller than that of the electron. Neutrinos hardly interact with matter. In fact, as you sit and read this, trillions of neutrinos are passing through you without interacting with the atoms that make your body. Note: The electron emitted during beta decay is not an orbital electron but an electron emitted from the nucleus of the atom. We often call these electrons, beta (?) particles. An example of beta decay is the transformation of sodium	 into magnesium	. 
Mg+?+ve 	  Notice that the mass number (A) during the transmutation process has not changed. It remains 24. What has changed is the atomic number Z, since there is now one more proton in the nucleus. Learn more about beta decay by following the link below. URL 
Gamma  Decay 	  We discussed earlier that the electrons of an atom occupy different stationary states or energy levels. It turns out that the nucleons within an atomic nucleus also occupy different energy levels. However, nuclear energy states are separated by much larger energy gaps. When a nucleon falls to a lower energy level in the nucleus, a high-energy electromagnetic pulse, called a gamma ray (?) is emitted, just like a photon is emitted when an electron falls to a lower energy level in the atom. It is good to keep in mind that the only difference between a photon and a gamma ray is that the photons ejected or absorbed by an electron in an atom have much lower energy than gamma rays. Gamma rays have energies millions of times more than visible light photons. Note that ejection of a gamma ray from a nucleus does not alter either the atomic mass or atomic number of the atom. Here is an example of gamma decay involving an excited cobalt 60 nucleus . The asterisk signifies the nucleus in an excited state. To recap: Alpha radiation, as it is sometimes called, usually cannot penetrate even a thin sheet of paper. Beta radiation can pass through a thin piece of wood or a few millimeters of aluminum, and gamma radiation would go a few centimeters of lead as shown in Figure 25.3. Penetrating abilities of alpha particles, beta particles and gamma radiation. Generally, being exposed to alpha radiation is not harmful unless the radiation is produced by a source inside the body. This may occur, for example, if the radioactive element radon (a gas) is inhaled. Then the effects of alpha radiation can be very serious. Radon is a known carcinogen. Here is a story of the Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, who won asylum in Great Britain, only to have died in 2006 under mysterious circumstances, related to radiation poisoning induced by alpha-decay of polonium-210, found in his body. Follow the link below to learn more. URL An alpha particle possessing the same amount of energy as a beta particle or gamma ray can cause ten to twenty times the damage to human cellular structure. The more massive, positively charged, alpha particle can cause numerous ionizations (remove electrons from atoms). The electronic configuration of an atom (the number of and energy levels of electrons) is responsible for all chemical interactions. Thus, a single alpha particle can cause the ionization of many atoms and alter the chemical properties of atoms within cells. The greatest danger occurs when damaged cells remain alive and continue to reproduce. Such altered, or mutated cells, do not perform their intended functions and are generically called cancerous cells. The effects of beta and gamma radiation on human health are also of serious concern since all types of radiation have ionizing effects. This is why, for example, anytime an x-ray (yet another form of radiation dangerous to human health) is taken for medical purposes, the patient is covered with a lead-lined apron. Lead is very dense and difficult for the radiation to penetrate. The ionizing effect of gamma and x-ray radiation is thus significantly reduced by passing through several millimeters of lead. In addition to the ill effects of radiation, there are also some benefits. Ironically, the very cancers that may be triggered by radiation can be fought by applying a narrowly directed radioactive beam to a cancerous area. Radioactive sources may even be inserted directly into the cancerous cells. Radiation is also used to kill bacteria on food in the process known as food irradiation, thus increasing the shelf life of perishable items. For more information on food irradiation follow the link below. URL As a result of the study of radioactivity, physicists discovered a new conservation law. The law of conservation of nucleon number: The total number of nucleons (A) in any reaction remains constant.When a nucleon falls to a lower energy level in the nucleus, a high-energy electromagnetic pulse, called a gamma ray (?) is emitted A = constant. 
Objectives 	  The student will: Understand how radioactive half-life is defined. Solve problems involving radioactive half-life. Understand radioactive dating. Solve problems involving radioactive dating. carbon dating: A technique used to measure the time that the remains of an animal or plant has been dead. By measuring how quickly the carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14, we can measure how long the bones have been dead. half-life: Over the period of time of one half-life, each nucleus has a 50% chance of decaying. Every isotope has a distinct half-life. No matter what the time duration for the half-life is, after that time interval passes, one-half of the original sample remains. 
Carbon  Dating 	  Radioactive decay occurs spontaneously, meaning that at any given moment, some number of atoms of the original sample (we dont know which particular atoms) are changing into a different substance. It does not happen on a fixed schedule, but instead happens randomly, with each atom having a chance to decay after a given time. This can be used to measure the time that the remains of an animal or plant has been dead, using a technique known as carbon dating. The key to carbon dating is carbon dioxide in the air contains trace amounts of a radioactive isotope of carbon produced in the upper atmosphere by cosmic radiation, carbon-14. It is produced in the nuclear reaction as follows: n p As long as plants are alive, they bring in carbon-14 from the air via photosynthesis. As long as animals are alive, they eat plants or other animals containing these trace amounts of carbon-14. Once they are dead, they are cut off from the carbon-14 in the upper atmosphere. The remaining amount in their bones slowly goes down from decay from beta radiation: . If we have a measure for how quickly the carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14, this can be used to measure how long the bones have been dead. The question is, what is that function? 
Half-life 	  Each radioactive nucleus decays independently and randomly. Each isotope also has a distinct half-life that defines how quickly it decays. The half-life of a nucleus is defined as follows: Over the period of time of one half-life, each nucleus has a 50% chance of decaying. Radioactive isotopes have different half-lives. For example, polonium-210, mentioned above, has a half-life of about 138 days. Uranium-238 has a half-life of over four billion years. Some radioactive isotopes have half-lives of thousandths of seconds, and even smaller. The meaning of half-life is the same, however. No matter what the time duration for the half-life is, after that time interval passes, one-half of the original sample remains. Let us use the symbol To for the half-life of any radioactive isotope and No for initial mass N for the remaining mass of the radioactive isotope. We can then construct the following table. TABLE 25.1: Time (t) in units of half-lives To	Sample amount (N) Note that based on the defintion of a half-life, the table describes an exponential function. A graph corresponding to the table is provided below, Figure 25.5. It is assumed that when t = 0,No = 10 grams. Note that the time is expressed in units of half-life, n. The decay of a radioactive material in units of half-lives. 
Decay of  Carbon-14 	  This function tells us how to measure the time taken by the decay of carbon-14. At the onset of death, the carbon14 in the body begins to decrease. While a living thing is alive, it has a fixed ratio of carbon-14 to the ordinary carbon-12 of roughly one part per trillion. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. Thus, after 5,730 years, only about half of the carbon-14 will remain (one part per two trillion). After 11,460 years, the ratio will be one part per four trillion. Radioactive dating (or just carbon dating) is not perfect because the processes which form radioactive carbon and mix it with nonradioactive carbon are very dynamic. Yet, statistically it yields fairly accurate results. The accuracy of carbon dating has been verified by using items of known age. For example, the age assigned to papyrus found in Egyptian pyramids using carbon dating agrees quite well with the age that historians had determined from the historical records. Using carbon dating, the iconic paintings in Lascaux cave in southwestern France have been determined to be around 15,500  900 years old. Carbon dating techniques have been instrumental in determining the approximate ages of prehistoric settlements by an examination of the charcoal found at campsites. 
Illustrative  Example 	  A sample of 128 grams of a radioactive isotope with half-life of 8 years decays for 48 years. How much of the original isotope remains? Solution: The time period for the decay, 48 years, is equivalent to 6 half-lives (or six doublings) Using Equation A, n

Nuclear fission 	  Earlier, we saw that high-energy neutrons were able to change nitrogen into radiocarbon. Physicists have known since 1919 that other natural processes also caused the transmutation of elements. (Note: Transmutation occurs in both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion reactions.) In 1919, Ernest Rutherford observed that, as high-energy alpha particles passed through nitrogen gas, oxygen atoms and free protons (p) were emitted. He reasoned that the nitrogen nuclei had taken on one additional proton and two additional neutrons, and thus turned into oxygen-17. The transformation can be written as: p Rutherfords experiment was the first instance of what is called the artificial transmutation of elements. During the 1930s, the famous Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901-1954), began experimenting in that field. He realized that slow-moving neutrons would be the best particles to use in inducing nuclear reactions, because they are not repelled by the nucleus. In fact, if they got close enough to the nucleus, they would be attracted by the strong nuclear force and captured by nuclei. Fermis idea proved correct. Bombarding the heaviest known naturally occurring element, uranium, Z = 92 with neutrons, he was able to produce the first transuranic (beyond uranium) elements that are not found anywhere on Earth. Examples include Neptunium (Ne, Z = 93) and Americium (Am, Z = 95). Two German scientists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, built on Fermis work in the late 1930s. They noticed that at times, when uranium was exposed to slow neutrons, two smaller nuclei, roughly half the size of the uranium atom, emerged from the reaction. How could this be? Up until that time, only small particles such as alpha particles were seen to be ejected in such reactions. A former Jewish colleague of Hahns, Lise Meitner (1878-1968) and her nephew and colleague, Otto Frisch (19041979) had left Nazi Germany fearing the anti-Semitism of Hitlers Germany, and were working in Sweden at the time. When Hahn reported the peculiar results of the experiment to Meitner (who shared them with Frisch), they quickly realized what had occurred. The captured neutron increased the internal energy of the nucleus of the uranium atom, Figure 25.6. The additional energy caused an increase in the motion of the nucleons in the atom. That, in turn, caused the nucleus to expand. As the nucleus expanded, the strong nuclear force weakened, permitting the electrostatic repulsion to split the uranium atom into nearly two equal parts, N1 and N2. Hahn and Strassmann had spilt the atom. The splitting of an atom with a large atomic mass into at least two relatively equal parts, with an accompanying release of energy, is called nuclear fission. It can be explained by likening the nucleus to a liquid drop, as shown in Figure 25.6. The liquid-drop model of atomic fission. (A) A neutron is about to be captured by a nucleus. (B) After capture, the atomic mass is increased by 1 and it is in an excited state. Thermal energy causes the nucleus to expand. (C) Expansion leads to the fission process of splitting. (D) The nucleus splits into two almost equal parts along with the ejection of three neutrons. In addition to the daughter nuclei, three neutrons are also released in the process, as shown in Figure 25.6. Physicists can detect the tracks of subatomic particles on photographic plates, as well as observe them by a trail of tiny droplets of water they produce when passing through a container filled with water vaporor alcohol (such containers are known as cloud chambers.) For more information on the tools physicists use to detect subatomic particles, follow the links below. 
Bubble chambers:	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc Uw H8 L5 	  It wasnt long before physicists realized the consequence of the liberation of additional neutrons within a reaction, which depended upon neutrons in the first place! It was clear that the release of just a few neutrons could induce an immense number of uranium nuclei to split in a very short period of time at the ever-increasing rate. The reaction would be self-sustaining, also known as the chain reaction. A more detailed explanation of the process is as follows: Slow neutrons cause uranium-235	 to split into two nearly equal parts. In the process, several neutrons are liberated from the parent nucleus, in addition to about 200 MeV of energy. The emitted neutrons, in turn, cause more uranium nuclei to split apart and more energy to be released. The continual emission of neutrons creates an exponential increase of nuclear fission events known as a chain reaction. Using that principle, Fermi built the first nuclear reactor at the University of Chicago in December, 1942. It was also understood that a nuclear chain reaction could be used to build an atomic bomb. During World War II, the Nazis were working on such a bomb, and so was the United States. Fortunately for us, the United States succeeded and the Nazis did not. In fact, Nazi Germany was defeated before the United States developed the atomic bomb. About seven weeks after the surrender of Nazi Germany, the first atomic bomb was tested (detonated) in a remote section of New Mexico on July 16, 1945. With the war in the Pacific still going on, President Harry S. Truman made the decision to use the atomic bomb. In August 1945, atomic bombs were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to the quick capitulation of Japan and ending World War II. For nearly two decades after World War II, atomic tests (denotations) were conducted above ground. These explosions, despite all the precautions, produced enormous, long-lasting environmental effects. The radiation produced from atomic explosions (called atomic fallout) does not simply go away. The half-life of many radioactive particles produced in those tests is measured in decades, hundreds, and even thousands of years. As we stated earlier, nuclear radiation can have devastating effects, such as triggering cancer, on human beings. Those who witnessed the effects of atomic radiation in Japan knew well the consequences of waging atomic war. The ill effects of exposure to atomic radiation are not confined to only those who experience it. They can be passed on to future generations in the form of genetic mutations. Soil, air, and water can all be irrevocably poisoned by atomic fallout. We now use atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Nuclear reactors produce heat that is used to generate steam to run turbines (generators). The dangerous byproducts of nuclear reactions, however, are still with us. It remains a challenge to find safe and secure ways of dealing with nuclear materials. Learn more about nuclear fission by clicking the links below. URL URL 
Nuclear fusion 	  The process in which the nuclei of lighter elements combine and form heavier elements, with an accompanying release of energy, is called nuclear fusion. Fusion does not occur naturally on Earth, since it requires tremendous amounts of energy to bring protons close enough for the strong force to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them. We have managed to create uncontrolled fusion events on Earth in the form of thermonuclear bombs (an atomic bomb triggers a thermonuclear, or fusion bomb). Controlled fusion events have been achieved experimentally for only a tiny fraction of a second, and for very small samples of materials. Fusion does occur naturally within the stars. Within the core of a star, sufficient energy exists to force the protons close enough together within the range of the nuclear strong force. Through a series of nuclear reactions, helium nuclei are eventually formed, releasing about 27 MeV per transmutation. Though this amount is considerably less than the energy released during the fission of a single Uranium-235 nuclei (200 MeV), the sun has vast amounts of hydrogen. Fusing hydrogen into helium releases about 4  1026 J every second within the sun. This is about 1 million times more energy than the energy currently used by the entire human race in a year! All nuclei beyond beryllium are made in the cores of stars. Stars as massive as the sun can create nuclei of oxygen (Z = 8) but no greater. Stars with masses greater than eight times that of the sun can create nuclei up through iron and nickel. Some very massive red giant stars can produce nuclei up though lead. Most of the nuclei beyond iron, however, are produced during supernovae explosions, where the temperature inside the core of such massive stars reaches in excess of a billion kelvins (the core temperature of the sun is merely 30 million kelvins). A supernova explosion occurs when the process of fusion inside a stars core is overcome by the gravitational force seeking to compress the star. As the star collapses, due to the inward force of gravity (known as gravitational collapse), enough energy is available to fuse nuclei beyond iron. Stellar compression continues until a blast wave is initiated and the star explodes, exuding those nuclei heavier than iron. Only a star with a mass several times greater than the sun has can become a supernova. With the exception of hydrogen, all of the elements in the periodic table, Figure 25.7, are created through fusion. 
Cosmic  Rays 	  Radioactive decay of nuclei is usually in only one of a few modes: ?, ?, and ?. However, at higher energies there is a much wider range of nuclear reactions. This is most commonly visible in cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles that hit the Earths atmosphere, coming from sources far outside the solar system like distant supernovae.

The weak nuclear force 	  It would not be proper to end this chapter without at least a passing reference to the weak nuclear force and the ultimate goal of theoretical physics. Physicists believe today that every particle has an associated antiparticle. For example, the antiparticle of the electron is called the positron. It is identical to an electron in every way except for the fact that its charge is positive. When they combine, they annihilate each other A neutral particle like the neutron also has an antiparticle and a neutron and its antiparticle also annihilate each other when they combine. The realization that all particles have antiparticles is instrumental in developing a complete theory of subatomic particles, which is why we mention it here. We stated earlier that a free neutron (one not confined to the nucleus of an atom) decays into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. The net charge remains zero, the antineutrino having no charge. An antineutron decays into an antiproton (negative charge), a positron, and a neutrino (again, the net charge is zero.) How, you may wonder, can a neutron be considered a fundamental particle if it can decompose into other particles? Indeed, this is not the case. Physicists no longer accept that nucleons are fundamental particles. The electron is still believed to be a fundamental particle, though. If there are particles more fundamental than nucleons, then the nucleons must be composed of yet smaller particles. Physicists recognize these particles as having fractional charge and call them quarks. It is the weak nuclear force which allows quarks to transform a proton into a neutron (and vice versa). It is also known that the weak nuclear force creates neutrinos and facilitates certain types of radioactive decay and plays an important role in solar fusion. Physicists realized that a strong force (or interaction) would be necessary to hold the quarks together and produced a theoretical framework for this called quantum chromodynamics. In the 1960s, it was shown that the nuclear weak force and electromagnetism were aspects of the same force, now called the electroweak force. By the 1970s physicists had worked out a model of particle physics called the Standard Model. The model combined everything that was known about the myriad of subatomic particles of the time. It did not incorporate gravity (general relativity) but did combine the electroweak force and quantum chromodynamics. Einsteins dream was to find a single force from which the four fundamental forces of nature would arise. The goal today is to extend the standard model into a grand unified theory (affectionately known as GUT) by incorporating into it the strong nuclear force and gravity. String theory, the notion that all forces and particles can be attributed to fundamental structures called strings, was thought to be able to provide such a theory. However, after 20 years of work with very little progress, more and more physicists are beginning to suspect that string theory may not hold the promise it once did. In the summer of 2012, a very important discovery was made concerning a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson particle. The standard model has predicted the existence of a particle which conveys mass to particles. It is called the Higgs boson and physicists believe they have confirmation of its existence due to the high energy experiments conducted with the CERN (Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire) particle accelerator located near Geneva, Switzerland.

Physics  Glossary 	  accuracy Determined by a comparing a measured quantity to an accepted value (if the accepted value exists, of course). average speed Distance divided by time whether speed is constant or not. average velocity The change in position divided by the change in time whether velocity is constant or not. dimensional analysis In physics and all science, dimensional analysis is a tool to find or check relations among physical quantities by using their dimensions. The dimension of a physical quantity is the combination of the basic physical dimensions (usually length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity) which describe it; for example, speed has the dimension length per time, and may be measured in meters per second, miles per hour, or other units. Dimensional analysis is based on the fact that a physical law must be independent of the units used to measure the physical variables. A straightforward practical consequence is that any meaningful equation (and any inequality and inequation) must have the same dimensions in the left and right sides. Checking this is the basic way of performing dimensional analysis. displacement The change in position, a vector quantity. distance The separation between two points, a scalar quantity. hypothesis A tentative explanation for an observation, phenomenon, or scientific problem that can be tested by further investigation. law A concise mathematical relationship that always occurs under specific conditions. A law is NOT an explanation. length The measurement of the extent of something along its greatest dimension. mass A property of matter equal to the measure of an objects resistance to changes in either the speed or direction of its motion. The mass of an object is not dependent on gravity and therefore is different from but proportional to its weight. meter stick A ruler one meter long (about 39.37 inches in length). position The separation between an object and a reference point. powers of 10 notation , etc. precision The number of significant digits to which a value has been reliably measured. The ability of a measurement to be consistently reproduced. random error An inconsistent error usually associated with the precision of a measuring tool, often detected by multiple readings. scalar A quantity, such as mass, length, or speed, that is completely specified by its magnitude or size and has no direction. scientific method A systematic approach used to investigate the natural world. significant digits Those digits in a measurement that carry reliable measurement information.
