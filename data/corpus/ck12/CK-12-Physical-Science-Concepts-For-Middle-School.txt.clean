Introduction 	  Are you curious about other planets? Did you ever wish you could explore them like the Mars rover in this picture? If so, then you’re thinking like a scientist. Scientists are curious about things in nature, and they do investigations to better understand them. They often use technology—from microscopes to Mars rovers—to extend their own senses so they can learn even more. In this unit, you’ll read about how scientists think and how they investigate and explore the natural world. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define science. • Explain the goal of science. • Describe how science advances knowledge. • Design a scientific experiment. Does the word science make you think of high-tech labs and researchers in white coats like the ones in this picture? This is often an accurate image of science but not always. If you look up science in a dictionary, you would find that it comes from a Latin word that means “having knowledge.” However, this isn’t an adequate definition either. What Is Science? Science is more about gaining knowledge than it is about simply having knowledge. Science is a way of learning about the natural world that is based on evidence and logic. In other words, science is a process, not just a body of facts. Through the process of science, our knowledge of the world advances. 
The  Goal of  Science 	  Scientists may focus on very different aspects of the natural world. For example, some scientists focus on the world of tiny objects, such as atoms and molecules. Other scientists devote their attention to huge objects, such as the sun and other stars. But all scientists have at least one thing in common. They want to understand how and why things happen. Achieving this understanding is the goal of science. Have you ever experienced the thrill of an exciting fireworks show like the one pictured in the Figure 1.1? Fireworks show how the goal of science leads to discovery. Fireworks were invented at least 2000 years ago in China, but explaining how and why they work didn’t happen until much later. 
It wasn’t until scientists had learned about 	  elements and chemical reactions that they could explain what caused fireworks to create brilliant bursts of light and deep rumbling booms. 
Fireworks were invented long before scientists could actually explain how 	  and why they explode. 
How  Science  Advances 	  Sometimes learning about science is frustrating because scientific knowledge is always changing. But that’s also what makes science exciting. Occasionally, science moves forward in giant steps. More commonly, however, science advances in baby steps. Giant steps in science may occur if a scientist introduces a major new idea. For example, in 1666, Isaac Newton introduced the idea that gravity is universal. People had long known that things fall to the ground because they are attracted by Earth. But Newton proposed that everything in the universe exerts a force of attraction on everything else. This idea is known as Newton’s law of universal gravitation. Q: How do you think Newton’s law of universal gravitation might have influenced the advancement of science? A: Newton’s law allowed scientists to understand many different phenomena. It explains not only why things always fall down toward the ground or roll downhill. It also explains the motion of many other objects. For example, it explains why planets orbit the sun. The idea of universal gravity even helped scientists discover the planets Neptune and Pluto. The caption and diagram in the Figure 1.2 explain how. Baby steps in science occur as small bits of evidence gradually accumulate. The accumulating evidence lets scientists refine and expand on earlier ideas. For example, the scientific idea of the atom was introduced in the early 1800s. But scientists came to understand the structure of the atom only as evidence accumulated over the next two centuries. Their understanding of atomic structure continues to expand today. The advancement of science is sometimes a very bumpy road. New knowledge and ideas aren’t always accepted at first, and scientists may be mocked for their ideas. The idea that Earth’s continents drift on the planet’s surface is a good example. This idea was first proposed by a scientist named Alfred Wegener in the early 1900s. Wegener also proposed that all of the present continents had once formed one supercontinent, which he named Pangaea (see wasn’t until the 1950s that enough evidence had accumulated for scientists to realize that Wegener had been right. Unfortunately, Wegener did not live long enough to see his ideas accepted. Q: What types of evidence might support Wegener’s ideas? A: Several types of evidence support Wegener’s ideas. For example, similar fossils and rock formations have been found on continents that are now separated by oceans. It is also now known that Earth’s crust consists of rigid plates that slide over molten rock below them. This explains how continents can drift. Even the shapes of today’s continents show how they once fit together, like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle. 
Summary 	  • Science is a way of learning about the natural world that is based on evidence and logic. 
In the early 1800s, astronomers noticed 	  a wobble in Uranus’ orbit around the sun. the wobble was caused by the pull of gravity of another, not-yet-discovered planet. Scientists searched the skies for the “missing” planet. When they discovered Neptune in missing planet. After the astronomers took into account the effects of Neptune’s gravity, they saw that Uranus still had an unexplained wobble. They predicted that there must be another planet beyond Neptune. That planet, now called 
Pluto, was finally discovered in 1930.  Of 	  special note, as of 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) demoted 
Pluto from its planet status as it does 	  not meet one of the criteria for planetary standards. For more information see: URL This map shows the supercontinent Pangaea, which was first proposed by Alfred Wegener. Pangaea included all of the separate continents we know today. 
Scientists now know that the individual 	  continents drifted apart to their present locations over millions of years. • The goal of science is to understand how and why things happen. • Science advances as new evidence accumulates and allows scientists to replace, refine, or expand on accepted ideas about the natural world.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define inductive reasoning. • Describe how inductive reasoning is used in science. • Explain why inductive reasoning cannot prove conclusively that an idea is true. The man in this photo is a police detective. He’s examining and gathering clues that may help solve a crime. Based on all of the clues he finds, he may be able to conclude who committed the crime. Doing science is similar to solving crimes. It also involves gathering evidence and drawing conclusions. Both solving crimes and doing science use inductive reasoning. What Is Inductive Reasoning? Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions based on many clues, or pieces of evidence. Many crimes are solved using inductive reasoning. It is also the hallmark of science and the basis of the scientific method. Q: How might the police detective pictured above use inductive reasoning to solve the crime? A: The detective might gather clues that provide evidence about the identity of the person who committed the crime. For example, he might find fingerprints or other evidence left behind by the perpetrator. The detective might eventually find enough clues to be able to conclude the identity of the most likely suspect. 
Inductive  Reasoning in  Science 	  A simple example will help you understand how inductive reasoning works in science. Suppose you grew up on a planet named Quim, where there is no gravity. In fact, assume you’ve never even heard of gravity. You travel to Earth (on a student exchange program) and immediately notice things are very different here than on your home planet. For one thing, when you step out of your spacecraft, you fall directly to the ground. Then, when you let go of your communications device, it falls to the ground as well. On Quim, nothing ever falls to the ground. For example, if you had let go of your communications device back home, it would have just stayed in place by your upper appendage. You notice that everything you let go of falls to the ground. Using inductive reasoning, you conclude that all objects fall to the ground on Earth. Then, you make the observation pictured ( Figure 1.5). You see round objects rising up into the sky, rather than falling toward the ground as you expect. Clearly, your first conclusion—although based on many pieces of evidence—is incorrect. You need to gather more evidence to come to a conclusion that explains all of your observations. Evidence that not everything falls to the ground on Earth. Q: What conclusion might you draw based on the additional evidence of the balloons rising instead of falling? A: With this and other evidence, you might conclude that objects heavier than air fall to the ground but objects lighter than air do not. 
Limits on  Inductive  Reasoning 	  Inductive reasoning can’t solve a crime or arrive at the correct scientific conclusion with 100 percent certainty. It’s always possible that some piece of evidence remains to be found that would disprove the conclusion. That’s why jurors in a trial are told to decide whether the defendant is guilty “without a reasonable doubt”—not without a shred of doubt. Similarly, a scientific theory is never really proven conclusively to be true. However, it can be supported 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  by so much evidence that it is accepted “without a reasonable doubt.” 
Summary 	  • Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions based on many pieces of evidence. This type of reasoning is the basis of the scientific method. • In science, inductive reasoning is used to draw general conclusions from evidence. The conclusions are changed if necessary to explain new evidence as it becomes available. • Inductive reasoning cannot prove conclusively that an idea is true, but it may lead to conclusions that are very likely to be true. Deductive reasoning is another type of reasoning. You can think of deductive reasoning as inductive reasoning in reverse. With deductive reasoning, you draw specific conclusions based on general statements that are assumed to be true. At the URL below, read the short article comparing inductive and deductive reasoning. Then put your knowledge into practice by doing the exercises that follow the article. URL would eat brand B food only when brand A was not available. Can she correctly conclude that all rats prefer brand A rat food over brand B food? Why or why not? • Define scientific theory. • Compare "theory" to "scientific theory." • Describe important theories of physical science. • Relate the law of parsimony to scientific theories. This photo shows a girl and her parents. They are having a discussion. As you can see, the girl is rolling her eyes. What do you think her parents may have said that caused this reaction? Could it be they have just grounded her for some reason? That’s certainly one possibility, but without any other information to go on, it’s “just a theory.” In other words, it’s just a hunch or a guess. Theories are very important in science, but in science a theory is never a hunch or a guess. It is much more than that. 
Not “ Just a  Theory” 	  The term theory is used differently in science than it is used in everyday language. A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence. Because it is so well supported, a scientific theory has a very good chance of being a correct explanation for events in nature. Because it is a broad explanation, it can explain many observations and pieces of evidence. In other words, it can help connect and make sense of many phenomena in the natural world. 
Examples of  Theories in  Physical  Science 	  A number of theories in science were first proposed many decades or even centuries ago, but they have withstood the test of time. An example of a physical science theory that has mainly withstood the test of time is Dalton’s atomic theory. John Dalton was a British chemist who lived in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Around 1800, he published his atomic theory, which is one of the most important theories in science. According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all substances consist of tiny particles called atoms. Furthermore, all the atoms of a given element are identical, whereas the atoms of different elements are always different. These parts of Dalton’s atomic theory are still accepted today, although some other details of his theory have since been disproven. Dalton based his theory on many pieces of evidence. For example, he studied many substances called compounds. These are substances that consist of two or more different elements. Dalton determined that a given compound always consists of the same elements in exactly the same proportions, no matter how small the sample of the compound. This idea is illustrated for the compound water in the Figure 1.6. Dalton concluded from this evidence that elements must be made up of tiny particles in order to always combine in the same specific proportions in any given compound. 
Water is a compound that consists of 	  the elements hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O). Like other compounds, the smallest particles of water are called molecules. 
Each molecule of water ( H2 O) contains 	  two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Q: Dalton thought that atoms are the smallest particles of matter. Scientists now know that atoms are composed of even smaller particles. Does this mean that the rest of Dalton’s atomic theory should be thrown out? A: The discovery of particles smaller than atoms doesn’t mean that we should scrap the entire theory. Atoms are still known to be the smallest particles of elements that have the properties of the elements. Also, it is atoms—not particles of atoms—that combine in fixed proportions in compounds. Instead of throwing out Dalton’s theory, scientists have refined and expanded on it. There are many other important physical science theories. Here are three more examples: • Einstein’s theory of gravity • Kinetic theory of matter • Wave-particle theory of light 
Keep  It  Simple 	  The formation of scientific theories is generally guided by the law of parsimony. The word parsimony means “thriftiness.” The law of parsimony states that, when choosing between competing theories, you should select the theory that makes the fewest assumptions. In other words, the simpler theory is more likely to be correct. For example, you probably know that Earth and the other planets of our solar system orbit around the sun. But several centuries ago, it was believed that Earth is at the center of the solar system and the other planets orbit around Earth. While it is possible to explain the movement of planets according to this theory, the explanation is unnecessarily complex. Q: Why do you think parsimony is an important characteristic of scientific theories? A: The more assumptions that must be made to form a scientific theory, the more chances there are for the theory to be incorrect. If one assumption is wrong, so is the theory. Conversely, the theory that makes the fewest assumptions, assuming it is well supported by evidence, is most likely to be correct. 
Summary 	  • A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence. • Examples of theories in physical science include Dalton’s atomic theory, Einstein’s theory of gravity, and the kinetic theory of matter. • The formation of scientific theories is generally guided by the law of parsimony. According to this law, the simplest of competing theories is most likely to be correct. Watch the first presentation by Dr. Eugenie Scott at this URL and then answer the questions below.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define scientific law. • Compare scientific laws to scientific theories. • Discuss scientific laws of physical science. • Describe the place of laws in science. Did you ever drive a bumper car like the one pictured here? As you drive around the track, other drivers try to bump into your car and push it out of the way. When another car bumps into yours, both cars may bounce back from the collision. The harder the two cars collide, the farther back they bounce. 
It’s the  Law 	  It may seem like common sense that bumper cars change their motion when they collide. That’s because all objects behave this way it’s the law! A scientific law, called Newton’s third law of motion, states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Thus, when one bumper car acts by ramming another, one or both cars react by pushing apart. Q: What are some other examples of Newton’s third law of motion? What actions are always followed by reactions? A: Other examples of actions and reactions include hitting a ball with a bat and the ball bouncing back; and pushing a swing and the swing moving away. 
Laws in  Science 	  Newton’s third law of motion is just one of many scientific laws. A scientific law is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions. Other examples of laws in physical science include: • Newton’s first law of motion • Newton’s second law of motion • Newton’s law of universal gravitation • Law of conservation of mass • Law of conservation of energy • Law of conservation of momentum 
Laws vs.  Theories 	  Scientific laws state what always happen. This can be very useful. It can let you let you predict what will happen under certain circumstances. For example, Newton’s third law tells you that the harder you hit a softball with a bat, the faster and farther the ball will travel away from the bat. However, scientific laws have a basic limitation. They don’t explain why things happen. “Why” questions are answered by scientific theories, not scientific laws. Q: You know that the sun always sets in the west. This could be expressed as a scientific law. Think of something else that always happens in nature. How could you express it as a scientific law? A: Something else that always happens in nature is water flowing downhill rather than uphill. This could be expressed as the law, “When water flows over a hill, it always flows from a higher to a lower elevation.” 
Summary 	  • A scientific law is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions. Newton’s three laws of motion are examples of laws in physical science. • A scientific law states what always happens but not why it happens. Scientific theories answer “why” questions.

His name is Albert Einstein, and he’s arguably the most important scientist of the time ago, but in terms of the history of science, it’s as though it were only yesterday. 
Evolution of  Science 	  People have probably wondered about the natural world for as long as there have been people. So it’s no surprise that science has roots that go back thousands of years. Some of the earliest contributions to science were made by Greek philosophers more than two thousand years ago. It wasn’t until many centuries later, however, that the scientific method and experimentation were introduced. The dawn of modern science occurred even more recently. It is generally traced back to the scientific revolution, which took place in Europe starting in the 1500s. 
In the  Beginning 	  A Greek philosopher named Thales, who lived around 600 BCE, has been called the “father of science” for his ideas about the natural world. He proposed that natural events such as lightning and earthquakes have natural causes. Up until then, people understood such events to be the acts of gods or other supernatural forces. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  Q: Why was Thales’ idea about natural causes such an important contribution to science? A: Natural causes can be investigated and understood, whereas gods or other supernatural causes are “above nature” and not suitable for investigation. Just a few hundred years after Thales, the Greek philosopher Aristotle made a very important contribution to science. You can see what Aristotle looked like in the Figure 1.7. Prior to Aristotle, other philosophers believed that they could find the truth about the natural world by inward reflection—in other words, just by thinking about it. Aristotle, in contrast, thought that truth about the natural world could come only from observations of nature and inductive reasoning. He argued that knowledge of nature must be based on evidence and logic. This idea is called empiricism, and it is the basis of science today. Aristotle introduced the idea of empiricism around 350 BCE. hallmark of modern science. 
It 	  is a 
Introducing the  Scientific  Method 	  In the first 1000 years CE, Europe went through a period called the Dark Ages. Science and learning in general were all but abandoned. However, in other parts of the world science flourished. During this period, some of the most important contributions to science were made by Persian scholars. For example, during the 700s CE, a Persian scientist named Geber introduced the scientific method and experimentation in chemistry. His ideas and methods were later adopted by European chemists. Today, Geber is known as the “father of chemistry.” 
Modern  Western  Science  Emerges 	  Starting in the mid-1500s, a scientific revolution occurred in Europe. This was the beginning of modern Western science. Many scientific advances were made during a period of just a couple of hundred years. The revolution in science began when Copernicus made the first convincing arguments that the sun—not Earth—is the center of what we now call the solar system. (You can see both models of the solar system in the Figure 1.8.) This was a drastic shift in thinking about Earth’s place in the cosmos. Around 1600, the Italian scientist Galileo greatly improved the telescope, which had just been invented, and made many important discoveries in the field of astronomy. Some of Galileo’s observations provided additional evidence for Copernicus’ sun-centered solar system. Q: Copernicus’ ideas about the solar system were so influential that the scientific revolution is sometimes called the “Copernican revolution.” Why do you think Copernicus’ ideas led to a revolution in science? A: Copernicus’ ideas about the solar system are considered to be the starting point of modern astronomy. They changed how all future scientists interpreted observations in astronomy. They also led to a flurry of new scientific investigation. Other contributions to science that occurred during the scientific revolution include: The model on the left shows what people believed about the solar system before Copernicus introduced the model on the right. • Kepler’s laws of planetary motion • Newton’s law of universal gravitation • Newton’s three laws of motion 
Einstein  Rocks  Science 	  Another major shift in science occurred with the work of Albert Einstein (the “rock star” scientist pictured in the opening image). In 1916, Einstein published his general theory of relativity. This theory relates matter and energy. It also explains gravity as a property of space and time (rather than a property of matter as Newton thought). Einstein’s theory has been supported by all evidence and observations to date, whereas Newton’s law of gravity does not apply to all cases. Einstein’s theory is still the accepted explanation for gravity today. Q: How might Einstein’s theory have influenced the course of science? A: Einstein’s theory suggested new areas of investigation. Many predictions based on the theory were later found to be true. For example, black holes in the universe were predicted by Einstein’s theory and later confirmed by scientific evidence. 
Summary 	  • Science has roots that go back thousands of years to Greek philosophers including Thales and Aristotle. • The scientific method was introduced in the 700s by a Persian scientist named Geber. • Modern science began with the scientific revolution in Europe the 1500s and 1600s. The scientific revolution was launched by Copernicus’ new ideas about the solar system.

This woman is playing a flute in what appears to be a cockpit. But why are her feet strapped to the floor? And why is her hair standing on end? The woman in the photo is astronaut Ellen Ochoa, Ph.D., and she’s playing her flute aboard the space shuttle Discovery. The straps prevent her from floating into the air in the zero-gravity ship. The lack of gravity also explains her hairdo. In addition to being an astronaut who has flown several space missions, Dr. Ochoa is a leading research scientist and an inventor with several patents to her credit. 
Biases  Against  Women and  People of  Color 	  Dr. Ochoa is one of just a few dozen female astronauts in the U.S. She is also the first Hispanic woman in the world to go into space. Although females make up more than half of the U.S. population, fewer than 25 percent of U.S. astronauts are women. Women are also under-represented in science, especially physical sciences such as chemistry and physics. What explains this? Throughout history, women—and also people of color of both genders—have rarely had the same chances as white males for education and careers in science. Cultural, social, and economic biases have made it far harder for them than for white males to excel in this area. This explains why there have been fewer scientists among their ranks. 
Contributions of  Women and  People of  Color 	  Despite their relative lack of opportunities, women and people of color have made many important contributions to science. Several have won Nobel prizes for their discoveries. Just a few of their contributions to physical science are presented in Table 1.1. You can learn about more of their contributions at these URLs: • URL • URL • URL TABLE 1.1: Important Contributions to Physical Science by Women and People of Color

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define ethics. • Identify ethical rules in science. • Describe how scientific knowledge might influence everyday ethical decisions. Believe it or not, the tree bark in this photo contains a revolutionary anti-cancer drug. For almost a decade after the drug was discovered, the trees, called Pacific yews, were stripped of their bark so chemists could extract the drug for cancer patients. Stripping the bark harmed the trees. This situation posed an ethical problem. What Is Ethics? Ethics refers to deciding what’s right and what’s wrong. Making ethical decisions involves weighing right and wrong in order to make the best choice. The ethical problem of the Pacific yew has both right and wrong aspects. It’s right to save lives with the cancer drug that comes from the tree bark, but it’s wrong to endanger the tree and risk its extinction. Q: What do you think is the most ethical decision about the Pacific yew? Should the bark be used to make the drug and possibly save human lives? Or should this be prohibited in order to protect the tree from possible extinction? A: This is tough ethical dilemma, and there is no right or wrong answer. Ethical dilemmas such as this often spur scientists to come up with new solutions to problems. That’s what happened in the case of the Pacific yew. Scientists tackled and solved the problem of determining the chemical structure of the anti-cancer drug so it could be synthesized in labs. This is a win-win solution to the problem. The synthetic drug is now available to save lives, and the trees are no longer endangered by being stripped of their bark. 
Ethical  Rules in  Science 	  Ethics is an important consideration in science. Scientific investigations must be guided by what is right and what is wrong. That’s where ethical rules come in. They help ensure that science is done safely and that scientific knowledge is reliable. Here are some of the ethical rules that scientists must follow: • Scientific research must be reported honestly. It is wrong and misleading to make up or change research results. • Scientific researchers must try to see things as they really are. They should avoid being biased by the results they expect or hope to get. • Researchers must be careful. They should do whatever they can to avoid errors in their data. • Researchers must inform coworkers and members of the community about any risks of their research. They should do the research only if they have the consent of these groups. • Researchers studying living animals must treat them humanely. They should provide for their needs and take pains to avoid harming them. • Researchers studying human subjects must tell their subjects that they have the right to refuse to participate in the research. Human subjects also must be fully informed about their role in the research, including any potential risks. You can read about a terrible violation of this ethical rule in the Figure 1.9. From the 1930s to 1970s, medical researchers (including the one pictured here) studied the progression of a serious disease in hundreds of poor men in 
Alabama.  They told the men they were 	  simply receiving free medical care. They never told the men that they had the disease, nor were the men treated for the disease when a cure was discovered in 
Instead, the study continued 	  the 1940s. for another 25 years. 
It came to an end 	  only when a whistleblower made it a frontpage story around the nation. 
Science and  Everyday  Ethical  Decisions 	  Sometimes, science can help people make ethical decisions in their own lives. For example, scientific evidence shows that certain human actions—such as driving cars that burn gasoline—are contributing to changes in Earth’s climate. This, in turn, is causing more severe weather and the extinction of many species. A number of ethical decisions might be influenced by this scientific knowledge. Q: For example, should people avoid driving cars to work or school because it contributes to climate change and the serious problems associated with it? What if driving is the only way to get there? Can you think of an ethical solution? A: This example shows that ethical decisions may not be all or nothing. For example, rather than driving alone, people might carpool with others. This would reduce their impact on climate change. They could also try to reduce 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  their impact in other ways. For example, they might turn down their thermostat in cold weather so their furnace burns less fuel. 
Summary 	  • Ethics refers to deciding what’s right and what’s wrong. • Scientific investigations must be guided by ethical rules. The rules help ensure that science is done safely and that scientific knowledge is reliable. • Sometimes science can help people make ethical decisions in their own lives, but other factors usually must be considered as well.

Identify the “rights” and “wrongs” of 	  • Define physical science. • Define chemistry and physics. • Discuss ways people depend on physical science. Unless you’re a competitive swimmer like the athletes in the picture, you probably don’t wear a full-body swimsuit. The swimsuit was designed to help a swimmer glide smoothly through the water without restricting body movements. The suit is made of two synthetic fibers: nylon, which is very smooth, lightweight, and durable; and spandex, which is very stretchy. This is just one example of the many ways that sports gear, equipment, and performance have been improved by physical science. What Is Physical Science? Physical science is the study of matter and energy. That covers a lot of territory because matter refers to all the “stuff” that exists in the universe. It includes everything you can see and many things that you cannot see, including the air around you. Energy is also universal. It’s what gives matter the ability to move and change. Electricity, heat, and light are some of the forms that energy can take. 
Chemistry and  Physics 	  Physical science, in turn, can be divided into chemistry and physics. Chemistry is the study of matter and energy at the scale of atoms and molecules. For example, the synthetic fibers in the swimmer’s suit were created in labs by chemists. Physics is the study of matter and energy at all scales—from the tiniest particles of matter to the entire 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  universe. Knowledge of several important physics concepts—such as motion and forces—contributed to the design of the swimmer’s suit. Q: It’s not just athletes that depend on physical science. We all do. What might be some ways that physical science influences our lives? A: We depend on physical science for just about everything that makes modern life possible. You couldn’t turn on a light, make a phone call, or use a computer without centuries of discoveries in chemistry and physics. The Figure and matter makes each action possible. Each of these pictures represents a way that physical science influences our lives. 
Summary 	  • Physical science is the study of matter and energy. It includes chemistry and physics. • We depend on centuries of discoveries in physical science for just about everything we do.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define chemistry. • Give examples of chemistry in everyday life. The Statue of Liberty, pictured above, is an icon of America and freedom. The statue is made of steel and covered with a thin layer of copper, the same type of matter that pennies are made of. Copper is a brownish red metal, so why is the statue green? Chemistry, which is a branch of physical science, has the answer. What Is Chemistry? Chemistry is the study of matter and energy and how they interact, mainly at the level of atoms and molecules. Basic concepts in chemistry include chemicals, which are specific types of matter, and chemical reactions. In a chemical reaction, atoms or molecules of certain types of matter combine chemically to form other types of matter. All chemical reactions involve energy. Q: How do you think chemistry explains why the copper on the Statue of Liberty is green instead of brownish red? A: The copper has become tarnished. The tarnish—also called patina—is a compound called copper carbonate, which is green. Copper carbonate forms when copper undergoes a chemical reaction with carbon dioxide in moist air. The green patina that forms on copper actually preserves the underlying metal. That’s why it’s not removed from the statue. Some people also think that the patina looks attractive. 
Chemistry and  You 	  Chemistry can help you understand the world around you. Everything you touch, taste, or smell is made of chemicals, and chemical reactions underlie many common changes. For example, chemistry explains how food cooks, why laundry detergent cleans your clothes, and why antacid tablets relieve an upset stomach. Other examples are illustrated in the Figure 1.11. Chemistry even explains you! Your body is made of chemicals, and chemical changes constantly take place within it. 
Each of these pictures represents a way 	  that chemicals and chemical reactions affect our lives. 
Summary 	  • Chemistry is the study of matter and energy and how they interact, mainly at the level of atoms and molecules. Basic concepts in chemistry include chemicals and chemical reactions. • Chemistry can help you understand the world around you. Everything you touch, taste, or smell is a chemical, and chemical reactions underlie many common changes. Watch this video about the importance of chemistry, and then answer the questions below. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  URL • Identify the scope of physics. • Describe ways that physics explains the world around you. Did you ever look at your reflection in a funhouse mirror? That’s what the person in this picture is doing. This type of mirror distorts your features in silly ways. Do you know how a mirror like this one works? Physics, which is a branch of physical science, can explain it. 
The  Scope of  Physics 	  Physics is the study of energy, matter, and their interactions. It’s a very broad field because it is concerned with matter and energy at all levels—from the most fundamental particles of matter to the entire universe. Some people would even argue that physics is the study of everything! Important concepts in physics include motion, forces such as magnetism and gravity, and forms of energy such as light, sound, and electrical energy. Q: How do you think physics explains the distorted images formed by a funhouse mirror? A: Physics explains how energy interacts with matter. In this case, for example, physics explains how visible light reflects from mirrors to form images. Most mirrors, such as bathroom mirrors, have a flat surface. Light reflected from a flat mirror forms an image that looks the same as the object in front of it. Funhouse mirrors, like the one pictured above, are different. They have a curved surface that reflects light at different angles. This explains why the images they form are distorted. 
Physics in the  World  Around  You 	  Physics can help you understand just about everything in the world around you. That’s because everything around you consists of matter and energy. Several examples of matter and energy interacting are pictured in the Figure 1.12. Read how physics explains each example. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  Examples of how matter and energy interact. Q: Based on the examples in Figure 1.12, what might be other examples of energy and matter interacting? A: Like the strings of cello, anything that vibrates produces waves of energy that travel through matter. For example, when you throw a pebble into a pond, waves of energy travel from the pebble through the water in all directions. Like an incandescent light bulb, anything that glows consists of matter that produces light energy. For example, fireflies use chemicals to produce light energy. Like a moving tennis racket, anything that moves has energy because it is moving, including your eyes as they read this sentence. 
Summary 	  • Physics is the study of energy, matter, and their interactions. It is concerned with matter and energy at all levels—from the most fundamental particles of matter to the entire universe. • Physics can help you understand just about everything in the world around you. That’s because everything around you is matter and has energy. Watch the video at this URL, and answer the questions at the end. URL (6:42) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Identify and describe several physical science careers. Imagine floating in space outside the International Space Station, like the astronaut pictured here. What an exciting career! Did you ever want to become an astronaut? A good place to start is by getting a degree in physical science. 
Studying  Physical  Science 	  Physical science is the study of matter and energy. It includes the sciences of chemistry and physics. Most careers in physical science require a 4-year college degree in one of these fields. Some careers require more advanced education as well. For example, an astronaut might have a master’s degree or even a doctoral degree. Q: Besides becoming an astronaut, a degree in physical science can prepare you for many other careers. What careers do you think might be available to people with degrees in physical science? A: People with degrees in physical science might become pharmacists, forensic technicians, or research scientists, to name just three possible careers. Four additional careers in physical science are described below. 
Careers in  Chemistry and  Physics 	  Training in the physical science field of chemistry or physics is needed for the careers described in the Figure 1.13. Do any of these careers interest you? You can learn more about careers in these fields at these URLs: • URL (chemistry) • URL (physics) 
These careers in chemistry and physics 	  vary in the level of education they require. 
Summary 	  • Physical science includes the fields of chemistry and physics. Most careers in physical science require a minimum of 4 years of college in one of these fields. • Examples of careers in physical science include pharmacist, laboratory supervisor, teacher, and surveyor.

Physics 	  • Define technology. • Outline how technology evolves. The odd-looking boat in this picture was made entirely from recycled plastic bottles. That’s unusual enough, but how the boat was made is even more unusual. Would you believe that it was created by a printer? Of course, it wasn’t a printer like the one you might have on your desk to print school papers. It was a special 3-D printer. This type of printer forms an object, layer by layer, by spraying a fine powder of plastic or metal instead of toner. It sprays the powder in a pattern directed by a computer program. A laser beam melts the powder, which then hardens. You can learn more about 3-D printing by watching the video at this URL: URL (0:59). Click image to the left or use the URL below. What Is Technology? Printers like the one that made the plastic bicycle are a new type of technology. Technology is the application of science to solve problems. Because technology finds solutions to practical problems, new technologies may 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  have major impacts on society, science, and industry. For example, some people predict that 3-D printing will revolutionize manufacturing. Q: Making products with 3-D printers has several advantages over making them with machines in factories. What do you think some of the advantages might be? A: Making products with 3-D printers would allow anyone anywhere to make just about anything, provided they have the printer, powder, and computer program. Suppose, for example, that you live in a remote location and need a new part for your car. The solution? Just download the design on your computer and print the part on your 3-D printer. Manufacturing would no longer require specially designed machines in factories that produce pollution. Another advantage of using 3-D printers to make products is that no materials are wasted. This would lower manufacturing costs as well as save natural resources. 
How  Technology  Evolves 	  New technologies such as 3-D printers often evolve slowly as new materials, designs, or processes are invented. Solar-powered cars are a good example. For several decades, researchers have been working on developing practical solar-powered cars. Why? Cars powered by sunlight have at least two important advantages over gas-powered cars. The energy they use is free and available almost everywhere, and they produce no pollution. The timeline in Table 
Milestone 	  The first modern solar cell was invented in 1954 by a team of researchers at Bell Labs in the U.S. It could convert light energy to enough electricity to power devices. In 1955, William G. Cobb of General Motors demonstrated his 15-inch-long “Sunmobile,” the world’s first solar-powered automobile. Its tiny electric motor was powered by 12 solar cells on top of the car. In 1983, the first drivable solar car was created by Hans 
Tholstrup, a  Danish inventor who was influenced by 	  the earlier Sunmobile. Called the “Quiet Achiever,” Tholstrup’s car was driven 4000 km across Australia. 
However, its average speed was only 23 km/h, despite 	  having more than 700 solar cells on its top panel. 
Inspired by his success with the  Quiet  Achiever, in 	  lenge. This was the world’s first solar car race. The race is now held every other year. In that first race, the winner was General Motors’ “Sunraycer,” shown here. 
It had an average speed of 67 km/h.  Its aerodynamic 	  shape helped it achieve that speed. In 2008, the first commercial solar car was introduced. Called the Venturi Astrolab, it has a top speed of 120 km/h. To go this fast while using very little energy, it is built of ultra-light materials. 
Its oversized body 	  protects the driver in case of collision and provides a lot of surface area for solar cells. Q: Why was the invention of the solar cell important to the evolution of solar car technology? A: The solar car could not exist without the solar cell. This invention provided a way to convert light energy to electricity that could be used to run a device such as a car. Q: The 1955 “Sunmobile” was just a model car. It was too small for people to drive. Why was it an important achievement in the evolution of solar car technology? A: The car wasn’t practical, but it was a working solar car. It showed people that solar car technology is possible. It spurred others, including Hans Tholstrup, to work on solar cars that people could actually drive. Q: How have the World Solar Challenge races influenced the development of solar cars? A: The races have drawn a lot of attention to solar car development. The challenge of winning a race has also stimulated developers to keep improving the performance of solar cars so they can go faster and farther on solar power alone. 
Summary 	  • Technology is the application of science to solve practical problems. • Technology evolves as new materials, designs, and processes are invented. Watch this video about saw-stop technology, and then answer the questions below. URL (5:06) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define technological design. • List the steps of the technological design process. This giant six-limbed robot is NASA’s Tri-ATHLETE. As the robot’s name suggests, it is very “athletic.” It was designed to do the heavy lifting in explorations of other planets and moons in the universe. The Tri (“three”) part of its name refers to the fact that the robot can split into two separate three-limbed robots. These smaller robots can do things that the larger, six-limbed robot can’t. What Is Technological Design? The process in which tri-ATHLETE was created and perfected is called technological design. This is the process in which most new technologies are developed. Technological design is similar to scientific investigation. Both processes rely on evidence and reason, and follow a logical sequence of steps to solve problems or answer questions. The process of designing a new technology includes much more than just coming up with a good idea. Possible limitations, or constraints, on the design must be taken into account. These might include factors such as the cost or safety of the new product or process. Making and testing a model of the design are also important. These steps ensure that the design actually works to solve the problem. This process also gives the designer a chance to find problems and modify the design if necessary. No solution is perfect, but testing and refining a design assures that the technology will provide a workable solution to the problem it is intended to solve. 
Steps of the  Technological  Design  Process 	  The technological design process can be broken down into the series of steps shown in the flowchart in Figure 1.14. Typically, some of the steps have to be repeated, and the steps may not always be done in the sequence shown. 
This flowchart illustrates the steps of the 	  technological design process. Consider the problem of developing a solar-powered car. Many questions would have to be researched in the design process. For example, what is the best shape for gathering the sun’s rays? How will sunlight be converted to useable energy to run the car? Will a back-up energy source be needed? After researching the answers, possible designs are developed. This generally takes imagination as well as sound reasoning. Then a model must be designed and tested. This allows any problems with the design to be worked out before a final design is selected and produced. Q: Assume you want to design a product that lets a person in a wheelchair carry around small personal items so they are easy to access. What questions might you research first? A: You might research questions such as: What personal items are people likely to need to carry with them? What types of carriers or holders are there that might be modified for use by people in a wheelchair? Where might a carrier be attached to a wheelchair or person in a wheelchair without interfering with the operation of the chair or hindering the person? Q: Suppose you have come up with a possible solution to the problem described in the previous question. How might you make a model of your idea? How could you test your model? A: First, you might make a sketch of your idea. Then you could make an inexpensive model using simple materials such as cardboard, newspaper, tape, or string. You could test your model by trying to carry several personal items in it while maneuvering around a room in a wheelchair. You would also want to make sure that you could do things like open doors, turn on light switches, and get in and out of the chair without the carrier getting in the way. 
Summary 	  • Technological design is the process in which new technology is developed. • Steps of the technological design process include: identify a problem, research the problem, generate possible solutions, select the best solution, create a model, test the model, refine and retest the model as needed, and communicate the final solution.

URL (5:05) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Give examples of physical and social constraints on technological design. • Explain why all technological designs have trade-offs. Look at the colorful kites in this picture. Did you ever fly a kite? Do you think you could make one? What shape would you make it? What materials would you use? How would you design it? 
Constraints on  Design 	  The development of new technology—whether it’s a simple kite or a complex machine—is called technological design. The technological design process is a step-by-step approach to finding a solution to a problem. Often, the main challenge in technological design is finding a solution that works within the constraints, or limits, on the design. All technological designs have constraints. Q: Assume you want to design a kite. What might be some constraints on your design? A: Possible constraints might include the shape and size of the kite and the materials you use to make it. 
Physical and  Social  Constraints 	  Technological design constraints may be physical or social. • Physical design constraints include factors such as natural laws and properties of materials. A kite, for example, will fly only if its shape allows air currents to lift it. Otherwise, gravity will keep it on the ground. • Social design constraints include factors such as ease of use, safety, attractiveness, and cost. For example, a kite string should be easy to unwind as the wind carries the kite higher. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  All technological designs have trade-offs because no design is perfect. For example, a design might be very good at solving a problem, but it might be too expensive to be practical. Or a design might be very attractive, but it might not be safe to use. Choosing the best design often involves weighing the pros and cons of different options and deciding which ones are most important. Q: What trade-offs might there be on the design of a kite? A: You might want to make a big kite, but if it’s too big it might be too heavy. Then it would fly only on very windy days. Or you might want to make a kite using a certain material that you really like, but the material might cost more than you can afford to spend. 
Summary 	  • All technological designs have constraints, or limits, on the design. • Physical design constraints include factors such as natural laws and properties of materials. Social design constraints include factors such as ease of use, safety, attractiveness, and cost. • All technological designs have trade-offs because no design is perfect. Choosing the best design involves weighing the pros and cons of different options. Watch this video showing how to make a kite with a traditional design. Then answer the questions below.

This incredible image was made by the Hubble space telescope. The image is called Pillars of Creation. It shows the actual formation of stars in distant space. The Hubble telescope is a very powerful telescope that orbits Earth like a satellite. Scientists placed the Hubble telescope into space so it could make clear images like this without background lights on Earth competing with the dim light from distant stars. It has led to many scientific discoveries. 
How  Technology and  Science  Are  Related 	  The Hubble space telescope shows that technology and science are closely related. Technology uses science to solve problems, and science uses technology to make new discoveries. However, technology and science have different goals. The goal of science is to answer questions and increase knowledge. The goal of technology is to find solutions to practical problems. Although they have different goals, science and technology work hand in hand, and each helps the other advance. Scientific knowledge is used to create new technologies such as the space telescope. New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in new ways. 
How  Technology  Revolutionized  Science 	  The Hubble telescope was put into orbit around Earth in the 1990s, but scientists have been using telescopes to make discoveries for hundreds of years. The first telescope was invented in the early 1600s. The inventor was probably 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  a Dutch lens maker named Hans Lippershey. He and his telescope are pictured in Figure 1.15. Lippershey used scientific knowledge of the properties of light and lenses to design his telescope. 
Hans  Lippershey is credited with making 	  the first practical telescope in 1608. He is pictured here using his invention to view distant objects. Officials of the Dutch government recognized the importance of 
Lippershey’s invention.  They gave him a 	  generous sum of money for his design. Lippershey’s new technology quickly spread all over Europe. Almost immediately, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo started working to improve Lippershey’s design. 
In just two years,  Galileo had made a more powerful 	  telescope. It could make very distant objects visible to the human eye. The Figure 1.16 shows Galileo demonstrating his powerful telescope. It appears to be focused on the moon. Galileo started using his telescope to explore the night sky. He soon made some remarkable discoveries. He observed hills and valleys on the moon and spots on the sun. He discovered that Jupiter has moons and that the sun rotates on its axis. With his discoveries, Galileo was able to prove that the sun, not Earth, is at the center of the solar system. This discovery played an important role in the history of science. It led to a scientific revolution that gave birth to modern Western science. And it all began with technology! Galileo is shown here presenting his telescope to government leaders. They must have been impressed. They gave him a life-long job as a university professor and doubled his salary. 
Other  Examples 	  There are many other examples that show how technology and science work together. Two are pictured in Figure It may have been invented by Galileo around the same time as the telescope. Like the invention of the telescope, the invention of the microscope also depended on scientific knowledge of light and lenses. Q: How do you think the invention of the microscope helped science advance? A: The microscope let scientists view a world of tiny objects they had never seen before. It led to many important scientific discoveries, including the discovery of cells, which are the basic building blocks of all living things. 
Seismometers and spectrometers are 	  both technological devices that led to important scientific discoveries. 
Summary 	  • Science and technology help each other advance. Scientific knowledge is used to create new technologies. New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in different ways and make new discoveries. • Examples of technologies that have helped science advance include the telescope and microscope. Read this short article about scientific discoveries made possible by the invention of the microscope. Then answer the questions below. URL results? 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Summarize how major advances in technology impact human society. • Describe how the Industrial Revolution affected people’s lives. The Mars Rover pictured here is a wheeled robot developed by NASA. Its job is to explore the surface of Mars. The rover contains a lot of complex modern technology. But how it moves by rolling on wheels is a very old invention. The wheel was probably invented many times in different cultures, beginning at least 10,000 years ago. In addition to wheeled carts and chariots, early wheels were used for water wheels, grinding wheels, and wheels for spinning pottery. Wheels really changed human life. They revolutionized transportation and made it much easier to do many different kinds of work. 
How  Technology  Affects  Society 	  Important new technologies such as the wheel have had a big impact on human society. Major advances in technology have influenced every aspect of life, including transportation, food production, manufacturing, communication, medicine, and the arts. That’s because technology has the goal of solving human problems, so new technologies usually make life better. They may make work easier, for example, or make people healthier. Sometimes, however, new technologies affect people in negative ways. For example, using a new product or process might cause human health problems or pollute the environment. Q: Can you think of a modern technology that has both positive and negative effects on people? A: Modern methods of transportation have both positive and negative effects on people. They help people and goods move quickly all over the world. However, most of them pollute the environment. For example, gasoline-powered cars and trucks add many pollutants to the atmosphere. The pollutants harm people’s health and contribute to global climate change. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  Few technologies have impacted society as greatly as the powerful steam engine developed by Scottish inventor James Watt in 1775 (see Figure 1.18). Watt’s steam engine was soon being used to power all kinds of machines. It started a revolution in industry. For the first time in history, people did not have to rely on human or animal muscle, wind, or water for power. With the steam engine to power machines, new factories sprang up all over Britain. 
This is a museum model similar to the 	  steam engine invented by James Watt. The Industrial Revolution began in Britain the late 1700s. It eventually spread throughout Western Europe, North America, Japan, and many other countries. It marked a major turning point in human history. Almost every aspect of daily life was influenced by it in some way. Average income and population both began to grow faster than ever before. People flocked to the new factories for jobs, and densely populated towns and cities grew up around the factories. The new towns and cities were crowded, and soot from the factories polluted the air. You can see an example of this in the Figure 1.19. This made living conditions very poor. Working conditions in the factories were also bad, with long hours and the pace set by machines. Even young children worked in the factories, damaging their health and giving them little opportunity for education or play. Q: In addition to factory machines, the steam engine was used to power farm machinery, trains, and ships. What effects might this have had on people’s lives? A: Farm machinery replaced human labor and allowed fewer people to produce more food. This is why many rural people migrated to the new towns and cities to look for work in factories. Steam-powered trains and ships made it easier for people to migrate. Food and factory goods could also be transported on steam-powered trains and ships, making them available to far more people. 
Summary 	  • Major advances in technology have influenced every aspect of human society, usually in good ways but sometimes in bad ways as well. • Almost every aspect of people’s lives was influenced by the Industrial Revolution that followed James Watt’s invention of a powerful steam engine in 1775.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Describe the general career of engineer. • Identify specific engineering careers. Did you ever wonder who thinks up the designs for roller coasters like this one, or how a roller coaster is built? There are more than 100 large amusement parks in the U.S., and they compete to have the fastest or tallest coasters that give the most thrilling ride. Each year, many of the parks install new roller coasters. Each new coaster is designed for its specific location and the park’s needs. Then it is custom built. 
Technology  Professionals 	  Companies that design and build roller coasters employ a range of technology professionals. Technology is the application of science to real-world problems. Professionals in technology are generally called engineers. Engineers are creative problem solvers. They use math and science to design and develop just about everything—from roller coasters to video games. Q: Whether engineers are designing and developing roller coasters or video games, they need many of the same skills and the same basic knowledge. What skills and knowledge do you think all engineers might need? A: All engineers need basic knowledge of math and science, particularly physical science. For example, to design and build a roller coaster, they would need to know about geometry, as well as forces and motion, which are important topics in physical science. In addition, all engineers must have skills such as logical thinking and creativity. The ability to envision three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional drawings is also helpful for most engineers. 
Careers in  Engineering 	  Different types of engineers, such as electrical and mechanical engineers, must work together to build roller coasters and most other engineering projects. You can learn about these and other technology careers at the URLs listed here and in the Figure 1.20. • URL • URL

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • State the role of investigations in science. • Outline the steps of the scientific method. Do you think that the man in this photo is a real scientist? In science fiction, scientists may be portrayed as wild-eyed and zany, randomly mixing chemicals in a lab. But that portrayal couldn’t be farther from the truth. Real scientists are disciplined professionals, and scientific investigations are very organized and methodical. 
Investigations in  Science 	  Investigations are at the heart of science. They are how scientists add to scientific knowledge and gain a better understanding of the world. Scientific investigations produce evidence that helps answer questions. Even if the evidence cannot provide answers, it may still be useful. It may lead to new questions for investigation. As more knowledge is discovered, science advances. 
Steps of a  Scientific  Investigation 	  Scientists investigate the world in many ways. In different fields of science, researchers may use different methods and be guided by different theories and questions. However, most scientists follow the general steps outlined in the general approach and not a strict sequence of steps. For example, scientists may follow the steps in a different order. Or they may skip or repeat some of the steps. The general steps followed in the scientific method. 
Using the  Scientific  Method: a  Simple  Example 	  A simple example will help you understand how the scientific method works. While Cody eats a bowl of cereal ( Figure 1.22), he reads the ingredients list on the cereal box. He notices that the cereal contains iron. Cody is studying magnets in school and knows that magnets attract objects that contain iron. He wonders whether there is enough iron in a flake of the cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet. He thinks that the iron content is probably too low for this to happen, even if he uses a strong magnet. 
Cody makes an observation that raises a question.  Curiosity about 	  observations is how most scientific investigations begin. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  Q: If Cody were doing a scientific investigation, what would be his question and hypothesis? A: Cody’s question would be, “Is there enough iron in a flake of cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet?” His hypothesis would be, “The iron content of a flake of cereal is too low for it to be attracted by a strong magnet.” Cody decides to do an experiment to test his hypothesis. He gets a strong magnet from his mom’s toolbox and places a dry flake of cereal on the table. Then he slowly moves the magnet closer to the flake. To his surprise, when the magnet gets very close to the flake, the flake moves the rest of the way to the magnet. Q: Based on this evidence, what should Cody conclude? A: Cody should conclude that his hypothesis is incorrect. There is enough iron in a flake of cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet. Q: If Cody were a scientist doing an actual scientific investigation, what should he do next? A: He should report his results to other scientists. 
Summary 	  • Investigations are at the heart of science. They produce evidence that helps scientists answer questions and better understand the world. • Most scientists follow the same general approach to investigation, which is called the scientific method. It includes the following steps: ask a question, do background research, construct a hypothesis, test the hypothesis by doing an experiment, analyze the data and draw a conclusion, and report the results. Read the procedure for the “Money in a Blender” investigation at the following URL. Then answer the questions below. With your teacher’s or parent’s approval, try the activity yourself. URL he have drawn then? • Define observation. • Identify the role of observation in scientific investigation. A scientist observed this orange-colored scum on a pond in her neighborhood. She wondered what the scum is and why it was there. She decided to do an investigation to find answers to her questions. Scientific investigations often result when observations like this raise questions. What Are Observations? An observation is any information that is gathered with the senses. Our senses include vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. We see with our eyes, hear with our ears, touch with our hands, smell with our nose, and taste with our tongue. We can also extend our senses and our ability to make observations by using instruments such as microscopes, telescopes, and thermometers. Q: How do these instruments extend human senses and our ability to make observations? A: Microscopes and telescopes extend the sense of vision. They allow us to observe objects that are too small (microscopes) or too distant (telescopes) for the unaided eye to see. Thermometers extend the sense of touch. Using our sense of touch, we can only feel how warm or cold something is relative to our own temperature or the temperature of something else. Thermometers allow us to measure precisely how warm or cold something is. 
Using  Observations to  Gather  Evidence 	  Besides raising questions for investigation, observations play another role in scientific investigations. They help scientists gather evidence. For example, to investigate whether a chemical change has occurred, a scientist might observe whether certain telltale signs are present. In some chemical changes, for example, a substance turns from 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  one color to another. You can see an example of this in the Figure 1.23. In other chemical changes, an odor is produced or gas bubbles are released. All of these changes can be observed with the senses. Some of these pennies are shiny and copper colored. That’s how pennies look when they are new. The older pennies are dull and brown. Copper at the surface of these pennies has combined with air to become a different substance with different properties. The change in color shows that a chemical change has occurred. Q: Some chemical changes release heat. How could this change be observed? A: The sense of touch—or a thermometer—could be used to observe an increase in temperature. 
Summary 	  • An observation is any information that is gathered with the senses. • Observations raise questions that lead to scientific investigations. Observations also help scientists gather evidence in investigations. We make many observations using our sense of hearing. Test your ability to make sound observations by doing the activity “Identifying Sounds” at this URL. Be sure to check your answers. URL • State two criteria of a scientific hypothesis. • Explain why a hypothesis cannot be proven true. Although this cartoon pokes fun at scientific hypotheses, the concept of hypothesis is one of the most important in science. Scientific investigations discover evidence that helps science advance, and the purpose of scientific investigations generally is to test hypotheses. Finding evidence to support or disprove hypotheses is how science advances. What Is a Scientific Hypothesis? The word hypothesis can be defined as an "educated guess." For example, it might be an educated guess about why a natural event occurs. But not all hypotheses—even those about the natural world—are scientific hypotheses. What makes a statement a scientific hypothesis rather than just an educated guess? A scientific hypothesis must meet two criteria: • A scientific hypothesis must be testable. • A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable. 
A  Scientific  Hypothesis  Must  Be  Testable 	  For a hypothesis to be testable means that it is possible to make observations that agree or disagree with it. If a hypothesis cannot be tested by making observations, it is not scientific. Consider this statement: "There are invisible creatures all around us that we can never observe in any way." This statement may or may not be true, but it is not a scientific hypothesis. That’s because it can’t be tested. Given the nature of the hypothesis, there are no observations a scientist could make to test whether or not it is false. 
A  Scientific  Hypothesis  Must  Be  Falsifiable 	  A hypothesis may be testable, but even that isn’t enough for it to be a scientific hypothesis. In addition, it must be possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false. Consider this statement: “There are other planets in the universe where life exists.” This statement is testable. If it is true, it is at least theoretically possible to find evidence showing that it’s true. For example, a spacecraft could be sent from Earth to explore the universe and report back if it discovers an inhabited planet. If such a planet were found, it would prove the statement is true. However, the statement isn’t a scientific hypothesis. Why? If it is false, it’s not possible to show that it’s false. The spacecraft may never find an inhabited planet, but that doesn’t necessarily mean there isn’t one. Given the vastness of the universe, we would never be able to check every planet for life! 
Both  Testable and  Falsifiable 	  Let’s consider one last example, which is illustrated in the Figure 1.24: "Any two objects dropped at the same time from the same height will reach the ground at the same time (assuming the absence of air resistance)." Is this statement testable? Yes. You could drop two objects at the same time from the same height and observe when they reach the ground. Of course, you would have to drop the objects in the absence of air to prevent air resistance, but at least such a test is theoretically possible. Is the statement falsifiable if it really is false? Again, the answer is yes. You can easily test many combinations of two objects and if any two objects do not reach the ground at the same time, then the hypothesis is false. If a hypothesis really is false, it should be relatively easy to disprove it. Can You Prove a Hypothesis Is True? If the hypothesis above about falling objects really were false, it is likely that this would be discovered sooner or later after enough objects had been dropped. It takes just one exception to disprove a hypothesis. But what if the hypothesis really is true? Can this be demonstrated as well? No; it would require testing all possible combinations of objects to show that they always reach the ground at the same time. This is impossible. New objects are being made all the time that would have to be tested. It’s always possible an exception would be found in the future to disprove the hypothesis. Although you can’t prove conclusively that a hypothesis is true, the more evidence you gather in support of it, the more likely it is to be true. 
Both the elephant and the boy are falling 	  to the ground because of gravity. The force of gravity (Fgrav) is greater for the elephant than it is for the boy because the elephant is much more massive. 
Nonetheless, both of them will reach the 	  ground at the same time (assuming they fall from the same height at the same time and there is no air resistance.) 
Summary 	  • In science, a hypothesis is an educated guess that can be tested with observations and falsified if it really is false. • You cannot prove conclusively that most hypotheses are true because it’s generally impossible to examine all possible cases for exceptions that would disprove them.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define experiment. • Contrast manipulated and responding variables in an experiment. • Explain why other variables in an experiment must be controlled. It’s exciting to roll down a skateboarding ramp, especially if you’re going fast. The steeper the ramp, the faster you’ll go. What else besides the steepness of a ramp influences how fast an object goes down it? You could do experiments to find out. What Is an Experiment? An experiment is a controlled scientific study of specific variables. A variable is a factor that can take on different values. For example, the speed of an object down a ramp might be one variable, and the steepness of the ramp might be another. 
Experimental  Variables 	  There must be at least two variables in any experiment: a manipulated variable and a responding variable. • A manipulated variable is a variable that is changed by the researcher. A manipulated variable is also called an independent variable. • A responding variable is a variable that the researcher predicts will change if the manipulated variable changes. A responding variable is also called a dependent variable. You can learn how to identify manipulated and responding variables in an experiment by watching this video about bouncing balls: URL (9:21) Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: If you were to do an experiment to find out what influences the speed of an object down a ramp, what would be the responding variable? How could you measure it? A: The responding variable would be the speed of the object. You could measure it indirectly with a stopwatch. You could clock the time it takes the object to travel from the top to the bottom of the ramp. The less time it takes, the faster the average speed down the ramp. Q: What variables might affect the speed of an object down a ramp? A: Variables might include factors relating to the ramp or to the object. An example of a variable relating to the ramp is its steepness. An example of a variable relating to the object is the way it moves—it might roll or slide down the ramp. Either of these variables could be manipulated by the researcher, so you could choose one of them for your manipulated variable. 
Controlling  Variables 	  Assume you are sliding wooden blocks down a ramp in your experiment. You choose steepness of the ramp for your manipulated variable. You want to measure how changes in steepness affect the time it takes a block to reach the bottom of the ramp. You decide to test two blocks on two ramps, one steeper than the other, and see which block reaches the bottom first. You use a shiny piece of varnished wood for one ramp and a rough board for the other ramp. You raise the rough board higher so it has a steeper slope (see sketch below). You let go of both blocks at the same time and observe that the block on the ramp with the gentler slope reaches the bottom sooner. You’re surprised, because you expected the block on the steeper ramp to go faster and get to the bottom first. Q: What explains your result? 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  A: The block on the steeper ramp would have reached the bottom sooner if all else was equal. The problem is that all else was not equal. The ramps varied not only in steepness but also in smoothness. The block on the smoother ramp went faster than the block on the rougher ramp, even though the rougher ramp was steeper. This example illustrates another important aspect of experiments: experimental controls. A control is a variable that must be held constant so it won’t influence the outcome of an experiment. The control can be used as a standard for comparison between experiments. In the case of your ramp experiment, smoothness of the ramps should have been controlled by making each ramp out of the same material. For other examples of controls in an experiment, watch the video at the URL below. It is Part II of the above video on bouncing balls. URL (5:44) Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: What other variables do you think might influence the outcome of your ramp experiment? How could these other variables be controlled? A: Other variables might include variables relating to the block. For example, a smoother block would be expected to go down a ramp faster than a rougher block. You could control variables relating to the block by using two identical blocks. 
Summary 	  • An experiment is a controlled scientific study of specific variables. A variable is a factor that can take on different values. • There must be at least two variables in any experiment: a manipulated variable and a responding variable. • A control is a variable that must be held constant so it won’t influence the outcome of an experiment. Do virtual experiments with objects sliding down ramps at the following URL, and then answer the questions below. For the y-axis, select Y pos (position of the object relative to the starting point), and for the x-axis, select time (time elapsed since the object started moving). From the controls, select one variable other than delta T to be your manipulated variable. Change this variable while controlling the others, and observe how it affects the movement of the object down the ramp. URL 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define field study. • Identify reasons why a field study might be done. The environmental chemist in this photo is “fishing” for a sample of river water. He works for the US Environmental Protection Agency. He is looking for evidence of pollution in the water. 
Doing  Science in the  Field 	  Although experiments are the “gold standard” for scientific investigations, sometimes it’s not possible or desirable to do experiments. Often it’s important to investigate a problem in the real world instead of in a lab. An investigation that gathers evidence in the real world—as the environmental chemist above is doing—is called a field study. Q: Why are field studies important for environmental scientists? A: To learn about the environment, scientists need to take measurements and make observations in the real world. This means gathering evidence in field studies; collecting samples of water from a river is one example of this method. 
Case  Study:  River  Water  Pollution 	  The environmental scientist above will gather samples of river water in several different locations. Then he will take the samples back to a lab to analyze them. He will do tests to identify any pollutants in the samples. Taking samples from different locations may help him identify the source of any pollution he finds. Pollution can enter a river from a single source, such as a waste water pipe from a factory. This is called point-source pollution. Or pollution can enter a river in runoff rainwater that picks up pollutants as it runs over the ground. This type of pollution enters the river everywhere. This is called nonpoint-source pollution. Q: Assume that the river is polluted only by nonpoint-source pollution. Describe how the samples of river water would compare in terms of the pollutants they contain. A: All of the samples would contain about the same amount and types of pollutants. Q: How might point-source pollution be identified? A: Just one sample might be polluted. This would be the sample taken at, or just downstream from, the single source of pollution. 
Summary 	  • In a field study, a scientist gathers evidence in the real world instead of in a lab. • Field studies are needed to investigate the environment. An example of a field study is collecting samples of river water to test for evidence of pollution. The mileage sticker pictured below states how many miles this car can go on 1 gallon of gas. The sticker shows the mileage for city driving and for highway driving. Unless you read the fine print at the bottom of the sticker, you would expect to get these mileages if you buy the car. However, these mileages were measured under ideal conditions in a lab, not as cars are actually driven in the real world. Gathering evidence to estimate average mileages in the real world would require a field study. real world? 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  might be investigated with a field study. • Explain why communication is important in science. • Identify ways that scientists can communicate about their research. Did you ever participate in a science fair? If you did, then you probably made a poster outlining what you did for your project and how your project turned out. Scientists often share their research in the same way. The picture above shows a poster session at a scientific conference. Posters are a quick and graphic way to communicate about research. 
Importance of  Communication in  Science 	  The last step of most scientific investigations is reporting the results. When scientists communicate their findings, they add to the body of scientific knowledge, and that’s how science advances. Science generally builds on previous knowledge, sometimes advancing in giant steps but more often in baby steps. The brick building analogy in the When scientists communicate about their research, they may also get useful feedback from other scientists. For example, comments from other scientists might help them improve their research design or interpret their findings in a different way. Other scientists can also repeat the research to see if they get the same results. Q: Why might it be important for other scientists to repeat an investigation? A: If an investigation is repeated and different results are obtained, then it throws doubt on the original research. On the other hand, if the same results are obtained, scientists can place more confidence in them. 
You can think of scientific knowledge as a 	  brick building, and the work of a single scientist as an individual brick. Considered by itself, the work of a single scientist may not seem that important, yet it may be an important piece of the overall structure. But unless a scientist communicates research results, that single brick may never be added to the building. 
How  Scientists  Communicate 	  The posters shown in the opening image are just one of several ways that scientists may communicate about their research. Some of the most common ways scientists communicate are listed below. • Scientists may present papers about their research at scientific conferences. This is a good way to quickly reach an audience of other scientists who are most interested in the research topic. • Scientists may publish articles about their research in peer-reviewed science journals. Peer review means that the work is analyzed by peers, in other words, by other scientists. The articles are published only if the other scientists are convinced that the research is accurate and honest. • Scientists may testify about their research before congress if their findings relate to matters of public policy, such as environmental pollution. • Scientists may communicate about their research to the general public. For example, they might create a Web site about their research, blog about it, or write articles for newspapers or magazines. Q: Why might it be important for scientists to communicate about their research to the general public? Give an example. A: Communicating to the general public might be important if the research is directly related to people’s lives. For example, assume that a scientist has investigated how driving habits are related to car crashes. She might write a newspaper article to share the research results with the public so they can adopt driving habits that reduce the risk of crashes. 
Summary 	  • The last step of most scientific investigations is communicating the results of the research. When scientists share their findings, they add to the body of scientific knowledge. They may also get useful feedback from other scientists. • Scientists may communicate about their research in several ways, such as presenting posters or papers at scientific conferences and publishing articles in scientific journals.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define replication. • Explain the importance of replication in science. Did a math teacher ever tell you to check your work? If you’re adding numbers, that means repeating the calculation to see if you get the same answer the second time. If you get the same result twice, then the answer is probably correct. But if you get a different answer the second time, at least one of the results must be incorrect. Then you have to add the numbers a third time and hope that the third answer will agree with one of the other two. 
Replication 	  Scientists also have to “check their work.” The results of an investigation are not likely to be well accepted unless the investigation is repeated—usually many times—and the same result is always obtained. Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated is called replication. If research results can be replicated, it means they are more likely to be correct. Repeated replication of investigations may turn a hypothesis into a theory. On the other hand, if results cannot be replicated they are likely to be incorrect. 
Why  Replication  Is  Important in  Science:  An  Example 	  The following example shows why replication is important in science. In 1998, a British researcher published an article in a medical journal reporting that he had found a link between a common childhood vaccine and autism (see Figure 1.26). According to the article, children in his study developed autism soon after receiving the vaccine. Following publication of the article, many parents refused to have their children vaccinated. Several epidemics occurred as a result, and some children died of the diseases. This child is receiving a vaccine. Soon after the original study was published, other researchers tried to replicate the research. However, it could not be replicated. No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result, scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect. Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his research results. If other scientists had not tried to replicate the research, the truth might never have come out. You can read more about this case at the URL below. URL 
Summary 	  • Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated is called replication. 
If research results can be 	  replicated, it means they are more likely to be correct. • Replication is important in science so scientists can “check their work.” The result of an investigation is not likely to be well accepted unless the investigation is repeated many times and the same result is always obtained. Scientists often repeat their own experiments to see if they can replicate the result. These repeated experiments are called trials. At the following URL, read about the repeated trials in an investigation involving crows. Be sure to watch the movies showing the crows during different trials. After reading the article and seeing the movies, answer the questions below. URL 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  researchers tried to replicate the vaccine-autism study described above. Why do you think so much effort was made to replicate this particular study? What was the outcome of the additional research? • Describe the International System of Units (SI). • Convert units between International and English systems. In 1999, NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter, pictured here, burned up as it passed through Mars’ atmosphere. The satellite was programmed to orbit Mars at high altitude and gather climate data. Instead, the Orbiter flew too low and entered the red planet’s atmosphere. Why did the Orbiter fly off course? The answer is human error. The flight system software on the Orbiter was written using scientific units of measurement, but the ground crew was entering data using common English units. 
I  Units 	  The example of the Mars Climate Orbiter shows the importance of using a standard system of measurement in science and technology. The measurement system used by most scientists and engineers is the International System of Units, or SI. There are a total of seven basic SI units, including units for length (meter) and mass (kilogram). SI units are easy to use because they are based on the number 10. Basic units are multiplied or divided by powers of ten to arrive at bigger or smaller units. Prefixes are added to the names of the units to indicate the powers of ten, as shown in the Table 1.4.

A: The name of this unit is the centimeter. Q: What fraction of a meter is a decimeter? A: A decimeter is one-tenth (0.1) of a meter. 
Unit  Conversions 	  In the Table 1.5, two basic SI units are compared with their English system equivalents. You can use the information in the table to convert SI units to English units or vice versa. For example, from the table you know that 1 meter equals 39.37 inches. How many inches are there in 3 meters?

(Hint: There are 36 inches in a yard.) A: Rod needs 39.37 inches (a meter) of wire, but a yard is only 36 inches, so if he buys a yard of wire he won’t have enough. 
Summary 	  • The measurement system used by most scientists and engineers is the International System of Units, or SI. There are seven basic SI units, including units for length and mass. • If you know the English equivalents of SI units, you can convert SI units to English units or vice versa.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • State how to read a metric ruler. • Describe how to measure mass with a triple beam balance. • Outline how to measure the volume of a liquid with a graduated cylinder. The device pictured above is called a pH meter. It is a scientific measuring device that measures the acidity of a liquid. Being able to use scientific measuring devices such as this is an important science skill. That’s because doing science typically involves making many measurements. For example, if you do lab exercises in science, you might measure an object’s length or mass, or you might find the volume of a liquid. Scientists use sensitive measuring devices to make measurements such as these. The measurements are usually made using SI units of measurement. 
Measuring  Length with a  Metric  Ruler 	  You’ve probably been using a ruler to measure length since you were in elementary school. But you may have made most of the measurements in English units of length, such as inches and feet. In science, length is most often measured in SI units, such as millimeters and centimeters. Many rulers have both types of units, one on each edge. The ruler pictured below has only SI units. It is shown here bigger than it really is so it’s easier to see the small lines, which measure millimeters. The large lines and numbers stand for centimeters. Count the number of small lines from the left end of the ruler (0.0). You should count 10 lines because there are 10 millimeters in a centimeter. Q: What is the length in millimeters of the red line above the metric ruler? A: The length of the red line is 32 mm. Q: What is the length of the red line in centimeters? A: The length of the red line is 3.2 cm. 
Measuring  Mass with a  Balance 	  Mass is the amount of matter in an object. Scientists often measure mass with a balance. A type of balance called a triple beam balance is pictured in Figure 1.27. To use this type of balance, follow these steps: moving the larger masses and then fine tune the measurement by moving the smaller masses as needed. is equal to the mass of the object. The Figure 1.28 is an enlarged version of the scales of the triple beam balance in Figure 1.27. It allows you to read the scales. The middle scale, which measures the largest movable mass, reads 300 grams. This is followed by the top scale, which reads 30 grams. The bottom scale reads 5.1 grams. Therefore, the mass of the object in the pan is Q: What is the maximum mass this triple beam balance can measure? A: The maximum mass it can measure is 610 grams (500 grams + 100 grams + 10 grams). Q: What is the smallest mass this triple beam balance can measure? A: The smallest mass it can measure is one-tenth (0.1) of a gram. To measure very small masses, scientists use electronic balances, like the one in the Figure 1.29. This type of balance also makes it easier to make accurate measurements because mass is shown as a digital readout. In the 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  picture, the balance is being used to measure the mass of a white powder on a plastic weighing tray. The mass of the tray alone would have to be measured first and then subtracted from the mass of the tray and powder together. The difference between the two masses is the mass of the powder alone. 
Measuring  Volume with a  Graduated  Cylinder 	  At home, you might measure the volume of a liquid with a measuring cup. 
In science, the volume of a liquid 	  might be measured with a graduated cylinder, like the one sketched below. The cylinder in the picture has a scale in milliliters (mL), with a maximum volume of 100 mL. Follow these steps when using a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of a liquid: meniscus. Q: What is the volume of the liquid in the graduated cylinder pictured above? A: The volume of the liquid is 67 mL. Q: What would the measurement be if you read the highest point of the curved surface of the liquid by mistake? A: The measurement would be 68 mL. 
Summary 	  • In science, length may be measured with a metric ruler using SI units such as millimeters and centimeters. • Scientists measure mass with a balance, such as a triple beam balance or electronic balance. • In science, the volume of a liquid might be measured with a graduated cylinder. A micrometer is a measuring device that is used to make precise measurements of very small distances. At the URL below, read about the parts of a micrometer and how to use it.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  below. What is the mass of the object? • Define accuracy of measurements. • Define precision of measurements. Have you ever played golf, like the boy in this photo? Even if you haven’t played golf before, you probably know that the goal of the game is to hit the ball into a hole with the fewest strokes of the club. Golf is a good way to understand two important concepts in scientific measurement: accuracy and precision. 
Accuracy 	  The accuracy of a measurement is how close the measurement is to the true value. If you were to hit four different golf balls toward an over-sized hole, all of them might land in the hole. These shots would all be accurate because they all landed in the hole. This is illustrated in the sketch below. 
Precision 	  As you can see from the sketch above, the four golf balls did not land as close to one another as they could have. Each one landed in a different part of the hole. Therefore, these shots are not very precise. The precision of measurements is how close they are to each other. If you make the same measurement twice, the answers are precise if they are the same or at least very close to one another. The golf balls in the sketch below landed quite close together in a cluster, so they would be considered precise. However, they are all far from the hole, so they are not accurate. Q: If you were to hit four golf balls toward a hole and your shots were both accurate and precise, where would the balls land? A: All four golf balls would land in the hole (accurate) and also very close to one another (precise). 
Summary 	  • Accuracy means making measurements that are close to the true value. • Precision means making measurements that are close in value to each other but not necessarily close to the true value. both accurate and precise. URL actual volume of the liquid is 69.70 mL. Are Kami’s measurements precise? Are they accurate? Explain your answers. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define derived quantity. • Explain how to calculate area, volume, and density. • Identify units of area, volume, and density. This scientist is using a calculator. Doing science often requires calculations. Converting units—say from inches to centimeters—is one type of calculation that might be required. Calculations may also be needed to find derived quantities. What Are Derived Quantities? Derived quantities are quantities that are calculated from two or more measurements. Derived quantities cannot be measured directly. They can only be computed. Many derived quantities are calculated in physical science. Three examples are area, volume, and density. 
Calculating  Area 	  The area of a surface is how much space it covers. It’s easy to calculate the area of a surface if it has a regular shape, such as the blue rectangle in the sketch below. You simply substitute measurements of the surface into the correct formula. To find the area of a rectangular surface, use this formula: Area (rectangular surface) = length × width (l × w) Q: What is the area of the blue rectangle? A: Substitute the values for the rectangle’s length and width into the formula for area: 
Area = 9 cm × 5 cm = 45 cm2 	  Q: Can you use this formula to find the area of a square surface? A: Yes, you can. A square has four sides that are all the same length, so you would substitute the same value for both length and width in the formula for the area of a rectangle. 
Calculating  Volume 	  The volume of a solid object is how much space it takes up. It’s easy to calculate the volume of a solid if it has a simple, regular shape, such as the rectangular solid pictured in the sketch below. To find the volume of a rectangular solid, use this formula: Volume (rectangular solid) = length × width × height (l × w × h) Q: What is the volume of the blue rectangular solid? A: Substitute the values for the rectangular solid’s length, width, and height into the formula for volume: Volume = 10 cm × 3 cm × 5 cm = 150 cm3 
Calculating  Density 	  Density is a quantity that expresses how much matter is packed into a given space. The amount of matter is its mass, and the space it takes up is its volume. To calculate the density of an object, then, you would use this formula: Density = mass volume 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  Q: The volume of the blue rectangular solid above is 150 cm3. If it has a mass of 300 g, what is its density? A: The density of the rectangular solid is: Density = Q: Suppose you have two boxes that are the same size but one box is full of feathers and the other box is full of books. Which box has greater density? A: Both boxes have the same volume because they are the same size. However, the books have greater mass than the feathers. Therefore, the box of books has greater density. 
Units of  Derived  Quantities 	  A given derived quantity, such as area, is always expressed in the same type of units. For example, area is always expressed in squared units, such as cm2 or m2. If you calculate area and your answer isn’t in squared units, then you have made an error. Q: What units are used to express volume? A: Volume is expressed in cubed units, such as cm3 or m3. Q: A certain derived quantity is expressed in the units kg/m3. Which derived quantity is it? A: The derived quantity is density, which is mass (kg) divided by volume (m3). 
Summary 	  • Derived quantities are quantities that are calculated from two or more measurements. They include area, volume, and density. • The area of a rectangular surface is calculated as its length multiplied by its width. • The volume of a rectangular solid is calculated as the product of its length, width, and height. • The density of an object is calculated as its mass divided by its volume. • A given derived quantity is always expressed in the same type of units. For example, area is always expressed in squared units, such as cm2. Read about derived quantities at this URL, and then answer the questions below. URL change, in a unit. For example, ∆t represents a change in time.) 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Define significant figures. • State rules for counting significant figures. • Explain how to determine significant figures in calculations. • Identify rules for rounding numbers. Jerod has a homework problem that involves finding the area of a rectangle. He knows that the area of a rectangle equals its length times its width. The rectangle in question has a length of 6.9 m and a width of 6.5 m, so he multiplies the two numbers on his calculator. The answer he gets is 44.85 m2, which he records on his homework. To his surprise, his teacher marks this answer wrong. The reason? The answer has too many significant figures. What Are Significant Figures? In any measurement, the number of significant figures is the number of digits thought to be correct by the person doing the measuring. It includes all digits that can be read directly from the measuring device plus one estimated digit. Look at the sketch of a beaker below. How much blue liquid does the beaker contain? The top of the liquid falls between the mark for 40 mL and 50 mL, but it’s closer to 50 mL. A reasonable estimate is 47 mL. In this measurement, the first digit (4) is known for certain and the second digit (7) is an estimate, so the measurement has two significant figures. Now look at the graduated cylinder sketched below. How much blue liquid does it contain? First, it’s important to note that you should read the amount of liquid at the bottom of its curved surface. This falls about half way between the mark for 36 mL and the mark for 37 mL, so a reasonable estimate would be 36.5 mL. Q: How many significant figures does this measurement have? A: There are three significant figures in this measurement. You know that the first two digits (3 and 6) are accurate. The third digit (5) is an estimate. 
Rules for  Counting  Significant  Figures 	  The examples above show that it’s easy to count the number of significant figures when you are making a measurement. But what if someone else has made the measurement? How do you know which digits are known for certain 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  and which are estimated? How can you tell how many significant figures there are in the measurement? There are several rules for counting significant figures: • Leading zeros are never significant. For example, in the number 006.1, only the 6 and 1 are significant. • Zeros within a number between nonzero digits are always significant. For example, in the number 106.1, the zero is significant, so this number has four significant figures. • Zeros that show only where the decimal point falls are not significant. For example, the number 470,000 has just two significant figures (4 and 7). The zeros just show that the 4 represents hundreds of thousands and the • Trailing zeros that aren’t needed to show where the decimal point falls are significant. For example, 4.00 has three significant figures. Q: How many significant figures are there in each of these numbers: 20,080, 2.080, and 2000? A: Both 20,080 and 2.080 contain four significant figures, but 2000 has just one significant figure. 
Determining  Significant  Figures in  Calculations 	  When measurements are used in a calculation, the answer cannot have more significant figures than the measurement with the fewest significant figures. This explains why the homework answer above is wrong. It has more significant figures than the measurement with the fewest significant figures. As another example, assume that you want to calculate the volume of the block of wood shown below. The volume of the block is represented by the formula: 
Volume = length × width × height 	  Therefore, you would do the following calculation: Volume = 1.2 cm × 1.0 cm × 1 cm = 1.2 cm3 Q: Does this answer have the correct number of significant figures? A: No, it has too many significant figures. The correct answer is 1 cm3. That’s because the height of the block has just one significant figure. Therefore, the answer can have only one significant figure. 
Rules for  Rounding 	  To get the correct answer in the volume calculation above, rounding was necessary. Rounding is done when one or more ending digits are dropped to get the correct number of significant figures. In this example, the answer was rounded down to a lower number (from 1.2 to 1). Sometimes the answer is rounded up to a higher number. How do you know which way to round? Follow these simple rules: • If the digit to be rounded (dropped) is less than 5, then round down. For example, when rounding 2.344 to three significant figures, round down to 2.34. • If the digit to be rounded is greater than 5, then round up. For example, when rounding 2.346 to three significant figures, round up to 2.35. • If the digit to be rounded is 5, round up if the digit before 5 is odd, and round down if digit before 5 is even. For example, when rounding 2.345 to three significant figures, round down to 2.34. This rule may seem arbitrary, but in a series of many calculations, any rounding errors should cancel each other out. 
Summary 	  • In any measurement, the number of significant figures is the number of digits thought to be correct by the person doing the measuring. It includes all digits that can be read directly from the measuring device plus one estimated digit. • To determine the number of significant figures in a measurement that someone else has made, follow the rules for counting significant figures. • When measurements are used in a calculation, the answer cannot have more significant figures than the measurement with the fewest significant figures. • Rounding is done when one or more ending digits are dropped to get the correct number of significant figures. Simple rules state when to round up and when to round down. Do the significant figures quiz at this URL. Be sure to check your answers.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • State the purpose of scientific notation. • Explain how to convert numbers to and from scientific notation. Most of the stars pictured in this view of the night sky are hundreds of light years from Earth. A light year is the distance that light can travel in a year, or about 6 trillion (6,000,000,000,000) miles. As this example shows, quantities in science may be very large. Many other quantities in science are very small. Both very large and very small numbers have many zeroes, so they are hard to read and write without making mistakes. That’s where scientific notation comes in. What Is Scientific Notation? Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or very small numbers that uses exponents. Numbers are written in this format: a× 10b The letter a stands for a decimal number, and the letter b stands for an exponent, or power, of 10. For example, the number 300 is written in scientific notation as 3.0 × 102. The number 0.03 is written as 3.0 × 10−2. Do you need a URL (9:45) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Using  Scientific  Notation 	  It’s easier to convert numbers to and from scientific notation than you might think. Refer to the examples on the chalkboard in the Figure 1.31 as you read the following steps. Follow the steps in the sequence listed here to convert a number to scientific notation. Follow the steps in the reverse order to convert a number from scientific notation. × 10b. decimal point right (second example in the Figure 1.31)? If so, b is negative. 
These two examples show how to convert 	  large and small numbers to scientific notation. Q: Apply the steps above to write 450,000 in scientific notation. A: The unwritten decimal point in this number follows the last zero. Move the decimal point from this position to the left and stop just before the last digit, giving you 4.5 for a. The decimal point was moved five places to the left, so b is 5. In scientific notation the number is 4.5 × 105. Q: Apply the steps in reverse order to write the number that is expressed as 7.2 × 104 in scientific notation. A: Add zeroes to 7.2 as you move the decimal point four places to the right. This gives you the number 72,000. 
Summary 	  • Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or very small numbers that uses exponents. Numbers are written in the format a × 10b. • Changing numbers to or from scientific notation is easy to do by following three simple steps.

The shortest girl has a height of 52 cm, and the tallest girl has a height of with a single number? How could express how they vary in height with another number? 
Using  Statistics to  Describe a  Sample 	  The girls in the picture above make up a small sample—there are only four of them. In scientific investigations, samples may include hundreds or even thousands of people or other objects of study. Especially when samples are very large, it’s important to be able to summarize their overall characteristics with a few numbers. That’s where descriptive statistics come in. Descriptive statistics are measures that show the central tendency, or center, of a sample or the variation in a sample. 
Describing the  Center 	  The central tendency of a sample can be represented by the mean, median, or mode. • The mean is the average value. It is calculated by adding the individual measurements and dividing the sum by the total number of measurements. • The median is the middle value. To find the median, rank all the measurements from smallest to largest and then find the measurement that is in the middle. • The mode is the most common value. It is the value that occurs most often. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  Q: A sample of five children have the following heights: 60 cm, 58 cm, 54 cm, 62 cm, and 58 cm. What are the mean, median, and mode of this sample? A: The mean is (60 cm + 58 cm + 54 cm + 62 cm + 58 cm) ÷ 5 = 58 cm. The median and mode are both 58 cm as well. The mean, median, and mode are not always the same, as they are for this sample. In fact, sometimes these three statistics are very different from one another for the same sample. 
Describing the  Range 	  Many samples have a lot of variation in measurements. Variation can be described with a statistic called the range. The range is the total spread of values in a sample. It is calculated by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value. Q: What is the range of heights in the sample of children in the previous question? A: The range is 62 cm –54 cm = 8 cm. 
Summary 	  • Descriptive statistics are measures that summarize the characteristics of a sample. • The central tendency, or center, of a sample can be represented by the mean, median, or mode. • The variation in a sample can be represented by the range, or the total spread of values. Practice calculating descriptive statistics by playing the games at this URL. URL • State why graphs are useful in science. • Describe bar graphs and their uses. • Describe circle graphs and what they show. • Describe line graphs and how they are used. Tornadoes, like the one pictured here, are very powerful storms that can cause incredible destruction. Their winds may exceed 300 miles per hour, and they can completely level towns and neighborhoods in just minutes. Because tornadoes can be so serious, they are closely monitored, measured, and counted. As a result, there are a lot of data on tornadoes. One way to present these data is with graphs. 
Using  Graphs in  Science 	  Graphs are very useful tools in science. They can help you visualize a set of data. With a graph, you can actually see what all the numbers in a data table mean. Three commonly used types of graphs are bar graphs, circle graphs, and line graphs. Each type of graph is suitable for showing a different type of data. 
Bar  Graphs 	  The data in Table 1.6 shows the average number of tornadoes per year for the ten U.S. cities that have the most tornadoes. The data were averaged over the time period 1950–2007. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  TABLE 1.6: Average Number of Tornadoes per Year (1950–2007) in U.S. Cities with the Greatest 
Average  Number of  Tornadoes(per 	  Bar graphs are especially useful for comparing values for different things, such as the average numbers of tornadoes for different cities. Therefore, a bar graph is a good choice for displaying the data in the Table 1.6. The bar graph below shows one way that these data could be presented. Q: What do the two axes of this bar graph represent? A: The x-axis represents cities, and the y-axis represents average numbers of tornadoes. Q: Could you switch what the axes represent? If so, how would the bar graph look? A: Yes; the x-axis could represent average numbers of tornadoes, and the y-axis could represent cities. The bars of the graph would be horizontal instead of vertical. 
Circle  Graphs 	  The data in Table 1.7 shows the percent of all U.S. tornadoes by tornado strength for the years 1986 to 1995. In this table, tornadoes are rated on a scale called the F scale. On this scale, F0 tornadoes are the weakest and F5 tornadoes are the strongest. TABLE 1.7: Percent of Tornadoes by Strength in the U.S. (1986–1995) Tornado Scale(F-scale rating) 
Percent of all  U. S.  Tornadoes 	  Circle graphs are used to show percents (or fractions) of a whole, such as the percents of F0 to F5 tornadoes out of all tornadoes. Therefore, a circle graph is a good choice for the data in the table. The circle graph below displays these data. Q: What if the Table 1.7 on tornado strength listed the numbers of tornadoes rather than the percents of tornadoes? Could a circle graph be used to display these data? A: No, a circle graph can only be used to show percents (or fractions) of a whole. However, the numbers could be used to calculate percents, which could then be displayed in a circle graph. If you need a refresher on percents and fractions, go to this URL: URL . 
Line  Graphs 	  Consider the data in Table 1.8. It lists the number of tornadoes in the U.S. per month, averaged over the years 2009 to 2011. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  TABLE 1.8: Average Number of Tornadoes in the U.S. per Month (2009–2011) 
Average  Number of  Tornadoes 	  Line graphs are especially useful for showing changes over time, or time trends in data, such as how the average number of tornadoes varies throughout the year. Therefore, a line graph would be a good choice to display the data in the Table 1.8. The line graph below shows one way this could be done. Q: Based on the line graph above, describe the trend in tornado numbers by month throughout the course of a year. A: The number of tornadoes rises rapidly from a low in January to a peak in April. This is followed by a relatively slow decline throughout the rest of the year. 
Summary 	  • Graphs are very useful tools in science because they display data visually. Three commonly used types of graphs are bar graphs, circle graphs, and line graphs. Each type of graph is suitable for a different type of data. • Bar graphs are suitable for comparing values for different things, such as the average numbers of tornadoes for different cities. • Circle graphs are used to show percents of a whole, such as the percent of all U.S. tornadoes with different strengths. • Line graphs are especially useful for showing changes over time, such as variation in the number of tornadoes by month throughout the year. When you make a line graph, you need to locate x and y values on a set of axes. This lets you plot the points that will be connected to create the line.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Identify properties of useful models in science. • Describe examples of simple models in physical science. Did you ever read a road map like this one? Maybe not, but you’ve probably made a sketch of a house or other object and played with toy cars or dolls. What do all these activities have in common? They all involve models. What Is a Model? A model is a representation of an object, system, or process. For example, a road map is a representation of an actual system of roads on the ground. Models are very useful in science. They provide a way to investigate things that are too small, large, complex, or distant to investigate directly. To be useful, a model must closely represent the real thing in important ways, but it must be simpler and easier to understand than the real thing. Q: What might be examples of things that would be modeled in physical science because they are difficult to investigate directly? A: Examples include extremely small things such as atoms, very distant objects such as stars, and complex systems such as the electric grid that carries electricity throughout the country. Q: What are ways that these things might be modeled? A: Types of models include two-dimensional diagrams, three-dimensional structures, mathematical formulas, and computer simulations. Examples of simple two-dimensional models in physical science are described below.

Simple  Models in  Physical  Science 	  The diagram below is a simple two-dimensional model of a water molecule. This is the smallest particle of water that still has the properties of water. The model shows that each molecule of water consists of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. Q: What else can you learn about water molecules from this model? A: The model shows the number of atomic particles—protons, neutrons, and electrons—in each type of atom. It also shows that each hydrogen atom in a water molecule shares its electron with the oxygen atom. Q: Do you think this water molecule model satisfies the criteria of a useful model? In other words, does it represent a real water molecule in important ways while being simpler and easier to understand than a real water molecule? A: The model shows the basic structure of a water molecule and how the atoms in the molecule share electrons. These features of the water molecule explain important properties of water. The model is also simpler and easier 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  to understand than a real water molecule. In a real molecule, electrons spin around the nuclei at the center of the atoms in a cloud, rather than in neat, circular orbits, as shown in the model. The atoms of a real water molecule also contain even smaller particles than protons, neutrons, and electrons. For many purposes, however, it’s not necessary to represent these more complex features of a real water molecule. The diagram below shows another example of a simple model in physical science. This diagram is a model of an electric circuit. It represents the main parts of the circuit with simple symbols. Horizontal lines with + and –signs represent a battery. The parts labeled R1, R2, and R3 are devices that use electricity provided by the battery. For example, these parts might be a series of three light bulbs. Q: In the electric circuit diagram, what do the black lines connecting the battery and electric devices represent? A: The black lines represent electric wires. The wires are necessary to carry electric current from the battery to the electric devices and back to the battery again. Q: How is a circuit diagram simpler and easier to understand than an actual electric circuit? A: A circuit diagram shows only the parts of the circuit that carry electric current, and it uses simple symbols to represent them.

Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Identify the meaning of lab safety symbols. • List rules for staying safe in the lab. • State what to do in case of accidents in the lab or field. Research in physical science can be exciting, but it also has potential dangers. For example, the field scientist in this photo is collecting water samples from treatment ponds. There are many microorganisms in the water that could make him sick. The water and shore can also be strewn with dangerous objects such as sharp can lids and broken glass bottles that could cause serious injury. Whether in the field or in the lab, knowing how to stay safe in science is important. 
Safety  Symbols 	  Lab procedures and equipment may be labeled with safety symbols. These symbols warn of specific hazards, such as flames or broken glass. Learn the symbols so you will recognize the dangers. Then learn how to avoid them. Many common safety symbols are shown below. Q: Do you know how you can avoid these hazards? A: Wearing protective gear is one way to avoid many hazards in science. For example, to avoid being burned by hot objects, use hot mitts to protect your hands. To avoid eye hazards, such as harsh liquids splashed into the eyes, wear safety goggles. You can learn more about these and other lab hazards and how to avoid them at this URL: URL ww.angelfire.com/va3/chemclass/safety.html . 
Safety  Rules 	  Following basic safety rules is another important way to stay safe in science. Safe practices help prevent accidents. Several lab safety rules are listed below. Different rules may apply when you work in the field. But in all cases, you should always follow your teacher’s instructions. 
Lab  Safety  Rules 	  • Wear long sleeves and shoes that completely cover your feet. • If your hair is long, tie it back or cover it with a hair net. • Protect your eyes, skin, and clothing by wearing safety goggles, an apron, and gloves. • Use hot mitts to handle hot objects. • Never work in the lab alone. • Never engage in horseplay in the lab. • Never eat or drink in the lab. • Never do experiments without your teacher’s approval. • Always add acid to water, never the other way around, and add the acid slowly to avoid splashing. • Take care to avoid knocking over Bunsen burners, and keep them away from flammable materials such as paper. 
Introduction to  Physical  Science 	  • Use your hand to fan vapors toward your nose rather than smelling substances directly. • Never point the open end of a test tube toward anyone—including yourself! • Clean up any spills immediately. • Dispose of lab wastes according to your teacher’s instructions. • Wash glassware and counters when you finish your work. • Wash your hands with soap and water before leaving the lab. 
In  Case of  Accident 	  Even when you follow the rules, accidents can happen. Immediately alert your teacher if an accident occurs. Report all accidents, whether or not you think they are serious. 
Summary 	  • Lab safety symbols warn of specific hazards, such as flames or broken glass. Knowing the symbols allows you to recognize and avoid the dangers. • Following basic safety rules, such as wearing safety gear, helps prevent accidents in the lab and in the field. • All accidents should be reported immediately. Examine this sketch of students working in a lab, and then answer the question below.

Introduction 	  What do think this picture shows? Here’s a hint: This illustration mimics a photo taken with a special microscope that makes images of things that are extremely small. In fact, the gray spheres in the image represent things so small that trillions of them would fit inside the period at the end of this sentence. Each gray sphere is an atom of lead. Do you know what atoms are? They are the basic building blocks of matter. Matter, in turn, is all the “stuff” in the universe. In this unit you will learn much more about matter—from things as simple as atoms to as complex as you! • Define matter. • State what mass measures. • State what volume measures. Can you guess what this colorful image shows? Believe it or not, it actually depicts individual atoms of cesium (reddish-orange) on a surface of gallium arsenide molecules (blue). The image was created with an extremely powerful microscope, called a scanning tunneling microscope. This is the only type of microscope that can make images of things as small as atoms, the basic building blocks of matter. What’s the Matter? Matter is all the “stuff” that exists in the universe. Everything you can see and touch is made of matter, including you! The only things that aren’t matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound. In science, matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume. Mass and volume measure different aspects of matter. 
Mass 	  Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in a substance or an object. The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit’s mass is less than 1 kg. Q: If the fruit were at a lower level than the iron object, what would be the mass of the fruit? A: The mass of the fruit would be greater than 1 kg. Mass is commonly confused with weight. The two are closely related, but they measure different things. Whereas mass measures the amount of matter in an object, weight measures the force of gravity acting on an object. The force of gravity on an object depends on its mass but also on the strength of gravity. If the strength of gravity is held constant (as it is all over Earth), then an object with a greater mass also has a greater weight. Q: With Earth’s gravity, an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of 2.2 lb. How much does a 10 kg object weigh on Earth? A: A 10 kg object weighs ten times as much as a 1 kg object: 
Volume 	  Volume is a measure of the amount of space that a substance or an object takes up. The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m3), but smaller volumes may be measured in cm3, and liquids may be measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. • The volume of a liquid is measured with a measuring container, such as a measuring cup or graduated cylinder. • The volume of a gas depends on the volume of its container: gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. • The volume of a regularly shaped solid can be calculated from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height. • The volume of an irregularly shaped solid can be measured by the displacement method. You can read below how this method works. For a video on the displacement method, go to this URL: URL atch?v=e0geXKxeTn4 . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: How could you find the volume of air in an otherwise empty room? A: If the room has a regular shape, you could calculate its volume from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular room can be calculated with the formula: 
Volume = length × width × height 	  If the length of the room is 5.0 meters, the width is 3.0 meters, and the height is 2.5 meters, then the volume of the room is: Volume = 5.0 m × 3.0 m × 2.5 m = 37.5 m3 Q: What is the volume of the dinosaur in the diagram above? A: The volume of the water alone is 4.8 mL. The volume of the water and dinosaur together is 5.6 mL. Therefore, the volume of the dinosaur alone is 5.6 mL – 4.8 mL = 0.8 mL. 
Summary 	  • Matter is all the “stuff” that exists in the universe. It has both mass and volume. • Mass measures the amount of matter in a substance or an object. The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg). • Volume measures the amount of space that a substance or an object takes up. The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m3). Do the mass and volume quiz at this URL. Be sure to check your answers. URL • Define physical property. • Give examples of physical properties of matter. Both of these people are participating in a board sport, but the man on the left is snowboarding in Norway while the woman on the right is sandboarding in Dubai. Snow and sand are both kinds of matter, but they have different properties. What are some ways snow and sand differ? One difference is the temperature at which they melt. Snow melts at 0°C, whereas sand melts at about 1600°C! The temperature at which something melts is its melting point. Melting point is just one of many physical properties of matter. What Are Physical Properties? Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to an entirely different substance. Physical properties are typically things you can detect with your senses. For example, they may be things that you can see, hear, smell, or feel. Q: What differences between snow and sand can you detect with your senses? A: You can see that snow and sand have a different color. You can also feel that snow is softer than sand. Both color and hardness are physical properties of matter. 
Additional  Physical  Properties 	  In addition to these properties, other physical properties of matter include the state of matter. States of matter include liquid, solid, and gaseous states. For example at 20°C, coal exists as a solid and water exists as a liquid. Additional examples of physical properties include: • odor • boiling point • ability to conduct heat • ability to conduct electricity • ability to dissolve in other substances Some of these properties are illustrated in the Figures 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4. The video at this URL below compares physical properties such as these for different classes of matter: URL (5:41) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
The strong smell of swimming pool water 	  is the odor of chlorine, which is added to the water to kill germs and algae. In contrast, bottled spring water, which contains no chlorine, does not have an odor. 
Coolant is added to the water in a car 	  radiator to keep the water from boiling and evaporating. Coolant has a higher boiling point than water and adding it to the water increases the boiling point of the solution. Q: The coolant that is added to a car radiator also has a lower freezing point than water. Why is this physical property useful? A: When coolant is added to water in a car radiator, it lowers the freezing point of the water. This prevents the water in the radiator from freezing when the temperature drops below 0°C, which is the freezing point of pure water. Q: Besides being able to conduct electricity, what other physical property of copper makes it well suited for electric wires? 
This teakettle is made of aluminum except 	  for its handle, which is made of plastic. Aluminum is a good conductor of heat. 
It conducts heat from the flames on the 	  range to the water inside the kettle, so the water heats quickly. Plastic, on the other hand, is not a good conductor of heat. It stays cool enough to touch even when the rest of the teakettle becomes very hot. A: Copper, like other metals, is ductile. This means that it can be rolled and stretched into long thin shapes such as wires. 
Summary 	  • Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to an entirely different substance. Physical properties are typically things you can detect with your senses. • Examples of physical properties of matter include melting point, color, hardness, state of matter, odor, and boiling point. Water is one of the most important substances on Earth, and it has some unique physical properties. Read in detail about any one of the physical properties of water at the URL below. Then make a poster or video demonstrating this property of water. URL Copper is a good conductor of electricity. 
That’s why electric wires are often made 	  of copper. They are covered with a protective coating of plastic, which does not conduct electricity. • Define density. • Demonstrate how to calculate density. The man in this cartoon is filling balloons with helium gas. What will happen if he lets go of the filled balloons? They will rise up into the air until they reach the ceiling. Do you know why? It’s because helium has less density than air. 
Defining  Density 	  Density is an important physical property of matter. It reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter has greater density. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena, not just why helium balloons rise. For example, differences in density of cool and warm ocean water explain why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. You can see a colorful demonstration of substances with different densities at this URL: URL (4:00) Click image to the left or use the URL below. To better understand density, think about a bowling ball and volleyball, pictured in the Figure 2.5. Imagine lifting each ball. The two balls are about the same size, but the bowling ball feels much heavier than the volleyball. That’s because the bowling ball is made of solid plastic, which contains a lot of tightly packed particles of matter. The volleyball, in contrast, is full of air, which contains fewer, more widely spaced particles of matter. In other words, the matter inside the bowling ball is denser than the matter inside the volleyball. A bowling ball is denser than a volleyball. 
Although both balls are similar in size, the 	  bowling ball feels much heavier than the volleyball. Q: If you ever went bowling, you may have noticed that some bowling balls feel heavier than others even though they are the same size. How can this be? A: Bowling balls that feel lighter are made of matter that is less dense. 
Calculating  Density 	  The density of matter is actually the amount of matter in a given space. The amount of matter is measured by its mass, and the space matter takes up is measured by its volume. Therefore, the density of matter can be calculated with this formula: Assume, for example, that a book has a mass of 500 g and a volume of 1000 cm3. Then the density of the book is: Density = mass volume Density = Q: What is the density of a liquid that has a volume of 30 mL and a mass of 300 g? A: The density of the liquid is: Density = = 10 g/mL 
Summary 	  • Density is an important physical property of matter. It reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. • The density of matter can be calculated by dividing its mass by its volume. Go to this URL and take the calculating-density quiz. Be sure to check your answers! URL show which substance has greater density. • Define chemical property. • Describe examples of chemical properties of matter. Look at the two garden trowels pictured here. Both trowels were left outside for several weeks. One tool became rusty, but the other did not. The tool that rusted is made of iron, and the other tool is made of aluminum. The ability to rust is a chemical property of iron but not aluminum. What Are Chemical Properties? Chemical properties are properties that can be measured or observed only when matter undergoes a change to become an entirely different kind of matter. For example, the ability of iron to rust can only be observed when iron actually rusts. When it does, it combines with oxygen to become a different substance called iron oxide. Iron is very hard and silver in color, whereas iron oxide is flakey and reddish brown. Besides the ability to rust, other chemical properties include reactivity and flammability. 
Reactivity 	  Reactivity is the ability of matter to combine chemically with other substances. Some kinds of matter are extremely reactive; others are extremely unreactive. For example, potassium is very reactive, even with water. When a peasized piece of potassium is added to a small amount of water, it reacts explosively. You can observe this reaction in the video at the URL below. (Caution: Don’t try this at home!) In contrast, noble gases such as helium almost never react with any other substances. URL (0:19) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Flammability 	  Flammability is the ability of matter to burn. When matter burns, it combines with oxygen and changes to different substances. Wood is an example of flammable matter, as seen in Figure 2.6. When wood burns, it changes to ashes, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. You can see ashes in the wood fire pictured here. The gases are invisible. Q: How can you tell that wood ashes are a different substance than wood? A: Ashes have different properties than wood. For example, ashes are gray and powdery, whereas wood is brown and hard. Q: What are some other substances that have the property of flammability? A: Substances called fuels have the property of flammability. They include fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum, as well as fuels made from petroleum, such as gasoline and kerosene. Substances made of wood, such as paper and cardboard, are also flammable. 
Summary 	  • Chemical properties are properties that can be measured or observed only when matter undergoes a change to become an entirely different kind of matter. They include reactivity, flammability, and the ability to rust. • Reactivity is the ability of matter to react chemically with other substances. • Flammability is the ability of matter to burn.

As this mountain of trash suggests, there are many different kinds of matter. In fact, there are millions of different kinds of matter in the universe. Yet all kinds of matter actually consist of relatively few pure substances. 
Pure  Substances 	  A pure substance is called an element. An element is a pure substance because it cannot be separated into any other substances. Currently, 92 different elements are known to exist in nature, although additional elements have been formed in labs. All matter consists of one or more of these elements. Some elements are very common; others are relatively rare. The most common element in the universe is hydrogen, which is part of Earth’s atmosphere and a component of water. The most common element in Earth’s atmosphere is nitrogen, and the most common element in Earth’s crust is oxygen. Several other elements are described in the musical video at this URL: URL (3:47) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Elemental  Properties 	  Each element has a unique set of properties that is different from the set of properties of any other element. For example, the element iron is a solid that is attracted by a magnet and can be made into a magnet, like the compass needle shown in the Figure 2.7. The element neon, on the other hand, is a gas that gives off a red glow when electricity flows through it. The lighted sign in the Figure 2.8 contains neon. 
The needle of this compass is made of the 	  element iron. Q: Do you know properties of any other elements? For example, what do you know about helium? A: Helium is a gas that has a lower density than air. That’s why helium balloons have to be weighted down so they won’t float away. Q: Living things, like all matter, are made of elements. Do you know which element is most common in living things? A: Carbon is the most common element in living things. It has the unique property of being able to combine with many other elements as well as with itself. This allows carbon to form a huge number of different substances. 
History of  Elements 	  For thousands of years, people have wondered about the substances that make up matter. About 2500 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that all matter is made up of just four elements, which he identified as earth, air, water, and fire. He thought that different substances vary in their properties because they contain different proportions of these four elements. Aristotle had the right idea, but he was wrong about which substances are elements. Nonetheless, his four elements were accepted until just a few hundred years ago. Then scientists started 
The red lights in this sign contain the 	  element neon. discovering many of the elements with which we are familiar today. Eventually they discovered dozens of different elements. You can read how and when the different elements were discovered at this URL: URL gov/content/origindc.pdf . 
Particles of  Elements 	  The smallest particle of an element that still has the properties of that element is the atom. Atoms actually consist of smaller particles, including protons and electrons, but these smaller particles are the same for all elements. All the atoms of an element are like one another, and are different from the atoms of all other elements. For example, the atoms of each element have a unique number of protons. Consider carbon as an example. Carbon atoms have six protons. They also have six electrons. All carbon atoms are the same whether they are found in a lump of coal or a teaspoon of table sugar ( Figure 2.9). On the other hand, carbon atoms are different from the atoms of hydrogen, which are also found in coal and sugar. Each hydrogen atom has just one proton and one electron. Carbon is the main element in coal (left). 
Carbon is also a major component of 	  sugar (right). Q: Why do you think coal and sugar are so different from one another when carbon is a major component of each substance? A: Coal and sugar differ from one another because they contain different proportions of carbon and other elements. For example, coal is about 85 percent carbon, whereas table sugar is about 42 percent carbon. Both coal and sugar also contain the elements hydrogen and oxygen but in different proportions. In addition, coal contains the elements nitrogen and sulfur. 
Summary 	  • An element is a pure substance that cannot be separated into any other substances. There are 92 naturally occurring elements. • Each element has a unique set of properties that is different from the set of properties of any other element. • For about 2000 years, people accepted Aristotle’s idea that all matter is made up of just four elements: earth, air, water, and fire. Starting about 500 years ago, scientists began discovering all of the elements that are known today. • The smallest particle of an element that still has the properties of that element is the atom. All the atoms of an element are like one another, and are different from the atoms of all other elements. At the following URL, choose any three elements and learn about their properties, history, and uses. Then create a table comparing and contrasting the three elements. URL was first introduced a few hundred years ago. • Define compound, and give examples of compounds. • Contrast the properties of compounds and the properties of the elements that form compounds. • Describe crystals and molecules. What is this strange-looking object? Can you guess what it is? It’s a model of a certain type of matter. Some types of matter are elements, or pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. Many other types of matter are compounds. The model above represents a compound. The compound it represents is carbon dioxide, a gas you exhale each time you breathe. What Is a Compound? A compound is a unique substance that forms when two or more elements combine chemically. For example, the compound carbon dioxide forms when one atom of carbon (grey in the model above) combines with two atoms of oxygen (red in the model). Another example of a compound is water. It forms when two hydrogen atoms combine with one oxygen atom. You can learn more about compounds and how they form by watching the video at this URL: URL (3:53) Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: How could a water molecule be represented? A: It could be represented by a model like the one for carbon dioxide in the opening image. You can see a sample A model of water. Two things are true of all compounds: • A compound always has the same elements in the same proportions. For example, carbon dioxide always has two atoms of oxygen for each atom of carbon, and water always has two atoms of hydrogen for each atom of oxygen. • A compound always has the same composition throughout. For example, all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and all the water in the ocean have these same proportions of elements. Q: How do you think the properties of compounds compare with the properties of the elements that form them? A: You might expect the properties of a compound to be similar to the properties of the elements that make up the compound. But you would be wrong. 
Properties of  Compounds 	  The properties of compounds are different from the properties of the elements that form them—sometimes very different. That’s because elements in a compound combine and become an entirely different substance with its own unique properties. Do you put salt on your food? Table salt is the compound sodium chloride. It contains sodium and chlorine. As shown in the Figure 2.11, sodium is a solid that reacts explosively with water, and chlorine is a poisonous gas. But together in table salt, sodium and chlorine form a harmless unreactive compound that you can safely eat. 
Sodium and chlorine combine to form 	  sodium chloride, or table salt. Q: The compound sodium chloride is very different from the elements sodium and chlorine that combine to form it. What are some properties of sodium chloride? A: Sodium chloride is an odorless white solid that is harmless unless consumed in large quantities. In fact, it is a necessary component of the human diet. 
Structure of  Compounds 	  Compounds like sodium chloride form structures called crystals. A crystal is a rigid framework of many ions locked together in a repeating pattern. Ions are electrically charged forms of atoms. You can see a crystal of sodium chloride in the Figure 2.12. It is made up of many sodium and chloride ions. A sodium chloride crystal consists of many sodium ions (blue) and chloride ions (green) arranged in a rigid framework. You can actually watch a crystal forming (with time-lapse photography) at this URL: URL atch?v=Jd9C40Svt5g (1:09). Click image to the left or use the URL below. Compounds such as carbon dioxide and water form molecules instead of crystals. A molecule is the smallest particle of a compound that still has the compound’s properties. It consists of two or more atoms bonded together. You saw models of carbon dioxide and water molecules above. You can learn more about molecules at this URL: URL ww.nyscience.org/marvelousmolecules/marveloussub.html . 
Summary 	  • A compound is a unique substance that forms when two or more elements combine chemically. A compound always has the same elements in the same proportions. • The properties of compounds may be very different from the properties of the elements that form them. • Some compounds form rigid frameworks called crystals. Other compounds form individual molecules. A molecule is the smallest particle of a compound that still has the compound’s properties. Investigate compounds at the following URL.

URL • Define mixture, and give examples of mixtures. • Contrast homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures. • Identify types of mixtures based on particle size. • Explain how to separate the components of mixtures. Ahhhh! A tall glass of ice-cold lemonade is really refreshing on a hot day. Lemonade is a combination of lemon juice, water, and sugar. Do you know what kind of matter lemonade is? It’s obviously not an element because it consists of more than one substance. Is it a compound? Not all combined substances are compounds. Some—including lemonade—are mixtures. What Is a Mixture? A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in any proportion. This is different from a compound, which consists of substances in fixed proportions. The substances in a mixture also do not combine chemically to form a new substance, as they do in a compound. Instead, they just intermingle and keep their original properties. The lemonade pictured above is a mixture because it doesn’t have fixed proportions of ingredients. It could have more or less lemon juice, for example, or more or less sugar, and it would still be lemonade. Q: What are some other examples of mixtures? A: Other examples of liquid mixtures include salt water and salad dressing. Air is a mixture of gases, mainly nitrogen and oxygen. The rock pictured in the Figure 2.13 is a solid mixture. This rock is a mixture of smaller rocks and minerals. Homogeneous or Heterogeneous? The lemonade in the opening picture is an example of a homogeneous mixture. A homogeneous mixture has the same composition throughout. Another example of a homogeneous mixture is salt water. If you analyzed samples of ocean water in different places, you would find that the proportion of salt in each sample is the same: 3.5 percent. The rock in Figure 2.13 is an example of a heterogeneous mixture. A heterogeneous mixture varies in its composition. The black nuggets, for example, are not distributed evenly throughout the rock. 
Types of  Mixtures 	  Mixtures have different properties depending on the size of their particles. Three types of mixtures based on particle size are solutions, suspensions, and colloids, all of which are described in Table 2.1. You can watch videos about the three types of mixtures at these URLs: • URL (4:35) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • URL (6:13) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Description 	  A solution is a homogeneous mixture with tiny particles. The particles are too small to see and also too small to settle or be filtered out of the mixture. When the salt is thoroughly mixed into the water in this glass, it will form a solution. The salt will no longer be visible in the water, and it won’t settle to the bottom of the glass. A colloid is a homogeneous mixture with mediumsized particles. The particles are large enough to see but not large enough to settle or be filtered out of the mixture. The gelatin in this dish is a colloid. It looks red because you can see the red gelatin particles in the mixture. 
However, the particles are too small to settle to the 	  bottom of the dish. 
A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture with large 	  particles. The particles are large enough to see and also to settle or be filtered out of the mixture. 
It 	  The salad dressing in this bottle is a suspension. contains oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices. 
If the bottle 	  sits undisturbed for very long, the mixture will separate into its component parts. That’s why you should shake it before you use it. Q: If you buy a can of paint at a paint store, a store employee may put the can on a shaker machine to mix up the paint in the can. What type of mixture is the paint? A: The paint is a suspension. Some of the components of the paint settle out of the mixture when it sits undisturbed for a long time. This explains why you need to shake (or stir) the paint before you use it. Q: The milk you buy in the supermarket has gone through a process called homogenization. This process breaks up the cream in the milk into smaller particles. As a result, the cream doesn’t separate out of the milk no matter how long it sits on the shelf. Which type of mixture is homogenized milk? A: Homogenized milk is a colloid. The particles in the milk are large enough to see—that’s why milk is white instead of clear like water, which is the main component of milk. However, the particles are not large enough to settle out of the mixture. 
Separating  Mixtures 	  The components of a mixture keep their own identity when they combine, so they retain their physical properties. Examples of physical properties include boiling point, ability to dissolve, and particle size. When components of mixtures vary in physical properties such as these, processes such as boiling, dissolving, or filtering can be used to separate them. Look at the Figure 2.14 of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The water in the lake is a solution of salt and water. Do you see the white salt deposits near the shore? How did the salt separate from the salt water? Water has a lower boiling point than salt, and it evaporates in the heat of the sun. With its higher boiling point, the salt doesn’t get hot enough to evaporate, so it is left behind. Q: Suppose you have a mixture of salt and pepper. What properties of the salt and pepper might allow you to separate them? A: Salt dissolves in water but pepper does not. If you mix salt and pepper with water, only the salt will dissolve, leaving the pepper floating in the water. You can separate the pepper from the water by pouring the mixture through a filter, such as a coffee filter. Q: After you separate the pepper from the salt water, how could you separate the salt from the water? A: You could heat the water until it boils and evaporates. The salt would be left behind. 
Summary 	  • A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in any proportions. The substances in a mixture do not combine chemically, so they retain their physical properties. • A homogeneous mixture has the same composition throughout. A heterogeneous mixture varies in its composition. • Mixtures can be classified on the basis of particle size into three different types: solutions, suspensions, and colloids. • The components of a mixture retain their own physical properties. These properties can be used to separate the components by filtering, boiling, or other physical processes. Take the mixtures quiz at the following URL. Check your answers and read the explanations. URL of mixture in your table. including sand. How could you use this difference in physical properties to separate a mixture of iron filings and sand? • Define physical change, and give examples of physical change. • Explain how physical changes can be reversed. These stunning rock arches in Utah were carved by wind-blown sand. Repeated scouring by the sand wore away the rock, bit by tiny bit, like sandpaper on wood. The bits of rock worn away by the sand still contain the same minerals as they did when they were part of the large rock. They have not changed chemically in any way. Only the size and shape of the rock have changed, from a single large rock to millions of tiny bits of rock. Changes in size and shape are physical changes in matter. What Is a Physical Change? A physical change is a change in one or more physical properties of matter without any change in chemical properties. In other words, matter doesn’t change into a different substance in a physical change. Examples of physical change include changes in the size or shape of matter. Changes of state—for example, from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas—are also physical changes. Some of the processes that cause physical changes include cutting, bending, dissolving, freezing, boiling, and melting. Four examples of physical change are pictured in the Figure URL (13:35) Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: In the Figure 2.15, what physical changes are occurring? A: The paper is being cut into smaller pieces, which is changing its size and shape. The ice cubes are turning into a puddle of liquid water because they are melting. This is a change of state. The tablet is disappearing in the glass of water because it is dissolving into particles that are too small to see. The lighthouse is becoming coated with ice as ocean spray freezes on its surface. This is another change of state. 
Reversing  Physical  Changes 	  When matter undergoes physical change, it doesn’t become a different substance. Therefore, physical changes are often easy to reverse. For example, when liquid water freezes to form ice, it can be changed back to liquid water by heating and melting the ice. Q: Salt dissolving in water is a physical change. How could this change be reversed? A: The salt water could be boiled until the water evaporates, leaving behind the salt. Water vapor from the boiling water could be captured and cooled. The water vapor would condense and change back to liquid water. 
Summary 	  • A physical change in matter is a change in one or more of matter’s physical properties. In a physical change, matter may change its size, shape, or state, but its chemical properties do not change. • Because the chemical properties of matter remain the same in a physical change, a physical change is often easy to reverse.

Communities often use fireworks to celebrate important occasions. Fireworks certainly create awesome sights and sounds! Do you know what causes the brilliant lights and loud booms of a fireworks display? The answer is chemical changes. What Is a Chemical Change? A chemical change occurs whenever matter changes into an entirely different substance with different chemical properties. A chemical change is also called a chemical reaction. Many complex chemical changes occur to produce the explosions of fireworks. An example of a simpler chemical change is the burning of methane. Methane is the main component of natural gas, which is burned in many home furnaces. During burning, methane combines with oxygen in the air to produce entirely different chemical substances, including the gases carbon dioxide and water vapor. You can watch some very colorful chemical changes occurring in the video at this URL: URL (2:54) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Identifying  Chemical  Changes 	  Most chemical changes are not as dramatic as exploding fireworks, so how can you tell whether a chemical change has occurred? There are usually clues. You just need to know what to look for. A chemical change has probably occurred if bubbles are released, there is a change of color, or an odor is produced. Other clues include the release of heat, light, or loud sounds. Examples of chemical changes that produce these clues are shown in the Figure 2.17. Q: In addition to iron rusting, what is another example of matter changing color? Do you think this color change is a sign that a new chemical substance has been produced? A: Another example of matter changing color is a penny changing from reddish brown to greenish brown as it becomes tarnished. The color change indicates that a new chemical substance has been produced. Copper on the surface of the penny has combined with oxygen in the air to produce a different substance called copper oxide. Q: Besides food spoiling, what is another change that produces an odor? Is this a chemical change? A: When wood burns, it produces a smoky odor. Burning is a chemical change. Q: Which signs of chemical change do fireworks produce? A: Fireworks produce heat, light, and loud sounds. These are all signs of chemical change. You can learn how fireworks produce these signs of chemical change at this URL: URL ks.htm . Can Chemical Changes Be Reversed? Because chemical changes produce new substances, they often cannot be undone. For example, you can’t change ashes from burning logs back into wood. Some chemical changes can be reversed, but only by other chemical changes. For example, to undo tarnish on copper pennies, you can place them in vinegar. The acid in the vinegar combines with the copper oxide of the tarnish. This changes the copper oxide back to copper and oxygen, making the pennies reddish brown again. You can try this at home to see how well it works. 
Summary 	  • A chemical change occurs whenever matter changes into an entirely different substance with different chemical properties. Burning is an example of a chemical change. • Signs of chemical change include the release of bubbles, a change of color, production of an odor, release of heat and light, and production of loud sounds. • Because chemical changes result in different substances, they often cannot be undone. Some chemical changes can be reversed, but only by other chemical changes. Chemical changes always result in new substances forming. Physical changes do not. Do the interactive lab at the following URL to see if you can identify the chemical changes. URL • Describe an example of mass remaining the same in a change of matter. • State the law of conservation of mass. If you build a campfire like this one, you start with a big pile of logs. As the fire burns, the pile of logs slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that’s left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the fire? Where’s the Matter? It may seem as though burning destroys matter, but the same amount, or mass, of matter still exists after a campfire as before. Look at the sketch in Figure 2.18. It shows that when wood burns, it combines with oxygen and changes not only to ashes but also to carbon dioxide and water vapor. The gases float off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Suppose you had measured the mass of the wood before it burned and the mass of the ashes after it burned. Also suppose you had been able to measure the oxygen used by the fire and the gases produced by the fire. What would you find? The total mass of matter after the fire would be the same as the total mass of matter before the fire. Q: What can you infer from this example? A: You can infer that burning does not destroy matter. It just changes matter into different substances. 
Law of  Conservation of  Mass 	  This burning campfire example illustrates a very important law in science: the law of conservation of mass. This law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Even when matter goes through a physical or chemical change, the total mass of matter always remains the same. Q: How could you show that the mass of matter remains the same when matter changes state? Burning is a chemical process. A: You could find the mass of a quantity of liquid water. Then you could freeze the water and find the mass of the ice. The mass before and after freezing would be the same, showing that mass is conserved when matter changes state. 
Summary 	  • Burning and other changes in matter do not destroy matter. The mass of matter is always the same before and after the changes occur. • The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. At the following URL, apply the law of conservation of mass to a scene from a Harry Potter film. Then answer the questions below.

The striking blue walls in this photo are actually the sheer ice walls of a massive glacier. The glacier in the picture is in Argentina, and the bluish water in the foreground is Lake Argentina. The photo represents an important concept in physical science. Can you guess what it is? 
Water,  Water  Everywhere 	  The photo above represents water in three common states of matter. States of matter are different phases in which any given type of matter can exist. There are actually four well-known states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Plasma isn’t represented in the iceberg photo, but the other three states of matter are. The iceberg itself consists of water in the solid state, and the lake consists of water in the liquid state. Q: Where is water in the gaseous state in the above photo? A: You can’t see the gaseous water, but it’s there. It exists as water vapor in the air. Q: Water is one of the few substances that commonly exist on Earth in more than one state. Many other substances typically exist only in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state. Can you think of examples of matter that usually exists in just one of these three states? A: Just look around you and you will see many examples of matter that usually exists in the solid state. They include soil, rock, wood, metal, glass, and plastic. Examples of matter that usually exist in the liquid state include cooking oil, gasoline, and mercury, which is the only metal that commonly exists as a liquid. Examples of matter that usually exists in the gaseous state include oxygen and nitrogen, which are the chief gases in Earth’s atmosphere. 
Phases  Are  Physical 	  A given kind of matter has the same chemical makeup and the same chemical properties regardless of its state. That’s because state of matter is a physical property. As a result, when matter changes state, it doesn’t become a different kind of substance. For example, water is still water whether it exists as ice, liquid water, or water vapor. 
Properties of  Solids,  Liquids, and  Gases 	  The most common states of matter on Earth are solids, liquids, and gases. How do these states of matter differ? Their properties are contrasted in the Figure 2.19. You can also watch videos about these three states of matter at the following URLs. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Properties of matter in different states. Q: The Figure 2.20 shows that a liquid takes the shape of its container. How could you demonstrate this? A: You could put the same volume of liquid in containers with different shapes. This is illustrated below with a beaker (left) and a graduated cylinder (right). The shape of the liquid in the beaker is short and wide like the beaker, while the shape of the liquid in the graduated cylinder is tall and narrow like that container, but each container holds the same volume of liquid. Q: How could you show that a gas spreads out to take the volume as well as the shape of its container? A: You could pump air into a bicycle tire. The tire would become firm all over as air molecules spread out to take the shape of the tire and also to occupy the entire volume of the tire. 
Summary 	  • States of matter are different phases in which any given type of matter can exist. There are four well-known states of matter—solid, liquid, gas, and plasma—but only the first three states are common on Earth. • State of matter is a physical property of matter. A given kind of matter has the same chemical makeup and the same chemical properties, regardless of state. • Solids have a fixed volume and a fixed shape. Liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container. Gases take both the volume and the shape of their container. Use the following resource to answer the questions that follow. • States of Matter at URL . • Identify properties of matter in the solid state. • Compare crystalline and amorphous solids. What do you think this picture shows? Could it be a delicate glass sculpture created by a talented artist? It’s delicate alright, but it’s not glass, nor was it created by an artist. It’s actually made of ice and it’s a work of nature. Now can you guess what it is? It’s a snowflake, as viewed under a microscope. 
Snowflakes and  Other  Solids 	  A snowflake is made of ice, or water in the solid state. A solid is one of four well-known states of matter. The other three states are liquid, gas, and plasma. Compared with these other states of matter, solids have particles that are much more tightly packed together. The particles are held rigidly in place by all the other particles around them so they can’t slip past one another or move apart. This gives solids a fixed shape and a fixed volume. 
Types of  Solids 	  Not all solids are alike. Some are crystalline solids; others are amorphous solids. Snowflakes are crystalline solids. Particles of crystalline solids are arranged in a regular repeating pattern, as you can see in the sketch in Figure 2.21. The repeating particles form a geometric shape called a crystal. You can watch a snowflake crystal forming at the following URL: URL . Another crystalline solid is table salt (sodium chloride). Crystals of table salt are pictured in the Figure 2.21. Amorphous means “shapeless.” Particles of amorphous solids are arranged more-or-less at random and do not form crystals, as you can see in the Figure 2.22. An example of an amorphous solid is cotton candy, also shown in the Q: Look at the quartz rock and plastic bag pictured in the Figure 2.23. Which type of solid do you think each of them is? A: The quartz is a crystalline solid. Rocks are made of minerals and minerals form crystals. You can see their geometric shapes. The bag is an amorphous solid. It is made of the plastic and most plastics do not form crystals. 
Summary 	  • A solid is a state of matter in which particles of matter are tightly packed together. This holds the particles rigidly in place and gives solids a fixed shape and fixed volume. • Crystalline solids have particles that are arranged in a regular repeating pattern. They form crystals. Amorphous solids have particles that are arranged more-or-less at random. They do not form crystals. At the following URL, read the article about solids. Then answer the questions below.

Colored by lights at night, an incredible amount of water plunges continuously over the sheer rock wall of Niagara Falls. If you stand close to the falls, the roar of the water is almost deafening, and the rushing water drenches you with spray. No wonder Niagara Falls was once named one of the seven natural wonders of the world! It’s amazing how such a common substance—water—can be so impressive. 
Water and  Other  Liquids 	  Water is the most common substance on Earth, and most of it exists in the liquid state. A liquid is one of four well-known states of matter, along with solid, gas, and plasma states. The particles of liquids are in close contact with each other but not as tightly packed as the particles in solids. The particles can slip past one another and take the shape of their container. However, they cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container, as particles of a gas can. If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container, the top surface of the liquid will be exposed to the air, like the vinegar in the bottle pictured in the Figure 2.25. Q: Why does most water on Earth’s surface exist in a liquid state? In what other states does water exist on Earth? A: Almost 97 percent of water on Earth’s surface is found as liquid salt water in the oceans. The temperature over most of Earth’s surface is above the freezing point (0°C) of water, so relatively little water exists as ice. Even near the poles, most of the water in the oceans is above the freezing point. And in very few places on Earth’s surface do temperatures reach the boiling point (100°C) of water. Although water exists in the atmosphere in a gaseous state, water vapor makes up less than 1 percent of Earth’s total water. 
Surface  Tension and  Viscosity 	  Two unique properties of liquids are surface tension and viscosity. Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles. Surface tension explains why water forms droplets, like the water droplet that has formed on the leaky faucet pictured in the Figure 2.26. You can learn more about surface tension at this URL: URL . Water drips from a leaky faucet. Viscosity is a liquid’s resistance to flowing. You can think of it as friction between particles of liquid. Thicker liquids are more viscous than thinner liquids. For example, the honey pictured in the Figure 2.27 is more viscous than the vinegar. You can learn more about viscosity at this URL: URL m-Textbook/Viscosity-840.html . Q: Which liquid do you think is more viscous: honey or chocolate syrup? A: The viscosity of honey and chocolate syrup vary by brand and other factors, but chocolate syrup generally is more viscous than honey. 
Summary 	  • A liquid is a state of matter in which particles can slip past one another and take the shape of their container. However, the particles cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container. • Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles. Viscosity is a liquid’s resistance to flowing. Table 2.2 shows the viscosity of water at different temperatures. Use the data in the table to answer the questions below. The meaning of the units of viscosity is not necessary to appreciate the relationship between temperature and viscosity.

(Assume that the x-axis represents temperature and the y-axis represents viscosity.) if your prediction is correct. • Identify properties of gases. • Explain why gases exert pressure. • Describe how atmospheric pressure changes as altitude increases. A hiker pauses to view the impressive peak of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. At the top of Mount Everest, the air is very thin. Climbers may need oxygen tanks to get enough oxygen to breathe, even though oxygen is the second most plentiful gas in the atmosphere. What Is a Gas? A gas is one of four well-known states of matter. (The other three are solid, liquid, and plasma). The particles of a gas can pull apart from each other and spread out. As a result, a gas does not have a fixed shape or a fixed volume. In fact, a gas always spreads out to take up whatever space is available to it. If a gas is enclosed in a container, it spreads out until it has the same volume as the container. Q: The sketches in the Figure 2.29 represent two identical sealed boxes that contain only air particles (represented by dots). There are more air particles in box B than box A. Which box contains a greater volume of air? A: This is a trick question! The air inside each box expands to fill the available space, which is identical for both boxes. There are more air particles in box B, but the volume of air is exactly the same in both boxes. 
Pressure of  Gases 	  Particles of gas are constantly moving in all directions at random. As a result, they are always bumping into each other and other things. This is modeled in the Figure 2.30. The force of the particles against things they bump into creates pressure. Pressure is defined in physics as the amount of force pushing against a given area. How much pressure a gas exerts depends on the number of gas particles in a given space and how fast they are moving. The more gas particles there are and the faster they are moving, the greater the pressure they create. To learn more about gas pressure and how to measure it, go to this URL: URL H5004 . 
The arrows show that particles of a gas 	  move randomly in all directions. Q: Look at box A and box B in the previous question. Is air pressure the same in both boxes? Why or why not? A: Air pressure is greater in box B. That’s because there are more air particles in box B to bump into each other and into the sides of the container. Therefore, the particles in box B exert more force on a given area. 
Pressure in the  Atmosphere 	  We live in a “sea” of air called the atmosphere. Can you feel the air in the atmosphere pressing against you? Not usually, but air actually exerts a lot of pressure because there’s so much of it. The atmosphere rises high above Earth’s surface, so it contains a huge number of gas particles. Most of them are concentrated close to Earth’s surface because of gravity and the weight of all the air in the atmosphere above them. As a result, air pressure is greatest at sea level and drops rapidly as you go higher in altitude. The Figure 2.31 shows how air pressure falls from sea level to the top of the atmosphere. In the graph, air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar (mb). The SI unit of pressure is newton per square centimeter (N/cm2). Q: The top of Mount Everest is almost 9 km above sea level. What is the pressure of the atmosphere at this altitude? A: Air pressure at the top of Mount Everest is about 260 mb. This is only about 25 percent of air pressure at sea level, which is 1013.2 mb. No wonder it’s hard for climbers to breathe when they get close to Mount Everest’s summit! 
Summary 	  • Gas is a state of matter in which particles of matter can pull apart from each other and spread out. As a result, a gas does not have a fixed shape or a fixed volume. • Gas particles are constantly moving and bumping into things, and this creates force. The amount of force pushing against a given area is called pressure. • The pressure of gases in the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases rapidly as altitude increases. Examine this sequence of photos in the Figure 2.32, and then answer the questions below. altitude instructions, like those on the label below. Explain why. • State properties of matter in the plasma state. • Identify where plasma is found. This glowing sphere is matter in a particular state. You’re probably familiar with the states of matter most common on Earth—solid, liquid, and gas. But the glowing sphere is a state of matter called plasma. The plasma ball pictured above was made by humans, but plasma is also found in nature. In fact, plasma makes up most of the matter in the universe. What Is Plasma? Plasma is a state of matter that resembles a gas but has certain properties that gases do not have. Like a gas, plasma consists of particles of matter than can pull apart and spread out, so it lacks a fixed volume and a fixed shape. Unlike a gas, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to a magnetic field. That’s because plasma consists of electrically charged particles called ions, instead of uncharged particles such as atoms or molecules. This gives plasma other interesting properties as well. For example, plasma glows with colored light when electricity passes through it. You can learn more about plasma at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Where Is Plasma Found? The sun and other stars consist of plasma. Plasma is also found naturally in lightning and in the northern and southern lights. If you’ve never seen these shimmering colorful lights in the winter night sky, the Figure 2.33 shows what they can look like. Human-made plasmas are found in fluorescent lights, plasma TV screens, and plasma spheres like the one pictured in the opening image. Northern lights. Q: Besides the northern lights, where are other examples of plasma in this picture? A: The stars consist of plasma. Q: What properties of plasma do you think explain why this state of matter is used in artificial lights? A: Plasma consists of charged particles called ions, so it conducts electric current and glows when electricity passes through it. These properties explain why plasma is used in artificial lights. 
Summary 	  • Plasma is a state of matter that lacks a fixed volume and a fixed shape and consists of charged particles called ions. Because it consists of charged particles, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to a magnetic field. • The sun and other stars consist of plasma. Plasma is also found naturally in lightning and the northern and southern lights. Human-made plasma is found in fluorescent lights, plasma TV screens, and plasma spheres. Read the article about plasma at the following URL, and then answer the questions below. URL • State the kinetic theory of matter. • Relate kinetic energy to state of matter. This neat row of cola bottles represents matter in three different states—solid, liquid, and gas. The bottles and caps are solids, the cola is a liquid, and carbon dioxide dissolved in the cola is a gas. It gives cola its fizz. Solids, liquids, and gases such as these have different properties. Solids have a fixed shape and a fixed volume. Liquids also have a fixed volume but can change their shape. Gases have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume. What explains these differences in states of matter? The answer has to do with energy. 
Moving  Matter 	  Energy is the ability to cause changes in matter. For example, your body uses chemical energy when you lift your arm or take a step. In both cases, energy is used to move matter—you. Any matter that is moving has energy just because it’s moving. The energy of moving matter is called kinetic energy. Scientists think that the particles of all matter are in constant motion. In other words, the particles of matter have kinetic energy. The theory that all matter consists of constantly moving particles is called the kinetic theory of matter. You can learn more about the theory at this URL: URL . 
Kinetic  Energy and  States of  Matter 	  Differences in kinetic energy explain why matter exists in different states. Particles of matter are attracted to each other, so they tend to pull together. The particles can move apart only if they have enough kinetic energy to overcome this force of attraction. It’s like a tug of war between opposing sides, with the force of attraction between particles on one side and the kinetic energy of individual particles on the other side. The outcome of the “war” determines the state of matter. • If particles do not have enough kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction between them, matter exists as a solid. The particles are packed closely together and held rigidly in place. All they can do is vibrate. This explains why solids have a fixed volume and a fixed shape. • If particles have enough kinetic energy to partly overcome the force of attraction between them, matter exists as a liquid. The particles can slide past one another but not pull apart completely. This explains why liquids can change shape but have a fixed volume. • If particles have enough kinetic energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them, matter exists as a gas. The particles can pull apart and spread out. This explains why gases have neither a fixed volume nor a fixed shape. Look at the Figure 2.35. It sums up visually the relationship between kinetic energy and state of matter. You can see an animated diagram at this URL: URL Q: How could you use a bottle of cola to demonstrate these relationships between kinetic energy and state of matter? A: You could shake a bottle of cola and then open it. Shaking causes carbon dioxide to come out of the cola solution and change to a gas. The gas fizzes out of the bottle and spreads into the surrounding air, showing that its particles have enough kinetic energy to spread apart. Then you could tilt the open bottle and pour out a small amount of the cola on a table, where it will form a puddle. This shows that particles of the liquid have enough kinetic energy to slide over each other but not enough to pull apart completely. If you do nothing to the solid glass of the cola bottle, it will remain the same size and shape. Its particles do not have enough energy to move apart or even to slide over each other. 
Summary 	  • According to the kinetic theory, particles of matter are in constant motion. The energy of motion is called kinetic energy. • The kinetic energy of particles of matter determines the state of matter. Particles of solids have the least kinetic energy and particles of gases have the most. Watch the video below (URL ) and then answer the questions that follow.

Questions 	  • Define change of state. • Identify processes that cause changes of state. • Explain the role of energy in changes of state. Both of these photos show the famous Golden Gate Bridge near San Francisco, California. The pictures were taken from about the same point of view, but they look very different. In the picture on the left, the deck of the bridge is almost completely hidden by a thick layer of fog. In the picture on the right the fog has disappeared, and the deck of the bridge—as well as the water below it—is clearly visible. Fog consists of tiny droplets of liquid water. The fog in the picture is like a cloud at ground level. Where did the fog come from, and where did it go? What Are Changes of State? The water droplets of fog form from water vapor in the air. Fog disappears when the water droplets change back to water vapor. These changes are examples of changes of state. A change of state occurs whenever matter changes from one state to another. Common states of matter on Earth are solid, liquid, and gas. Matter may change back and forth between any two of these states. Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not change matter’s chemical makeup or chemical properties. For example, when fog changes to water vapor, it is still water and can change back to liquid water again. 
Processes that  Cause  Changes of  State 	  Several processes are involved in common changes of state. They include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and evaporation. The Figure 2.36 shows how matter changes in each of these processes. Q: Which two processes result in matter changing to the solid state? A: The processes are deposition, in which matter changes from a gas to a solid, and freezing, in which matter changes from a liquid to a solid. 
The  Role of  Energy in  Changes of  State 	  Suppose that you leave some squares of chocolate candy in the hot sun. A couple of hours later, you notice that the chocolate has turned into a puddle like the one pictured in the Figure 2.37. Q: What happened to the chocolate? A: The chocolate melted. It changed from a solid to a liquid. In order for solid chocolate to melt and change to a liquid, the particles of chocolate must gain energy. The chocolate pictured in the Figure 2.37 gained energy from sunlight. Energy is the ability to cause changes in matter, and it is always involved in changes of state. When matter changes from one state to another, it either absorbs energy—as when chocolate melts—or loses energy. For example, if you were to place the melted chocolate in a refrigerator, it would lose energy to the cold air inside the refrigerator. As a result, the liquid chocolate would change to a solid again. Q: Why is energy always involved in changes of state? A: The energy of particles of matter determines the matter’s state. Particles of a gas have more energy than particles of a liquid, and particles of a liquid have more energy than particles of a solid. Therefore, in order for matter to change from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas, particles of matter must absorb energy. In order for matter to change from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, particles of matter must lose energy. 
Summary 	  • A change of state occurs whenever matter changes from one state to another. Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not change matter’s chemical makeup or chemical properties. • Processes involved in changes of state include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and evaporation. • Energy is always involved in changes of state. Particles of matter either absorb or lose energy when matter changes from one state to another. Take the changing states quiz at the following URL. Be sure to check your answers. URL • Describe what happens to the particles of matter when it freezes. • Define freezing point, and state the freezing point of water. The man in this photo is climbing a glacier. Ice climbing is a dangerous sport that should be attempted only by highly experienced climbers. For one thing, ice is very slippery, which makes it harder than rock to grip. Clinging to the slippery vertical surface takes strength, training, and the right equipment. 
From  Liquid to  Solid 	  You don’t have to be an ice climber to enjoy ice. Skating and fishing are two other sports that are also done on ice. What is ice? It’s simply water in the solid state. The process in which water or any other liquid changes to a solid is called freezing. Freezing occurs when a liquid cools to a point at which its particles no longer have enough energy to overcome the force of attraction between them. Instead, the particles remain in fixed positions, crowded closely together, as shown in the Figure 2.38. 
Freezing  Point 	  The temperature at which a substance freezes is known as its freezing point. Freezing point is a physical property of matter. The freezing point of pure water is 0°C. Below this temperature, water exists as ice. Above this temperature, it exists as liquid water or water vapor. Many other substances have much lower or higher freezing points than water. You can see some examples in the Table 2.3. The freezing point of pure water is included in the table for comparison. 
Carbon 	  Freezing Point (°C) -272 -222 -210 Q: What trend do you see in this table? A: Substances in the table with freezing points lower than water are gases. Substances in the table with freezing points higher than water are solids. Q: Sodium is a solid at room temperature. Given this information, what can you infer about its freezing point? A: You can infer that the freezing point of sodium must be higher than room temperature, which is about 20°C. The freezing point of sodium is actually 98°C. 
Summary 	  • Freezing is the process in which a liquid changes to a solid. It occurs when a liquid cools to a point at which its particles no longer have enough energy to overcome the force of attraction between them. • The freezing point of a substance is the temperature at which it freezes. The freezing point of pure water is Road crews put salt on icy roads, and salt is also used to make ice cream. Do you know why? Read the article at the following URL to find out, and then answer the questions below. URL • Describe what happens to particles of matter when it melts. • Define melting point, and state the melting point of ice. The fiery red-orange “river” flowing downhill in this photo isn’t water. It’s molten (melted) rock, and it’s erupting from a volcano. Most rocks on Earth’s surface are solid objects. Why is the rock that erupts from a volcano in a liquid state? How does rock change from a solid to a liquid? 
From  Solid to  Liquid 	  The process in which rocks or other solids change to liquids is called melting. Melting occurs when particles of a solid absorb enough energy to partly overcome the force of attraction holding them together. This allows them to move out of their fixed positions and slip over one another. Melting, like other changes of state, is a physical change in matter, so it doesn’t change the chemical makeup or chemical properties of matter. Q: The molten rock that erupts from a volcano comes from deep underground. How is this related to its liquid state? A: It is always very hot deep underground where molten rock originates. The high temperatures give rock enough energy to melt and remain in a molten state. Underground rock in this state is called magma. Q: What happens to magma after it erupts and starts flowing over the surface of the ground? A: After magma erupts, it is called lava. On the surface, lava eventually cools and hardens to form solid rock. Other substances that are normally solids on Earth can also be heated until they melt. You can see an example in the Figure 2.39. The photo shows molten gold being poured into a mold. When the gold cools, it will harden into a solid gold bar that has the same shape as the mold. 
Melting  Point 	  The temperature at which a substance melts is called its melting point. Melting point is a physical property of matter. The gold pictured in the Figure 2.39, for example, has a melting point of 1064°C. This is a high melting point, and most other metals also have high melting points. The melting point of ice, in comparison, is much lower at 0°C. Many substances have even lower melting points. For example, the melting point of oxygen is -222°C. 
Melting and  Global  Climate  Change 	  Because of global climate change, temperatures all over Earth are rising. However, the melting points of Earth’s substances, including ice, are constant. The result? Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate. Melting glaciers cause rising sea levels and the risk of dangerous river flooding on land. You can learn more about these effects of melting at this URL: URL glacier-melt.html . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • Melting occurs when particles of a solid absorb enough energy to partly overcome the force of attraction holding them together. This allows them to move out of their fixed positions and slip over one another, forming a liquid. • The temperature at which a substance melts is called its melting point. The melting point of ice is 0°C. An alloy is a mixture of a metal with one or more other substances. The following Table 2.4 lists melting points of two metals and three alloys that they form together. Examine the table and then answer the questions below. 
Metal or  Alloy 	  Iridium metal (pure) Platinum metal (pure) Platinum-iridium alloy (15% iridium) Platinum-iridium alloy (10% iridium) Platinum-iridium alloy (5% iridium) Melting Point (°C) relative to the melting points of the metals they contain? copper is 1084°C, and the melting point of tin is 232°C. What might be a reasonable prediction for the melting point of bronze? • Describe how vaporization occurs. • Contrast vaporization and evaporation. • Define boiling point, and give the boiling point of water. Why is steam rising from the spring in this picture? It’s because the water is boiling hot. The bubbles in the water show that it is boiling. The water in the spring is hot enough to boil because it comes from an underground source near hot molten rock. 
All  Steamed  Up 	  Steam actually consists of tiny droplets of liquid water. What you can’t see in the picture is the water vapor that is also present in the air above the spring. Water vapor is water in the gaseous state. It constantly rises up from the surface of boiling hot water. Why? At high temperatures, particles of a liquid gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them, so they change to a gas. The gas forms bubbles that rise to the surface of the liquid because gas is less dense than liquid. The bubbling up of the liquid is called boiling. When the bubbles reach the surface, the gas escapes into the air. The entire process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas that escapes into the air is called vaporization. You can watch an animation of the process at this URL: URL ww.visionlearning.com/img/app/library/objects/Flash/VLObject-321-030317040343.swf Q: Why does steam form over the hot spring pictured above? A: Steam forms when some of the water vapor from the boiling water cools in the air and condenses to form droplets of liquid water. 
Vaporization vs.  Evaporation 	  Vaporization is easily confused with evaporation, but the two processes are not the same. Evaporation also changes a liquid to a gas, but it doesn’t involve boiling. Instead, evaporation occurs when particles at the surface of a liquid gain enough energy to escape into the air. This happens without the liquid becoming hot enough to boil. 
Boiling  Point 	  The temperature at which a substance boils and changes to a gas is called its boiling point. Boiling point is a physical property of matter. The boiling point of pure water is 100°C. Other substances may have higher or lower boiling points. Several examples are listed in the Table 2.5. Pure water is included in the table for comparison. 
Sodium chloride 	  Boiling Point (°C) -253 -196 -79 -36 Q: Assume you want to get the salt (sodium chloride) out of salt water. Based on information in the table, how could you do it? A: You could heat the salt water to 101°C. The water would boil and vaporize but the salt would not. Instead, the salt would be left behind as solid particles. Q: Oxygen is a gas at room temperature (20°C). What does this tell you about its boiling point? A: The boiling point of oxygen must be lower than 20°C. Otherwise, it would be a liquid at room temperature. 
Summary 	  • Vaporization is the process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas. • Vaporization is easily confused with evaporation, but evaporation doesn’t involve boiling. • The temperature at which a liquid boils and starts changing to a gas is called its boiling point.

How is this likely to affect the boiling point of water? starts boiling and turning to water vapor. The pot becomes very hot but otherwise appears to be unchanged by the increase in temperature. Based on these observations, what can you conclude about the boiling point of aluminum? • Define evaporation, and describe how it occurs. • Identify factors that affect the rate of evaporation. • Explain evaporative cooling. The clothes on this clothesline are soaking wet, but before too long they will be completely dry. How does this happen? Where does the water go? And what factors might help the clothes on the line dry more quickly? 
From  Liquid to  Gas  Without  Boiling 	  Evaporation explains why clothes dry on a clothesline. Evaporation is the process in which a liquid changes to a gas without becoming hot enough to boil. It occurs when individual liquid particles at the exposed surface of the liquid absorb just enough energy to overcome the force of attraction with other liquid particles. If the surface particles are moving in the right direction, they will pull away from the liquid and move into the air. This is illustrated in the 
Factors  That  Affect the  Rate of  Evaporation 	  Many factors influence how quickly a liquid evaporates. They include: • temperature of the liquid. A cup of hot water will evaporate more quickly than a cup of cold water. • exposed surface area of the liquid. The same amount of water will evaporate more quickly in a wide shallow bowl than in a tall narrow glass. • presence or absence of other substances in the liquid. Pure water will evaporate more quickly than salt water. • air movement. Clothes on a clothesline will dry more quickly on a windy day than on a still day. • concentration of the evaporating substance in the air. Clothes will dry more quickly when air contains little water vapor. With the interactive animation at the URL below, you can explore how three of these factors affect the rate of evaporation of water. URL 
Evaporative  Cooling 	  Did you ever notice that moving air cools you down when you’re hot and sweaty? For example, if you sit in front of a fan, you feel cooler. That’s because moving air helps to evaporate the sweat on your skin. But why does the evaporation of sweat cool you down? When a liquid such as sweat evaporates, energetic particles on the surface of the liquid escape into the air. After these particles leave, the remaining liquid has less energy, so it is cooler. This is called evaporative cooling. Q: On a hot day, high humidity makes you feel even hotter. Can you explain why? A: Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. When humidity is high, sweat evaporates more slowly because there is already a lot of water vapor in the air. The slower evaporation rate reduces the potential for evaporative cooling. 
Summary 	  • Evaporation is the process in which a liquid changes to a gas without becoming hot enough to boil. It occurs only at the exposed surface of a liquid. • Many factors affect how quickly a liquid evaporates, including the temperature of the liquid and air movement. • When particles evaporate from the surface of a liquid, the remaining liquid is cooler because it has less energy. This is called evaporative cooling. Evaporation plays an important role in the water cycle, which recycles Earth’s water. Explore the water cycle with the interactive animation at the following URL. Then answer the questions below. URL electric fan, aims it at the floor, and turns it on. Do you think this will help the floor dry faster? Why or why not? • Describe how condensation occurs. • Relate dew point to condensation. • Identify the role of condensation in the water cycle. This beautiful beaded net is something very common in nature: a spider web. The “beads” on the spider web are actually drops of water. The drops of water are not raindrops, and they weren’t there on the previous day. Where did they come from? 
From  Gas to  Liquid 	  The drops of water on the spider web are dewdrops. They formed overnight when warm moist air came into contact with the cooler spider web. Contact with the cooler web cooled the air. When air cools, it can hold less water vapor, so some of the water vapor in the air changed to liquid water. The process in which water vapor—or another gas—changes to a liquid is called condensation. Another common example of condensation is pictured in the 
Dew  Point 	  When air is very humid, it doesn’t have to cool very much for water vapor in the air to start condensing. The temperature at which condensation occurs is called the dew point. The dew point varies depending on air temperature and moisture content. It is always less than or equal to the actual air temperature, but warmer air and moister air have dew points closer to the actual air temperature. That’s why glasses of cold drinks “sweat” more on a hot, humid day than they do on a cool, dry day.

This 	  left behind by a (condensation trail) jet. Water vapor in its exhaust gases condensed on dust particles in the air. Q: What happens when air temperature reaches the dew point? A: When air temperature reaches the dew point, water vapor starts condensing. It may form dew (as on the spider web in the opening image), clouds, or fog. Dew forms on solid objects on the ground. Clouds form on tiny particles in the air high above the ground. Fog is a cloud that forms on tiny particles in the air close to the ground. 
Condensation and the  Water  Cycle 	  The water cycle continuously recycles Earth’s water. Condensation plays an important role in this cycle. Find condensation in the water cycle Figure 2.44. It changes water vapor in the atmosphere to liquid water that can fall to Earth again. Without condensation, the water cycle would be interrupted and Earth’s water could not recycle. Q: In the water cycle, what happens to water after it condenses? A: After water condenses, it may form clouds that produce precipitation such as rain. 
Summary 	  • The process in which water vapor or any other gas changes to a liquid is called condensation. • The temperature at which condensation of water vapor occurs is called the dew point. The dew point varies depending on air temperature and moisture content. • Condensation plays an important role in the water cycle. Without it, Earth’s water could not recycle.

Rock bands often use special stage effects, like the fake fog in this picture. Real fog forms when water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of water. The fake fog shown here formed when solid carbon dioxide changed directly to carbon dioxide gas. How Sublime! Solid carbon dioxide is also called dry ice. That’s because when it gets warmer and changes state, it doesn’t change to a liquid by melting. Instead, it changes directly to a gas without going through the liquid state. The process in which a solid changes directly to a gas is called sublimation. It occurs when energy is added to a solid such as dry ice. You can watch dry ice changing directly to a gas in the video at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: Alyssa’s mom put some mothballs in her closet in the spring to keep moths away from her wool clothes. By autumn, the mothballs were much smaller. What happened to them? A: Mothballs are made of naphthalene, a substance that undergoes sublimation at room temperature. The solid mothballs slowly changed to a gas during the summer months, explaining why they were much smaller by autumn. 
Sublimation of  Snow and  Ice 	  Snow and ice may also undergo sublimation under certain conditions. This is most likely to happen where there is intense sunlight, very cold temperatures, and dry winds. These conditions are often found on mountain peaks. As snow sublimates, it gradually shrinks without any runoff of liquid water. At the URL below, you can watch a time-lapse video showing sublimation of snow on the highest mountain in the Andes.

Summary 	  • Sublimation is the process in which a solid changes directly to a gas without going through the liquid state. Solid carbon dioxide is an example of a substance that undergoes sublimation. • Snow and ice undergo sublimation under certain conditions. This is most likely to happen where there is intense sunlight, very cold temperatures, and dry winds. Read the short article about sublimation at the following URL. Be sure to examine the two graphs comparing changes of state in water and carbon dioxide. Then answer the questions below. URL after the holes in the top of the container are opened. Explain why this occurs. • Define the change of state called deposition • Describe examples of deposition in nature. The leaf-like pattern on the glass pictured here is as beautiful as any work of art. It formed on a windowpane on a very cold winter night. Do you know how it formed? The answer is deposition. What Is Deposition? Deposition refers to the process in which a gas changes directly to a solid without going through the liquid state. For example, when warm moist air inside a house comes into contact with a freezing cold windowpane, water vapor in the air changes to tiny ice crystals. The ice crystals are deposited on the glass, often in beautiful patterns like the “leaves” on the window above. Be aware that deposition has a different meaning in Earth science than in chemistry. In Earth science, deposition refers to the dropping of sediments by wind or water, rather than to a change of state. 
Examples of  Deposition in  Nature 	  Deposition as a change of state often occurs in nature. For example, when warm moist air comes into contact with very cold surfaces—such as the ground or objects on the ground—ice crystals are deposited on them. These ice crystals are commonly called frost. Look at the dead leaf and blades of grass in the Figure 2.46. They are covered with frost. If you look closely, you can see the individual crystals of ice. You can watch a demonstration of frost forming on the side of a very cold can at the URL below. (Click on the mulitmedia choice “Ice on a Can.”). The ice in the can has been cooled to a very low temperature by adding salt to it. If you want to do the demonstration yourself, follow the procedure at the URL. URL Q: In places with very cold winters, why might frost be more likely to form on the ground in the fall than in the winter? A: Frost forms when the air is warmer than the ground. This is more likely to be the case in the fall. In the winter, the air is likely to be as cold as the ground. Deposition also occurs high above the ground when water vapor in the air changes to ice crystals. In the atmosphere, the ice crystals are deposited on tiny dust particles. These ice crystals form clouds, generally cirrus clouds, which are thin and wispy. You can see cirrus clouds in the Figure 2.47. Q: Cirrus clouds form only at altitudes of 6 kilometers or higher above sea level. Do you know why? A: At this altitude, the atmosphere is always very cold. Unless the air is cold, water vapor will condense to form water droplets instead of ice crystals. 
Summary 	  • In chemistry, deposition refers to the process in which a gas changes directly to a solid without going through the liquid state. • Examples of deposition in nature include frost forming on the ground and cirrus clouds forming high in the atmosphere.

Then he decided to let the car’s defroster do the work for him. What conditions caused the windshield to become covered with frost, and how does the defroster clear the frost from the windshield? • State how popping bubble wrap demonstrates Boyle’s law. • Explain why pressure goes up when gas molecules crowd into a smaller space. Are you one of those people who can’t resist popping the bubbles of bubble wrap? As annoying as it might be to the people around you, do you just love to squeeze those little plastic bubbles? Before the bubbles pop, the air pressing against the inside of the bubbles inflates them like tiny balloons. When you pop the bubbles, most of the air rushes out. Pop Goes the Bubble! What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law, if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles’ volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. “Father” Boyle Boyle’s law is named for Robert Boyle, the English scientist who discovered this relationship between gas volume and pressure. Boyle based the law on his own controlled experiments. He published his results, along with detailed descriptions of his procedures and observations, in the 1660s. These steps were unheard of in his day. Mainly because of his careful research and the details he provided about it, Boyle has been called the “father of modern chemistry.” 
It’s  Crowded in  Here 	  Imagine a container of gas molecules like the one in the Figure 2.49. The container in the sketch has a lid that can be pushed down to shrink the volume of the gas inside. Notice what happens as the lid is lowered. The gas molecules crowd closer together because there is less space for them to occupy and they have nowhere else to go. Gas molecules have a lot of energy. They are always moving and bouncing off each other and anything else in their path. When gas molecules bump into things, it creates pressure. Pressure is greater when gas molecules occupy a smaller space, because the greater crowding results in more collisions. In other words, decreasing the volume of a gas increases its pressure. If you go to the URL below, you can watch a simulation of this. URL 
You  Go  Up and  I’ll  Go  Down 	  As the volume of gas in the container pictured in the Figure 2.49 gets smaller, the pressure of the gas molecules becomes greater. When two variables change in opposite directions like this, the variables have an inverse, or “upside-down,” relationship. Q: How could you show an inverse relationship with a graph? Sketch a graph to show what the relationship between gas volume and pressure might look like. Let the x-axis represent volume (V) and the y-axis represent pressure (P). A: Did you sketch a graph like the one in the Figure 2.50? Let’s see why this graph is correct. Find the point on the line where volume is smallest. That’s were pressure is highest. Then find the point where volume is largest. That’s where pressure is lowest. Whenever you see a graph with this shape, it usually represents variables that have an inverse relationship, like gas volume and pressure. 
Summary 	  • Boyle’s law states that if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure. • When gas molecules bump into things, it creates pressure. Pressure is greater when gas molecules occupy a smaller space, because greater crowding results in more collisions. This explains why decreasing the volume of a gas increases its pressure. You can see for yourself that Boyle’s law really works. At the following URL, simulate measuring the volume and pressure of two different gases. Use the graphing tool to make graphs of your data. Then answer the questions at the end of the activity to see how well you understand Boyle’s law. URL squeeze the balloon with one hand, so there is less space inside it. Then assume you use both hands (and maybe a friend’s hands) to squeeze the balloon so there is even less space inside. What do you think will happen to the balloon if you keep squeezing it to a smaller and smaller volume? Explain your prediction. • Describe how the volume of a gas is related to its temperature. • Explain what happens to gas particles when they are heated. In the 1700s and 1800s, hot air balloons were very popular. Why wouldn’t they be? Riding in a hot air balloon allowed people to travel through the air and get a bird’s eye view of the landscape at a time when airplanes did not yet exist. Do you know why hot air can inflate a balloon? Read on to find out. 
Up,  Up, and  Away 	  The popularity of hot air balloons got scientists thinking about gases and what happens to them when they heat up. In the early 1800s, two French scientists—Jacques Charles and Joseph Gay-Lussac—decided to investigate how changes in the temperature of a gas affect the amount of space it takes up, or its volume. They heated air and measured how its volume changed. The two scientists already knew that the pressure of a gas affects it volume. This had been demonstrated back in the 1660s by the English scientist Robert Boyle. So Charles and Gay-Lussac controlled the effects of pressure by keeping it constant in their experiments. Based on the results of the research, Charles developed a scientific law about gases. It is one of three well-known gas laws, the others being Boyle’s law and Amontons’ law. According to Charles’ law, when the pressure of a gas is held constant, increasing its temperature increases its volume. The opposite is also true: decreasing the temperature of a gas decreases it volume. You Try It! At the URL below, you can simulate Charles’ and Gay-Lussac’s work. The simulation lets you choose different temperatures for a gas and see how it affects the volume of the gas. After you have recorded several sets of values in the data table, use the graphing feature to plot the points. URL Q: What does the graph of the data look like? A: The graph is a straight line that rises from left to right. This type of graph shows that both variables increase together at a constant rate. Q: Could you use the graph to find the volume of a gas at a temperature you didn’t choose for your data table? A: Yes, you could. You could find the temperature on the temperature scale, trace straight up from this point to the graph line, and then trace straight across to the volume scale to find the volume for that temperature. 
Amazing  Motion 	  Can you guess why the volume of a gas increases when it is heated? Heating a gas gives its particles more energy. With more energy, the particles move faster. You can see this in the simulation at the URL below. Drag the bar to increase the temperature, and you’ll be amazed at how fast the particles zigzag around inside the box! If the speedy particles had more room, they would spread out and the volume of the gas would increase. URL edu/UCB/AcademicAffairs/ArtsSciences/physics/PhysicsInitiative/Physics2000/bec/temperature.html Q: Now that you know how a gas behaves when it is heated, can you explain how hot air causes a balloon to inflate? A: As the air heats, its particles spread out and occupy more space, causing the balloon to inflate. 
Summary 	  • According to Charles’ law, when the pressure of a gas is held constant, increasing its temperature increases its volume. • Heating a gas gives its particles more energy so they move faster. If the speedy particles have room to spread out, the volume of the gas will increase. Do the activity on Charles’ law at the following URL. Be sure to answer the questions at the end of the activity. URL The outdoor temperature was 26°C. Then the boy took the balloons inside his air-conditioned house, where the temperature was 20°C. What do you think happened to the balloons after they had been inside the cool house for a while? Explain. • State Amontons’ law. • Explain why the pressure of a fixed volume of gas increases as the gas heats up. Lawrence checked the air pressure in one of his tires before driving to school on a cold winter day. The tire pressure gauge registered 32 pounds of force per square inch. After making the 10-mile trip to school, Lawrence checked the air pressure again. This time the gauge registered 34 pounds of force per square inch. Lawrence didn’t add any air to the tire in between the two measurements, so why did air pressure in the tire increase? 
Keep on  Rolling 	  There was no additional air in the tire the second time Lawrence checked the air pressure, but something did change between the two measurements. The tires had rolled over 10 miles of road on the trip to school. Any time one surface moves over another, it causes friction. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are touching, and friction between two surfaces always generates heat. Quickly rub your hands together and you’ll feel the heat generated by the friction between them. As the tires moved over the road, friction between the tires and road generated heat. In short, the tires got warmer and so did the air inside them. It’s the Law! The space inside a car tire is more-or-less fixed, so it has a constant volume. What happens when the volume of air is constant and its temperature increases? Lawrence found out the answer to that question when he measured the air pressure in his tire. Increasing the temperature of a gas such as air, while holding its volume constant, increases the pressure of the gas. This relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas is called Amontons’ law. It was first proposed by a French scientist named Guillaume Amontons in the late 1600s. Amontons’ gas law is just one of three commonly known gas laws. The other two are Boyle’s law and Charles’ law. Q: How does Amontons’ gas law explain the difference in air pressure in Lawrence’s tire? A: The tire—and the air inside it—got warmer because of friction with the road. The volume of air inside the tire was more-or-less constant, so the pressure of the air increased when it got warmer. 
Particle  Pressure 	  Why does the pressure of a gas increase as it gets warmer? Particles of a gas are constantly moving and bumping into things. The force of the collisions is measured by pressure. Pressure is the amount of force exerted on a given area, such as pounds of force per square inch. When gas particles heat up and gain energy, they move faster. This causes more collisions and greater pressure. Therefore, heating particles of gas in a closed space causes the pressure of the gas to increase. Explore the behavior of gas particles at different temperatures at the following URL. Change the temperature of the gas and watch what happens to its particles. URL Q: Look at the graph in the simulation above as you change the temperature of the gas. What happens to the pressure of the gas as its temperature increases? A: In the graph, the pressure of the gas increases as its temperature increases. 
Summary 	  • According to Amontons’ law, increasing the temperature of a gas while holding its volume constant increases the pressure of the gas. • When gas particles heat up and gain energy, they move faster. This increases their collisions with each other and their container, causing greater pressure. Watch the following simple demonstration, and then answer the questions below.

What could this hilly blue surface possibly be? Do you have any idea? The answer is a single atom of the element Cobalt. The picture was created using a scanning tunneling microscope. No other microscope can make images of things as small as atoms. How small are atoms? You will find out in this lesson. What Are Atoms? Atoms are the building blocks of matter. They are the smallest particles of an element that still have the element’s properties. Elements, in turn, are pure substances—such as nickel, hydrogen, and helium—that make up all kinds of matter. All the atoms of a given element are identical in that they have the same number of protons, one of the building blocks of atoms (see below). They are also different from the atoms of all other elements, as atoms of different elements have different number of protons.

Size of  Atoms 	  Unlike bricks, atoms are extremely small. The radius of an atom is well under 1 nanometer, which is one-billionth of a meter. If a size that small is hard to imagine, consider this: trillions of atoms would fit inside the period at the end of this sentence. Although all atoms are very small, elements vary in the size of their atoms. The Figure by chemical symbols, such as H for hydrogen and He for helium. Of course, real atoms are much smaller than the circles representing them in the Figure 2.54. Q: Which element in the Figure 2.54 has the biggest atoms? A: The element in the figure with the biggest atoms is cesium (Cs). 
Subatomic  Particles 	  Although atoms are very tiny, they consist of even smaller particles. Three main types of particles that make up all atoms are: • protons, which have a positive electric charge. • electrons, which have a negative electric charge. • neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge. The model in the Figure 2.55 shows how these particles are arranged in an atom. The particular atom represented by the model is helium, but the particles of all atoms are arranged in the same way. At the center of the atom is a dense area called the nucleus, where all the protons and neutrons are clustered closely together. The electrons constantly move around the nucleus. Helium has two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus and two electrons moving around the nucleus. Atoms of other elements have different numbers of subatomic particles, but the number of protons always equals the number of electrons. This makes atoms neutral in charge because the positive and negative charges “cancel out.” Model of a helium atom. Q: Lithium has three protons, four neutrons, and three electrons. Sketch a model of a lithium atom, similar to the model 2.55 for helium. A: Does your sketch resemble the model in the Figure 2.56? The model has three protons (blue) and four neutrons (gray) in the nucleus, with three electrons (red) moving around the nucleus. You can see an animated model of a lithium atom at this URL: URL . Q: All atoms of carbon have six protons. How many electrons do carbon atoms have? A: Carbon atoms must have six electrons to “cancel out” the positive charges of the six protons. That’s because atoms are always neutral in electric charge. 
Summary 	  • Atoms are the building blocks of matter. They are the smallest particles of an element that still have the element’s properties. • All atoms are very small, but atoms of different elements vary in size. • Three main types of particles that make up all atoms are protons, neutrons, and electrons.

An atomic bomb explodes and generates a huge mushroom cloud. The tremendous energy released when the bomb explodes is incredibly destructive. Where does all the energy come from? The answer is the nucleus of the atom. 
At the  Heart of  It  All 	  The nucleus (plural, nuclei) is a positively charged region at the center of the atom. It consists of two types of subatomic particles packed tightly together. The particles are protons, which have a positive electric charge, and neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge. Outside of the nucleus, an atom is mostly empty space, with orbiting negative particles called electrons whizzing through it. The Figure 2.57 shows these parts of the atom. 
Size and  Mass of the  Nucleus 	  The nucleus of the atom is extremely small. Its radius is only about 1/100,000 of the total radius of the atom. If an atom were the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a pea! You can see another sports analogy comparing the size of the nucleus and atom at this URL: URL (1:06) Click image to the left or use the URL below. Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of mass for their size. As a result, the nucleus has virtually all the mass of an atom. Given its great mass and tiny size, the nucleus is very dense. If an object the size of a penny had the same density as the nucleus of an atom, its mass would be greater than 30 million tons! You can learn more about the size and mass of the nucleus at this URL: URL (2:03) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Holding  It  All  Together 	  Particles with opposite electric charges attract each other. This explains why negative electrons orbit the positive nucleus. Particles with the same electric charge repel each other. This means that the positive protons in the nucleus push apart from one another. So why doesn’t the nucleus fly apart? An even stronger force—called the strong nuclear force—holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. You can learn more about these forces in the nucleus by watching the video at this URL: URL (6:27) Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: Can you guess why an atomic bomb releases so much energy when it explodes? A: When an atomic bomb explodes, the nuclei of atoms undergo a process called fission, in which they split apart. This releases the huge amount of energy that was holding together subatomic particles in the nucleus. 
Summary 	  • The nucleus is a small, dense region at the center of the atom. It consists of positive protons and neutral neutrons, so it has an overall positive charge. • The nucleus is just a tiny part of the atom, but it contains virtually all of the atom’s mass. • The strong nuclear force holds together protons and neutrons in the nucleus and overcomes the electric force of repulsion between protons.

How is the gigantic sun related to the extremely tiny proton? Read on to find out. What Is a Proton? A proton is one of three main particles that make up the atom. The other two particles are the neutron and electron. Protons are found in the nucleus of the atom. This is a tiny, dense region at the center of the atom. Protons have a positive electrical charge of one (+1) and a mass of 1 atomic mass unit (amu), which is about 1.67 × 10−27 kilograms. Together with neutrons, they make up virtually all of the mass of an atom.

A: The sun’s tremendous energy is the result of proton interactions. In the sun, as well as in other stars, protons from hydrogen atoms combine, or fuse, to form nuclei of helium atoms. This fusion reaction releases a huge amount of energy and takes place in nature only at the extremely high temperatures of stars such as the sun. 
Identical  Protons,  Different  Elements 	  All protons are identical. For example, hydrogen protons are exactly the same as protons of helium and all other elements, or pure substances. However, atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons. In fact, atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all other elements. For example, a hydrogen atom has just one proton, whereas a helium atom has two protons. The number of protons in an atom determines the electrical charge of the nucleus. The nucleus also contains neutrons, but they are neutral in charge. The one proton in a hydrogen nucleus, for example, gives it a charge of +1, and the two protons in a helium nucleus give it a charge of +2. To learn more about the relationship between protons and elements, go to this URL: URL (1:57) Q: There are six protons in each atom of carbon. What is the electrical charge of a carbon nucleus? A: The electrical charge of a carbon nucleus is +6. What Are Protons Made of? Protons are made of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons. As you can see in the Figure 2.58, a proton contains three quarks (colored circles) and three streams of gluons (wavy white lines). Two of the quarks are called up quarks (u), and the third quark is called a down quark (d). The gluons carry the strong nuclear force between quarks, binding them together. This force is needed to overcome the electric force of repulsion between positive protons. Although protons were discovered almost 100 years ago, the quarks and gluons inside them were discovered much more recently. Scientists are still learning more about these fundamental particles. You can take an animated tour of the atom, including protons and their fundamental particles, at this URL: URL g/atomtour/index.html .

The arrow in this photo is pointing to a star that doesn’t look like much compared with some of the other stars in the picture. It’s certainly much smaller than most other stars. In fact, it’s only about 20 kilometers in diameter. Compare that with the 1.4-million-kilometer diameter of our own sun. Despite its small size, however, this star has greater mass than the sun, making it incredibly dense. It also has tremendous gravity. In fact, gravity on its surface is about consists solely of neutrons. You can learn more about these fascinating stars at the URL below. You will read about neutrons in this article. URL What Is a Neutron? A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom. The other two particles are the proton and electron. Atoms of all elements—except for most atoms of hydrogen—have neutrons in their nucleus. The nucleus is the small, dense region at the center of an atom where protons are also found. Atoms generally have about the same number of neutrons as protons. For example, all carbon atoms have six protons and most also have six neutrons. A model of a carbon atom is shown in the Figure 2.59. For an excellent video explaining the structure of atoms, including neutrons, go to this URL: URL (7:44) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Properties of  Neutrons 	  Unlike protons and electrons, which are electrically charged, neutrons have no charge. In other words, they are electrically neutral. That’s why the neutrons in the diagram above are labeled n0. The zero stands for “zero charge.” The mass of a neutron is slightly greater than the mass of a proton, which is 1 atomic mass unit (amu). (An atomic mass unit equals about 1.67 × 10−27 kilograms.) A neutron also has about the same diameter as a proton, or 1.7 × 
Same  Element,  Different  Numbers of  Neutrons 	  All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons. The number of neutrons, however, may vary for atoms of the same element. For example, almost 99 percent of carbon atoms have six neutrons, but the rest have either seven or eight neutrons. Atoms of an element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. The nuclei of these isotopes of carbon are shown in the Figure 2.60. The isotope called carbon-14 is used to find the ages of fossils. You can learn how at this URL: URL /geology/carbon-14.htm . Q: Notice the names of the carbon isotopes in the diagram. Based on this example, infer how isotopes of an element are named. A: Isotopes of an element are named for their total number of protons and neutrons. Q: The element oxygen has 8 protons. How many protons and neutrons are there in oxygen-17? A: Oxygen-17—like all atoms of oxygen—has 8 protons. Its name provides the clue that it has a total of 17 protons and neutrons. Therefore, it must have 9 neutrons (8 + 9 = 17). 
Particles in  Neutrons 	  Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons. Each neutron contains three quarks, as shown in the diagram below. Two of the quarks are called down quarks (d) and the third quark is called an up quark (u). Gluons (represented by wavy black lines in the diagram) are fundamental particles that are given off or absorbed by quarks. They carry the strong nuclear force that holds together quarks in a neutron. 
Summary 	  • A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom. It is found in the nucleus and is neutral in electric charge. It has about the same mass and diameter as a proton. Neutrons are found in all atoms except for most atoms of hydrogen. • All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons, but they may vary in their numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. • Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons. Gluons carry the strong nuclear force that binds together the quarks in a neutron. Read the article on neutrons at the following URL, and then complete the fill-in statements below. URL • Describe electrons. • Explain where electrons are found in atoms. • Describe energy levels in atoms. Watch out! Lightning is extremely dangerous. A single bolt of lightning can carry a billion volts of electricity. That’s enough energy to light a 100-watt light bulb—for three months! As impressive as it is, lightning is nothing more than a sudden flow of extremely tiny particles. What are the particles that flow in a lightning bolt? The answer is electrons. What Are Electrons? Electrons are one of three main types of particles that make up atoms. The other two types are protons and neutrons. Unlike protons and neutrons, which consist of smaller, simpler particles, electrons are fundamental particles that do not consist of smaller particles. They are a type of fundamental particles called leptons. All leptons have an electric charge of -1 or 0. For an excellent video about electrons and other fundamental particles in atoms, go to this URL: URL (7:44) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Properties of  Electrons 	  Electrons are extremely small. The mass of an electron is only about 1/2000 the mass of a proton or neutron, so electrons contribute virtually nothing to the total mass of an atom. Electrons have an electric charge of -1, which is equal but opposite to the charge of proton, which is +1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons, so the positive and negative charges “cancel out,” making atoms electrically neutral. Where Are Electrons? Unlike protons and neutrons, which are located inside the nucleus at the center of the atom, electrons are found outside the nucleus. Because opposite electric charges attract each other, negative electrons are attracted to the positive nucleus. This force of attraction keeps electrons constantly moving through the otherwise empty space around the nucleus. The Figure 2.61 is a common way to represent the structure of an atom. It shows the electron as a particle orbiting the nucleus, similar to the way that planets orbit the sun. 
Orbitals 	  The atomic model in the Figure 2.61 is useful for some purposes, but it’s too simple when it comes to the location of electrons. In reality, it’s impossible to say what path an electron will follow. Instead, it’s only possible to describe the chances of finding an electron in a certain region around the nucleus. The region where an electron is most likely to be is called an orbital. Each orbital can have at most two electrons. Some orbitals, called S orbitals, are shaped like spheres, with the nucleus in the center. An S orbital is pictured in Figure 2.62. Where the dots are denser, the chance of finding an electron is greater. Also pictured in Figure 2.62 is a P orbital. P orbitals are shaped like dumbbells, with the nucleus in the pinched part of the dumbbell. You can see animated, three-dimensional models of orbitals at the following URL. URL (1:37) Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: How many electrons can there be in each type of orbital shown in the Figure 2.62? A: There can be a maximum of two electrons in any orbital, regardless of its shape. Q: Where is the nucleus in each orbital? A: The nucleus is at the center of each orbital. It is in the middle of the sphere in the S orbital and in the pinched part of the P orbital. What’s Your Energy Level? Electrons are located at fixed distances from the nucleus, called energy levels. You can see the first three energy levels in the Figure 2.63. The diagram also shows the maximum possible number of electrons at each energy level. • Electrons at lower energy levels, which are closer to the nucleus, have less energy. At the lowest energy level, which has the least energy, there is just one orbital, so this energy level has a maximum of two electrons. • Only when a lower energy level is full are electrons added to the next higher energy level. Electrons at higher energy levels, which are farther from the nucleus, have more energy. They also have more orbitals and greater possible numbers of electrons. • Electrons at the outermost energy level of an atom are called valence electrons. They determine many of the properties of an element. That’s because these electrons are involved in chemical reactions with other atoms. Atoms may share or transfer valence electrons. Shared electrons bind atoms together to form chemical compounds. You can see all of these ideas in action at the following URL (scroll down to the animation at the bottom of the Web page). URL Q: If an atom has 12 electrons, how will they be distributed in energy levels? A: The atom will have two electrons at the first energy level, eight at the second energy level, and the remaining two at the third energy level. Q: Sometimes, an electron jumps from one energy level to another. How do you think this happens? A: To change energy levels, an electron must either gain or lose energy. That’s because electrons at higher energy levels have more energy than electrons at lower energy levels. 
Summary 	  • Electrons are one of three main types of particles that make up the atom. They are extremely small and have an electric charge of -1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons. • Negative electrons are attracted to the positive nucleus. This force of attraction keeps electrons constantly moving around the nucleus. The region where an electron is most likely to be found is called an orbital. • Electrons are located at fixed distances from the nucleus, called energy levels.

The  Search for  Fundamental  Particles 	  Scientists have long wanted to find the most basic building blocks of the universe. They asked, “what are the fundamental particles of matter that cannot be subdivided into smaller, simpler particles,” and “what holds these particles together?” The quest for fundamental particles began thousands of years ago. Scientists thought they had finally found them when John Dalton discovered the atom in 1803 (see the timeline in Table 2.7). The word atom means “indivisible,” and Dalton thought that the atom could not be divided into smaller, simpler particles.

Through the research of many scientists, many other 	  fundamental particles (except gravitons) are shown to exist. For almost 100 years after Dalton discovered atoms, they were accepted as the fundamental particles of matter. But starting in the late 1890s with the discovery of electrons, particles smaller and simpler than atoms were identified. Within a few decades, protons and neutrons were also discovered. Ultimately, hundreds of subatomic particles were found. You can learn how such tiny particles are discovered by watching the video at this URL: URL com/video_5112658_particle-accelerator_.html . Leptons and Quarks and Bosons, Oh My! Today, scientists think that electrons truly are fundamental particles that cannot be broken down into smaller, simpler particles. They are a type of fundamental particles called leptons. Protons and neutrons, on the other hand, are no longer thought to be fundamental particles. Instead, they are now thought to consist of smaller, simpler particles of matter called quarks. Scientists theorize that leptons and quarks are held together by yet another type of fundamental particles called bosons. All three types of fundamental particles—leptons, quarks, and bosons—are described below. The following Figure 2.64 shows the variety of particles of each type. • There are six types of quarks. In ordinary matter, virtually all quarks are of the types called up and down quarks. All quarks have mass, and they have an electric charge of either +2/3 or -1/3. For example, up quarks have a charge of +2/3, and down quarks have a charge of -1/3. Quarks also have a different type of charge, called color charge, although it has nothing to do with the colors that we see. Quarks are never found alone but instead always occur in groups of two or three quarks. • There are also six types of leptons, including electrons. Leptons have an electric charge of either -1 or 0. Electrons, for example, have a charge of -1. Leptons have mass, although the mass of electrons is extremely small. • There are four known types of bosons, which are force-carrying particles. Each of these bosons carries a different fundamental force between interacting particles. In addition, there is a particle which may exist, called the "Higgs Boson", which gives objects the masses they have. Some types of bosons have mass; others are massless. Bosons have an electric charge of +1, -1, or 0. Q: Protons consist of three quarks: two up quarks and one down quark. Neutrons also consist of three quarks: two down quarks and one up quark. Based on this information, what is the total electric charge of a proton? Of a neutron? A: These combinations of quarks give protons a total electric charge of +1 (2/3 + 2/3 –1/3 = 1) and neutrons a total electric charge of 0 (2/3 –1/3 –1/3 = 0). 
Force- Carrying  Particles 	  The interactions of matter particles are subject to four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetic force, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force. All of these forces are thought to be transmitted by bosons, the forcecarrying fundamental particles. The different types of bosons and the forces they carry are shown in Table 2.8. Consider the examples of gluons, the bosons that carry the strong nuclear force. A continuous exchange of gluons between quarks binds them together in both protons and neutrons. Note that force-carrying particles for gravity (gravitons) have not yet been found.

A: Photons carry electromagnetic force. They are responsible for the force of attraction or repulsion between all electrically charged matter, including the force of attraction between negative electrons and positive protons in an atom. Q: Gravitons have not yet been discovered so they have only been hypothesized to exist. What evidence do you think leads scientists to think that these hypothetical particles affect both leptons and quarks and that they carry force over all distances? A: Gravity is known to affect all matter that has mass, and both quarks and leptons have mass. Gravity is also known to work over long as well as short distances. For example, Earth’s gravity keeps you firmly planted on the ground and also keeps the moon orbiting around the planet. 
The  Standard  Model 	  Based on their knowledge of subatomic particles, scientists have developed a theory called the standard model to explain all the matter in the universe and how it is held together. The model includes only the fundamental particles in the Table 2.8. No other particles are needed to explain all kinds of matter. According to the model, all known matter consists of quarks and leptons that interact by exchanging bosons, which transmit fundamental forces. The standard model is a good theory because all of its predictions have been verified by experimental data. However, the model doesn’t explain everything, including the force of gravity and why matter has mass. Scientists continue to search for evidence that will allow them to explain these aspects of force and matter as well. You can learn much more about the standard model at the URL below. Click on “the standard model” and follow the sequence titled “What is fundamental?” URL 
Summary 	  • For centuries, scientists searched for the fundamental particles of matter and the “glue” that holds them together. At first, scientists thought that atoms were the fundamental particles. Now they know that there are smaller, simpler particles than atoms that make up matter and carry the forces that hold matter together. • Protons and neutrons are made up of fundamental particles of matter called quarks. Electrons are another type of fundamental particles of matter called leptons. Bosons are fundamental particles that carry forces between fundamental particles of matter. • Scientists think that a different type of boson carries each of the four fundamental forces in the universe (strong and weak nuclear forces, electromagnetic force, and gravity). • The standard model is a simple theory that explains all the matter in the universe and its interactions (except for the mass of matter and the force of gravity). According to the standard model, all known matter consists of quarks and leptons, which interact by exchanging force-carrying particles called bosons.

Then check your knowledge of fundamental particles by taking the quiz at the end of the sequence. URL type in your table. its fundamental particles, including force-carrying particles. • Describe electromagnetic forces within the atom. • Explain how the strong nuclear force holds the nucleus together. • Outline how the weak nuclear force changes atoms. You’ve probably used items like those pictured here. What do all of them have in common? They are all used to hold things together. However, they do so in different ways. Like these different kinds of fasteners, there are different kinds of “fasteners” that hold together the subatomic particles inside atoms. The “fasteners” are called forces, and there are three different kinds of them at work inside the atom: electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force. For an introduction to these forces inside the atom, see the colorful tutorial at this URL: http ://URL . 
Electromagnetic  Force 	  Electromagnetic force is a force of attraction or repulsion between all electrically charged particles. This force is transferred between charged particles of matter by fundamental force-carrying particles called photons. Because of electromagnetic force, particles with opposite charges attract each other and particles with the same charge repel each other. Inside the atom, two types of subatomic particles have electric charge: electrons, which have an electric charge of -1, and protons, which have an opposite but equal electric charge of +1. The model of an atom in the Figure 2.65 shows both types of charged particles. Protons are found inside the nucleus at the center of the atom, and they give the nucleus a positive charge. (There are also neutrons in the nucleus, but they have no electric charge.) Negative electrons stay in the area surrounding the positive nucleus because of the electromagnetic force of attraction between them. Q: Why do you think protons cluster together in the nucleus of the atom instead of repelling each other because of their like charges? A: The electromagnetic force of repulsion between positively charged protons is overcome by a stronger force, called the strong nuclear force. 
Strong  Nuclear  Force 	  The strong nuclear force is a force of attraction between fundamental particles called quarks, which have a type of charge called color charge. The strong nuclear force is transferred between quarks by fundamental force-carrying particles called gluons. Both protons and neutrons consist of quarks. The exchange of gluons holds quarks together within a proton or neutron. Excess, or residual, strong force holds together protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The strong nuclear force is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force of repulsion pushing protons apart. Both forces are represented in the Figure 2.66. The strong nuclear force works only over very short distances. As a result, it isn’t effective if the nucleus gets too big. As more protons are added to the nucleus, the electromagnetic force of repulsion between them gets stronger, while the strong nuclear force of attraction between them gets weaker. This puts an upper limit on the number of protons an atom can have and remain stable. If atoms have more than 83 protons, the electromagnetic repulsion between them is greater than the strong nuclear force of attraction between them. This makes the nucleus unstable, 
The types of quarks found in protons and 	  neutrons are called up quarks (u) and down quarks (d). Each proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark (uud), and each neutron consists of one up quark and two down quarks (udd). This diagram represents two protons. or radioactive, so it breaks down. The following video discusses the strong nuclear force and its role in the atom. The video also introduces the weak nuclear force, which is described next. URL (3:32) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Weak  Nuclear  Force 	  The weak nuclear force is transferred by the exchange of force-carrying fundamental particles called W and Z bosons. This force is also a very short-range force that works only within the nucleus of the atom. It is much weaker than the strong force or electromagnetic force that are also at work inside the atom. Unlike these other two forces, the weak nuclear force does not bind subatomic particles together in an atom. Instead, it changes subatomic particles from one type to another. The Figure 2.67 shows one way this can happen. In this figure, an up quark in a proton is changed by the weak force to a down quark. This changes the proton (uud) to a neutron (udd). Q: If the weak force causes a proton to change to a neutron, how does this change the atom? A: The resulting atom represents a different element. That’s because each element has a unique number of protons. For example, all atoms of helium have two protons. If one of the protons in a helium atom changes to a neutron, the resulting atom would have just one proton, so the atom would no longer be a helium atom. Instead it would be a hydrogen atom, because all hydrogen atoms have a single proton. 
Summary 	  • The electromagnetic force of attraction between negative electrons and positive protons in the nucleus keeps electrons in the area surrounding the nucleus. • The electromagnetic force of repulsion between positive protons in the nucleus is overcome by the strong nuclear force between protons and neutrons. This force holds the nucleus together. • The weak nuclear force changes subatomic particles from one type to another. When protons change to neutrons, this changes atoms of one element to atoms of a different element. Do the atom builder activity at the following URL.

URL an atom of one element to an atom of a different element? • Define atomic number. • Explain what mass number represents. Athletes wearing the same-colored jerseys are all on the same team. In addition, each player’s jersey has a unique number to distinguish him from his teammates. Imagine how confusing it would be if members of both teams wore the same-colored jerseys or all the members of a team had the same number on their jerseys. How could you tell the athletes apart? 
Telling  Atoms  Apart 	  It’s often useful to have ways to signify different people or objects like athletes on teams. The same is true of atoms. It’s important to be able to distinguish atoms of one element from atoms of other elements. Elements are pure substances that make up all other matter, so each one is given a unique name. The names of elements are also represented by unique oneor two-letter symbols, such as H for hydrogen, C for carbon, and He for helium. You can see other examples in the Figure 2.68. Q: The table shown in the Figure 2.68 is called the periodic table of the elements. Each symbol stands for a different element. What do you think the symbol K stands for? A: The symbol K stands for the element potassium. The symbol comes from the Latin name for potassium, which is kalium. The symbols in the Figure 2.68 would be more useful if they revealed more information about the atoms they represent. For example, it would be useful to know the numbers of protons and neutrons in the atoms. That’s where atomic number and mass number come in. 
Atomic  Number 	  The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. This number is very important because it is unique for atoms of a given element. All atoms of an element have the same number of protons, and every element has a different number of protons in its atoms. For example, all helium atoms have two protons, and no other elements have atoms with two protons. In the case of helium, the atomic number is 2. The atomic number of an element is usually written in front of and slightly below the element’s symbol, like in the Figure 2.69 for helium. Atoms are neutral in electrical charge because they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons. Therefore, the atomic number of an atom also tells you how many electrons the atom has. This, in turn, determines many of the atom’s properties. 
Mass  Number 	  There is another number in the Figure 2.69 for helium. That number is the mass number, which is the mass of the atom in a unit called the atomic mass unit (amu). One atomic mass unit is the mass of a proton, or about 1.67 × this URL: URL . A neutron has just a tiny bit more mass than a proton, so its mass is often assumed to be one atomic mass unit as well. Because electrons have virtually no mass, just about all the mass of an atom is in its protons and neutrons. Therefore, the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom determines its mass in atomic mass units. Consider helium again. Most helium atoms have two neutrons in addition to two protons. Therefore the mass of most helium atoms is 4 atomic mass units (2 amu for the protons + 2 amu for the neutrons). However, some helium atoms have more or less than two neutrons. Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Because the number of neutrons can vary for a given element, the mass numbers of different atoms of an element may also vary. For example, some helium atoms have three neutrons instead of two. Therefore, they have a different mass number than the one given in the Figure 2.69. Q: What is the mass number of a helium atom that has three neutrons? A: The mass number is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. For helium atoms with three neutrons, the mass number is 2 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 5. Q: How would you represent this isotope of helium to show its atomic number and mass number? A: You would represent it by the element’s symbol and both numbers, with the mass number on top and the atomic number on the bottom: 
Summary 	  • Elements are pure substances that make up all matter, so each one is given a unique name. The names of elements are also represented by unique one-, two-, or threeletter symbols. • The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. This is also unique for each element. • An atom’s mass number is its mass in atomic mass units (amu), which is about equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the atom.

The incredible green lights in this cold northern sky consist of charged particles known as ions. Their swirling pattern is caused by the pull of Earth’s magnetic north pole. Called the northern lights, this phenomenon of nature shows that ions respond to a magnetic field. Do you know what ions are? Read on to find out. 
Atoms  Are  Neutral 	  The northern lights aren’t caused by atoms, because atoms are not charged particles. An atom always has the same number of electrons as protons. Electrons have an electric charge of -1 and protons have an electric charge of +1. Therefore, the charges of an atom’s electrons and protons “cancel out.” This explains why atoms are neutral in electric charge. Q: What would happen to an atom’s charge if it were to gain extra electrons? A: If an atom were to gain extra electrons, it would have more electrons than protons. This would give it a negative charge, so it would no longer be neutral. 
Atoms to  Ions 	  Atoms cannot only gain extra electrons. They can also lose electrons. In either case, they become ions. Ions are atoms that have a positive or negative charge because they have unequal numbers of protons and electrons. If atoms lose electrons, they become positive ions, or cations. If atoms gain electrons, they become negative ions, or anions. Consider the example of fluorine (see Figure 2.70). A fluorine atom has nine protons and nine electrons, so it is electrically neutral. If a fluorine atom gains an electron, it becomes a fluoride ion with an electric charge of -1. 
Names and  Symbols 	  Like fluoride, other negative ions usually have names ending in –ide. Positive ions, on the other hand, are just given the element name followed by the word ion. For example, when a sodium atom loses an electron, it becomes a positive sodium ion. The charge of an ion is indicated by a plus (+) or minus sign (-), which is written to the right of and just above the ion’s chemical symbol. For example, the fluoride ion is represented by the symbol F−, and the sodium ion is represented by the symbol Na+. If the charge is greater than one, a number is used to indicate it. For example, iron (Fe) may lose two electrons to form an ion with a charge of plus two. This ion would be represented by the symbol Fe2+. This and some other common ions are listed with their symbols in the Table 2.9. 
O2− 	  Q: How does the iron(III) ion differ from the iron(II) ion? A: The iron(III) ion has a charge of +3, so it has one less electron than the iron(II) ion, which has a charge of +2. Q: What is the charge of an oxide ion? How does its number of electrons compare to its number of protons? A: An oxide ion has a charge of -2. It has two more electrons than protons. 
How  Ions  Form 	  The process in which an atom becomes an ion is called ionization. It may occur when atoms are exposed to high levels of radiation. The radiation may give their outer electrons enough energy to escape from the attraction of the positive nucleus. However, most ions form when atoms transfer electrons to or from other atoms or molecules. For example, sodium atoms may transfer electrons to chlorine atoms. This forms positive sodium ions (Na+) and negative chloride ions (Cl−). You can see an animation of this process at the URL below. URL (0:20) Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: Why do you think atoms lose electrons to, or gain electrons from, other atoms? A: Atoms form ions by losing or gaining electrons because it makes them more stable and this state takes less energy to maintain. The most stable state for an atom is to have its outermost energy level filled with the maximum possible number of electrons. In the case of metals such as lithium, with just one electron in the outermost energy level, a more stable state can be achieved by losing that one outer electron. In the case of nonmetals such as fluorine, which has seven electrons in the outermost energy level, a more stable state can be achieved by gaining one electron and filling up the outer energy level. You can learn more about why ions form by watching the video at this URL: URL (9:35) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Properties of  Ions 	  Ions are highly reactive, especially as gases. They usually react with ions of opposite charge to form neutral compounds. For example, positive sodium ions and negative chloride ions react to form the neutral compound sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt. This occurs because oppositely charged ions attract each other. Ions with the same charge, on the other hand, repel each other. Ions are also deflected by a magnetic field, as you saw in the opening image of the northern lights. 
Summary 	  • Atoms have equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons, so they are neutral in electric charge. • Atoms can gain or lose electrons and become ions, which are atoms that have a positive or negative charge because they have unequal numbers of protons and electrons. • The process in which an atom becomes an ion is called ionization. It may occur when atoms are exposed to high levels of radiation or when atoms transfer electrons to or from other atoms. • Ions are reactive, attracted or repulsed by other charged particles, and deflected by a magnetic field.

Is this creature a space alien? It may look alien, but the sketch is actually just a scientist wearing a special suit to protect himself from harmful radiation. The scientist is working with radioactive chemicals called isotopes. Not all isotopes are radioactive, but many of them are. To understand why, you first need to know what isotopes are. What Are Isotopes? All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but some may have different numbers of neutrons. For example, all carbon atoms have six protons, and most have six neutrons as well. But some carbon atoms have seven or eight neutrons instead of the usual six. Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Many isotopes occur naturally. Usually one or two isotopes of an element are the most stable and common. Different isotopes of an element generally have the same physical and chemical properties. That’s because they have the same numbers of protons and electrons. For a video explanation of isotopes, go to this URL: URL (5:23) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
An  Example:  Hydrogen  Isotopes 	  Hydrogen is an example of an element that has isotopes. Three isotopes of hydrogen are modeled in the Figure hydrogen. Some hydrogen atoms have one neutron as well. These atoms are the isotope named deuterium. Other hydrogen atoms have two neutrons. These atoms are the isotope named tritium. For animated versions of these hydrogen isotopes, go to this URL: URL . Q: The mass number of an atom is the sum of its protons and neutrons. What is the mass number of each isotope of hydrogen shown in the Figure 2.71? A: The mass numbers are: hydrogen = 1, deuterium = 2, and tritium = 3. 
Naming  Isotopes 	  For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass number. For example, carbon atoms with the usual 6 neutrons have a mass number of 12 (6 protons + 6 neutrons = 12), so they are called carbon-12. Carbon atoms with 7 neutrons have an atomic mass of 13 (6 protons + 7 neutrons = 13). These atoms are the isotope called carbon-13. Q: Some carbon atoms have 8 neutrons. What is the name of this isotope of carbon? A: Carbon atoms with 8 neutrons have an atomic mass of 14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons = 14), so this isotope of carbon is named carbon-14. 
Stability of  Isotopes 	  Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a stable nucleus. Having too many or too few neutrons relative to protons results in an unstable, or radioactive, nucleus that will sooner or later break down to a more stable form. This process is called radioactive decay. Many isotopes have radioactive nuclei, and these isotopes are referred to as radioisotopes. When they decay, they release particles that may be harmful. This is why radioactive isotopes are dangerous and why working with them requires special suits for protection. The isotope of carbon known as carbon-14 is an example of a radioisotope. In contrast, the carbon isotopes called carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable. 
Summary 	  • Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Different isotopes of an element generally have the same physical and chemical properties because they have the same numbers of protons and electrons. • Most hydrogen atoms lack a neutron and are just called hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms with one neutron are the isotope known as deuterium, and those with two neutrons are the isotope named tritium. • For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass number, which is the number of protons plus neutrons. For example, carbon with a mass number of 14 is called carbon-14. • Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a stable nucleus. If they have too many or too few neutrons relative to protons, they are radioactive and will decay to more stable forms. Isotopes with radioactive nuclei are called radioisotopes.

The man shown above has been called the “laughing philosopher” because of his cheerful disposition. He certainly looks cheerful in this picture. Why is a philosopher featured in a science text? He made an amazing contribution to science, although it was ridiculed by others and then ignored for more than 2000 years. His name was Democritus, and he introduced the idea of the atom as the basic building block of all matter. You can learn about Democritus’ place in the history of the atom at this URL: URL (9:03) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Cutting the  Cheese 	  Democritus lived in Greece from about 460 to 370 B.C.E. Like many other ancient Greek philosophers, he spent a lot of time wondering about the natural world. Democritus wondered, for example, what would happen if you cut a chunk of matter—such as a piece of cheese into smaller and smaller pieces. He thought that a point would be reached at which the cheese could not be cut into still smaller pieces. He called these pieces atomos, which means “uncuttable” in Greek. This is where the modern term atom comes from. In the video at the following URL, Bill Nye the Science Guy demonstrates how Democritus arrived at his idea of the atom. URL (6:37) Click image to the left or use the URL below. How many times could you cut this piece of cheese in half? How small would the smallest pieces be? 
Just a  Guess 	  Democritus’ idea of the atom has been called “the best guess in antiquity.” That’s because it was correct in many ways, yet it was based on pure speculation. It really was just a guess. Here’s what Democritus thought about the atom: • All matter consists of atoms, which cannot be further subdivided into smaller particles. • Atoms are extremely small—too small to see. • Atoms are solid particles that are indestructible. • Atoms are separated from one another by emptiness, or “void.” Q: How are Democritus’ ideas about atoms similar to modern ideas about atoms? A: Modern ideas agree that all matter is made up of extremely small building blocks called atoms. Q: How are Democritus’ ideas different from modern ideas? A: Although atoms are extremely small, it is now possible to see them with very powerful microscopes. Atoms also aren’t the solid, uncuttable particles Democritus thought. Instead, they consist of several kinds of smaller, simpler particles as well as a lot of empty space. In addition, atoms aren’t really indestructible because they can be changed to other forms of matter or energy. 
Keep on  Moving 	  Did you ever notice dust motes moving in still air where a beam of sunlight passes through it? You can see an example in the forest scene in the Figure 2.73. This sort of observation gave Democritus the idea that atoms are in constant, random motion. If this were true, Democritus thought, then atoms must always be bumping into each other. When they do, he surmised, they either bounce apart or stick together to form clumps of atoms. Eventually, the clumps could grow big enough to be visible matter. Dust motes dance in a beam of sunlight. Q: Which modern theory of matter is similar to Democritus’ ideas about the motion of atoms? A: The modern kinetic theory of matter is remarkably similar to Democritus’ ideas about the motion of atoms. According to this theory, atoms of matter are in constant random motion. This motion is greater in gases than in liquids, and it is greater in liquids than in solids. But even in solids, atoms are constantly vibrating in place. 
Why  Matter  Varies 	  Democritus thought that different kinds of matter vary because of the size, shape, and arrangement of their atoms. For example, he suggested that sweet substances are made of smooth atoms and bitter substances are made of sharp atoms. He speculated that atoms of liquids are slippery, which allows them to slide over each other and liquids to flow. Atoms of solids, in contrast, stick together, so they cannot move apart. Differences in the weight of matter, he argued, could be explained by the closeness of atoms. Atoms of lighter matter, he thought, were more spread out and separated by more empty space. Q: Democritus thought that different kinds of atoms make up different types of matter. How is this similar to modern ideas about atoms? A: The modern view is that atoms of different elements differ in their numbers of protons and electrons and this gives them different physical and chemical properties. That’s Ridiculous! Democritus was an important philosopher, but he was less influential than another Greek philosopher named Aristotle, who lived about 100 years after Democritus. Aristotle rejected Democritus’ idea of the atom. In fact, Aristotle thought the idea was ridiculous. Unfortunately, Aristotle’s opinion was accepted for more than 2000 years, and Democritus’ idea was more or less forgotten. However, the idea of the atom was revived around 1800 by the English scientist John Dalton. Dalton developed an entire theory about the atom, much of which is still accepted today. He based his theory on experimental evidence, not on lucky guesses.

You probably know what this sketch represents. It’s a model of an atom, one of the miniscule particles that make up all matter. The idea that matter consists of extremely tiny particles called atoms was first introduced about 2500 years ago by a Greek philosopher named Democritus. However, other philosophers considered Democritus’ idea ridiculous, and it was more or less forgotten for more than 2000 years. 
Reintroducing the  Atom 	  Around 1800, the English chemist John Dalton brought back Democritus’ ancient idea of the atom. You can see a picture of Dalton 2.74. Dalton grew up in a working-class family. As an adult, he made a living by teaching and just did research in his spare time. Nonetheless, from his research he developed one of the most important theories in all of science. Based on his research results, he was able to demonstrate that atoms actually do exist, something that Democritus had only guessed. 
Dalton’s  Experiments 	  Dalton did many experiments that provided evidence for the existence of atoms. For example: • He investigated pressure and other properties of gases, from which he inferred that gases must consist of tiny, individual particles that are in constant, random motion. • He researched the properties of compounds, which are substances that consist of more than one element. He showed that a given compound is always comprised of the same elements in the same whole-number ratio and that different compounds consist of different elements or ratios. This can happen, Dalton reasoned, only if elements are made of separate, discrete particles that cannot be subdivided. 
Atomic  Theory 	  From his research, Dalton developed a theory about atoms. Dalton’s atomic theory consists of three basic ideas: • All substances are made of atoms. Atoms are the smallest particles of matter. They cannot be divided into smaller particles, created, or destroyed. • All atoms of the same element are alike and have the same mass. Atoms of different elements are different and have different masses. • Atoms join together to form compounds, and a given compound always consists of the same kinds of atoms in the same proportions. Dalton’s atomic theory was accepted by many scientists almost immediately. Most of it is still accepted today. However, scientists now know that atoms are not the smallest particles of matter. Atoms consist of several types of smaller particles, including protons, neutrons, and electrons.

The  Billiard  Ball  Model 	  Because Dalton thought atoms were the smallest particles of matter, he envisioned them as solid, hard spheres, like billiard (pool) balls, so he used wooden balls to model them. Three of his model atoms are pictured in the Figure and used to model compounds. Q: When scientists discovered smaller particles inside the atom, they realized that Dalton’s atomic models were too simple. How do modern atomic models differ from Dalton’s models? A: Modern atomic models, like the one pictured at the top of this article, usually represent subatomic particles, including electrons, protons, and neutrons.

J. Thomson discovered the electron. • Describe Thomson’s plum pudding model of the atom. You probably know that the wires strung between these high towers carry electricity. But do you know what electricity is? It actually consists of a constant stream of tiny particles called electrons. Electrons are negatively charged fundamental particles inside atoms. Atoms were discovered around 1800, but almost 100 years went by before electrons were discovered. 
Thomson  Discovers  Electrons 	  John Dalton discovered atoms in 1804. He thought they were the smallest particles of matter, which could not be broken down into smaller particles. He envisioned them as solid, hard spheres. It wasn’t until 1897 that a scientist named Joseph John (J. J.) Thomson discovered that there are smaller particles within the atom. Thomson was born in England and studied at Cambridge University, where he later became a professor. In 1906, he won the Nobel Prize in physics for his research on how gases conduct electricity. This research also led to his discovery of the electron. You can see a picture of Thomson 2.76. You can take a museum tour of his discovery at this online exhibit: URL ww.aip.org/history/electron/ . 
Thomson’s  Experiments 	  In his research, Thomson passed current through a cathode ray tube, similar to the one seen in the Figure 2.77. A cathode ray tube is a glass tube from which virtually all of the air has been removed. It contains a piece of metal called an electrode at each end. One electrode is negatively charged and known as a cathode. The other electrode is positively charged and known as an anode. When high-voltage electric current is applied to the end plates, a cathode ray travels from the cathode to the anode. What is a cathode ray? That’s what Thomson wanted to know. Is it just a ray of energy that travels in waves like a ray of light? That was one popular hypothesis at the time. Or was a cathode ray a stream of moving particles? That was the other popular hypothesis. Thomson tested these ideas by placing negative and positive plates along the sides of the cathode ray tube to see how the cathode ray would be affected. The cathode ray appeared to be repelled by the negative plate and attracted by the positive plate. This meant that the ray was negative in charge and that is must consist of particles that have mass. He called the particles “corpuscles,” but they were later renamed electrons. For a video demonstration of Thomson’s experiment, go to this URL: URL -thomsons-experiments-with-cathode.html . Thomson also measured the mass of the particles he had identified. He did this by determining how much the cathode rays were bent when he varied the voltage. He found that the mass of the particles was 2000 times smaller than the mass of the smallest atom, the hydrogen atom. In short, Thomson had discovered the existence of particles smaller than atoms. This disproved Dalton’s claim that atoms are the smallest particles of matter. From his discovery, Thomson also inferred that electrons are fundamental particles within atoms. Q: Atoms are neutral in electric charge. How can they be neutral if they contain negatively charged electrons? A: Atoms also contain positively charged particles that cancel out the negative charge of the electrons. However, these positive particles weren’t discovered until a couple of decades after Thomson discovered electrons. 
The  Plum  Pudding  Model 	  Thomson also knew that atoms are neutral in electric charge, so he asked the same question: How can atoms contain negative particles and still be neutral? He hypothesized that the rest of the atom must be positively charged in order to cancel out the negative charge of the electrons. He envisioned the atom as being similar to a plum pudding, like the one pictured in the Figure 2.78—mostly positive in charge (the pudding) with negative electrons (the plums) scattered through it. Q: How is our modern understanding of atomic structure different from Thomson’s plum pudding model? A: Today we know that all of the positive charge in an atom is concentrated in a tiny central area called the nucleus, with the electrons swirling through empty space around it, as in the Figure 2.79. The nucleus was discovered just a few years after Thomson discovered the electron, so the plum pudding model was soon rejected. 
Summary 	  • In 1897, J. J. Thomson discovered the first subatomic particle, the electron, while researching cathode rays. • To explain the neutrality of atoms, Thomson proposed a model of the atom in which negative electrons are scattered throughout a sphere of positive charge. He called his atom the plum pudding model. Watch this detailed presentation about J. J. Thomson’s discovery of the electron, and then answer the question below.

What reasoning did Thomson use to make this inference? plum pudding model of the atom. • Explain how Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus of the atom. • Describe Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom. Thom is shooting baskets. He’s trying to hit the backboard so the ball will bounce off it and into the basket. If only the backboard was bigger! It would be a lot easier to hit. If the ball misses the backboard, it will just keep going and Thom will have to run after it. Believe it or not, the research that led to the discovery of the nucleus of the atom was a little like shooting baskets. 
Narrowing  Down the  Nucleus 	  In 1804, almost a century before the nucleus was discovered, the English scientist John Dalton provided evidence for the existence of the atom. Dalton thought that atoms were the smallest particles of matter, which couldn’t be divided into smaller particles. He modeled atoms with solid wooden balls. In 1897, another English scientist, named J. J. Thomson, discovered the electron. It was first subatomic particle to be identified. Because atoms are neutral in electric charge, Thomson assumed that atoms must also contain areas of positive charge to cancel out the negatively charged electrons. He thought that an atom was like a plum pudding, consisting mostly of positively charged matter with negative electrons scattered through it. The nucleus of the atom was discovered next. It was discovered in 1911 by a scientist from New Zealand named Ernest Rutherford, who is pictured in Figure 2.80. Through his clever research, Rutherford showed that the positive charge of an atom is confined to a tiny massive region at the center of the atom, rather than being spread evenly throughout the “pudding” of the atom as Thomson had suggested. You can watch a video about Rutherford and his discovery at this URL: URL (3:28) Click image to the left or use the URL below. Go for the Gold! The way Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus is a good example of the role of creativity in science. His quest actually began in 1899 when he discovered that some elements give off positively charged particles that can penetrate just about anything. He called these particles alpha (α) particles (we now know they were helium nuclei). Like all good scientists, Rutherford was curious. He wondered how he could use alpha particles to learn about the structure of the atom. He decided to aim a beam of alpha particles at a sheet of very thin gold foil. He chose gold because it can be pounded into sheets that are only 0.00004 cm thick. Surrounding the sheet of gold foil, he placed a screen that glowed when alpha particles struck it. It would be used to detect the alpha particles after they passed through the foil. A small slit in the screen allowed the beam of alpha particles to reach the foil from the particle emitter. You can see the setup for Rutherford’s experiment in the Figure 2.81. Q: What would you expect to happen when the alpha particles strike the gold foil? A: The alpha particles would penetrate the gold foil. Alpha particles are positive, so they might be repelled by any areas of positive charge inside the gold atoms. Assuming a plum pudding model of the atom, Rutherford predicted that the areas of positive charge in the gold atoms would deflect, or bend, the path of all the alpha particles as they passed through. You can see what really happened in the Figure 2.81. Most of the alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil as though it wasn’t there. The particles seemed to be passing through empty space. Only a few of the alpha particles were deflected from their straight path, as Rutherford had predicted. Surprisingly, a tiny percentage of the particles bounced back from the foil like a basketball bouncing off a backboard! You can see an animation of this experiment at the following Q: What can you infer from these observations? A: You can infer that most of the alpha particles were not repelled by any positive charge, whereas a few were repelled by a strong positive charge. 
The  Nucleus  Takes  Center  Stage 	  Rutherford made the same inferences. He concluded that all of the positive charge and virtually all of the mass of an atom are concentrated in one tiny area and the rest of the atom is mostly empty space. Rutherford called the area of concentrated positive charge the nucleus. He predicted—and soon discovered—that the nucleus contains positively charged particles, which he named protons. Rutherford also predicted the existence of neutral nuclear particles called neutrons, but he failed to find them. However, his student James Chadwick discovered them several years later. You can learn how at this URL: URL . 
The  Planetary  Model 	  Rutherford’s discoveries meant that Thomson’s plum pudding model was incorrect. Positive charge is not spread evenly throughout an atom. Instead, it is all concentrated in the tiny nucleus. The rest of the atom is empty space except for the electrons scattered through it. In Rutherford’s model of the atom, which is shown in the Figure 2.82, the electrons move around the massive nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. That’s why his model is called the planetary model. Rutherford didn’t know exactly where or how electrons orbit the nucleus. That research would be undertaken by later scientists, beginning with Niels Bohr in 1913. New and improved atomic models would also be developed. Nonetheless, Rutherford’s model is still often used to represent the atom. You can see an animated version of the model at this URL: URL . 
Summary 	  • Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus of the atom in 1910. He sent a beam of alpha particles toward gold foil and observed the way the particles were deflected by the gold atoms. From his results, he concluded that all of the positive charge and virtually all of the mass of an atom are concentrated in one tiny area, called the nucleus, and the rest of the atom is mostly empty space. • In Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom, the electrons move through empty space around the tiny positive nucleus like planets orbiting the sun.

Modeling the  Atom 	  The existence of the atom was first demonstrated around 1800 by John Dalton. Then, close to a century went by before J.J. Thomson discovered the first subatomic particle, the negatively charged electron. Because atoms are neutral in charge, Thomson thought that they must consist of a sphere of positive charge with electrons scattered through it. In 1910, Ernest Rutherford showed that this idea was incorrect. He demonstrated that all of the positive charge of an atom is actually concentrated in a tiny central region called the nucleus. Rutherford surmised that electrons move around the nucleus like planets around the sun. Rutherford’s idea of atomic structure was an improvement on Thomson’s model, but it wasn’t the last word. Rutherford focused on the nucleus and didn’t really clarify where the electrons were in the empty space surrounding the nucleus. The next major advance in atomic history occurred in 1913, when the Danish scientist Niels Bohr published a description of a more detailed model of the atom. His model identified more clearly where electrons could be found. Although later scientists would develop more refined atomic models, Bohr’s model was basically correct and much of it is still accepted today. It is also a very useful model because it explains the properties of different elements. Bohr received the 1922 Nobel prize in physics for his contribution to our understanding of the structure of the atom. You can see a picture of Bohr 2.83. 
On the  Level 	  As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure 2.84. Q: How is an atom like a ladder? A: Energy levels in an atom are like the rungs of a ladder. Just as you can stand only on the rungs and not in between them, electrons can orbit the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus and not in between them. 
Energy by the  Spoonful 	  Bohr’s model of the atom is actually a combination of two different ideas: Rutherford’s atomic model of electrons orbiting the nucleus and German scientist Max Planck’s idea of a quantum, which Planck published in 1901. A quantum (plural, quanta) is the minimum amount of energy that can be absorbed or released by matter. It is a discrete, or distinct, amount of energy. If energy were water and you wanted to add it to matter in the form of a drinking glass, you couldn’t simply pour the water continuously into the glass. Instead, you could add it only in small fixed quantities, for example, by the teaspoonful. Bohr reasoned that if electrons can absorb or lose only fixed quantities of energy, then they must vary in their energy by these fixed amounts. Thus, they can occupy only fixed energy levels around the nucleus that correspond to quantum increases in energy. 
This is a two-dimensional model of a 	  three-dimensional atom. The concentric circles actually represent concentric spheres. Q: The idea that energy is transferred only in discrete units, or quanta, was revolutionary when Max Planck first proposed it in 1901. However, what scientists already knew about matter may have made it easier for them to accept the idea of energy quanta. Can you explain? A: Scientists already knew that matter exists in discrete units called atoms. This idea had been demonstrated by John Dalton around 1800. Knowing this may have made it easier for scientists to accept the idea that energy exists in discrete units as well. 
Summary 	  • In Bohr’s atomic model, electrons move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. The fixed distances where electrons may orbit are called energy levels. • Bohr arrived at his model by applying Planck’s idea of energy quanta to Rutherford’s atomic model of electrons orbiting the nucleus.

Fireworks are a great way to celebrate happy events. Do you know what causes the brilliant, colored lights of fireworks? The lights are bursts of energy given off by atoms in the fireworks. What do you suppose causes these bursts of light? The answer has to do with energy levels of atoms. What Are Energy Levels? Energy levels (also called electron shells) are fixed distances from the nucleus of an atom where electrons may be found. Electrons are tiny, negatively charged particles in an atom that move around the positive nucleus at the center. Energy levels are a little like the steps of a staircase. You can stand on one step or another but not in between the steps. The same goes for electrons. They can occupy one energy level or another but not the space between energy levels. The model in the Figure 2.85 shows the first four energy levels of an atom. Electrons in energy level I (also called energy level K) have the least amount of energy. As you go farther from the nucleus, electrons at higher levels have more energy, and their energy increases by a fixed, discrete amount. Electrons can jump from a lower to the next higher energy level if they absorb this amount of energy. Conversely, if electrons jump from a higher to a lower energy level, they give off energy, often in the form of light. This explains the fireworks pictured above. When the fireworks explode, electrons gain energy and jump to higher energy levels. When they jump back to their original energy levels, they release the energy as light. Different atoms have different arrangements of electrons, so they give off light of different colors. You can see an animation of electrons jumping from one energy level to another at this Q: In the atomic model Figure 2.85, where would you find electrons that have the most energy? A: Electrons with the most energy would be found in energy level IV. 
Energy  Levels and  Orbitals 	  The smallest atoms are hydrogen atoms. They have just one electron orbiting the nucleus. That one electron is in the first energy level. Bigger atoms have more electrons. Electrons are always added to the lowest energy level first until it has the maximum number of electrons possible. Then electrons are added to the next higher energy level until that level is full, and so on. How many electrons can a given energy level hold? The maximum numbers of electrons possible for the first four energy levels are shown in the Figure 2.85. For example, energy level I can hold a maximum of two electrons, and energy level II can hold a maximum of eight electrons. The maximum number depends on the number of orbitals at a given energy level. An orbital is a volume of space within an atom where an electron is most likely to be found. As you can see by the images in the Figure 2.86, some orbitals are shaped like spheres (S orbitals) and some are shaped like dumbbells (P orbitals). There are other types of orbitals as well. Regardless of its shape, each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. Energy level I has just one orbital, so two electrons will fill this energy level. Energy level II has four orbitals, so it takes eight electrons to fill this energy level. The animation below shows the electrons in the first two energy levels for an atom of lithium, which has a total of three electrons. URL Q: Energy level III can hold a maximum of 18 electrons. How many orbitals does this energy level have? A: At two electrons per orbital, this energy level must have nine orbitals. 
The  Outermost  Level 	  Electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom have a special significance. These electrons are called valence electrons, and they determine many of the properties of an atom. An atom is most stable if its outermost energy level contains as many electrons as it can hold. For example, helium has two electrons, both in the first energy level. This energy level can hold only two electrons, so helium’s only energy level is full. This makes helium a very stable element. In other words, its atoms are unlikely to react with other atoms. Consider the elements fluorine and lithium, modeled in the Figure 2.87. Fluorine has seven of eight possible electrons in its outermost energy level, which is energy level II. It would be more stable if it had one more electron because this would fill its outermost energy level. Lithium, on the other hand, has just one of eight possible electrons in its outermost energy level (also energy level II). It would be more stable if it had one less electron because it would have a full outer energy level (now energy level I). Both fluorine and lithium are highly reactive elements because of their number of valence electrons. Fluorine will readily gain one electron and lithium will just as readily give up one electron to become more stable. In fact, lithium and fluorine will react together as shown in the Figure 2.88. When the two elements react, lithium transfers its one “extra” electron to fluorine. Q: A neon atom has ten electrons. How many electrons does it have in its outermost energy level? How stable do you think a neon atom is? A: A neon atom has two electrons in energy level I and its remaining eight electrons in energy level II, which can hold only eight electrons. This means that is outermost energy level is full. Therefore, a neon atom is very stable. 
Summary 	  • Energy levels (also called electron shells) are fixed distances from the nucleus of an atom where electrons may be found. As you go farther from the nucleus, electrons at higher energy levels have more energy. • Electrons are always added to the lowest energy level first until it has the maximum number of electrons possible, and then electrons are added to the next higher energy level until that level is full, and so on.

The fan pictured here is turned off in the photo on the left and running at high speed in the photo on the right. In the right-hand photo, the blades are moving too fast for you to see the individual blades. You can’t tell where any given blade is at any given moment. In some ways, rapidly moving fan blades are similar to electrons moving about the nucleus of an atom. Like fan blades, electrons move very quickly and we can never tell exactly where they are. If that’s the case, how can we represent electrons in models of the atom? Where Are the Electrons? Up until about 1920, scientists accepted Niels Bohr’s model of the atom. In this model, negative electrons circle the positive nucleus at fixed distances from the nucleus, called energy levels. You can see the model in Figure 2.89 for an atom of the element nitrogen. Bohr’s model is useful for understanding properties of elements and their chemical interactions. However, it doesn’t explain certain behaviors of electrons, except for those in the simplest atom, the hydrogen atom. What Are the Chances? In the mid-1920s, an Austrian scientist named Erwin Schrödinger thought that the problem with Bohr’s model was restricting the electrons to specific orbits. He wondered if electrons might behave like light, which scientists already knew had properties of both particles and waves. Schrödinger speculated that electrons might also travel in waves. At the URLs below, you can see how some of these waves might look. • URL • URL Q: How do you pin down the location of an electron in a wave? A: You can’t specify the exact location of an electron. However, Schrödinger showed that you can at least determine where an electron is most likely to be. Schrödinger developed an equation that could be used to calculate the chances of an electron being in any given place around the nucleus. Based on his calculations, he identified regions around the nucleus where electrons are most likely to be. He called these regions orbitals. As you can see in the Figure 2.90, orbitals may be shaped like spheres, dumbbells, or rings. In each case, the nucleus of the atom is at the center of the orbital. You can see animated models of orbitals this URL: URL . 
A  Fuzzy  Cloud 	  Schrödinger’s work on orbitals is the basis of the modern model of the atom, which scientists call the quantum mechanical model. The modern model is also commonly called the electron cloud model. That’s because each orbital around the nucleus of the atom resembles a fuzzy cloud around the nucleus, like the ones shown in the being. Q: In the model pictured in the Figure 2.91, where are the two helium electrons most likely to be? A: The two electrons are most likely to be inside the sphere closest to the nucleus where the cloud is darkest. 
Summary 	  • Bohr’s model of the atom, in which electrons circle the nucleus at fixed energy levels, cannot explain all the behaviors of electrons. • In the 1920s, Erwin Schrödinger proposed that electrons travel in waves, which means their exact positions cannot be determined. He developed an equation to calculate the chances of an electron being in any given place. Using his equation, he identified regions around the nucleus, called orbitals, where electrons are most likely to be. • Orbitals are the basis of the electron cloud model of the atom.

Look at the left-hand photo above. What a messy closet! Do you have a messy closet too? If you do, then you know how hard it can be to find a specific item of clothing. If you don’t have a messy closet, just imagine trying to find a particular shirt or pair of jeans in the closet above. It could take a long time, and it would probably make you late for school! Now look at the closet on the right. It’s very neat and well organized. With a closet like this, it would be easy to find whatever item you wanted. Q: What do these two closets have to do with science? A: They show why it’s important to keep things organized, including the elements, which are the pure substances that make up all kinds of matter. 
Organizing  Elements 	  For many years, scientists looked for a good way to organize the elements. This became increasingly important as more and more elements were discovered. An ingenious method of organizing elements was developed in 1869 by a Russian scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev, who is pictured 2.92. Mendeleev’s method of organizing elements was later revised, but it served as a basis for the method that is still used today. You can learn more about Mendeleev and his work at this URL: URL eriodic-table-video.htm . Mendeleev was a teacher as well as a chemist. He was writing a chemistry textbook and wanted to find a way to organize the 63 known elements so it would be easier for students to learn about them. He made a set of cards of the elements, similar to a deck of playing cards. On each card, he wrote the name of a different element, its atomic mass, and other known properties. Mendeleev arranged and rearranged the cards in many different ways, looking for a pattern. He finally found it when he placed the elements in order by increasing atomic mass. Q: What is atomic mass? Why might it be a good basis for organizing elements? A: Atomic mass is the mass of one atom of an element. It is about equal to the mass of the protons plus the neutrons in an atom. It is a good basis for organizing elements because each element has a unique number of protons and atomic mass is an indirect way of organizing elements by number of protons. 
Groups and  Periods 	  You can see how Mendeleev organized the elements in the Figure 2.93. From left to right across each row, elements are arranged by increasing atomic mass. Mendeleev discovered that if he placed eight elements in each row and then continued on to the next row, the columns of the table would contain elements with similar properties. He called the columns groups. They are sometimes called families, because elements within a group are similar but not identical to one another, like people in a family. Mendeleev’s table of the elements is called a periodic table because of its repeating pattern. Anything that keeps repeating is referred to as periodic. Other examples of things that are periodic include the monthly phases of the moon and the daily cycle of night and day. The term period refers to the interval between repetitions. For example, the moon’s phases repeat every four weeks. In a periodic table of the elements, the periods are the rows of the table. In Mendeleev’s table, each period contains eight elements, and then the pattern repeats in the next row. 
Filling in the  Blanks 	  Did you notice the blanks in Mendeleev’s table? They are spaces that Mendeleev left blank for elements that had not yet been discovered when he created his table. He predicted that these missing elements would eventually be discovered. Based on their position in the table, he even predicted their properties. For example, he predicted a missing element in row 5 of group III. He also predicted that the missing element would have an atomic mass of they found it just a few years later. They named the new element gallium. Scientists searched for the other missing elements in Mendeleev’s table and eventually found all of them. An important measure of a good model is its ability to make accurate predictions. This makes it a useful model. Clearly, Mendeleev’s periodic table was a useful model. It helped scientists discover new elements and made sense of those that were already known. 
Summary 	  • In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev developed a method for organizing elements based on their atomic mass. His method was later revised, but it served as a basis for the method used today. • Mendeleev created a periodic table of all the elements that were known at the time. The rows of the table, called periods, each contained eight elements that increased in atomic mass from left to right. The columns of the table, called groups, contained elements with similar properties. • Mendeleev’s periodic table was a good model because it could be used to predict unknown elements and their properties. All of these missing elements were eventually discovered. Do the activity at the URL below to simulate how Mendeleev developed his periodic table.

The  First  Periodic  Table 	  In the 1860s, a scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev also saw the need to organize the elements. He created a table in which he arranged all of the elements by increasing atomic mass from left to right across each row. When he placed eight elements in each row and then started again in the next row, each column of the table contained elements with similar properties. He called the columns of elements groups. Mendeleev’s table is called a periodic table and the rows are called periods. That’s because the table keeps repeating from row to row, and periodic means “repeating.” 
The  Modern  Periodic  Table 	  A periodic table is still used today to organize the elements. You can see a simple version of the modern periodic table in the Figure 2.94. The modern table is based on Mendeleev’s table, except the modern table arranges the elements by increasing atomic number instead of atomic mass. Atomic number is the number of protons in an atom, and this number is unique for each element. The modern table has more elements than Mendeleev’s table because many elements have been discovered since Mendeleev’s time. Some newer elements have been made artificially and added after their existence has been verified. For example, elements 114 and 116 were added in 2011. In 2015 four more elements (atomic numbers 113, 115, 117, and 118) were verified and added. The periodic table continues to grow. You can explore an interactive version of the modern periodic table at this URL: URL . 
Reading the  Table 	  In the Figure 2.94, each element is represented by its chemical symbol, which consists of one or two letters. The first letter of the symbol is always written in upper case, and the second letter—if there is one—is always written in lower case. For example, the symbol for copper is Cu. It stands for cuprum, which is the Latin word for copper. The number above each symbol in the table is its unique atomic number. Notice how the atomic numbers increase from left to right and from top to bottom in the table. Q: Find the symbol for copper in the Figure 2.94. What is its atomic number? What does this number represent? A: The atomic number of copper is 29. This number represents the number of protons in each atom of copper. (Copper is the element that makes up the coil of wire in photo A of the opening sequence of photos.) 
Periods of the  Modern  Periodic  Table 	  Rows of the modern periodic table are called periods, as they are in Mendeleev’s table. From left to right across a period, each element has one more proton than the element before it. Some periods in the modern periodic table are longer than others. For example, period 1 contains only two elements: hydrogen (H) and helium (He). In contrast, periods 6 and 7 are so long that many of their elements are placed below the main part of the table. They are the elements starting with lanthanum (La) in period 6 and actinium (Ac) in period 7. Some elements in period 7 have not yet been named. They are represented by temporary three-letter symbols, such as Uub. The number of each period represents the number of energy levels that have electrons in them for atoms of each element in that period. Q: Find calcium (Ca) in the Figure 2.94. How many energy levels have electrons in them for atoms of calcium? A: Calcium is in period 4, so its atoms have electrons in them for the first four energy levels. 
Groups of the  Modern  Periodic  Table 	  Columns of the modern table are called groups, as they are in Mendeleev’s table. However, the modern table has many more groups—18 compared with just 8 in Mendeleev’s table. Elements in the same group have similar properties. For example, all elements in group 18 are colorless, odorless gases, such as neon (Ne). (Neon is the element inside the light in opening photo C.) In contrast, all elements in group 1 are very reactive solids. They react explosively with water, as you can see in the video and Figure 2.95. URL (2:22) Click image to the left or use the URL below. The alkali metal sodium (Na) reacting with water. 
Classes of  Elements 	  All elements can be classified in one of three classes: metals, metalloids, or nonmetals. Elements in each class share certain basic properties. For example, elements in the metals class can conduct electricity, whereas elements in the nonmetals class generally cannot. Elements in the metalloids class fall in between the metals and nonmetals in their properties. An example of a metalloid is arsenic (As). (Arsenic is the element in opening photo B.) In the periodic table above, elements are color coded to show their class. As you move from left to right across each period of the table, the elements change from metals to metalloids to nonmetals. Q: To which class of elements does copper (Cu) belong: metal, metalloid, or nonmetal? Identify three other elements in this class. A: In the Figure 2.94, the cell for copper is colored blue. This means that copper belongs to the metals class. Other elements in the metals class include iron (Fe), sodium (Na), and gold (Au). It is apparent from the table that the majority of elements are metals. You can see videos about all of the elements in the modern periodic table at the URL below. Choose an element from each class and watch the video about it. URL

When you think of metals, do you think of solid objects such as iron nails and gold jewelry? If so, it might surprise you to learn that the shiny liquid pouring out of the pipette in the photo above is also a metal. It’s called mercury, and it’s the only metal that normally exists on Earth as a liquid. Just what are metals, and what are their properties? Read on to find out. What Are Metals? Metals are elements that can conduct electricity. They are one of three classes of elements (the other two classes are nonmetals and metalloids). Metals are by far the largest of the three classes. In fact, most elements are metals. All of the elements on the left side and in the middle of the periodic table, except for hydrogen, are metals. There are several different types of metals, including alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table, alkaline Earth metals in group 2, and transition metals in groups 3–12. The majority of metals are transition metals. 
Properties of  Metals 	  Elements in the same class share certain basic similarities. In addition to conducting electricity, many metals have several other shared properties, including those listed below. You can dig deeper into the properties of metals at this • Metals have relatively high melting points. This explains why all metals except for mercury are solids at room temperature. • Most metals are good conductors of heat. That’s why metals such as iron, copper, and aluminum are used for pots and pans. • Metals are generally shiny. This is because they reflect much of the light that strikes them. The mercury pictured above is very shiny. • The majority of metals are ductile. This means that they can be pulled into long, thin shapes, like the aluminum electric wires pictured in the Figure 2.96. • Metals tend to be malleable. This means that they can be formed into thin sheets without breaking. An example is aluminum foil, also pictured in the Figure 2.96. Q: The defining characteristic of metals is their ability to conduct electricity. Why do you think metals have this property? A: The properties of metals—as well as of elements in the other classes—depend mainly on the number and arrangement of their electrons. 
Explaining the  Properties of  Metals 	  To understand why metals can conduct electricity, consider the metal lithium as an example. An atom of lithium is modeled below. Look at lithium’s electrons. There are two electrons at the first energy level. This energy level can hold only two electrons, so it is full in lithium. The second energy level is another story. It can hold a maximum of eight electrons, but in lithium it has just one. A full outer energy level is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Lithium would need to gain seven electrons to fill its outer energy level and make it stable. It’s far easier for lithium to give up its one electron in energy level 2, leaving it with a full outer energy level (now level 1). Electricity is a flow of electrons. Because lithium (like most other metals) easily gives up its “extra” electron, it is a good conductor of electricity. This tendency to give up electrons also explains other properties of metals such as lithium. 
Summary 	  • Metals are elements that can conduct electricity. Most elements are metals. • All metals except for mercury are solids at room temperature. Many metals are shiny, ductile, and malleable. Most are also good conductors of heat. • Electricity is a flow of electrons. Atoms of metals tend to give up electrons, explaining why they are good conductors of electricity. The tendency to give up electrons also explains many of the other properties of metals. At the following URL, click on any one of the metals in the interactive periodic table. Read the information provided about your choice of metal, and then make a poster demonstrating its structures, properties, and uses. URL • Identify the nonmetals class of elements. • List properties of nonmetals. • Explain why nonmetals vary in their reactivity and cannot conduct electricity. The three pure substances pictured above have the distinction of being among the top ten elements that make up the human body. All three of them belong to the class of elements called nonmetals. Most of the elements that comprise the human body—as well as the majority of other living things—are nonmetals. In fact, seven of the top ten elements in your own body belong to this class of elements. What do you know about nonmetals? What are their properties, and how are they different from other elements? In this article, you’ll find out. What Are Nonmetals? Nonmetals are elements that generally do not conduct electricity. They are one of three classes of elements (the other two classes are metals and metalloids.) Nonmetals are the second largest of the three classes after metals. They are the elements located on the right side of the periodic table. Q: From left to right across each period (row) of the periodic table, each element has atoms with one more proton and one more electron than the element before it. How might this be related to the properties of nonmetals? A: Because nonmetals are on the right side of the periodic table, they have more electrons in their outer energy level than elements on the left side or in the middle of the periodic table. The number of electrons in the outer energy level of an atom determines many of its properties. 
Properties of  Nonmetals 	  As their name suggests, nonmetals generally have properties that are very different from the properties of metals. Properties of nonmetals include a relatively low boiling point, which explains why many of them are gases at room temperature. However, some nonmetals are solids at room temperature, including the three pictured above, and one nonmetal—bromine—is a liquid at room temperature. Other properties of nonmetals are illustrated and described in the Table 2.10. 
Illustration 	  TABLE 2.10: (continued) 
Property 	  Most nonmetals are poor conductors of heat. In fact, they are such poor conductors of heat that they are often used for insulation. For example, the down filling in this sleeping bag is full of air, which consists primarily of the nonmetal gases oxygen and nitrogen. These gases prevent body heat from escaping to the cold outside air. 
Solid nonmetals are generally dull and brittle like these 	  pieces of iodine. Like other nonmetals, iodine lacks the luster of metals and will easily crack and crumble. 
Reactivity of  Nonmetals 	  Reactivity is how likely an element is to react chemically with other elements. Some nonmetals are extremely reactive, whereas others are completely nonreactive. What explains this variation in nonmetals? The answer is their number of valence electrons. These are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that are involved in interactions with other atoms. Let’s look at two examples of nonmetals, fluorine and neon. Simple atomic models of these two elements are shown in the Figure 2.97. Q: Which element, fluorine or neon, do you predict is more reactive? A: Fluorine is more reactive than neon. That’s because it has seven of eight possible electrons in its outer energy level, whereas neon already has eight electrons in this energy level. Although neon has just one more electron than fluorine in its outer energy level, that one electron makes a huge difference. Fluorine needs one more electron to fill its outer energy level in order to have the most stable arrangement of electrons. Therefore, fluorine readily accepts an electron from any element that is equally “eager” to give one up, such as the metal lithium or sodium. As a result, fluorine is highly reactive. In fact, reactions with fluorine are often explosive, as you can see in the URL below. Neon, on the other hand, already has a full outer energy level. It is already very stable and never reacts with other elements. It neither accepts nor gives up electrons. Neon doesn’t even react with fluorine, which reacts with all other elements except helium. URL (6:42) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Why  Most  Nonmetals  Cannot  Conduct  Electricity 	  Like most other nonmetals, fluorine cannot conduct electricity, and its electrons explain this as well. An electric current is a flow of electrons. Elements that readily give up electrons (the metals) can carry electric current because their electrons can flow freely. Elements that gain electrons instead of giving them up cannot carry electric current. They hold onto their electrons so they cannot flow. 
Summary 	  • Nonmetals are elements that generally cannot conduct electricity. They are the second largest class of elements after metals. Examples of nonmetals include hydrogen, carbon, chlorine, and helium. • Properties of nonmetals include a relatively low boiling point, so many nonmetals are gases. Nonmetals are also poor conductors of heat, and solid nonmetals are dull and brittle. • Some nonmetals are very reactive, whereas others are not reactive at all. It depends on the number of electrons in their outer energy level. • Reactive nonmetals tend to gain electrons. This explains why they cannot conduct electricity, which is a flow of electrons.

How does he test them? • Identify the metalloids class of elements. • List physical properties of metalloids. • Explain why some metalloids react like metals and others react like nonmetals. What is this intricate orb? It is the greatly magnified skeleton of single-celled ocean organisms call radiolarian. The skeleton is made of an element that is extremely common on Earth. In fact, it is the second most abundant element in Earth’s crust. It is also one of the most common elements in the entire universe. What is this important element? Its name is silicon, and it belongs to a class of elements called metalloids. 
What  Are  Metalloids 	  Metalloids are the smallest class of elements. (The other two classes of elements are metals and nonmetals). There are just six metalloids. In addition to silicon, they include boron, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. Metalloids fall between metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. They also fall between metals and nonmetals in terms of their properties. Q: How does the position of an element in the periodic table influence its properties? A: Elements are arranged in the periodic table by their atomic number, which is the number of protons in their atoms. Atoms are neutral in electric charge, so they always have the same number of electrons as protons. It is the number of electrons in the outer energy level of atoms that determines most of the properties of elements. 
Chemical  Properties of  Metalloids 	  How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of electrons in the outer energy level of their atoms. Metalloids have from three to six electrons in their outer energy level. Boron, pictured in the Figure 2.98, is the only metalloid with just three electrons in its outer energy level. It tends to act like metals by giving up its electrons in chemical reactions. Metalloids with more than four electrons in their outer energy level (arsenic, antimony, and tellurium) tend to act like nonmetals by gaining electrons in chemical reactions. Those with exactly four electrons in their outer energy level (silicon and germanium) may act like either metals or nonmetals, depending on the other elements in the reaction. 
Physical  Properties of  Metalloids 	  Most metalloids have some physical properties of metals and some physical properties of nonmetals. For example, metals are good conductors of both heat and electricity, whereas nonmetals generally cannot conduct heat or electricity. And metalloids? They fall between metals and nonmetals in their ability to conduct heat, and if they can conduct electricity, they usually can do so only at higher temperatures. Metalloids that can conduct electricity at higher temperatures are called semiconductors. Silicon is an example of a semiconductor. It is used to make the tiny electric circuits in computer chips. You can see a sample of silicon and a silicon chip in the Figure 2.99. Metalloids tend to be shiny like metals but brittle like nonmetals. Because they are brittle, they may chip like glass or crumble to a powder if struck. Other physical properties of metalloids are more variable, including their boiling and melting points, although all metalloids exist as solids at room temperature. You can learn about the properties of specific metalloids by watching the video at this URL: URL (6:50) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • Metalloids are the smallest class of elements, containing just six elements. They fall between metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. • How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of electrons in the outer energy level of their atoms. Metalloids may act either like metals or nonmetals in chemical reactions. • Most metalloids have some physical properties of metals and some physical properties of nonmetals. They fall between metals and nonmetals in their ability to conduct heat and electricity. They are shiny like metals but brittle like nonmetals. All exist as solids at room temperature. Because metalloids are similar in some ways to metals and in other ways to nonmetals, to understand metalloids you need to know about these other two classes of elements.

Did you ever play the card game called go fish? Players try to form groups of cards of the same value, such as four sevens, with the cards they are dealt or by getting cards from other players or the deck. This give and take of cards is a simple analogy for the way atoms give and take valence electrons in chemical reactions. What Are Valence Electrons? Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that can participate in interactions with other atoms. Valence electrons are generally the electrons that are farthest from the nucleus. As a result, they may be attracted as much or more by the nucleus of another atom than they are by their own nucleus. 
Electron  Dot  Diagrams 	  Because valence electrons are so important, atoms are often represented by simple diagrams that show only their valence electrons. These are called electron dot diagrams, and three are shown below. In this type of diagram, an element’s chemical symbol is surrounded by dots that represent the valence electrons. Typically, the dots are drawn as if there is a square surrounding the element symbol with up to two dots per side. An element never has more than eight valence electrons, so there can’t be more than eight dots per atom. Q: Carbon (C) has four valence electrons. What does an electron dot diagram for this element look like? A: An electron dot diagram for carbon looks like this: 
Valence  Electrons and the  Periodic  Table 	  The number of valence electrons in an atom is reflected by its position in the periodic table of the elements (see the periodic table in the Figure 2.100). Across each row, or period, of the periodic table, the number of valence electrons in groups 1–2 and 13–18 increases by one from one element to the next. Within each column, or group, of the table, all the elements have the same number of valence electrons. This explains why all the elements in the same group have very similar chemical properties. For elements in groups 1–2 and 13–18, the number of valence electrons is easy to tell directly from the periodic table. This is illustrated in the simplified periodic table in the Figure 2.101. It shows just the numbers of valence electrons in each of these groups. For elements in groups 3–12, determining the number of valence electrons is more complicated. You can learn more about the valence electrons of elements in these groups at this URL: URL olorado.edu/physics/2000/periodic_table/transition_elements.html . Q: Based on both periodic tables above ( Figures 2.100 and 2.101), what are examples of elements that have just one valence electron? What are examples of elements that have eight valence electrons? How many valence electrons does oxygen (O) have? A: Any element in group 1 has just one valence electron. Examples include hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na). Any element in group 18 has eight valence electrons (except for helium, which has a total of just two electrons). Examples include neon (Ne), argon (Ar), and krypton (Kr). Oxygen, like all the other elements in group 16, has six valence electrons. 
Valence  Electrons and  Reactivity 	  The table salt pictured in the Figure 2.102 contains two elements that are so reactive they are rarely found alone in nature. Instead, they undergo chemical reactions with other elements and form compounds. Table salt is the compound named sodium chloride (NaCl). It forms when an atom of sodium (Na) gives up an electron and an atom of chlorine (Cl) accepts it. When this happens, sodium becomes a positively charged ion (Na+), and chlorine becomes a negatively charged ion (Cl−). The two ions are attracted to each and join a matrix of interlocking sodium and chloride ions, forming a crystal of salt. Q: Why does sodium give up an electron? A: An atom of a group 1 element such as sodium has just one valence electron. It is “eager” to give up this electron in order to have a full outer energy level, because this will give it the most stable arrangement of electrons. You can see how this happens in the animation at the following URL and in the Figure 2.103. Group 2 elements with two valence electrons are almost as reactive as elements in group 1 for the same reason. URL Q: Why does chlorine accept the electron from sodium? A: An atom of a group 17 element such as chlorine has seven valence electrons. It is “eager” to gain an extra electron to fill its outer energy level and gain stability. Group 16 elements with six valence electrons are almost as reactive for the same reason. Atoms of group 18 elements have eight valence electrons (or two in the case of helium). These elements already have a full outer energy level, so they are very stable. As a result, they rarely if ever react with other elements. Elements in other groups vary in their reactivity but are generally less reactive than elements in groups 1, 2, 16, or Table salt (sodium chloride). Q: Find calcium (Ca) in the periodic table (see Figure 2.100). Based on its position in the table, how reactive do you think calcium is? Name another element with which calcium might react. A: Calcium is a group 2 element with two valence electrons. Therefore, it is very reactive and gives up electrons in chemical reactions. It is likely to react with an element with six valence electrons that “wants” to gain two electrons. This would be an element in group 6, such as oxygen. 
Valence  Electrons and  Electricity 	  Valence electrons also determine how well—if at all—the atoms of an element conduct electricity. The copper wires in the cable in the Figure 2.104 are coated with plastic. Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity, so it is used for wires that carry electric current. Plastic contains mainly carbon, which cannot conduct electricity, so it is used as insulation on the wires. Q: Why do copper and carbon differ in their ability to conduct electricity? A: Atoms of metals such as copper easily give up valence electrons. Their electrons can move freely and carry electric current. You can see in detail how this occurs at the URL below. Atoms of nonmetals such as the carbon, on the other hand, hold onto their electrons. Their electrons can’t move freely and carry current. URL A few elements, called metalloids, can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals. Examples include silicon and germanium in group 14. Both become better conductors at higher temperatures. These elements are called semiconductors. Q: How many valence electrons do atoms of silicon and germanium have? What happens to their valence electrons when the atoms are exposed to an electric field? A: Atoms of these two elements have four valence electrons. When the atoms are exposed to an electric field, the valence electrons move away from the atoms and allow current to flow. 
Summary 	  • Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that can participate in interactions with other atoms. • Because valence electrons are so important, atoms may be represented by electron dot diagrams that show only their valence electrons. • The number of valence electrons in atoms may cause them to be unreactive or highly reactive. For those atoms that are reactive, the number of valence electrons also determines whether they tend to give up or gain electrons in chemical reactions. • Metals, which easily give up electrons, can conduct electricity. Nonmetals, which attract electrons, generally cannot. Metalloids such as silicon and germanium can conduct electricity but not as well as metals.

All of the elements in group 9 have nine valence electrons. d. Elements with the most valence electrons are in group 18. • Identify the elements in group 1 of the periodic table. • Explain why group 1 elements are very reactive. • List other properties of alkali metals. You probably think of water as a substance that can put out fires. But some elements are so reactive that they burn in water. In fact, they virtually explode in water. That’s what is happening in the photo above. About 3 pounds of sodium were added to water, and the result was this explosive reaction. Why is sodium such a reactive element? In this lesson you will find out. 
The  First  Group 	  Sodium (Na) is an element in group 1 of the periodic table of the elements. This group (column) of the table is shown below. It includes the nonmetal hydrogen (H) and six metals that are called alkali metals. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have the same number of valence electrons. These are the electrons in their outer energy level that can be involved in chemical reactions. Valence electrons determine many of the properties of an element, so elements in the same group have similar properties. All the elements in group 1 have just one valence electron. This makes them very reactive. Q: Why does having just one valence electron make group 1 elements very reactive? A: With just one valence electron, group 1 elements are “eager” to lose that electron. Doing so allows them to achieve a full outer energy level and maximum stability. 
Reactivity of  Group 1  Elements 	  Hydrogen is a very reactive gas, and the alkali metals are even more reactive. In fact, they are the most reactive metals and, along with the elements in group 17, are the most reactive of all elements. The reactivity of alkali metals increases from the top to the bottom of the group, so lithium (Li) is the least reactive alkali metal and francium (Fr) is the most reactive. Because alkali metals are so reactive, they are found in nature only in combination with other elements. They often combine with group 17 elements, which are very “eager” to gain an electron. At the URL below, you can watch a video that shows just how reactive the alkali metals are. URL (2:22) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Other  Properties of  Alkali  Metals 	  Besides being very reactive, alkali metals share a number of other properties. • Alkali metals are all solids at room temperature. • Alkali metals are low in density, and some of them float on water. • Alkali metals are relatively soft. Some are even soft enough to cut with a knife, like the sodium pictured in the Figure 2.105. 
A  Closer  Look 	  Although all group 1 elements share certain properties, such as being very reactive, they are not alike in every way. Three different group 1 elements are described in more detail below ( Figures 2.106, 2.107, and 2.108). Notice the ways in which they differ from one another. 
Hydrogen has the smallest, lightest atoms 	  of all elements. 
Pure hydrogen is a 	  colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that is nontoxic but highly flammable. Hydrogen gas exists mainly as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules (H2), as shown in the diagram on the right. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and the third most abundant element on Earth, occurring mainly in compounds such as water. Q: Why do you think hydrogen gas usually exists as diatomic molecules? A: Each hydrogen atom has just one electron. When two hydrogen atoms bond together, they share a pair of electrons. The shared electrons fill their only energy level, giving them the most stable arrangement of electrons. 
Potassium is a soft, silvery metal 	  that ignites explosively in water. It easily loses its one valence electron to form positive potassium ions (K+), which are needed by all living cells. Potassium is so important for plants that it is found in almost all fertilizers, like the one shown here. 
Potassium is abundant in  Earth’s crust in 	  minerals such as feldspar. Q: Francium decays too quickly to form compounds with other elements. Which elements to you think it would bond with if it could? A: With one valence electron, francium would bond with a halogen element in group 17, which has seven valence electrons and needs one more to fill its outer energy level. Elements in group 17 include fluorine and chlorine. 
Summary 	  • Group 1 of the periodic table includes hydrogen and the alkali metals. • Because they have just one valence electron, group 1 elements are very reactive. As a result, they are found in nature only in combination with other elements. • Alkali metals are all solids at room temperature. They are relatively soft and low in density. • From the top to the bottom of group 1, the elements have heavier, more reactive atoms. At the following URL, click on “Group 1 data and graphs.” Use the data in the group 1 table to fill in the blanks below with either increases or decreases. URL From the top to the bottom of group 1, properties of the alkali metals change as follows: 
Francium has one of the largest, heaviest 	  atoms of all elements. 
Its one valence 	  electron is far removed from the nucleus, as you can see in the atomic model on the right, so it is easily removed from the atom. Francium is radioactive and quickly decays to form other elements such as radium. This is why francium is extremely rare in nature. Less than an ounce of francium is present on Earth at any given time. • Identify alkaline Earth metals. • List properties of alkaline Earth metals. • Explain why alkaline Earth metals are very reactive. Sparklers like the one this girl is holding make festive additions to many celebrations. You may use them yourself. But watch out if you do because their flames are really hot! The bright white flames are produced when magnesium burns. Magnesium is a lightweight metal that burns at a very high temperature. Other uses of magnesium include flash photography, flares, and fireworks. Magnesium is a metal in group 2 of the periodic table, which you will read about in this concept. 
The  Second  Group 	  Barium (Ba) is one of six elements in group 2 of the periodic table, which is shown below. Elements in this group are called alkaline Earth metals. These metals are silver or gray in color. They are relatively soft and low in density, although not as soft and lightweight as alkali metals. You can watch a brief video introduction to the alkaline Earth metals at this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Reactivity of  Alkaline  Earth  Metals 	  All alkaline Earth metals have similar properties because they all have two valence electrons. They readily give up their two valence electrons to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. As a result, they are very reactive, although not quite as reactive as the alkali metals in group 1. For example, alkaline Earth metals will react with cold water, but not explosively as alkali metals do. Because of their reactivity, alkaline Earth metals never exist as pure substances in nature. Instead, they are always found combined with other elements. The reactivity of alkaline Earth metals increases from the top to the bottom of the group. That’s because the atoms get bigger from the top to the bottom, so the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus. When valence electrons are farther from the nucleus, they are attracted less strongly by the nucleus and more easily removed from the atom. This makes the atom more reactive. Q: Alkali metals have just one valence electron. Why are alkaline Earth metals less reactive than alkali metals? A: It takes more energy to remove two valence electrons from an atom than one valence electron. This makes alkaline Earth metals with their two valence electrons less reactive than alkali metals with their one valence electron. 
Examples of  Alkaline  Earth  Metals 	  For a better understanding of alkaline Earth metals, let’s take a closer look at two of them: calcium (Ca) and strontium (Sr). Calcium is a soft, gray, nontoxic alkaline Earth metal. Although pure calcium doesn’t exist in nature, calcium compounds are very common in Earth’s crust and in sea water. Calcium is also the most abundant metal in the human body, occurring as calcium compounds such as calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. These calcium compounds are found in bones and make them hard and strong. The skeleton of the average adult contains about a kilogram of calcium. Because calcium—like barium—absorbs x-rays, bones show up white in x-ray images. Calcium is an important component of a healthy human diet. Good food sources of calcium are pictured in Figure Q: What health problems might result from a diet low in calcium? A: Children who don’t get enough calcium while their bones are forming may develop a deficiency disease called rickets, in which their bones are softer than normal and become bent and stunted. Adults who don’t get enough calcium may develop a condition called osteoporosis, in which the bones lose calcium and become weak and brittle. People with osteoporosis are at high risk of bone fractures. Strontium is a silver-colored alkaline Earth metal that is even softer than calcium. Strontium compounds are quite common and have a variety of uses—from fireworks to cement to toothpaste. In fireworks, strontium compounds produce deep red explosions. In toothpaste, like the one pictured in the Figure 2.110, the compound strontium chloride reduces tooth sensitivity. 
Summary 	  • Elements in group 2 of the periodic table are called alkaline Earth metals. They are silvery or gray in color. They are also relatively soft and low in density. • Alkaline Earth metals are very reactive because they readily give up their two valence electrons to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Reactivity increases from the top to the bottom of the group. • Examples of alkaline Earth metals include calcium, which is needed for strong bones, and strontium, which is used for making cement and other products.

What do all of the objects pictured above have in common? All of them are made completely or primarily of copper. Copper has an amazing variety of uses, including cooking pots, plumbing pipes, roofing tiles, jewelry, musical instruments, and electric wires. Copper is a good choice for these and many other objects because of its properties. It can be formed into wires and flat sheets, it’s a great conductor of heat and electricity, it’s hard and strong, and it doesn’t corrode easily. In all these ways, copper is a typical transition metal. What Are Transition Metals? Transition metals are all the elements in groups 3–12 of the periodic table. In the periodic table pictured in Figure all known elements. In addition to copper (Cu), well known examples of transition metals include iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) (Copper (Cu) is pictured in its various applications in the opening image). You can explore specific transition metals with the interactive periodic table at this URL: URL . Q: Transition metals have been called the most typical of all metals. What do you think this means? A: Unlike some other metals, transition metals have the properties that define the metals class. They are excellent conductors of electricity, for example, and they also have luster, malleability, and ductility. You can read more about these properties of transition metals below. 
Properties of  Transition  Metals 	  Transition metals are superior conductors of heat as well as electricity. They are malleable, which means they can be shaped into sheets, and ductile, which means they can be shaped into wires. They have high melting and boiling points, and all are solids at room temperature, except for mercury (Hg), which is a liquid. Transition metals are also high in density and very hard. Most of them are white or silvery in color, and they are generally lustrous, or shiny. The compounds that transition metals form with other elements are often very colorful. You can see several examples in the Figure 2.112. Some properties of transition metals set them apart from other metals. Compared with the alkali metals in group 1 and the alkaline Earth metals in group 2, the transition metals are much less reactive. They don’t react quickly with water or oxygen, which explains why they resist corrosion. Other properties of the transition metals are unique. They are the only elements that may use electrons in the next to highest—as well as the highest—energy level as valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons that form bonds with other elements in compounds and that generally determine the properties of elements. Transition metals are unusual in having very similar properties even with different numbers of valence electrons. The transition metals also include the only elements that produce a magnetic field. Three of them have this property: iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Q: How is the number of valence electrons typically related to the properties of elements? A: The number of valence electrons usually determines how reactive elements are as well as the ways in which they react with other elements. 
Those  Elements  Down  Under 	  Transition metals include the elements that are most often placed below the periodic table (the pinkand purpleshaded elements in the Figure 2.111). Those that follow lanthanum (La) are called lanthanides. They are all relatively reactive for transition metals. Those that follow actinium (Ac) are called actinides. They are all radioactive. This means that they are unstable, so they decay into different, more stable elements. Many of the actinides do not occur in nature but are made in laboratories. 
Summary 	  • Transition metals are all the elements in groups 3–12 of the periodic table. More than half of all elements are transition metals. • Transition metals are typical metals, with properties such as a superior ability to conduct electricity and heat. They also have the metallic properties of luster, malleability, and ductility. In addition, transition metals have high melting and boiling points and high density. • The lanthanides and actinides are the transition metals that are usually placed below the main part of the periodic table. Lanthanides are relatively reactive for transition metals, and actinides are radioactive.

Then write a paragraph comparing and contrasting the two elements. URL • Identify elements in groups 13–16 of the periodic table. • List properties of a metalloid from each of these groups. This image represents a famous ancient Egyptian named Tutankhamen. Do you see his heavy eyeliner? Most likely the eyeliner was made of a mineral containing antimony. This metalloid was commonly used for makeup by Egyptians between four and five thousand years ago. Today we know that antimony is toxic, although Tutankhamen probably didn’t know that. Antimony is found in group 15 of the periodic table. Group 15 is one of four groups of the periodic table that contain metalloids. 
Groups 13–16 	  Groups 13–16 of the periodic table (orange in the Figure 2.113) are the only groups that contain elements classified as metalloids. Unlike other groups of the periodic table, which contain elements in just one class, groups 13–16 contain elements in at least two different classes. In addition to metalloids, they also contain metals, nonmetals, or both. Groups 13–16 fall between the transition metals (in groups 3–12) and the nonmetals called halogens (in group What Are Metalloids? Metalloids are the smallest class of elements, containing just six members: boron (B), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and tellurium (Te). Metalloids have some properties of metals (elements that can conduct electricity) and some properties of nonmetals (elements that cannot conduct electricity). For example, most metalloids can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals. Metalloids also tend to be shiny like metals, but brittle like nonmetals. Chemically, metalloids may behave like metals or nonmetals, depending on their number of valence electrons. You can learn more about specific metalloids by clicking on the element symbols in the periodic table at this URL: URL . Q: Why does the chemical behavior of an element depend on its number of valence electrons? A: Valence electrons are the electrons in an atom’s outer energy level that may be involved in chemical reactions with other atoms. 
Group 13:  Boron  Group 	  Group 13 of the periodic table is also called the boron group because boron (B) is the first element at the top of the group (see Figure 2.114). Boron is also the only metalloid in this group. The other four elements in the group—aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), and thallium (Tl)—are all metals. Group 13 elements have three valence electrons and are fairly reactive. All of them are solids at room temperature. 
Group 14:  Carbon  Group 	  Group 14 of the periodic table is headed by the nonmetal carbon (C), so this group is also called the carbon group. Carbon is followed by silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) ( Figure 2.115), which are metalloids, and then by tin (Sn) and lead (Pb), which are metals. Group 14 elements group have four valence electrons, so they generally aren’t very

It is also used 	  to make fiber optic cables—like the one pictured here—that carry telephone and other communication signals. 
Group 15:  Nitrogen  Group 	  Group 15 of the periodic table is also called the nitrogen group. The first element in the group is the nonmetal nitrogen (N), followed by phosphorus (P), another nonmetal. Arsenic (As) ( Figure 2.116) and antimony (Sb) are the metalloids in this group, and bismuth (Bi) is a metal. All group 15 elements have five valence electrons, but they vary in their reactivity. Nitrogen, for example, is not very reactive at all, whereas phosphorus is very reactive and found naturally only in combination with other substances. All group 15 elements are solids, except for nitrogen, which is a gas. 
The most common form of the metalloid 	  arsenic is gray and shiny. Arsenic is extremely toxic, so it is used as rat poison. Surprisingly, we need it (in tiny amounts) for normal growth and a healthy nervous system. 
Group 16:  Oxygen  Group 	  Group 16 of the periodic table is also called the oxygen group. The first three elements—oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and selenium (Se)—are nonmetals. They are followed by tellurium (Te) ( Figure 2.117), a metalloid, and polonium (Po), a metal. All group 16 elements have six valence electrons and are very reactive. Oxygen is a gas at room temperature, and the other elements in the group are solids. Tellurium is a silvery white, brittle metalloid. 
It is toxic and may cause birth 	  defects. Tellurium can conduct electricity when exposed to light, so it is used to make solar panels. 
It has several other 	  uses as well. For example, it makes steel and copper easier to work with and lends color to ceramics. Q: With six valence electrons, group 16 elements need to attract two electrons from another element to have a stable electron arrangement of eight valence electrons. Which group of elements in the periodic table do you think might form compounds with elements in group 16? A: Group 2 elements, called the alkaline Earth metals, form compounds with elements in the oxygen group. That’s because group 2 elements have two valence electrons that they are “eager” to give up. An example of a group 2 and group 6 compound is calcium oxide (CaO). 
Summary 	  • Groups 13–16 of the periodic table contain one or more metalloids, in addition to metals, nonmetals, or both. • Group 13 is called the boron group, and boron is the only metalloid in this group. The other group 13 elements are metals. • Group 14 is called the carbon group. This group contains two metalloids: silicon and germanium.

You’ve probably seen halogen lights like the ones pictured here. You may even have halogen lights in your home. If you do, you may have noticed that they get really hot and give off a lot of light for their size. A halogen light differs from a regular incandescent light bulb in having a small amount of halogen gas inside the bulb. The gas combines chemically with the metal in the filament, and this extends the life of the filament. It allows the lamp to get hotter and give off more light than a regular incandescent light without burning out quickly. What is halogen gas, and which elements are halogens? In this article, you’ll find out. 
Meet the  Halogens 	  Halogens are highly reactive nonmetallic elements in group 17 of the periodic table. As you can see in the periodic table shown in the Figure 2.118, the halogens include the elements fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). All of them are relatively common on Earth except for astatine. Astatine is radioactive and rapidly decays to other, more stable elements. As a result, it is one of the least common elements on Earth. Q: Based on their position in the periodic table from the Figure 2.118, how many valence electrons do you think halogens have? A: The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in group 1. It then increases by one from left to right across each period (row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18. Therefore, halogens have seven valence electrons. 
Chemical  Properties of  Halogens 	  The halogens are among the most reactive of all elements, although reactivity declines from the top to the bottom of the halogen group. Because all halogens have seven valence electrons, they are “eager” to gain one more electron. Doing so gives them a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Halogens often combine with alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table. Alkali metals have just one valence electron, which they are equally “eager” to donate. Reactions involving halogens, especially halogens near the top of the group, may be explosive. You can see some examples in the video at the URL below. (Warning: Don’t try any of these reactions at home!) URL (1:00) Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Physical  Properties of  Halogens 	  The halogen group is quite diverse. It includes elements that occur in three different states of matter at room temperature. Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine and astatine are solids. Halogens also vary in color, as you can see in the Figure 2.119. Fluorine and chlorine are green, bromine is red, and iodine and astatine are nearly black. Like other nonmetals, halogens cannot conduct electricity or heat. Compared with most other elements, halogens have relatively low melting and boiling points. You can watch a lab demonstration of the melting and boiling points of halogens at this URL: URL . 
Uses of  Halogens 	  Most halogens have a variety of important uses. A few are described in the Table 2.11. 
Fluorine helps prevent tooth decay, so it is added to 	  toothpaste as the compound sodium fluoride. You can learn how it protects teeth at this URL: URL nimated-teeth.com/tooth_decay/t4_tooth_decay_flu oride.htm . Chlorine is the active ingredient in household bleach. It removes stains from clothes. It can also be used to disinfect countertops and other surfaces. 
Halogen 	  TABLE 2.11: (continued) 
Bromine is used to purify water in swimming pools and 	  hot tubs. It reacts with bacteria and other germs and renders them harmless. Iodine is added to alcohol and used as an antiseptic. It reacts with germs on cuts and wounds. Small amounts of iodine are also needed for good health. 
U. S., iodine is added to table salt to prevent iodine 	  deficiencies. Does the salt you use contain iodine? Q: Can you relate some of these uses of halogens to the properties of these elements? A: The ability of halogens to kill germs and bleach clothes relates to their highly reactive nature. 
Summary 	  • Halogens are highly reactive nonmetal elements in group 17 of the periodic table. • Halogens include solids, liquids, and gases at room temperature, and they vary in color. • Halogens are among the most reactive of all elements. They have seven valence electrons, so they are very “eager” to gain one electron to have a full outer energy level. • Halogens have a variety of important uses, such as preventing tooth decay and killing germs. The Table 2.12 gives the melting and boiling points of halogens. Create a graph with the data, and then describe in words the trends that you see in your graph. 
Astatine 	  Melting Point (°C) -220 -101 -7 Boiling Point (°C) -188 -35 • Identify the noble gases. • List properties of noble gases. • Explain the nonreactivity of noble gases and how it is related to the octet rule. Okay, helium balloons are light, but they’re not that light! This fanciful picture serves to make the point that helium is one of the lightest elements. Helium belongs to a group of elements called the noble gases. What Are Noble Gases? Noble gases are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the periodic table. As you can see in the periodic table in Figure 2.120, noble gases include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). All noble gases are colorless and odorless. They also have low boiling points, explaining why they are gases at room temperature. Radon, at the bottom of the group, is radioactive, so it constantly decays to other elements. For an excellent overview of the noble gases, watch the video at this URL: URL (4:53) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • To learn how the noble gases were discovered, go to this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. • To explore specific noble gases, click on their symbols in the periodic table at this URL: URL m/ . Q: Based on their position in the periodic table ( Figure 2.120), how many valence electrons do you think noble gases have? A: The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in group 1. It then increases by one from left to right across each period (row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18. Therefore, noble gases have eight valence electrons. 
Chemical  Properties of  Noble  Gases 	  Noble gases are the least reactive of all known elements. That’s because with eight valence electrons, their outer energy levels are full. The only exception is helium, which has just two electrons. But helium also has a full outer energy level, because its only energy level (energy level 1) can hold a maximum of two electrons. A full outer energy level is the most stable arrangement of electrons. As a result, noble gases cannot become more stable by reacting with other elements and gaining or losing valence electrons. Therefore, noble gases are rarely involved in chemical reactions and almost never form compounds with other elements. 
Noble  Gases and the  Octet  Rule 	  Because the noble gases are the least reactive of all elements, their eight valence electrons are used as the standard for nonreactivity and to explain how other elements interact. This is stated as the octet (“group of eight”) rule. According to this rule, atoms react to form compounds that allow them to have a group of eight valence electrons like the noble gases. For example, sodium (with one valence electron) reacts with chlorine (with seven valence electrons) to form the stable compound sodium chloride (table salt). In this reaction, sodium donates an electron and chlorine accepts it, giving each element an octet of valence electrons. 
Some  Uses of  Noble  Gases 	  Did you ever get helium balloons like those in the opening picture? Unlike a balloon filled with air, a balloon filled with helium needs to be weighted down so it won’t float away —although you don’t have to use an elephant!. Q: Why does a helium balloon float away if it’s not weighted down? A: Helium atoms have just two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons, so they have less mass than any other atoms except hydrogen. As a result, helium is lighter than air, explaining why a helium balloon floats up into the air unless weighted down. Early incandescent light bulbs, like the one pictured in the Figure 2.121, didn’t last very long. The filaments quickly burned out. Although air was pumped out of the bulb, it wasn’t a complete vacuum. Oxygen in the small amount of air remaining inside the light bulb reacted with the metal filament. This corroded the filament and caused dark deposits on the glass. Filling a light bulb with argon gas prevents these problems. That’s why modern light bulbs are filled with argon. Q: How does argon prevent the problems of early light bulbs? A: As a noble gas with eight electrons, argon doesn’t react with the metal in the filament. This protects the filament and keeps the glass blub free of deposits. Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure 2.122. Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. 
Summary 	  • Noble gases are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the periodic table. • Noble gases are the least reactive of all elements. That’s because they have eight valence electrons, which fill their outer energy level. This is the most stable arrangement of electrons, so noble gases rarely react with other elements and form compounds. • The octet rule states that atoms react to form compounds that allow them to have eight valence electrons like the noble gases, which are the least reactive elements. • Noble gases are used for balloons, light bulbs, and lighted signs.

Introduction 	  Yummy! S’mores are on the way! Did you ever toast marshmallows over a campfire? The sweet treats singe on the outside and melt on the inside. Both the fire and the toasted marshmallows are evidence of chemical changes. In the process of burning, the wood changes to ashes and gases, and the outside of the marshmallow turns brown and crispy. Neither the wood nor the marshmallows can change back to their original form. That’s because burning is a chemical change and chemical changes are often impossible to undo. In this unit, you’ll learn about many types of chemical changes, including how they occur and why you can’t live without them. • Define chemical bond. • Explain why chemical bonds form. • Compare and contrast types of chemical bonds. Did you ever make cupcakes from scratch? You mix together flour, sugar, eggs, and other ingredients to make the batter, put the batter into cupcake papers, and then put them into the oven to bake. The cupcakes that come out of the oven after baking are different from any of the individual ingredients that went into the batter. Like the ingredients that join together to make cupcakes, atoms of different elements can join together to form entirely different substances called compounds. In cupcakes, the eggs and other wet ingredients cause the dry ingredients to stick together. What causes elements to stick together in compounds? The answer is chemical bonds. What Is a Chemical Bond? A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions. Bonds form when atoms share or transfer valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that may be involved in chemical interactions. Valence electrons are the basis of all chemical bonds. For a video introduction to chemical bonds, go to this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: Why do you think that chemical bonds form? A: Chemical bonds form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons. 
Why  Bonds  Form 	  To understand why chemical bonds form, consider the common compound known as water, or H2O. It consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom. As you can see in the on the left side of the Figure 3.1, each hydrogen atom has just one electron, which is also its sole valence electron. The oxygen atom has six valence electrons. These are the electrons in the outer energy level of the oxygen atom. In the water molecule on the right in the Figure 3.1, each hydrogen atom shares a pair of electrons with the oxygen atom. By sharing electrons, each atom has electrons available to fill its sole or outer energy level. The hydrogen atoms each have a pair of shared electrons, so their first and only energy level is full. The oxygen atom has a total of eight valence electrons, so its outer energy level is full. A full outer energy level is the most stable possible arrangement of electrons. It explains why elements form chemical bonds with each other. 
Types of  Chemical  Bonds 	  Not all chemical bonds form in the same way as the bonds in water. There are actually three different types of chemical bonds, called covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds. Each type of bond is described below. You can learn more about the three types by watching this video: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. For an entertaining song comparing covalent and ionic bonds, go to this URL: URL 
Yr U-7 Sf 	  • A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two nonmetal atoms that share a pair of electrons. One electron is provided by each atom, and the pair of electrons is attracted to the positive nuclei of both atoms. The water molecule represented in the Figure 3.1 contains covalent bonds. • An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together oppositely charged ions. Ionic bonds form crystals instead of molecules. Table salt contains ionic bonds. • A metallic bond is the force of attraction between a positive metal ion and the valence electrons that surround it—both its own valence electrons and those of other ions of the same metal. The ions and electrons form a lattice-like structure. Only metals, such as the copper pictured in the Figure 3.2, form metallic bonds. Metallic bonds explain many of the properties of metals. This coil of wire is made of the metal copper. Like other metals, copper is shiny, can be formed into wires, and conducts electricity. 
Summary 	  • A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions. Bonds form when atoms share or transfer valence electrons. • Atoms form chemical bonds to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. • There are three different types of chemical bonds: covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds. Watch the video about covalent bonds at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.

Look at all the colors you can make by mixing together just a few colors of paint. In the photo above, the rainbow of colors on the brush formed from just four paint colors: green, yellow, red, and blue. The same thing is true of matter in general. By combining just a few different elements, you can form many different chemical compounds. What Are Compounds? A compound is a unique substance that forms when two or more elements combine chemically. Compounds form as a result of chemical reactions. The elements in compounds are held together by chemical bonds. A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions that share or transfer valence electrons. For a video introduction to compounds, go to this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Water is an example of a common chemical compound. As you can see in the Figure 3.3, each water molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Water always has this 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen. All water molecules have two hydrogen atoms (gray) and one oxygen atom (blue). Like water, all compounds consist of a fixed ratio of elements. compound there is. It always has the same composition. Q: Sometimes the same elements combine in different ratios. How can this happen if a compound always consists of the same elements in the same ratio? A: If the same elements combine in different ratios, they form different compounds. 
Same  Elements,  Different  Compounds 	  Look at the Figure 3.4 of water (H2O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and read about these two compounds. Both compounds consist of hydrogen and oxygen, but they have different ratios of the two elements. As a result, water and hydrogen peroxide are different compounds with different properties. If you’ve ever used hydrogen peroxide to disinfect a cut, then you know that it is very different from water! Water: Water is odorless and colorless. We drink it, bathe in it, and use it to wash our clothes. In fact, we can’t live without it. 
Hydrogen  Peroxide:  Hydrogen peroxide is 	  also odorless and colorless. 
It’s used as 	  an antiseptic to kill germs on cuts. It’s also used as bleach to remove color form hair. Q: Read the Figure 3.5 about carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). Both compounds consist of carbon and oxygen, but in different ratios. How can you tell that carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are different compounds? A: You can tell that they are different compounds from their very different properties. Carbon dioxide is a harmless gas that living things add to the atmosphere during respiration. Carbon monoxide is a deadly gas that can quickly kill people if it becomes too concentrated in the air. Carbon Dioxide: Every time you exhale, you release carbon dioxide into the air. It’s an odorless, colorless gas. Carbon dioxide contributes to global climate change, but it isn’t directly harmful to human health. Carbon Monoxide: Carbon monoxide is produced when matter burns. 
It’s a colorless, odorless gas that is very 	  harmful to human health. 
In fact, it can 	  kill people in minutes. Because you can’t see or smell carbon monoxide, it must be detected with an alarm. 
Types of  Compounds 	  There are two basic types of compounds that differ in the nature of the bonds that hold their atoms or ions together. They are covalent and ionic compounds. Both types are described below. You can learn more about the properties of covalent and ionic compounds at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Covalent compounds consist of atoms that are held together by covalent bonds. These bonds form between nonmetals that share valence electrons. Covalent compounds exist as individual molecules. Water is an example of a covalent compound. • Ionic compounds consist of ions that are held together by ionic bonds. These bonds form when metals transfer electrons to nonmetals. Ionic compounds exist as a matrix of many ions, called a crystal. Sodium chloride (table salt) is an example of an ionic compound.

You can make a simple salad dressing using just the two ingredients pictured above: oil and vinegar. Recipes for oil-and-vinegar salad dressing vary, but they typically include about three parts oil to one part vinegar, or a ratio of of vinegar. Chemical compounds also have “ingredients” in a certain ratio. However, unlike oil-and-vinegar salad dressing, a chemical compound always has exactly the same ratio of elements. This ratio can be represented by a chemical formula. 
Representing  Compounds 	  In a chemical formula, the elements in a compound are represented by their chemical symbols, and the ratio of different elements is represented by subscripts. Consider the compound water as an example. Each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Therefore, the chemical formula for water is: 
H2 	  The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen in the molecule. The O for oxygen has no subscript. When there is just one atom of an element in a molecule, no subscript is used in the chemical formula. 
Formulas for  Ionic and  Covalent  Compounds 	  The Table 3.1 shows four examples of compounds and their chemical formulas. The first two compounds are ionic compounds, and the second two are covalent compounds. Each formula shows the ratio of ions or atoms that make up the compound.

Look at the photos of bar magnets in the opening image. At first glance, the two photos look very similar, but they differ in one important way. In the top photo, the north (blue) poles of both magnets are placed close together. In the bottom photo, the north pole of one magnet is placed close to the south (red) pole of the other magnet. Now look closely at the iron filings in the two photos. The ion filings show the force of repulsion between the two north poles in the top photo and the force of attraction between the north and south poles in the bottom photo. Like the poles of magnets, electric charges repel or attract each other. Two positive or two negative charges repel each other, and two opposite charges attract each other. The attraction of opposite electric charges explains how ionic bonds form. 
How  Ionic  Bonds  Form 	  An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together positive and negative ions. It forms when atoms of a metallic element give up electrons to atoms of a nonmetallic element. The Figure 3.6 shows how this happens. In row 1 of the Figure 3.6, an atom of sodium (Na) donates an electron to an atom of chlorine (Cl). • By losing an electron, the sodium atom becomes a sodium ion. It now has more protons than electrons and a charge of +1. Positive ions such as sodium are given the same name as the element. The chemical symbol has a plus sign to distinguish the ion from an atom of the element. The symbol for a sodium ion is Na+. • By gaining an electron, the chlorine atom becomes a chloride ion. It now has more electrons than protons and a charge of -1. Negative ions are named by adding the suffix –ide to the first part of the element name. The symbol for chloride is Cl−. Sodium and chloride ions have equal but opposite charges. Opposite electric charges attract each other, so sodium and chloride ions cling together in a strong ionic bond. You can see this in row 2 of the Figure 3.6. (Brackets separate the ions in the diagram to show that the ions in the compound do not actually share electrons.) When ionic bonds hold ions together, they form an ionic compound. The compound formed from sodium and chloride ions is named sodium chloride. It is commonly called table salt. You can see an animation of sodium chloride forming at this URL: URL 
Why  Ionic  Bonds  Form 	  Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals. That’s because metals “want” to give up electrons, and nonmetals “want” to gain electrons. Find sodium (Na) in the Figure 3.7. Sodium is an alkali metal in group 1. Like all group 1 elements, it has just one valence electron. If sodium loses that one electron, it will have a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Now find fluorine (F) in the periodic table Figure gains one electron, it will also have a full outer energy level and the most stable arrangement of electrons. Q: Predict what other elements might form ionic bonds. A: Metals on the left and in the center of the periodic table form ionic bonds with nonmetals on the right of the periodic table. For example, alkali metals in group 1 form ionic bonds with halogen nonmetals in group 17. 
Energy and  Ionic  Bonds 	  It takes energy to remove valence electrons from an atom because the force of attraction between the negative electrons and the positive nucleus must be overcome. The amount of energy needed depends on the element. Less energy is needed to remove just one or a few valence electrons than many. This explains why sodium and other alkali metals form positive ions so easily. Less energy is also needed to remove electrons from larger atoms in the same group. For example, in group 1, it takes less energy to remove an electron from francium (Fr) at the bottom of the group than from lithium (Li) at the top of the group (see the Figure 3.7). In bigger atoms, valence electrons are farther from the nucleus. As a result, the force of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus is weaker. Q: What do you think happens when an atom gains an electron and becomes a negative ion? A: Energy is released when an atom gains an electron. Halogens release the most energy when they form ions. As a result, they are very reactive elements. 
Summary 	  • An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together positive and negative ions. It forms when atoms of a metallic element give up electrons to atoms of a nonmetallic element. • Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals. That’s because metals “want” to give up electrons, and nonmetals “want” to gain electrons. • It takes energy to remove valence electrons from an atom and form a positive ion. Energy is released when an atom gains valence electrons and forms a negative ion. Fill in the ionic bonding worksheet at the following URL. URL bonds. Which type of atom requires more energy to become an ion? Why? • Describe ionic compounds and how they form. • Explain how ionic compounds are named. • Identify properties and uses of ionic compounds. The truck pictured above is spreading crystals of the salt calcium chloride on a snowy road to prevent ice from forming. The crystals lower the freezing point of water so when the snow melts, it won’t turn to ice. Do you know why calcium chloride lowers the freezing point of water? The answer has to do with the type of compound that calcium chloride is. Calcium chloride is an ionic compound. What Are Ionic Compounds? All compounds form when atoms of different elements share or transfer electrons. Compounds in which electrons are transferred from one atom to another are called ionic compounds. In this type of compound, electrons actually move between the atoms, rather than being shared between them. When atoms give up or accept electrons in this way, they become charged particles called ions. The ions are held together by ionic bonds, which form an ionic compound. Ionic compounds generally form between elements that are metals and elements that are nonmetals. For example, the metal calcium (Ca) and the nonmetal chlorine (Cl) form the ionic compound calcium chloride (CaCl2). In this compound, there are two negative chloride ions for each positive calcium ion. Because the positive and negative charges cancel out, an ionic compound is neutral in charge. Q: Now can you explain why calcium chloride prevents ice from forming on a snowy road? A: If calcium chloride dissolves in water, it breaks down into its ions (Ca2+ and Cl−). When water has ions dissolved in it, it has a lower freezing point. Pure water freezes at 0°C. With calcium and chloride ions dissolved in it, it won’t freeze unless the temperature reaches -29°C or lower. 
Crystals 	  Many compounds form molecules, but ionic compounds form crystals instead. A crystal consists of many alternating positive and negative ions bonded together in a matrix. Look at the crystal of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the Figure bonds. 
Sodium chloride crystals are cubic in 	  shape. Other ionic compounds may have crystals with different shapes. You can watch a short video at the following URL to see how sodium and chlorine combine to form sodium chloride: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Naming  Ionic  Compounds 	  Ionic compounds are named for their positive and negative ions. The name of the positive ion always comes first, followed by the name of the negative ion. For example, positive sodium ions and negative chloride ions form the compound named sodium chloride. Similarly, positive calcium ions and negative chloride ions form the compound named calcium chloride. Q: What is the name of the ionic compound that is composed of positive barium ions and negative iodide ions? A: The compound is named barium iodide. 
Properties of  Ionic  Compounds 	  The crystal structure of ionic compounds is strong and rigid. It takes a lot of energy to break all those ionic bonds. As a result, ionic compounds are solids with high melting and boiling points. You can see the melting and boiling points of several different ionic compounds in the Table 3.2. To appreciate how high they are, consider that the melting and boiling points of water, which is not an ionic compound, are 0°C and 100°C, respectively. TABLE 3.2: Melting and Boiling Points of a Few Ionic Compounds 
Ionic  Compound 	  Sodium chloride (NaCl) Calcium chloride (CaCl2) Barium oxide (BaO) Iron bromide (FeBr3) Melting Point (°C) Boiling Point (°C) Solid ionic compounds are poor conductors of electricity. The strong bonds between their oppositely charged ions lock them into place in the crystal. Therefore, the charged particles cannot move freely and carry electric current, which is a flow of charge. But all that changes when ionic compounds dissolve in water. When they dissolve, they separate into individual ions. The ions can move freely, so they can carry current. Dissolved ionic compounds are called electrolytes. The rigid crystals of ionic compounds are brittle. They are more likely to break than bend when struck. As a result, ionic crystals tend to shatter easily. Try striking salt crystals with a hammer and you’ll find that they readily break into smaller pieces.

Uses of  Ionic  Compounds 	  Ionic compounds have many uses. Some are shown in the Figure 3.9. Many ionic compounds are used in industry. The human body needs several ions for good health. Having low levels of the ions can endanger important functions such as heartbeat. Solutions of ionic compounds can be used to restore the ions. 
Summary 	  • Ionic compounds consist of oppositely charged ions that are held together by ionic bonds. The opposite charges cancel out so ionic compounds have a net neutral charge. Ionic compounds form when metals transfer valence electrons to nonmetals. • Ionic compounds exist as crystals rather than molecules. A crystal consists of many alternating positive and negative ions bonded together in a matrix. • Ionic compounds are named for their positive metal ion first, followed by their negative nonmetal ion. • Ionic compounds are solids with high melting and boiling points. They are good conductors of electricity but only when dissolved in water. Their crystals are rigid and brittle. • Ionic compounds have many uses in industry. They are also needed by humans and other living things. Watch the tutorial on ionic compounds at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.

What is the formula for this compound? and structure of this compound. • Define covalent bond. • Describe covalent compounds and diatomic elements. • Explain why covalent bonds form. In a tennis match, two players keep hitting the ball back and forth. The ball bounces from one player to the other, over and over again. The ball keeps the players moving together on the court. What if the two players represented the nuclei of two atoms and the ball represented valence electrons? What would the back and forth movement of the ball represent? The answer is a covalent bond. 
Sharing  Electrons 	  A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two atoms that share a pair of valence electrons. The shared electrons are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms. This forms a molecule consisting of two or more atoms. Covalent bonds form only between atoms of nonmetals. 
Covalent  Compounds and  Diatomic  Elements 	  The two atoms that are held together by a covalent bond may be atoms of the same element or different elements. When atoms of different elements form covalent bonds, a new substance, called a covalent compound, results. Water is an example of a covalent compound. A water molecule is modeled in the Figure 3.10. A molecule is the smallest particle of a covalent compound that still has the properties of the compound. Q: How many valence electrons does the oxygen atom (O) share with each hydrogen atom (H)? How many covalent bonds hold the water molecule together? A: The oxygen atom shares one pair of valence electrons with each hydrogen atom. Each pair of shared electrons represents one covalent bond, so two covalent bonds hold the water molecule together. The diagram in the Figure 3.11 shows an example of covalent bonds between two atoms of the same element, in this case two atoms of oxygen. The diagram represents an oxygen molecule, so it’s not a new compound. Oxygen normally occurs in diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules. Several other elements also occur as diatomic molecules: hydrogen, nitrogen, and all but one of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). At the URL below, you can see an animation of electron sharing in a molecule of chlorine. URL Q: How many electrons do these two oxygen atoms share? How many covalent bonds hold the oxygen molecule together? A: The two oxygen atoms share two pairs of electrons, so two covalent bonds hold the oxygen molecule together. 
Why  Covalent  Bonds  Form 	  Covalent bonds form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons. Look at the oxygen atoms in the Figure 3.11. Alone, each oxygen atom has six valence electrons. By sharing two pairs of valence electrons, each oxygen atom has a total of eight valence electrons. This fills its outer energy level, giving it the most stable arrangement of electrons. The shared electrons are attracted to both oxygen nuclei, and this force of attraction holds the two atoms together in the oxygen molecule. 
Summary 	  • A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two atoms that share a pair of valence electrons. Covalent bonds form only between atoms of nonmetals. • The two atoms that are held together in a covalent bond may be atoms of the same element or different elements. When atoms of different elements bond together, it forms a covalent compound. • Covalent bonds form because the shared electrons fill each atom’s outer energy level and this is the most stable arrangement of electrons.

The burner on a gas stove burns with a pretty blue flame like the one pictured in the opening image. The fuel burned by most gas stoves is natural gas, which consists mainly of methane. Methane is a compound that contains only carbon and hydrogen. Like many other compounds that consist of just these two elements, methane is used for fuel because it burns very easily. Methane is an example of a covalent compound. What Are Covalent Compounds? Compounds that form from two or more nonmetallic elements, such as carbon and hydrogen, are called covalent compounds. In a covalent compound, atoms of the different elements are held together in molecules by covalent bonds. These are chemical bonds in which atoms share valence electrons. The force of attraction between the shared electrons and the positive nuclei of both atoms holds the atoms together in the molecule. A molecule is the smallest particle of a covalent compound that still has the properties of the compound. The largest, most complex covalent molecules have thousands of atoms. Examples include proteins and carbohydrates, which are compounds in living things. The smallest, simplest covalent compounds have molecules with just two atoms. An example is hydrogen chloride (HCl). It consists of one hydrogen atom and one chlorine atom, as you can see in the Figure 3.12. You can watch an animation of hydrogen chloride forming at the following URL. URL 
Naming and  Writing  Formulas for  Covalent  Compounds 	  To name simple covalent compounds, follow these rules: • Start with the name of the element closer to the left side of the periodic table. • Follow this with the name of element closer to the right of the periodic table. Give this second name the suffix –ide. • Use prefixes to represent the numbers of the different atoms in each molecule of the compound. The most commonly used prefixes are shown in the Table 3.3. 
Prefix 	  mono(or none) ditritetrapentahexaQ: What is the name of the compound that contains three oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms? A: The compound is named dinitrogen trioxide. Nitrogen is named first because it is farther to the left in the periodic table than oxygen. Oxygen is given the -ide suffix because it is the second element named in the compound. The prefix diis added to nitrogen to show that there are two atoms of nitrogen in each molecule of the compound. The prefix triis added to oxygen to show that there are three atoms of oxygen in each molecule. In the chemical formula for a covalent compound, the numbers of the different atoms in a molecule are represented by subscripts. For example, the formula for the compound named carbon dioxide is CO2. Q: What is the chemical formula for dinitrogen trioxide? A: The chemical formula is N2O3. 
Properties of  Covalent  Compounds 	  The covalent bonds of covalent compounds are responsible for many of the properties of the compounds. Because valence electrons are shared in covalent compounds, rather than transferred between atoms as they are in ionic compounds, covalent compounds have very different properties than ionic compounds. • Many covalent compounds, especially those containing carbon and hydrogen, burn easily. In contrast, many ionic compounds do not burn. • Many covalent compounds do not dissolve in water, whereas most ionic compounds dissolve well in water. • Unlike ionic compounds, covalent compounds do not have freely moving electrons, so they cannot conduct electricity.

Water is an example of a covalent compound that is a liquid at room temperature. The boiling point of water is 100°C. 
Summary 	  • Covalent compounds contain two or more nonmetallic elements held together by covalent bonds, in which atoms share pairs of valence electrons. A molecule is the smallest particle of a covalent compound that still has the properties of the compound. • A few rules can be applied to name simple covalent compounds: name the left-most element in the periodic table first, add -ide to the second named element, and use prefixes for the numbers of atoms. • Covalent bonds are responsible for many of the properties of covalent compounds. Covalent compounds have relatively low boiling points, cannot conduct electricity, and may not dissolve in water. Practice naming and writing chemical formulas for covalent compounds by completing the worksheet at the following URL. URL What is its chemical formula. • Describe polar and nonpolar covalent bonds. • Explain why some covalent compounds are polar. Like the north and south poles of a bar magnet, Earth’s north and south magnetic poles—pictured above—are opposites in terms of their magnetic fields. Some types of chemical bonds and chemical compounds have “poles” similar to a bar magnet as well. But in the case of chemical bonds and compounds, the poles are opposites in terms of their electric charge. These bonds and compounds are described as polar. 
Polar and  Nonpolar  Covalent  Bonds 	  Covalent bonds are chemical bonds between atoms of nonmetals that share valence electrons. In some covalent bonds, electrons are not shared equally between the two atoms. These are called polar covalent bonds. The Figure than the hydrogen atoms do because the nucleus of the oxygen atom has more positively charged protons. As a result, the oxygen atom becomes slightly negative in charge, and the hydrogen atoms become slightly positive in charge. For another example of polar bonds, see the video at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. In other covalent bonds, electrons are shared equally. These bonds are called nonpolar covalent bonds. Neither atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly. As a result, the atoms remain neutral in charge. The oxygen (O2) molecule in the Figure 3.14 has two nonpolar bonds. The two oxygen nuclei have an equal force of attraction for their four shared electrons. 
Polar and  Nonpolar  Covalent  Compounds 	  A covalent compound is a compound in which atoms are held together by covalent bonds. If the covalent bonds are polar, then the covalent compound as a whole may be polar. A polar covalent compound is one in which there is a slight difference in electric charge between opposite sides of the molecule. All polar compounds contain polar bonds. But having polar bonds does not necessarily result in a polar compound. It depends on how the atoms are arranged. This is illustrated in the Figure 3.15. In both molecules, the oxygen atoms attract electrons more strongly than the carbon or hydrogen atoms do, so both molecules have polar bonds. However, only formaldehyde is a polar compound. Carbon dioxide is nonpolar. Q: Why is carbon dioxide nonpolar? A: The symmetrical arrangement of atoms in carbon dioxide results in opposites sides of the molecule having the same charge. 
Summary 	  • In polar covalent bonds, electrons are not shared equally between the two atoms, so one atom is slightly negative in charge and one is slightly positive in charge. In nonpolar covalent bonds, electrons are shared equally so the atoms remain neutral in charge. • Covalent compounds with polar bonds may be polar or nonpolar, depending on their arrangement of atoms.

CHCl3 shows three covalent compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms. Are the compounds polar or nonpolar? Explain. • Describe hydrogen bonds and explain why they form. • Relate hydrogen bonding to melting and boiling points of compounds. The colorful red and blue model in the opening image represents a water molecule. The molecule’s one oxygen atom is colored red, and its two hydrogen atoms are colored blue. Can you guess why? The red color represents negative electric charge, and the blue color represents positive electric charge. The colors show that water is a polar compound. What Are Polar Compounds? Polar compounds, such as water, are compounds that have a partial negative charge on one side of each molecule and a partial positive charge on the other side. All polar compounds contain polar bonds (although not all compounds that contain polar bonds are polar.) In a polar bond, two atoms share electrons unequally. One atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly, so it has a partial negative charge. The other atom attracts the shared electrons less strongly, so it is has a partial positive charge. In a water molecule, the oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do. This explains why the oxygen side of the water molecule has a partial negative charge and the hydrogen side of the molecule has a partial positive charge. Q: If a molecule is polar, how might this affect its interactions with nearby molecules of the same compound? A: Opposite charges on different molecules of the same compound might cause the molecules to be attracted to each other. 
Hydrogen  Bonding 	  Because of water’s polarity, individual water molecules are attracted to one another. You can see this in the Figure of a nearby water molecule. This force of attraction is called a hydrogen bond. You can watch hydrogen bonds forming between water molecules in the animation at this URL: URL Hydrogen bonds are intermolecular (“between-molecule”) bonds, rather than intramolecular (“within-molecule”) bonds. They occur not only in water but in other polar molecules in which positive hydrogen atoms are attracted to negative atoms in nearby molecules. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak as chemical bonds go. For example, they are much weaker than the bonds holding atoms together within molecules of covalent compounds. To learn more about hydrogen bonding and when it occurs, see the video at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Hydrogen  Bonds and  Changes of  State 	  Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table 3.5 compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.

A: Water is more polar than ammonia. Its strong polarity explains why its melting and boiling points are high even for a polar covalent compound. 
Summary 	  • Polar covalent compounds have molecules with a partial negative charge on one side and a partial positive charge on the other side. This occurs because the compounds contain polar bonds. In a polar bond, one atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the other atom does. • In some polar molecules that contain hydrogen atoms, the partial positive charge of the hydrogen atoms of one molecule are attracted to the partial negative charge of an atom of a nearby molecule. This force of attraction is called a hydrogen bond. • Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, but they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from each other when matter changes state from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. This explains why polar covalent compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. Watch the video about hydrogen bonds at the following URL, and then answer the questions below. URL atoms? in hydrogen bonds? in water. • Describe metallic bonds. • Explain how metallic bonds influence the properties of metals. The thick, rigid trunk of the oak tree on the left might crack and break in a strong wind. The slim, flexible trunk of the willow tree on the right might bend without breaking. In one way, metals are like willow trees. They can bend without breaking. That’s because metals form special bonds called metallic bonds. What Are Metallic Bonds? Metallic bonds are forces of attraction between positive metal ions and the valence electrons that are constantly moving around them (see the Figure 3.17). The valence electrons include their own and those of other, nearby ions of the same metal. The valence electrons of metals move freely in this way because metals have relatively low electronegativity, or attraction to electrons. The positive metal ions form a lattice-like structure held together by all the metallic bonds. For an animated version of metallic bonding, go to this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: Why do metallic bonds form only in elements that are metals? Why don’t similar bonds form in elements that are nonmetals? A: Metal atoms readily give up valence electrons and become positive ions whenever they form bonds. When nonmetals bond together, the atoms share valence electrons and do not become ions. For example, when oxygen atoms bond together they form oxygen molecules in which two oxygen atoms share two pairs of valence electrons equally, so neither atom becomes charged. Metallic bonds. 
Metallic  Bonds and the  Properties of  Metals 	  The valence electrons surrounding metal ions are constantly moving. This makes metals good conductors of electricity. The lattice-like structure of metal ions is strong but quite flexible. This allows metals to bend without breaking. Metals are both ductile (can be shaped into wires) and malleable (can be shaped into thin sheets). You can learn more about metallic bonds and the properties of metals at this URL: URL

Why doesn’t the iron crack when he hits it? A: The iron ions can move within the “sea” of electrons around them. They can shift a little closer together or farther apart without breaking the metallic bonds between them. Therefore, the metal can bend rather than crack when the hammer hits it. Metal worker shaping iron metal.

Metals such as iron are useful for many purposes because of their unique properties. For example, they can conduct electricity and bend without breaking. However, pure metals may be less useful than mixtures of metals with other elements. For example, adding a little carbon to iron makes it much stronger. This mixture is called steel. Steel is so strong that it can hold up huge bridges, like the one pictured above. Steel is also used to make skyscrapers, cargo ships, cars, and trains. Steel is an example of an alloy. What Are Alloys? An alloy is a mixture of a metal with one or more other elements. The other elements may be metals, nonmetals, or both. An alloy is formed by melting a metal and dissolving the other elements in it. The molten solution is then allowed to cool and harden. Alloys generally have more useful properties than pure metals. Several examples of alloys are described and pictured below. You can learn about another alloy—the amazing alloy called memory wire—at the following URL.

This 	  makes it useful for sinks, eating utensils, and other objects that are exposed to water. "Gold" bracelet: Pure gold is relatively soft, so it is rarely used for jewelry. Most "gold" jewelry is actually made of an alloy of gold, copper and silver. Bronze statue: 
Bronze was the first alloy ever made.  The 	  earliest bronze dates back many thousands of years. Bronze is a mixture of copper and tin. Both copper and tin are relatively soft metals, but mixed together in bronze they are much harder. Bronze has been used for statues, coins, and other objects. Q: Sterling silver is an alloy that is used to make fine jewelry. What elements do you think sterling silver contains? What properties might sterling silver have that make it more useful than pure silver? A: Most sterling silver is about 93 percent silver and about 7 percent copper. Sterling silver is harder and stronger than pure silver, while retaining the malleability and luster of pure silver.

Does the term chemical reaction bring to mind an image like this one? In the picture, a chemist is mixing chemicals in a lab. Many chemical reactions take place in labs. However, most chemical reactions do not. Where do they occur? They happen in the world all around you. They even happen inside your own body. In fact, you are alive only because of the many chemical reactions that constantly take place inside your cells. What Is a Chemical Reaction? A chemical reaction is a process in which some substances change into different substances. Substances that start a chemical reaction are called reactants. Substances that are produced in the reaction are called products. Reactants and products can be elements or compounds. Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations, like the one below, in which reactants (on the left) are connected by an arrow to products (on the right). 
Reactants →  Products 	  Chemical reactions may occur quickly or slowly. Look at the two pictures in the Figure 3.20. Both represent chemical reactions. In the picture on the left, a reaction inside a fire extinguisher causes foam to shoot out of the extinguisher. This reaction occurs almost instantly. In the picture on the right, a reaction causes the iron tool to turn to rust. This reaction occurs very slowly. In fact, it might take many years for all of the iron in the tool to turn to rust. Q: What happens during a chemical reaction? Where do the reactants go, and where do the products come from? A: During a chemical reaction, chemical changes take place. Some chemical bonds break and new chemical bonds form. 
Same  Atoms,  New  Bonds 	  The reactants and products in a chemical reaction contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction. As a result, the atoms are in different combinations in the products than they were in the reactants. This happens because chemical bonds break in the reactants and new chemical bonds form in the products. Consider the chemical reaction in which water forms from oxygen and hydrogen gases. The Figure 3.21 represents this reaction. Bonds break in molecules of hydrogen and oxygen, and then new bonds form in molecules of water. In both reactants and products there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, but the atoms are combined differently in water. You can see another example at this URL: URL ondenthalpy.htm . 
Types of  Chemical  Reactions 	  The chemical reaction in the Figure 3.21, in which water forms from hydrogen and oxygen, is an example of a synthesis reaction. In this type of reaction, two or more reactants combine to synthesize a single product. There are several other types of chemical reactions, including decomposition, replacement, and combustion reactions. The Table 3.6 compares these four types of chemical reactions. You can see demonstrations of each type at this URL: URL . 
B+  D →  D +  	  fuel + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water 
H4 + 2 O2 →  O2 + 2 H2 	  Q: The burning of wood is a chemical reaction. Which type of reaction is it? A: The burning of wood—or of anything else—is a combustion reaction. In the combustion example in the table, the fuel is methane gas (CH4). 
Energy  In and  Energy  Out 	  All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products. In terms of energy, there are two types of chemical reactions: endothermic reactions and exothermic reactions. • In exothermic reactions, more energy is released when bonds form in products than is used to break bonds in reactants. These reactions release energy to the environment, often in the form of heat or light. • In endothermic reactions, more energy is used to break bonds in reactants than is released when bonds form in products. These reactions absorb energy from the environment. Q: When it comes to energy, which type of reaction is the burning of wood? Is it an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction? How can you tell? A: The burning of wood is an exothermic reaction. You can tell by the heat and light energy given off by a wood fire. 
Summary 	  • A chemical reaction is a process in which some substances, called reactants, change into different substances, called products. During the reaction, chemical bonds break in the reactants and new chemical bonds form in the products. • Types of chemical reactions include synthesis, decomposition, replacement, and combustion reactions. • All chemical reactions involve energy. Exothermic reactions release more energy than they use. Endothermic reactions use more energy than they release. At the following URL, watch Bill Nye the Science Guy demonstrate chemical reactions. Then answer the questions below. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. reaction? Is the reaction endothermic or exothermic? that the reaction released energy? • Identify reactants and products in chemical reactions. • Explain the relationship between reactants and products. Did you ever wonder what happens to a candle when it burns? A candle burning is a chemical change in matter. In a chemical change, one type of matter changes into a different type of matter, with different chemical properties. Chemical changes occur because of chemical reactions. You can see more examples of chemical changes at this Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
From  Reactants to  Products 	  All chemical reactions—including a candle burning—involve reactants and products. • Reactants are substances that start a chemical reaction. • Products are substances that are produced in the reaction. When a candle burns, the reactants are fuel (the candlewick and wax) and oxygen (in the air). The products are carbon dioxide gas and water vapor. 
Relating  Reactants and  Products 	  The relationship between reactants and products in a chemical reaction can be represented by a chemical equation that has this general form: 
Reactants →  Products 	  The arrow (→) shows the direction in which the reaction occurs. In many reactions, the reaction also occurs in the opposite direction. This is represented with another arrow pointing in the opposite direction (←). Q: Write a general chemical equation for the reaction that occurs when a fuel such as candle wax burns. A: The burning of fuel is a combustion reaction. The general equation for this type of reaction is: 
Fuel +  O2 →  O2 +  H2 	  Q: How do the reactants in a chemical reaction turn into the products? A: Bonds break in the reactants, and new bonds form in the products. 
Breaking and  Making  Chemical  Bonds 	  The reactants and products in a chemical reaction contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction. As a result, the atoms end up in different combinations in the products. This makes the products new substances that are chemically different from the reactants. Consider the example of water forming from hydrogen and oxygen. Both hydrogen and oxygen gases exist as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules. These molecules are the reactants in the reaction. The Figure 3.22 shows that bonds must break to separate the atoms in the hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Then new bonds must form between hydrogen and oxygen atoms to form water molecules. The water molecules are the products of the reaction. Q: Watch the animation of a similar chemical reaction at the following URL. Can you identify the reactants and the product in the reaction? URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. A: The reactants are hydrogen (H2) and fluorine (F2), and the product is hydrogen fluoride (HF). 
Summary 	  • All chemical reactions involve both reactants and products. Reactants are substances that start a chemical reaction, and products are substances that are produced in the reaction. • A chemical reaction can be represented by the general chemical formula: 
Reactants →  Products 	  . • Bonds break and reform during chemical reactions. Reactants and products contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction, so reactants and products are different substances.

H4+ 2 O2 →  O2 + 2 H2 	  • Give examples of irreversible and reversible chemical reactions. • Describe a reversible reaction that is in equilibrium. This diagram represents a chemical reaction. In the reaction, two molecules of hydrogen gas (2 H-H) combine one molecule of oxygen gas (O=O) to produce two molecules of water (2 H-O-H). Look at the arrow in the diagram. What does it represent? It shows that the reaction normally occurs in that direction, that is, from the two gases to water. Does the opposite reaction ever occur? Can water change back to hydrogen and oxygen gases? In other words, is the reaction reversible? Read on to find out. 
Irreversible  Reactions 	  Some chemical reactions can occur in only one direction. These reactions are called irreversible reactions. The reactants can change to the products, but the products cannot change back to the reactants. These reactions are like making a cake. The ingredients of a cake—such as eggs and flour—are the reactants. They are mixed together and baked to form the cake, which is the product (see Figure 3.23). The cake can’t be “unbaked” and “unmixed” to change it back to the raw eggs, flour, and other ingredients. So making a cake is irreversible. Combustion reactions are generally irreversible. Combustion occurs whenever a fuel burns. In this type of reaction, the fuel may combine with oxygen (in the air) and produces carbon dioxide and water vapor. The chemical equation for a combustion reaction is: 
Fuel +  O2 →  O2 +  H2 	  In a complete combustion reaction, fuel and oxygen are the reactants and the products are carbon dioxide and water. These two products cannot react to reform the fuel and oxygen, so the reaction is irreversible. The one-way arrow in the equation shows that the reaction can go in only one direction. 
Reversible  Reactions 	  Many chemical reactions can occur in both directions. These reactions are called reversible reactions. Not only can the reactants change to the products, but the products can change back to the reactants, at least under certain conditions. Consider again the reaction in which hydrogen gas and oxygen gas combine to produce water. This reaction is reversible if an electric current is applied to the water that is produced. You can see how this is done in the Figure 3.24. The current causes the water molecules to break down to individual hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Then these atoms recombine to form molecules of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. Q: In a chemical equation, a reversible reaction is represented with two arrows, one pointing in each direction. This shows that the reaction can go both ways. How would you represent the reversible reaction in which hydrogen and oxygen gases combine to produce water? A: The chemical equation would be: 
Balancing  Act 	  In a reversible reaction, both forward and reverse directions of the reaction generally occur at the same time. While reactants are reacting to produce products, products are reacting to produce reactants. Often, a point is reached at which forward and reverse directions of the reaction occur at the same rate. When this happens, there is no overall change in the amount of reactants and products, even though the reactions keep occurring in both directions. This point is called equilibrium. The term equilibrium means “state of balance,” and it is used to refer to a state of balance between any opposing changes. You can see an animation of a chemical reaction reaching equilibrium at this tion.php . 
Summary 	  • Irreversible chemical reactions can occur in only one direction. The reactants can change to the products, but the products cannot change back to the reactants. • Reversible chemical reactions can occur in both directions. The reactants can change to the products, and the products can also change back to the reactants. • Equilibrium occurs when forward and reverse directions of a reversible reaction occur at the same rate so there is no overall change in the amounts of reactants and products.

The process in which this occurred involved chemical reactions. How do you know that chemical reactions have occurred? The change in color is the most obvious clue. What’s Your Sign? A change in color is just one of several potential signs that a chemical reaction has occurred. Other potential signs include: • Change in temperature-Heat is released or absorbed during the reaction. • Production of a gas-Gas bubbles are released during the reaction. • Production of a solid-A solid settles out of a liquid solution. The solid is called a precipitate.

A: Yes, a chemical reaction occurred. You know because the bubbles are evidence that a gas has been produced and production of a gas is a sign of a chemical reaction.

Look at this rusty bike. It has been left outside in damp weather too many times, so the iron in the metal parts has rusted. Iron rusts when it combines with oxygen in the air. Iron rusting is an example of a chemical reaction. In a chemical reaction, substances change into entirely different substances. For example, the iron in the bike and the oxygen in the air have changed into rust. Q: How could you represent this reaction, besides just describing it in words? A: Scientists use a standard method to represent a chemical reaction, called a chemical equation. What Is a Chemical Equation? A chemical equation is a shorthand way to sum up what occurs in a chemical reaction. The general form of a chemical equation is: 
Reactants →  Products 	  The reactants in a chemical equation are the substances that begin the reaction, and the products are the substances that are produced in the reaction. The reactants are always written on the left side of the equation and the products on the right. The arrow pointing from left to right shows that the reactants change into the products during the reaction. This happens when chemical bonds break in the reactants and new bonds form in the products. As a result, the products are different chemical substances than the reactants that started the reaction. For a good overview of chemical equations and how to write them, watch the video at this URL: URL Q: What is the general equation for the reaction in which iron rusts? A: Iron combines with oxygen to produce rust, which is the compound named iron oxide. This reaction could be represented by the general chemical equation below. Note that when there is more than one reactant, they are separated by plus signs (+). If more than one product were produced, plus signs would be used between them as well. 
Using  Chemical  Symbols and  Formulas 	  When scientists write chemical equations, they use chemical symbols and chemical formulas instead of names to represent reactants and products. Look at the chemical reaction illustrated in the Figure 3.28. In this reaction, carbon reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide. Carbon is represented by the chemical symbol C. The chemical symbol for oxygen is O, but pure oxygen exists as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules, represented by the chemical formula O2. A molecule of the compound carbon dioxide consists of one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen, so carbon dioxide is represented by the chemical formula CO2. Q: What is the chemical equation for this reaction? A: The chemical equation is: 
C +  O2 →  O2 	  Q: How have the atoms of the reactants been rearranged in the products of the reaction? What bonds have been broken, and what new bonds have formed? A: Bonds between the oxygen atoms in the oxygen molecule have been broken, and new bonds have formed between the carbon atom and the two oxygen atoms. Is It Balanced? All chemical equations, like equations in math, must balance. This means that there must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow. That’s because matter is always conserved in a chemical reaction. This is the law of conservation of mass. Look at the equation above for the reaction between carbon and oxygen in the formation of carbon dioxide. Count the number of atoms of each type. Are the numbers the same on both sides of the arrow? The answer is yes, so the equation is balanced. 
Coefficients 	  Let’s return to the chemical reaction in which iron (Fe) combines with oxygen (O2) to form rust, or iron oxide (Fe2O3). The equation for this reaction is: This equation illustrates the use of coefficients to balance chemical equations. A coefficient is a number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula that shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction. From the equation for rusting, you can see that four atoms of iron combine with three molecules of oxygen to form two molecules of iron oxide. Q: Is the equation for the rusting reaction balanced? How can you tell? A: Yes, the equation is balanced. You can tell because there is the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow. First count the iron atoms. There are four iron atoms in the reactants. There are also four iron atoms in the products (two in each of the two iron oxide molecules). Now count the oxygen atoms. There are six on each side of the arrow, confirming that the equation is balanced in terms of oxygen as well as iron. 
Summary 	  • Scientists use chemical equations to summarize what happens in chemical reactions. Reactants are placed on the left side of the equation and products are placed on the right. An arrow is used to indicate the direction in which the reaction occurs. Plus signs (+) are placed between multiple reactants or products. • In chemical equations, reactants and products are represented by chemical symbols and formulas. Numbers called coefficients are placed in front of the symbols and formulas to show how much of each substance is involved in the reaction. • Chemical equations must be balanced. A balanced equation has the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation. Watch the video on chemical equations at the URL below.

The little boy on this seesaw weighs more than the little girl on the other side. That’s why his side of the seesaw is on the ground and her side is up in the air. For a seesaw to balance, the two riders must be the same weight. A chemical equation that represents a chemical reaction is a little bit like a seesaw. For a chemical equation to balance, there must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation. 
Writing  Chemical  Equations 	  A chemical equation represents the changes that occur during a chemical reaction. A chemical equation has the general form: 
Reactants →  Products 	  An example of a simple chemical reaction is the reaction in which hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) combine to produce water (H2O). In this reaction, the reactants are hydrogen and oxygen and the product is water. To write the chemical equation for this reaction, you would start by writing the reactants on the left and the product on the right, with an arrow between them to show the direction in which the reaction occurs: Equation 1: 
H2 +  O2 →  H2 	  Q: Look closely at equation 1. There’s something wrong with it. Do you see what it is? A: All chemical equations must be balanced. This means that there must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow. That’s because mass is always conserved in chemical reactions. Count the number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms on each side of the arrow. There are two hydrogen atoms in both reactants and products. There are two oxygen atoms in the reactants but only one in the product. Therefore, equation 1 is not balanced. 
Using  Coefficients 	  Coefficients are used to balance chemical equations. A coefficient is a number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula. It shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction. For example, two molecules of hydrogen would be written as 2 H2, and two molecules of water would be written 2 H2O. A coefficient of 1 usually isn’t written. Coefficients can be used to balance equation 1 (above) as follows: Equation 2: Equation 2 shows that two molecules of hydrogen react with one molecule of oxygen to produce two molecules of water. The two molecules of hydrogen each contain two hydrogen atoms and so do the two molecules of water. Therefore, there are now four hydrogen atoms in both reactants and products. Q: Is equation 2 balanced? A: Count the oxygen atoms to find out. There are two oxygen atoms in the one molecule of oxygen in the reactants. There are also two oxygen atoms in the products, one in each of the two water molecules. Therefore, equation 2 is balanced. 
Steps in  Balancing a  Chemical  Equation 	  Balancing a chemical equation involves a certain amount of trial and error. In general, however, you should follow these steps: of the arrow? If not, the equation is not balanced, and you need to go to step 2. of the substances. Use the smallest coefficients possible. Warning! Never change the subscripts in chemical formulas. Changing subscripts changes the substances involved in the reaction. Change only the coefficients. Q: Balance this chemical equation for the reaction in which nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) combine to form ammonia (NH3): 
N2 +  H2 →  H3 	  A: First count the nitrogen atoms on both sides of the arrow. There are two nitrogen atoms in the reactants so there must be two in the products as well. Place the coefficient 2 in front of NH3 to balance nitrogen: 
N2 +  H2 → 2  H3 	  Now count the hydrogen atoms on both sides of the arrow. There are six hydrogen atoms in the products so there must also be six in the reactants. Place the coefficient 3 in front of H2 to balance hydrogen: 
N2 + 3  H2 → 2  H3 	  If you’re still not sure how to balance chemical equations, watch the excellent video at this URL: URL be.com/watch?v=RnGu3xO2h74 . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • A chemical equation represents the changes that occur during a chemical reaction. It has the general form: Reactants → Products. All chemical equations must be balanced. This means that there must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow. • Coefficients are used to balance chemical equations.

Chemical  Reactions and  Balanced  Equations 	  A chemical reaction occurs when some substances change chemically to other substances. Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations. Consider a simple chemical reaction, the burning of methane. In this reaction, methane (CH4) combines with oxygen (O2) in the air and produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O). The reaction is represented by the following chemical equation: 
H4 + 2 O2 →  O2 + 2 H2 	  This equation shows that one molecule of methane combines with two molecules of oxygen to produce one molecule of carbon dioxide and two molecules of water vapor. All chemical equations must be balanced. This means that the same number of each type of atom must appear on both sides of the arrow. Q: Is the chemical equation for the burning of methane balanced? Count the atoms of each type on both sides of the arrow to find out. A: Yes, the equation is balanced. There is one carbon atom on both sides of the arrow. There are also four hydrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms on both sides of the arrow. 
Following the  Law 	  Why must chemical equations be balanced? It’s the law! Matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions. This is the law of conservation of mass. In every chemical reaction, the same mass of matter must end up in the products as started in the reactants. Balanced chemical equations show that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. 
Lavoisier and  Conservation of  Mass 	  How do scientists know that mass is always conserved in chemical reactions? Careful experiments in the 1700s by a French chemist named Antoine Lavoisier led to this conclusion. Lavoisier carefully measured the mass of reactants and products in many different chemical reactions. He carried out the reactions inside a sealed jar, like the one in the Figure 3.29. In every case, the total mass of the jar and its contents was the same after the reaction as it was before the reaction took place. This showed that matter was neither created nor destroyed in the reactions. Another outcome of Lavoisier’s research was the discovery of oxygen. You can learn more about Lavoisier and his important research at: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Antoine Lavoisier. Q: Lavoisier carried out his experiments inside a sealed glass jar. Why was sealing the jar important for his results? What might his results have been if he hadn’t sealed the jar? A: Sealing the jar was important so that any gases produced in the reactions were captured and could be measured. If he hadn’t sealed the jar, gases might have escaped detection. Then his results would have shown that there was less mass after the reactions than before. In other words, he would not have been able to conclude that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. 
Summary 	  • A chemical reaction occurs when some substances change chemically to other substances. Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations. • All chemical equations must be balanced because matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions. • Antoine Lavoisier did careful experiments to discover the law of conservation of mass in chemical reactions.

In this photo of Los Angeles, California, the air over the city is brown with smog. A major component of smog is nitrogen dioxide, which is a toxic gas with a sharp odor. Nitrogen dioxide can irritate the eyes and throat and trigger asthma attacks. Where does this poisonous gas come from? It forms when nitric oxide—from sources such as car exhaust—reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction is a synthesis reaction. What Is a Synthesis Reaction? A synthesis reaction occurs when two or more reactants combine to form a single product. A synthesis reaction can be represented by the general equation: 
A +  B →  	  In this equation, the letters A and B represent the reactants that begin the reaction, and the letter C represents the product that is synthesized in the reaction.

A: The equation for this synthesis reaction is: 
Examples of  Synthesis  Reactions 	  Another example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) to produce sodium chloride (NaCl). This reaction is represented by the chemical equation: Sodium is a highly reactive metal, and chlorine is a poisonous gas. Both elements are pictured in the Figure 3.30. The compound they synthesize has very different properties. Sodium chloride is commonly called table salt, which is neither reactive nor poisonous. In fact, salt is a necessary component of the human diet. You can see more examples of synthesis reactions at this URL: URL .

Hydrogen peroxide is a widely used disinfectant for minor cuts and scrapes. You may have a bottle of hydrogen peroxide like the one pictured here in your medicine cabinet at home. Did you ever notice that hydrogen peroxide is always kept in a dark brown bottle like this one? Do you know why? The reason is that hydrogen peroxide needs to be protected from light. If it isn’t, it will gradually break down to water and oxygen. This is a decomposition reaction. What Is a Decomposition Reaction? A decomposition reaction occurs when one reactant breaks down into two or more products. It can be represented by the general equation: 
B →  A +  	  In this equation, AB represents the reactant that begins the reaction, and A and B represent the products of the reaction. The arrow shows the direction in which the reaction occurs.

H2 O3 →  H2 O +  O2 	  • Another decomposition reaction occurs when water (H2O) breaks down to produce hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gases (see Figure 3.31). This happens when an electric current passes through the water, as illustrated below. The equation for this reaction is: Decomposition of water. Q: What ratio of hydrogen molecules (H2) to oxygen molecules (O2) is produced in the decomposition of water? A: Two hydrogen molecules per oxygen molecule are produced because water (H2O) has a ratio of two hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom. 
Summary 	  • A decomposition reaction occurs when one reactant breaks down into two or more products. This can be represented by the general equation: AB → A + B. • Examples of decomposition reactions include the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, and the breakdown of water to hydrogen and oxygen.

The man hanging from the burning helicopter in the photo above is a stunt man. He fills in for the lead actor in the movie in dangerous scenes like this one. Like other stunt workers, he has special training to do such dangerous work as safely as possible. Replacing actors with stunt workers is common in action movies. Some chemical reactions also involve replacements. More reactive elements replace less reactive elements in compounds. These reactions are called replacement reactions. What Is a Replacement Reaction? A replacement reaction occurs when elements switch places in compounds. This type of reaction involves ions (electrically charged versions of atoms) and ionic compounds. These are compounds in which positive ions of a metal and negative ions of a nonmetal are held together by ionic bonds. Generally, a more reactive element replaces an element that is less reactive, and the less reactive element is set free from the compound. There are two types of replacement reactions: single and double. Both types are described below. Q: Can you predict how single and double replacement reactions differ? A: One way they differ is that a single replacement reaction involves one reactant compound, whereas a double replacement reaction involves two reactant compounds. Keep reading to learn more about these two types of reactions. 
Single  Replacement  Reactions 	  A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces another in a single compound. This type of reaction has the general equation: 
A +  C →  B +  	  In this equation, A represents a more reactive element and BC represents the original compound. During the reaction, A replaces B, forming the product compound AC and releasing the less reactive element B. An example of a single replacement reaction occurs when potassium (K) reacts with water (H2O). A colorless solid compound named potassium hydroxide (KOH) forms, and hydrogen gas (H2) is set free. The equation for the reaction is: In this reaction, a potassium ion replaces one of the hydrogen atoms in each molecule of water. Potassium is a highly reactive group 1 alkali metal, so its reaction with water is explosive. You can watch the reaction occurring at this Q: Find potassium in the periodic table of the elements. What other element might replace hydrogen in water in a similar replacement reaction? A: Another group 1 element, such as lithium or sodium, might be involved in a similar replacement reaction with water. 
Double  Replacement  Reactions 	  A double replacement reaction occurs when two ionic compounds exchange ions. This produces two new ionic compounds. A double replacement reaction can be represented by the general equation: 
B +  D →  D +  	  AB and CD are the two reactant compounds, and AD and CB are the two product compounds that result from the reaction. During the reaction, the ions B and D change places. Q: Could the product compounds be DA and BC? A: No, they could not. In an ionic compound, the positive metal ion is always written first, followed by the negative nonmetal ion. Therefore, A and C must always come first, followed by D or B. An example of a double replacement reaction is sodium chloride (NaCl) reacting with silver fluoride (AgF). This reaction is represented by the equation: 
Na Cl +  Ag F →  Na F +  Ag Cl 	  During the reaction, chloride and fluoride ions change places, so two new compounds are formed in the products: sodium fluoride (NaF) and silver chloride (AgCl). To better understand how and why double replacement reactions occur, watch the video at this URL: URL Q: When iron sulfide (FeS) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) react together, a double replacement reaction occurs. What are the products of this reaction? What is the chemical equation for this reaction? A: The products of the reaction are iron chloride (FeCl2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The chemical equation for this reaction is: 
Summary 	  • A replacement reaction occurs when elements switch places in compounds. This type of reaction involves ions. Generally, more reactive elements replace less reactive elements. • A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces another element in one compound.

This performer isn’t really eating fire, but he still puts on an impressive show. You know that fire is dangerous. It’s hot, it can burn you, and it can easily get out of control. But do you know what fire is? Fire is the result of a chemical reaction. Whenever something burns, a type of reaction called a combustion reaction occurs. What Is a Combustion Reaction? A combustion reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen (O2). For example, in the Figure usually referred to as fuel. The products of a complete combustion reaction include carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O). The reaction typically gives off heat and light as well. The general equation for a complete combustion reaction is: 
The burning of charcoal is a combustion 	  reaction. 
Combustion of  Hydrocarbons 	  The fuel that burns in a combustion reaction contains compounds called hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). The charcoal pictured in the Figure 3.32 consists of hydrocarbons. So do fossil fuels such as natural gas. Natural gas is a fuel that is commonly used in home furnaces and gas stoves. The main component of natural gas is the hydrocarbon called methane (CH4). You can see a methane flame in the 
The combustion of methane gas heats a 	  pot on a stove. Q: Sometimes the flame on a gas stove isn’t just blue but has some yellow or orange in it. Why might this occur? A: If the flame isn’t just blue, the methane isn’t getting enough oxygen to burn completely, leaving some of the carbon unburned. The flame will also not be as hot as a completely blue flame for the same reason. You can simulate the combustion of hydrocarbons, including methane, at this URL: URL eenbowe/sections/projectfolder/flashfiles/stoichiometry/stoic_excess_oxy.html . 
Summary 	  • A complete combustion reaction occurs when a fuel reacts quickly with oxygen (O2) and produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The general equation for a complete combustion reaction is: Fuel + O2 → 
O2 +  H2 	  • The fuel that burns in a combustion reaction usually consists of hydrocarbons, which contain only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). An example of a hydrocarbon is methane (CH4), the main component of natural gas. Watch the video about combustion reactions at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.

Did you ever use an instant ice pack like this one? You don’t have to pre-cool it in the freezer. All you need to do is squeeze the pack and it starts to get cold. How does this happen? The answer is an endothermic chemical reaction. 
What  Is an  Endothermic  Reaction 	  All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products. In some chemical reactions, called exothermic reactions, more energy is released when new bonds form in the products than is needed to break bonds in the reactants. The opposite is true of endothermic reactions. In an endothermic reaction, it takes more energy to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products. 
Energy  Change in  Endothermic  Reactions 	  The word endothermic literally means “taking in heat.” A constant input of energy, often in the form of heat, is needed to keep an endothermic reaction going. This is illustrated in the Figure 3.34. Energy must be constantly added because not enough energy is released when the products form to break more bonds in the reactants. The general equation for an endothermic reaction is: 
Reactants +  Energy →  Products 	  Note: ∆H represents the change in energy. In endothermic reactions, the temperature of the products is typically lower than the temperature of the reactants. The drop in temperature may be great enough to cause liquids to freeze. That’s what happens in the endothermic reaction at this URL: URL srev1.shtml . Q: Now can you guess how an instant cold pack works? A: Squeezing the cold pack breaks an inner bag of water, and the water mixes with a chemical inside the pack. The chemical and water combine in an endothermic reaction. The energy needed for the reaction to take place comes from the water, which gets colder as the reaction proceeds. 
Photosynthesis 	  One of the most important series of endothermic reactions is photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, plants make the simple sugar glucose (C6H12O6) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). They also release oxygen (O2) in the process. The reactions of photosynthesis are summed up by this chemical equation: The energy for photosynthesis comes from light. Without light energy, photosynthesis cannot occur. As you can see in the Figure 3.35, plants can get the energy they need for photosynthesis from either sunlight or artificial light. 
Summary 	  • An endothermic reaction is a chemical reaction in which more energy is needed to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products. • A constant input of energy, often in the form of heat, is needed to keep an endothermic reaction going. • One of the most important series of endothermic reactions is photosynthesis. The energy needed for photosynthesis comes from light. Watch the series of slides and animations at the following URL.

URL reaction? • Define exothermic reaction. • Describe the role of energy in exothermic reactions. • Give examples of exothermic reactions. This mushroom cloud was produced in a 1953 nuclear bomb test in Nevada. There’s no doubt that the explosion gave off a huge amount of energy. Although not as impressive as nuclear reactions, many chemical reactions also give off energy. These reactions are called exothermic reactions. What Is an Exothermic Reaction? All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products. In some chemical reactions, called endothermic reactions, less energy is released when new bonds form in the products than is needed to break bonds in the reactants. The opposite is true of exothermic reactions. In an exothermic reaction, it takes less energy to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products. 
Energy  Change in  Exothermic  Reactions 	  The word exothermic means “releasing heat.” Energy, often in the form of heat, is released as an exothermic reaction proceeds. This is illustrated in the Figure 3.36. The general equation for an exothermic reaction is: 
Reactants →  Products +  Energy 	  Note: ∆H represents the change in energy. If the energy produced in an exothermic reaction is released as heat, it results in a rise in temperature. As a result, the products are likely to be warmer than the reactants. That’s what happens in the exothermic reaction at the URL below. URL Q: You turn on the hot water faucet, and hot water pours out. How does the water get hot? Do you think that an exothermic reaction might be involved? A: A hot water heater increases the temperature of water in most homes. Many hot water heaters burn a fuel such as natural gas. The burning fuel causes the water to get hot because combustion is an exothermic reaction. 
Combustion as an  Exothermic  Reaction 	  All combustion reactions are exothermic reactions. During a combustion reaction, a substance burns as it combines with oxygen. When substances burn, they usually give off energy as heat and light. Look at the big bonfire in the can see the light energy the fire is giving off. If you were standing near the fire, you would also feel its heat. 
Summary 	  • An exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction in which less energy is needed to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products. • During an exothermic reaction, energy is constantly given off, often in the form of heat. • All combustion reactions are exothermic reactions.

The blue flame in this photo is burning inside a home furnace. The fuel is natural gas, and it combines with oxygen when it burns. This chemical reaction, called a combustion reaction, gives off a lot of energy. 
Energy and  Chemical  Reactions 	  All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products. Like the combustion reaction in a furnace, some chemical reactions require less energy to break bonds in reactants than is released when bonds form in products. These reactions, called exothermic reactions, release energy. In other chemical reactions, it takes more energy to break bonds in reactants than is released when bonds form in products. These reactions, called endothermic reactions, absorb energy. 
Conservation of  Energy 	  Whether a chemical reaction absorbs or releases energy, there is no overall change in the amount of energy during the reaction. That’s because energy cannot be created or destroyed. This is the law of conservation of energy. Energy may change form during a chemical reaction—for example, from chemical energy to heat energy when gas burns in a furnace—but the same amount of energy remains after the reaction as before. This is true of all chemical reactions. You can learn more about the law of conservation of energy at this URL: URL es/energyconservation.html . Q: If energy can’t be destroyed during a chemical reaction, what happens to the energy that is absorbed in an endothermic reaction? A: The energy is stored in the bonds of the products as chemical energy. In an endothermic reaction, the products have more stored chemical energy than the reactants. This is represented by the graph on the left in the Figure 3.38. In an exothermic reaction, the opposite is true. The products have less stored chemical energy than the reactants. You can see this in the graph on the right in the Figure 3.38. Note: ∆H represents the change in energy. Q: What happens to the excess energy in the reactants of an exothermic reaction? A: The excess energy is generally released to the surroundings when the reaction occurs. In a home heating system, for example, the energy that is released during combustion in the furnace is used to heat the home. 
Summary 	  • All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products. Endothermic reactions absorb energy, and exothermic reactions release energy. • The law of conservation of energy states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Whether a chemical reaction absorbs or releases energy, there is no overall change in the amount of energy during the reaction. Go through the tutorial at the following URL, and then answer the questions at the end. URL om/objects/ViewObject.aspx?ID=GCH8705 • Define activation energy. • Explain why all chemical reactions require activation energy. These cheerleaders have a lot of energy! Their role is to get the fans as excited as they are so everyone will cheer for the team. They use their energy to activate the crowd. 
Getting  Started 	  Chemical reactions also need energy to be activated. They require a certain amount of energy just to get started. This energy is called activation energy. For example, activation energy is needed to start a car engine. Turning the key causes a spark that activates the burning of gasoline in the engine. The combustion of gas won’t occur without the spark of energy to begin the reaction. Q: Why is activation energy needed? Why won’t a reaction occur without it? A: A reaction won’t occur unless atoms or molecules of reactants come together. This happens only if the particles are moving, and movement takes energy. Often, reactants have to overcome forces that push them apart. This takes energy as well. Still more energy is needed to start breaking bonds in reactants. 
Activating  Endothermic and  Exothermic  Reactions 	  Some chemical reactions need a constant input of energy to take place. They are called endothermic reactions. Other chemical reactions release energy when they occur, so they can keep going without any added energy. They are called exothermic reactions. Q: It makes sense that endothermic reactions need activation energy. But do exothermic reactions also need activation energy? A: All chemical reactions need energy to get started, even exothermic reactions. Look at the Figure 3.39. They compare energy changes that occur during endothermic and exothermic reactions. From the graphs, you can see that both types of reactions need the same amount of activation energy in order to get started. Only after it starts does the exothermic reaction produce more energy than it uses. 
A  Common  Example 	  You have probably used activation energy to start a chemical reaction. For example, if you’ve ever struck a match to light it, then you provided the activation energy needed to start a combustion reaction. When you struck the match on the box, the friction started the match head burning. Combustion is exothermic. Once a match starts to burn, it releases enough energy to activate the next reaction, and the next, and so on. However, the match won’t burst into flames on its own. 
Summary 	  • All chemical reactions, including exothermic reactions, need activation energy to get started. • Activation energy is needed so reactants can move together, overcome forces of repulsion, and start breaking bonds. Watch the animated reactions at the following URL, and then answer the question below. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. product results from this reaction? • Define chemical reaction rate. • Identify factors that influence the rate of chemical reactions. Sodium reacts violently with water. That’s what is happening in the picture above. Why does sodium have such explosive reactions? It’s because the reactions occur so quickly. How Fast Does It Go? How fast a chemical reaction occurs is called the reaction rate. Several factors affect the rate of a given chemical reaction. They include the: • temperature of reactants. • concentration of reactants. • surface area of reactants. • presence of a catalyst. At the following URL, you can see animations showing how these factors affect the rate of chemical reactions. URL 
Temperature of  Reactants 	  When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure 3.40). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure 3.40). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. 
Left image:  Bread after 1 month on a 	  warm countertop. Right image: Bread after 1 month in a cold refrigerator. 
Concentration of  Reactants 	  Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. When the concentration of reactants is higher, the reaction rate is faster. At higher concentrations, particles of reactants are crowded closer together, so they are more likely to collide and react. Did you ever see a sign like the one in the Figure 3.41? You might see it where someone is using a tank of pure oxygen for a breathing problem. Combustion, or burning, is a chemical reaction in which oxygen is a reactant. A greater concentration of oxygen in the air makes combustion more rapid if a fire starts burning. Q: It is dangerous to smoke or use open flames when oxygen is in use. Can you explain why? A: Because of the higher-than-normal concentration of oxygen, the flame of a match, lighter, or cigarette could spread quickly to other materials or even cause an explosion. 
Surface  Area of  Reactants 	  When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure 3.42. Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. 
Presence of a  Catalyst 	  Some reactions need extra help to occur quickly. They need another substance called a catalyst. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction. A catalyst isn’t a reactant, so it isn’t changed or used up in the reaction. Therefore, it can catalyze many other reactions. 
Summary 	  • How fast a chemical reaction occurs is called the reaction rate. • Several factors affect the rate of a chemical reaction, including the temperature, concentration, and surface area of reactants, and the presence of a catalyst. Watch the video about reaction rate at the following URL, and then answer the questions below. URL • Define catalyst. • Explain how catalysts work. • Identify the role of catalysts in living things. The tunnel through this mountain provides a faster route for cars to get to the other side of the mountain. chemical reaction were like a road to the other side of a mountain, a catalyst would be like a tunnel. 
If a 	  What Is a Catalyst? A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction. The presence of a catalyst is one of several factors that influence the rate of chemical reactions. (Other factors include the temperature, concentration, and surface area of reactants.) A catalyst isn’t a reactant in the chemical reaction it speeds up. As a result, it isn’t changed or used up in the reaction, so it can go on to catalyze many more reactions. Q: How is a catalyst like a tunnel through a mountain? A: Like a tunnel through a mountain, a catalyst provides a faster pathway for a chemical reaction to occur. 
How  Catalysts  Work 	  Catalysts interact with reactants so the reaction can occur by an alternate pathway that has a lower activation energy. Activation energy is the energy needed to start a reaction. When activation energy is lower, more reactant particles have enough energy to react so the reaction goes faster. Many catalysts work like the one in the Figure 3.43. (You can see an animated version at the following URL.) The catalyst brings the reactants together by temporarily bonding with them. This makes it easier and quicker for the reactants to react together. Notice how the catalyst is released by the product molecule at the end of the reaction. URL esson5/explainingcatalysts.htm Q: In the Figure 3.43, look at the energy needed in the catalytic and non-catalytic pathways of the reaction. How does the amount of energy compare? How does this affect the reaction rate along each pathway? A: The catalytic pathway of the reaction requires far less energy. Therefore, the reaction will occur faster by this pathway because more reactants will have enough energy to react. 
Catalysts in  Living  Things 	  Chemical reactions constantly occur inside living things. Many of these reactions require catalysts so they will occur quickly enough to support life. Catalysts in living things are called enzymes. Enzymes may be extremely effective. A reaction that takes a split second to occur with an enzyme might take many years without it! More than 1000 different enzymes are necessary for human life. Many enzymes are needed for the digestion of food. An example is amylase, which is found in the mouth and small intestine. Amylase catalyzes the breakdown of starch to sugar. You can see how it affects the rate of starch digestion in the Figure 3.44. Q: If you chew a starchy food such as a soda cracker for a couple of minutes, you may notice that it starts to taste slightly sweet. Why does this happen? A: The starches in the cracker start to break down to sugars with the help of the enzyme amylase. Try this yourself and see if you can taste the reaction.

Spiral structures like the one pictured here could replace batteries in the future because they can store energy like a spring and conduct electricity. The structure is a tiny nanotube that consists entirely of carbon atoms. Carbon nanotubes are made in labs, but carbon-based compounds are also the most common naturally occurring compounds on Earth. More than 90 percent of all known compounds contain carbon. Do you know why carbon is found in so many compounds? Read on to find out. If you first want to learn more about carbon nanotubes, go to this URL: http ://URL . 
Carbon,  Carbon  Everywhere 	  Carbon is a very common “ingredient” of matter because it can combine with itself and with many other elements. It can form a great diversity of compounds, ranging in size from just a few atoms to thousands of atoms. There are millions of known carbon compounds, and carbon is the only element that can form so many different compounds. You can find a good introduction to carbon and its chemistry at this URL: URL t0Vn30 
Valence  Electrons in  Carbon 	  Carbon is a nonmetal in group 14 of the periodic table. Like other group 14 elements, carbon has four valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that are involved in chemical bonds. The valence electrons of carbon are shown in the electron dot diagram in the Figure 3.45. Q: How many more electrons does carbon need to have a full outer energy level? A: Carbon needs four more valence electrons, or a total of eight valence electrons, to fill its outer energy level. A full outer energy level is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Q: How can carbon achieve a full outer energy level? A: Carbon can form four covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are chemical bonds that form between nonmetals. In a covalent bond, two atoms share a pair of electrons. By forming four covalent bonds, carbon shares four pairs of electrons, thus filling its outer energy level and achieving stability. 
How  Carbon  Forms  Bonds 	  A carbon atom can form covalent bonds with other carbon atoms or with the atoms of other elements. Carbon often forms bonds with hydrogen. Compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons. Methane (CH4), which is modeled in the Figure 3.46, is an example of a hydrocarbon. In methane, a single carbon atom forms covalent bonds with four hydrogen atoms. The diagram on the left in the Figure 3.46 shows all the shared valence electrons. The diagram on the right in the Figure 3.46, called a structural formula, represents each pair of shared electrons with a dash (–). Methane (CH4) 
Carbon- Carbon  Bonds 	  Carbon can form single, double, or even triple bonds with other carbon atoms. In a single bond, two carbon atoms share one pair of electrons. In a double bond, they share two pairs of electrons, and in a triple bond they share three pairs of electrons. Examples of compounds with these types of bonds are represented by the structural formulas in the Figure 3.47. Q: How many bonds do the carbon atoms share in each of these compounds? A: In ethane, the two carbon atoms share a single bond. In ethene they share a double bond, and in ethyne they share a triple bond. 
Summary 	  • Carbon forms covalent bonds with atoms of carbon or other elements. There is a great diversity of carbon compounds, ranging in size from just one to thousands of atoms. • Carbon has four valence electrons, so it can achieve a full outer energy level by forming four covalent bonds. When it bonds only with hydrogen, it forms compounds called hydrocarbons. • Carbon can form single, double, or triple covalent bonds with other carbon atoms. Read the article about carbon bonding at the following URL, and then make an outline of article content. URL • Define polymer and monomer. • Identify natural and synthetic carbon polymers. You probably recognize this image as the great seal of the United States. The motto on the seal, E pluribus unum, is Latin for “out of many, one.” It refers to the formation of one country out of many states. Large carbon compounds could have the same motto. Can you guess why? In this lesson, you’ll find out. 
Out of  Many,  One 	  Carbon has a unique ability to form covalent bonds with many other atoms. It can bond with other carbon atoms as well as with atoms of other elements. Because of this ability, carbon often forms polymers. A polymer is a large molecule that is made out of many smaller molecules that are joined together by covalent bonds. The smaller, repeating molecules are called monomers. (The prefix monomeans “one” and the prefix polymeans “many.”) Polymers may consist of just one type of monomer or of more than one type. Polymers are similar to the strings of beads pictured in the Figure 3.48. Like beads on a string, monomers in a polymer may be all the same or different from one another. 
Natural  Carbon  Polymers 	  Many polymers of carbon occur naturally. Two examples are rubber and cellulose. • Rubber is a natural polymer of the monomer named isoprene (C5H8). This polymer comes from rubber trees, which grow in tropical areas. Structural formulas for rubber and isoprene are shown in the Figure 3.49. Note that just a small section of the rubber polymer is represented by the structural formula. • Cellulose is a natural polymer of the monomer named glucose (C6H12O6). This polymer makes up the cell walls of plants and is the most common compound in living things. Structural formulas for cellulose and glucose are also shown in the Figure 3.49). As you can see from the structural formula for cellulose, when two glucose monomers bond together, a molecule of water (H2O) is released. Q: How are the glucose molecules arranged in the cellulose polymer? A: The glucose molecules alternate between right-side up and upside down. 
Synthetic  Carbon  Polymers 	  Synthetic carbon polymers are produced in labs or factories. Plastics are common examples of synthetic carbon polymers. You are probably familiar with the plastic called polyethylene. All of the plastic items pictured in the for ethylene and polyethylene are also shown in the Figure 3.51.

Summary 	  • Carbon has a unique ability to form many covalent bonds, so it often forms polymers. A polymer is a large molecule that is made up of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers, which are joined together by covalent bonds. • Natural polymers include rubber and cellulose. Synthetic polymers include plastics such as polyethylene. Watch the video about polymers at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.

Actually, pencil “leads” aren’t made of lead at all. They are made of a form of carbon called graphite. How carbon atoms are arranged in graphite explains why it’s suitable for writing—and also why it breaks so easily. Q: Graphite is one of several forms of carbon. How can a single element exist in different forms? A: Carbon can exist in different forms because atoms of carbon can combine in different ways. What Are the Forms of Carbon? Graphite is one of three forms of crystalline, or crystal-forming, carbon. Carbon also exists in an amorphous, or “shapeless,” form in substances such as coal and charcoal. Different forms of the same element are called allotropes. Besides graphite, the other allotropes of crystalline carbon are diamond and fullerenes. All three forms exist as crystals rather than molecules. In a crystal, many atoms are bonded together in a repeating pattern that may contains thousands of atoms. The arrangement of atoms in the crystal differs for each form of carbon and explains why the different forms have different properties. For an entertaining, video-game introduction to the three forms of crystalline carbon, go to this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: How do you think the properties of diamond might differ from the properties of graphite? A: Diamond is clear whereas graphite is black. Diamond is also very hard, so it doesn’t break easily. Graphite, in contrast, is soft and breaks very easily. 
Diamond 	  Diamond is a form of carbon in which each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms. This forms a strong, rigid, three-dimensional structure (see Figure 3.52). Diamond is the hardest natural substance, and no other natural substance can scratch it. This property makes diamonds useful for cutting and grinding tools as well as for rings and other jewelry (see Figure 3.53). 
Graphite 	  Graphite is a form of crystalline carbon in which each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms. The carbon atoms are arranged in layers, with strong bonds within each layer but only weak bonds between layers (see Figure 3.54). The weak bonds between layers allow the layers to slide over one another, so graphite is relatively soft and slippery. This makes it useful as a lubricant. Q: Why do graphite’s properties make it useful for pencil “leads”? A: Being slippery, graphite slides easily over paper when you write. Being soft, it rubs off on the paper, allowing you to leave marks. Graphite’s softness also allows you to sharpen it easily. (Imagine trying to sharpen a diamond!) 
Fullerene 	  A fullerene (also called a Bucky ball) is a form of carbon in which carbon atoms are arranged in a hollow sphere resembling a soccer ball (see Figure 3.55). Each sphere contains 60 carbon atoms, and each carbon atom is bonded to three others by single covalent bonds. The bonds are relatively weak, so fullerenes can dissolve and form solutions. Fullerenes were first discovered in 1985 and have been found in soot and meteorites. Possible commercial uses of fullerenes are under investigation. 
Summary 	  • Different forms, or allotropes, of carbon are diamond, graphite, and fullerenes. 
Fullerene  Crystal 	  • In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms, forming a rigid structure that makes diamond very hard. • In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms, and the atoms forms layers that are only weakly bonded together. This makes graphite soft and slippery. • In a fullerene, carbon atoms are bonded to three other atoms in a soccer ball pattern. The bonds are weak, so fullerenes can dissolve and form solutions.

Each one shows an item that you might have used or seen used by someone else. All of the items have something in common. Can you guess what it is? They all involve carbon compounds known as hydrocarbons. What Are Hydrocarbons? Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. Hydrocarbons are the simplest type of carbon-based compounds, but they can vary greatly in size. The smallest hydrocarbons have just one or two carbon atoms. The largest hydrocarbons may have thousands of carbon atoms. Q: How are hydrocarbons involved in each of the photos pictured above? A: The main ingredient of mothballs is the hydrocarbon naphthalene. The main ingredient in nail polish remover is the hydrocarbon acetone. The lawn mower runs on a mixture of hydrocarbons called gasoline, and the camp stove burns a hydrocarbon fuel named isobutane. 
Properties of  Hydrocarbons 	  The size of hydrocarbon molecules influences their properties, including their melting and boiling points. As a result, some hydrocarbons are gases at room temperature, while others are liquids or solids. Hydrocarbons are generally nonpolar, which means that their molecules do not have oppositely charged sides. Therefore, they do not dissolve in water, which is a polar compound. In fact, hydrocarbons tend to repel water. That’s why they are used in floor wax and similar products. 
Classes of  Hydrocarbons 	  Hydrocarbons are placed in two different classes: saturated hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons. This classification is based on the number of bonds between carbon atoms. • Saturated hydrocarbons have only single bonds between carbon atoms, so the carbon atoms are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, they are saturated with hydrogen atoms. • Unsaturated hydrocarbons have at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms, so the carbon atoms are not bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, they are unsaturated with hydrogen atoms. You can learn more about saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Uses of  Hydrocarbons 	  It is hard to overstate the importance of hydrocarbons to modern life. Hydrocarbons have even been called the “driving force of western civilization.” You saw some ways they are used in the opening image. Several other ways are pictured in the Figure 3.56. The most important use of hydrocarbons is for fuel. Gasoline, natural gas, fuel oil, diesel fuel, jet fuel, coal, kerosene, and propane are just some of the commonly used hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrocarbons are also used to make things, including plastics and synthetic fabrics such as polyester. 
Sources of  Hydrocarbons 	  The main source of hydrocarbons is fossil fuels—coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Fossil fuels formed over hundreds of millions of years, as dead organisms were covered with sediments and put under great pressure. Giant ferns in ancient swamps turned into coal deposits. The Figure 3.57 shows one way that coal deposits are mined. Dead organisms in ancient seas gradually formed deposits of petroleum and natural gas. You can read more about these sources of hydrocarbons at the URL below. URL 
Summary 	  • Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. Hydrocarbons are the simplest type of carbon-based compounds. • Hydrocarbons vary greatly in size, which influences properties such as melting and boiling points. At room temperature, hydrocarbons may be gases, liquids, or solids. They are generally nonpolar and do not dissolve in water. 
Motor oil:  Motor oil consists of several 	  hydrocarbons. 
It lubricates the moving 	  parts of car engines. Asphalt: Asphalt pavement on highways is made of hydrocarbons found in petroleum. Candle: Many candles are made of paraffin wax, a solid mixture of hydrocarbons. Lighter: 
This lighter burns the hydrocarbon named 	  butane. Rain Boots: These rain boots are made of a mixture of several hydrocarbons. Transportation: These forms of transportation are fueled by different mixtures of hydrocarbons. 
Open- Pit  Coal  Mine 	  • Hydrocarbons are placed in two basic classes—saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons—based on the number of bonds between their carbon atoms. • Hydrocarbons have a wide variety of important uses, but their most important use is as fuels. • The main source of hydrocarbons is fossil fuels—coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Using the puzzle maker at the URL below, create a crossword puzzle for hydrocarbons. Exchange puzzles with a classmate and try to solve each other’s puzzle. URL • Define saturated hydrocarbon. • Explain how saturated hydrocarbons are named. • Identify shapes of saturated hydrocarbon molecules. You can tell that this sponge is saturated with water because when it is squeezed, the water pours out. When something is saturated with water, it already holds as much water as possible. Compounds called hydrocarbons, which contain only carbon and hydrogen, can also be saturated, but not with water. What Are Saturated Hydrocarbons? Saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. They are the simplest class of hydrocarbons. They are called saturated because each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen. You can see an example of a saturated hydrocarbon in the Figure 3.58. In this compound, named ethane, each carbon atom is bonded to three hydrogen atoms. In the structural formula, each dash (-) represents a single covalent bond, in which two atoms share one pair of valence electrons. Q: What is the chemical formula for ethane? A: The chemical formula is C2H6. What’s in a Name? Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes. The name of specific alkanes always ends in –ane. The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and other small alkanes are listed in the Table 3.7. The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally boil and melt at higher temperatures. 
Octane 	  Chemical Formula Boiling Point(°C) Melting Point(°C) 
C8 H18 	  -183 -172 -188 -138 -130 -95 -91 -57 -162 -89 -42 State (at 20 °C) gas gas gas gas liquid liquid liquid liquid Q: The Table 3.7 shows only alkanes that have relatively few carbon atoms. Some alkanes have many more carbon atoms. What properties might larger alkanes have? A: Alkanes with more carbon atoms have higher boiling and melting points, so some of them are solids at room temperature. 
Shapes of  Alkanes 	  Structural formulas are often used to represent hydrocarbon compounds because the molecules can have different shapes and a structural formula shows how the atoms are arranged. Hydrocarbons may form straight chains, 
A)  In a straight-chain molecule, all the 	  carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branchedchain molecules. rings can join together formula? seen below? • Describe isomers of hydrocarbons. • Contrast properties of isomers of the same hydrocarbon. • Relate the number of isomers to the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon. Look at the desks in the photos above. Both pictures show the same classroom with the same number of desks, but the desks are arranged differently in each picture. The different arrangements work better for different classroom activities. Desks in rows facing the front of the classroom are better for watching the teacher do demonstrations. Desks facing each other in small groups are better for working on group projects. What does the arrangement of desks in a classroom have to do with chemistry? Like desks in a classroom, atoms in a hydrocarbon molecule can be arranged in different ways, and the different arrangements give them different properties. 
Same  Atoms,  Different  Shapes 	  Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms. The smallest hydrocarbon, methane (CH4), contains just one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. Larger hydrocarbons contain many more. Hydrocarbons with four or more carbon atoms can have different shapes. Although they have the same chemical formula, with the same numbers of carbon and hydrogen atoms, they form different compounds, called isomers. Isomers are compounds whose properties are different because their atoms are bonded together in different arrangements. 
Examples of  Isomers 	  The smallest hydrocarbon that has isomers is butane, which has just four carbon atoms. In the Figure 3.60 you can see structural formulas for normal butane (or n-butane) and its only isomer, named iso-butane. Both molecules have four carbon atoms as well as ten hydrogen atoms (C4H10), but the atoms are arranged differently in the two compounds. In n-butane, all four carbon atoms are lined up in a straight chain. In iso-butane, one of the carbon atoms branches off from the main chain. You can see three-dimensional models of these two isomers at the URLs below. Rotate the molecule models to get a better idea of their shapes. URL URL The next smallest hydrocarbon is pentane, which has five carbon atoms and twelve hydrogen atoms (C5H12). Pentane has three isomers: n-pentane, iso-pentane, and neo-pentane. Their structural formulas are shown in the images below. Look at the carbon atoms in each isomer. In n-pentane (see Figure 3.61), the carbon atoms form a straight chain. In iso-pentane (see Figure 3.62), one carbon atom branches off from the main chain. In neo-pentane (see Figure 3.63), two carbon atoms branch off from the main chain. How Many Isomers? Butane has only two isomers and pentane has just three, but some hydrocarbons have many more isomers than these. As you increase the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon, the number of isomers quickly increases. For example, heptane, with seven carbon atoms, has nine isomers; and dodecane, with twelve carbon atoms, has 355 isomers. Some hydrocarbons with many more carbon atoms have billions of isomers! Q: Why does the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon determine how many isomers it has? A: The more carbon atoms there are, the greater the number of possible arrangements of carbon atoms. 
Properties of  Isomers 	  Because isomers are different compounds, they have different properties. Generally, branched-chain isomers have lower boiling and melting points than straight-chain isomers. For example, the boiling and melting points of isobutane are -12 °C and -160 °C, respectively, compared with 0 °C and -138 °C for n-butane. The more branching there is, the lower the boiling and melting points are. Q: The boiling point of n-pentane is 36 °C. Predict the boiling points of iso-pentane and neo-pentane. A: The boiling point of iso-pentane is 28 °C, and the boiling point of neo-pentane is 10 °C. 
Summary 	  • Hydrocarbons with the same numbers of atoms but different shapes form different compounds called isomers. • Hydrocarbons with four or more carbon atoms have isomers. The more carbon atoms a hydrocarbon has, the greater the number of isomers. • Isomers are different compounds with different properties, such as different boiling and melting points. At the following URL, watch the video about isomers of hexane. Then answer the questions below. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Define unsaturated hydrocarbon. • Describe alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and alkynes. Look at the difference between cooking oil and butter. Fats can be either liquid, like oil, or solid, like butter, at room temperature depending on their chemical structure. Saturated fats are straight in structure and tightly packed together to form a solid at room temperature. Double and triple bonds in unsaturated fats make them easier to break down at lower temperatures. What Are Unsaturated Hydrocarbons? Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. The carbon atoms in hydrocarbons may share single, double, or triple covalent bonds. Unsaturated hydrocarbons contain at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms. They are classified on the basis of their bonds as alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, or alkynes. Q: Why do you suppose hydrocarbons with double or triple bonds are called unsaturated? A: A carbon atom always forms four covalent bonds. Carbon atoms with double or triple bonds are unable to bond with as many hydrogen atoms as they could if they were joined only by single bonds. This makes them unsaturated with hydrogen atoms. 
Alkenes 	  Unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. The name of a specific alkene always ends in –ene and has a prefix indicating the number of carbon atoms. The structural formula in the Figure Ethene is produced by most fruits and vegetables. It speeds up ripening. The Figure 3.64 show the effects of ethene on bananas. Alkenes can have different shapes. They can form straight chains, branched chains, or rings. Alkenes with the same atoms but different shapes are called isomers. Smaller alkenes have relatively high boiling and melting points, so 
The bananas on the left were stored in 	  a special bag that absorbs ethene. The bananas on the right were stored without a bag. they are gases at room temperature. Larger alkenes have lower boiling and melting points, so they are liquids or waxy solids at room temperature. 
Aromatic  Hydrocarbons 	  Unsaturated hydrocarbons called aromatic hydrocarbons are cyclic hydrocarbons that have double bonds. These compounds have six carbon atoms in a ring with alternating single and double bonds. The smallest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene, which has just one ring. Its structural formula is shown in the Figure 3.65. Larger aromatic hydrocarbons consist of two or more rings, which are joined together by bonds between their carbon atoms. The name of aromatic hydrocarbons comes from their strong aroma, or scent. That’s why they are used in air fresheners and mothballs. You can learn more about these interesting hydrocarbons at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: How many bonds does each carbon atom in benzene form? A: Each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds. Carbon atoms always form four covalent bonds, regardless of the atoms to which it bonds. 
Alkynes 	  Unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more triple bonds are called alkynes. The names of specific alkynes always end in –yne and have a prefix for the number of carbon atoms. The structural formula in the Figure 3.66 represents the smallest alkyne, named ethyne, which has two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms (C2H2). Ethyne is also called acetylene. It is burned in acetylene torches, like the one pictured in the Figure 3.67. The flame of an acetylene torch is so hot that it can melt metal. Alkynes may form straight or branched chains. They rarely occur in ring shapes. In fact, alkynes of all shapes are relatively rare in nature.

Q: What is the chemical formula for this compound, and what is its name? A: The chemical formula is C6H12O6, and the name of the compound is glucose. In this article you’ll learn more about glucose and other compounds that are essential to life. 
Introduction to  Biochemical  Compounds 	  Glucose is an example of a biochemical compound. The prefix biocomes from the Greek word that means “life.” A biochemical compound is any carbon-based compound that is found in living things. Biochemical compounds make up the cells and tissues of living things. They are also involved in all life processes, including making and using food for energy. Given their diversity of functions, it’s not surprising that there are millions of different biochemical compounds. Q: Plants make food in the process of photosynthesis. What biochemical compound is synthesized in photosynthesis? A: Glucose is synthesized in photosynthesis. Virtually all living things use glucose for energy, but glucose is just one of many examples of biochemical compounds that are found in most or all living things. In fact the similarity in biochemical compounds between living things provides some of the best evidence for the evolution of species from common ancestors. A classic example is the biochemical compound called cytochrome c. It is found in all living organisms because it performs essential life functions. Only slight variations in the molecule exist between closely related species, as you can see in the Figure and the single-celled tetrahymena (pictured in the Figure 3.68), the cytochrome c molecule is nearly 50 percent the same. 
Structure of  Biochemical  Molecules 	  All biochemical molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen as well as carbon. They may also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur. Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers. Polymers are large molecules that consist of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers. Glucose is a monomer of biochemical compounds called starches. In starches and all other biochemical polymers, monomers are joined together by covalent bonds, in which atoms share pairs of valence electrons. 
Size of  Biochemical  Molecules 	  Most biochemical molecules are macromolecules. The prefix macromeans “large,” and many biochemical molecules are very large indeed. They may contain thousands of monomer molecules. The largest known biochemical molecule is called titin. It plays an important role in muscle contraction. The human form of the molecule contains more than

A: Glucose is a sugar in the class carbohydrates. Like other carbohydrates, it contains only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. It provides energy to the cells of living things. Q: Look back at the chemical formula for titin. In which class of biochemical compounds should it be placed? A: Titin is a protein. You can tell because it contains sulfur, and proteins are the only biochemical compounds that contain this element. 
Summary 	  • Biochemical compounds are carbon-based compounds that are found in living things. The similarity in biochemical compounds between living things provides evidence for the evolution of species from common ancestors. • All biochemical molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen as well as carbon. They may also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur. Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers. • Most biochemical molecules are macromolecules, meaning that they are very large. Some contain thousands of monomer molecules. • Although there are millions of biochemical compounds, all of them can be grouped into just four classes: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Choose one of the classes of biochemical compounds and do a Web quest to learn more about it. You may want to start with one of the following URLs. Make a list of the main points you discover as you work through your Web quest. URL URL URL URL • Define carbohydrate. • Describe sugars and their role in living things. • Identify starches and their sources. • Outline the structure and functions of cellulose. The fluffy white fibers on this plant look like cotton balls because that’s what they are. The plant is a cotton plant, and the fibers are used to make cotton fabric. Cotton fibers consist of one of the most common compounds on Earth: cellulose. Cellulose is a biochemical compound found in all plants. It belongs to the class of biochemical compounds called carbohydrates. What are Carbohydrates? Carbohydrates are one of four classes of biochemical compounds. The other three classes are proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. In addition to cellulose, carbohydrates include sugars and starches. Carbohydrate molecules contain atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Living things use carbohydrates mainly for energy. For more in-depth information on carbohydrates, you may want to watch the videos at these URLs: URL URL Q: Which carbohydrates do you use for energy? A: You may eat a wide variety of carbohydrates—from sugars in fruits to starches in potatoes. However, body cells use only sugars for energy. 
Sugars 	  Sugars are simple carbohydrates. Molecules of sugars have relatively few carbon atoms. Glucose (C6H12O6) is one of the smallest sugar molecules. Plants and some other organisms make glucose in the process of photosynthesis. Living things that cannot make glucose obtain it by consuming plants or these other organisms. In the Figure 3.69, you can see structural formulas for glucose and two other sugars, named fructose and sucrose. Fructose is a sugar that is found in fruits. It is an isomer of glucose. Isomers are compounds that have the same atoms but different arrangements of atoms. Do you see how the atoms are arranged differently in fructose than in glucose? You’re probably most familiar with the sugar sucrose, because sucrose is table sugar. It’s the sugar that you spoon onto your cereal or into your iced tea. 
Note:  Each unlettered point where lines 	  intersect represents a carbon atom. Q: Compare the structure of sucrose with the structures of glucose and fructose. How is sucrose related to the other two sugars? A: Sucrose consists of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose bonded together. 
Starches 	  Starches are complex carbohydrates. They are polymers of glucose. A polymer is a large molecule that consists of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers. The monomers are joined together by covalent bonds. Starches contain hundreds of glucose monomers. Plants make starches to store extra glucose. Consumers get starches by eating plants. Common sources of starches in the human diet are pictured in the Figure 3.70. Our digestive system breaks down starches to sugar, which our cells use for energy. Foods that are good sources of starches. 
Cellulose 	  Cellulose is another complex carbohydrate that is a polymer of glucose. However, glucose molecules are bonded together differently in cellulose than they are in starches. Cellulose molecules bundle together to form long, tough fibers, as you can see in the Figure 3.71. Have you ever eaten raw celery? If you have, then you probably noticed that the stalks contain long, stringy fibers. The fibers are mostly cellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant biochemical compound. It makes up the cell walls of plants and gives support to stems and tree trunks. Cellulose also provides needed fiber in the human diet. We can’t digest cellulose, but it helps keep food wastes moving through the digestive tract. 
Summary 	  • Carbohydrates are biochemical compounds that include sugars, starches, and cellulose. They contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and they are used mainly for energy by living things. • Sugars are simple carbohydrates such as glucose, which the cells of living things use for energy. • Starches are complex carbohydrates that are polymers of glucose. Starches are used by plants to store energy. Consumers get starches by eating plants. They break down the starches to sugar for energy. • Cellulose is another complex carbohydrate that is a polymer of glucose. It is the most abundant biochemical compound.

These pretty, colorful “ribbons” aren’t leftover ribbons from birthday gifts. The “ribbons” are a model of a molecule called hemoglobin, which is coursing through your blood vessels right now. Hemoglobin is a compound that is found in red blood cells and has the crucial job of carrying oxygen to cells throughout the body. Your life depends on hemoglobin. 
Meet the  Proteins 	  Hemoglobin is a compound in the class of compounds called proteins. Proteins are one of four classes of biochemical compounds, which are compounds in living things. (The other three classes are carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.) Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Protein molecules consist of one or more chains of small molecules called amino acids. 
Protein  Structure 	  Amino acids are the “building blocks” of proteins. There are 20 different amino acids. The structural formula of the simplest amino acid, called glycine, is shown in the Figure 3.72. Other amino acids have slightly different structures. A protein molecule is made from one or more long chains of amino acids, each linked to its neighbors by covalent bonds. If a protein has more than one chain, the chains are held together by weaker bonds, such as hydrogen bonds. The sequence of amino acids in chains and the number of chains in a protein determine the protein’s shape. The shape of a protein, in turn, determines its function. Shapes may be very complex. You can learn more about the shapes of proteins at the URL below. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: What do you think the “ribbons” in the colorful hemoglobin molecule pictured in the opening image represent? A: The “ribbons” represent chains of amino acids. 
Protein  Functions 	  Proteins are the most numerous and diverse biochemical compounds, and they have many different functions. Some of their functions include: • making up tissues as components of muscle. • speeding up biochemical reactions as enzymes. • regulating life processes as hormones. • helping to defend against infections as antibodies. • carrying materials around the body as transport proteins (see the example of hemoglobin in the Figure 3.73). 
The blood protein hemoglobin binds with 	  oxygen and carries it from the lungs to all the body’s cells. Heme is a small molecule containing iron that is part of the larger hemoglobin molecule. Oxygen binds to the iron in heme. 
Summary 	  • Proteins are one of four classes of biochemical compounds. Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. • A protein molecule is made from one or more long chains of amino acids, each linked to its neighbors by covalent bonds. Multiple chains of a protein are held together by weaker bonds. • Proteins are the most numerous and diverse biochemical compounds. They have many different functions.

Protein folding continues until the molecule has the largest possible shape. c. Amino acid side chains move through each other as folding takes place. • Identify the class of biochemical compounds called lipids. • Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. • Explain the role of phospholipids in the cell membranes of living things. You’ve probably seen dozens of nutrition facts labels like the one in the opening image. The labels show the nutrients that foods contain. Many people read nutrition facts labels to see how much fat there is in particular foods. That’s because eating too much fat, especially saturated fat, can be unhealthy and contribute to weight gain. Fats are a type of biochemical compound called lipids. What Are Lipids? Lipids are one of four classes of biochemical compounds, which are compounds that make up living things and carry out life processes. (The other three classes of biochemical compounds are carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids.) Living things use lipids to store energy. Lipids are also the major components of cell membranes in living things. Types of lipids include fats and oils. • Fats are solid lipids that animals use to store energy. • Oils are liquid lipids that plants use to store energy. Q: Can you name some lipids that are fats? What are some lipids that are oils? A: Lipids that are fats include butter and the fats in meats. Lipids that are oils include olive oil and vegetable oil. Examples of both types of lipids are pictured in the Figure 3.74. (A) The white bands on these lamb chops are fat. (B) The yellow liquid in this bottle is olive oil. 
Fatty  Acids 	  Lipids consist only or mainly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Both fats and oils are made up of long chains of carbon atoms that are bonded together. These chains are called fatty acids. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In the Figure 3.75 you can see structural formulas for two small fatty acids, one saturated and one unsaturated. • Saturated fatty acids have only single bonds between carbon atoms. As a result, the carbon atoms are bonded In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogens. to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. Saturated fatty acids are found in fats. • Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond between carbon atoms. As a result, some carbon atoms are not bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. They are unsaturated with hydrogens. Unsaturated fatty acids are found in oils. Q: Both of these fatty acid molecules have six carbon atoms and two oxygen atoms. How many hydrogen atoms does each fatty acid molecule contain? What else is different about the two molecules? A: The saturated fatty acid molecule has 12 hydrogen atoms. This is as many hydrogen atoms as can possibly be bonded to carbon atoms in this molecule. The unsaturated fatty acid molecule has 10 hydrogen atoms, or two less than the maximum possible number. The saturated fatty acid has only single bonds between its carbon atoms. The unsaturated fatty acid has a double bond between two of its carbon atoms. 
Phospholipids 	  Some lipids contain the element phosphorus as well as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These lipids are called phospholipids. Two layers of phospholipid molecules make up the cell membranes of living things. In the Figure • One end of each phospholipid molecule is polar, so it has a partial electric charge. Water is also polar and has electrically charged ends, so it is attracted to the oppositely charged end of a phospholipid molecule. This end of the phospholipid molecule is described as hydrophilic, which means “water loving.” • The other end of each phospholipid molecule is nonpolar and has no electric charge. This end of the phospholipid molecule repels polar water and is described as hydrophobic, or “water hating.” In the Figure 3.76, the hydrophilic ends of the phospholipid molecules are on the outsides of the cell membrane, and the hydrophobic ends are on the inside of the cell membrane. This arrangement of phospholipids allows some substances to pass through the cell membrane while keeping other substances out. You can see how this works in the video at the URL below. URL

A spiral staircase can be used as a model for a DNA molecule. DNA is a nucleic acid. Q: DNA is such a well-known molecule that you probably know something about it already. What do you know about DNA, and why do you think this molecule is so “famous”? A: You many know that DNA contains genes. It is so “famous” because it explains how we inherit traits from our parents and pass them on to our offspring. What Are Nucleic Acids? Nucleic acids are one of four classes of biochemical compounds. (The other three classes are carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.) Nucleic acids include RNA (ribonucleic acid) as well as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Both types of nucleic acids contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Q: Which of the elements in DNA is not identified with any other class of biochemical compounds? A: All biochemical compounds contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; and proteins as well as nucleic acids contain nitrogen. Phosphorus is the only element that is identified with nucleic acids. 
Nucleotides 	  Nucleic acids consist of chains of small molecules called nucleotides, which are held together by covalent bonds. The structure of a nucleotide is shown in the Figure 3.77. Each nucleotide consists of: the bases are adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. RNA has the base uracil instead of thymine, but the other three bases are the same. 
The  Double  Helix 	  RNA consists of just one chain of nucleotides. DNA consists of two chains. Nitrogen bases on the two chains of DNA form hydrogen bonds with each other. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak bonds that form between a positively charged hydrogen atom in one molecule and a negatively charged atom in another molecule. Hydrogen bonds form only between adenine and thymine, and between guanine and cytosine. These bonds hold the two chains together and give DNA is characteristic double helix, or spiral, shape. You can see the shape of the DNA molecule in the Figure 3.78. Sugars and phosphate groups form the “backbone” of each chain of DNA. The bonded bases are called base pairs. Determining the structure of DNA was a huge scientific breakthrough. You can read the interesting story of its discovery and why it was so important at the URL below. URL Q: Compare the structure of DNA to a spiral staircase. What part of the molecule do the stair steps represent? A: The steps represent the base pairs. 
Functions of  Nucleic  Acids 	  DNA stores genetic information in the cells of all living things. It contains the genetic code. This is the code that instructs cells how to make proteins. The instructions are encoded in the sequence of nitrogen bases in the nucleotide chains of DNA. RNA copies and interprets the genetic code in DNA and is also involved in the synthesis of proteins based on the code. You can watch these events unfolding at the following URL.

How do you think the instructions encoded in DNA reach the cytoplasm so they can be used to make proteins? A: After RNA copies the instructions in DNA, it carries them from the nucleus to a site of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm, where the instructions are translated into a protein.

This marathon runner has just finished running a 26.2-mile race! Running that far nonstop takes a lot of energy—you can tell how drained she is from her face. But you don’t have to run a marathon to use energy. All living things need energy all the time just to stay alive. Whether it’s running a marathon or simply taking a breath, energy is required. Where does all that energy come from? The answer is chemical reactions. 
Chemical  Reactions in  Living  Things 	  Chemical reactions that take place inside living things are called biochemical reactions (biomeans “life”). It’s not just for energy that living things depend on biochemical reactions. Every function and structure of a living organism depends on thousands of biochemical reactions taking place in each cell. The sum of all these biochemical reactions is called metabolism. 
Catabolic and  Anabolic  Reactions 	  Biochemical reactions of metabolism can be divided into two general categories: catabolic reactions and anabolic reactions. You can watch an animation showing how the two categories of reactions are related at this URL: URL lasses.midlandstech.edu/carterp/courses/bio225/chap05/lecture1.htm • Catabolic reactions involve breaking bonds. Larger molecules are broken down to smaller ones. For example, complex carbohydrates are broken down to simple sugars. Catabolic reactions release energy, so they are exothermic. • Anabolic reactions involve forming bonds. Smaller molecules are combined to form larger ones. For example, simple sugars are combined to form complex carbohydrates. Anabolic reactions require energy, so they are endothermic. Q: Imagine! Each of the trillions of cells in your body is continuously performing thousands of catabolic and anabolic reactions. That’s an amazing number of biochemical reactions—far more than the number of reactions that might take place in a lab or factory. How can so many biochemical reactions take place simultaneously in our cells? A: So many reactions can occur because biochemical reactions are amazingly fast. Q: In a lab or factory, reactants can be heated to very high temperatures or placed under great pressure so they will react very quickly. These ways of speeding up chemical reactions can’t occur inside the delicate cells of living things. So how do cells speed up biochemical reactions? A: The answer is enzymes. 
The  Importance of  Enzymes 	  Enzymes are proteins that increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. Enzymes are synthesized in the cells that need them, based on instructions encoded in the cell’s DNA. Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again. Enzymes are highly specific for certain chemical reactions, so they are very effective. A reaction that would take years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme. Enzymes are also very efficient, so waste products rarely form. 
Photosynthesis and  Cellular  Respiration 	  Some of the most important biochemical reactions are the reactions involved in photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Together, these two processes provide energy to almost all of Earth’s organisms. The two processes are closely related, as you can see in the Figure 3.79. In photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is converted to stored chemical energy in glucose. In cellular respiration, stored energy is released from glucose and stored in smaller amounts that cells can use. Q: What are the reactants and products in photosynthesis and cellular respiration? A: In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are the reactants. They combine using energy from light to produce oxygen (O2) and glucose (C6H12O6). Oxygen and glucose, in turn, are the reactants in cellular respiration. They combine to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy. 
Summary 	  • Biochemical reactions are chemical reactions that take place inside living things. Thousands of biochemical reactions continuously take place inside each cell. The sum of all these biochemical reactions is called metabolism. • Biochemical reactions of metabolism can be divided into two general categories: catabolic reactions, which break bonds and release energy, and anabolic reactions, which form bonds and absorb energy. • Enzymes are proteins that greatly increase the rate of biochemical reactions, allowing thousands of reactions to occur simultaneously in living cells. • The chemical reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration together provide energy to virtually all living things on Earth.

Look at the amazing meat-eating plants pictured here! Called pitcher plants, they use their “pitchers” to capture and digest insects. But even these pitcher plants—like all other plants—make food by photosynthesis. They “eat” insects just to get extra nutrients. 
Food from  Light 	  Most of the energy used by living things comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. That’s because sunlight provides the energy for photosynthesis. This is the process in which plants and certain other organisms synthesize glucose (C6H12O6). The process uses carbon dioxide and water and also produces oxygen. The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is: Photosynthesis changes light energy to chemical energy. The chemical energy is stored in the bonds of glucose molecules. Glucose, in turn, is used for energy by the cells of almost all living things. Photosynthetic organisms such as plants make their own glucose. Other organisms get glucose by consuming plants (or organisms that consume plants). Q: How do living things get energy from glucose? A: They break bonds in glucose and release the stored energy in the process of cellular respiration. 
Photosynthetic  Organisms 	  The organisms pictured in the Figures 3.80, 3.81, and 3.82 all use sunlight to make glucose in the process of photosynthesis. In addition to plants, they include bacteria and algae. All of these organisms contain the green pigment chlorophyll, which is needed to capture light energy. 
A tremendous amount of photosynthesis 	  takes place in the plants of this lush tropical rainforest. 
The green streaks on this very blue 	  lake are photosynthetic bacteria called cyanobacteria. 
Summary 	  • Photosynthesis is the process in which certain living things use energy in sunlight to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water. Oxygen is also produced in this process. • Chemical energy that is stored in the bonds of glucose molecules is used by the cells of almost all living things for energy. • Living things that undergo photosynthesis and produce glucose include plants, cyanobacteria, and algae.

Breathing is often referred to as respiration. When you breathe, you take oxygen into your lungs as you inhale, and you release carbon dioxide and water vapor as you exhale. Inside all the cells of your body, a different kind of respiration takes place. This kind of respiration is called cellular respiration. What is Cellular Respiration? Cellular Respiration is the process in which the cells of living things break down the organic compound glucose with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. The overall chemical equation for cellular respiration is: 
C6 H12 O6 + 6 O2 → 6 O2 + 6 H2 	  As the Figure 3.83 shows, cellular respiration occurs in the cells of all kinds of organisms, including those that make their own food (autotrophs) as well as those that get their food by consuming other organisms (heterotrophs). Q: How is cellular respiration related to breathing? A: Breathing consists of inhaling and exhaling, and its purpose is to move gases into and out of the body. Oxygen needed for cellular respiration is brought into the body with each inhalation. Carbon dioxide and water vapor produced by cellular respiration are released from the body with each exhalation. 
Energy  Changes in  Cellular  Respiration 	  The reactions of cellular respiration are catabolic reactions. 
In catabolic reactions, bonds are broken in larger 	  molecules and energy is released. In cellular respiration, bonds are broken in glucose, and this releases the chemical energy that was stored in the glucose bonds. Some of this energy is converted to heat. The rest of the energy is used to form many small molecules of a compound called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. ATP molecules contain just the right amount of stored chemical energy to power biochemical reactions inside cells.

Summary 	  • Cellular respiration is the process in which the cells of all living things break down glucose with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. • Cellular respiration is a catabolic process that releases energy by breaking bonds in glucose. It uses the energy to form ATP, a small molecule that stores just the right amount of energy for cells to use.

An enzyme cleaner like the one pictured here contains proteins called enzymes. The enzymes attach themselves to particular stains and help break them down. Different enzymes work on different types of stains, such as grease stains or bloodstains. Removing stains isn’t the only use of enzymes. Enzymes are also essential to life. 
Why  Living  Things  Need  Enzymes 	  Chemical reactions constantly occur inside the cells of living things. However, under the conditions inside cells, most biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to maintain life. That’s where enzymes come in. Enzymes are catalysts in living things. Like other catalysts, they speed up chemical reactions. Enzymes are proteins that are synthesized in the cells that need them, based on instructions encoded in the cells’ DNA. 
How  Enzymes  Work 	  Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. One way this can happen is modeled in the Figure 3.84. Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again. Each enzyme is highly specific for the particular reaction is catalyzes, so enzymes are very effective. A reaction that would take many years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme. Enzymes are also very efficient, so waste products rarely form. Q: This model of enzyme action is called the lock-and-key model. Explain why. A: The substrates (reactants) fit precisely into the active site of the enzyme like a key into a lock. Being brought together in the enzyme in this way helps the reactants react more easily. After the product is formed, it is released by the enzyme. The enzyme is now ready to pick up more reactants and catalyze another reaction. You can see an animated version of this model at the following URL.

Digestive  Enzymes 	  More than 1000 different enzymes are necessary for human life. Many enzymes are needed for the digestion of food. Two examples are amylase and pepsin. Both are described in the Figure 3.85. 
Summary 	  • Enzymes are catalysts in living things. They speed up biochemical reactions. • Under the conditions inside living cells, biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to support life without the help of enzymes. • Enzymes increase the rate of biochemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. • More than 1000 different enzymes are necessary for human life, and many help digest food.

It can be really exciting to explore a big underground cave like the one in this picture. Do you know how caves form? Believe it or not, water is the answer. Water slowly dissolves rocks, especially certain types of rocks such as limestone. When rocks or other substances dissolve in water, they form a solution. What Is a Solution? A solution is a mixture of two or more substances, but it’s not just any mixture. A solution is a homogeneous mixture. In a homogeneous mixture, the dissolved particles are spread evenly through the mixture. The particles of the solution are also too small to be seen or to settle out of the mixture. To put solutions in context as a type of mixture, watch the video at this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Parts of a  Solution 	  All solutions have two parts: the solute and the solvent. The solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute. Particles of solvent pull apart particles of solute, and the solute particles spread throughout the solvent. Salt water, such as the ocean water in the Figure 3.86, is an example of a solution. In a saltwater solution, salt is the solute and water is the solvent. Q: A scientist obtained a sample of water from the Atlantic Ocean and determined that the sample was about 3.5 percent dissolved salt. Predict the percent of dissolved salt in a sample of water from the Pacific Ocean. A: As a solution, ocean water is a homogeneous mixture. Therefore, no matter where the water sample is obtained, its composition will be about 3.5 percent dissolved salt. Soluble or Insoluble? Not only salt, but many other solutes can dissolve in water. In fact, so many solutes can dissolve in water that water has been called the universal solvent. Even rocks can dissolve in water, which explains the cave that opened this article. A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, is said to be soluble in that solvent. Conversely, a solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent. Although most solutes can dissolve in water, some solutes are insoluble in water. Oil is an example. Did you ever try to mix oil with water? No matter how well you mix the oil into the water, after the mixture stands for a while, the oil separates from the water and rises to the top. You can see how oil floats on ocean water in the Figure 3.87. 
Solutions and  States of  Matter 	  Like salt water in the ocean, many solutions are normally in the liquid state. However, matter in any state can form a solution. An alloy, which is a mixture of a metal with one or more other substances, is a solid solution at room temperature. For example, the alloy bronze is a solution of copper and tin. Matter in the gaseous state can also form solutions. Q: What is an example of a gaseous solution? A: Air in the atmosphere is a gaseous solution. It is a mixture that contains mainly nitrogen and oxygen gases, with very small amounts of several other gases. The circle graph in the Figure 3.88 shows the composition of air. Oil from an oil spill floats on ocean water. Because air is a solution, it is homogeneous. In other words, no matter where you go, the air always contains the same proportion of gases that are shown in the graph. 
Summary 	  • A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances in which the dissolved particles are too small to be seen or to settle out of the mixture. • In a solution, the substance that dissolves is the solute, and the substance that dissolves the solute is the solvent. • A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent is said to be soluble in that solvent. A solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent. • Solutions may be liquids such as salt water, solids such as alloys, or gases such as air.

This giant Buddha statue, which is a national treasure in Japan, is made of bronze. Bronze consists mainly of copper but also contains some tin. Bronze is an example of a solution. A solution is a type of mixture that has the same composition throughout. 
How a  Solution  Forms 	  A solution forms when one substance is dissolved by another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance that dissolves it is called the solvent. The solute is present in a lesser amount that the solvent. When the solute dissolves, it separates into individual particles, which spread throughout the solvent. Q: In bronze, what are the solute and solvent? A: Because bronze consists mainly of copper, copper is the solvent and tin is the solute. The two metals are combined in a hot, molten state, but they form a solid solution at room temperature. What’s Your State? In the example of bronze, a solid (tin) is dissolved in another solid (copper). However, matter in any state can be the solute or solvent in a solution. For example, in a saltwater solution, a solid (salt) is dissolved in a liquid (water). The Table 3.10 describes examples of solutions consisting of solutes and solvents in various states of matter.

Water as a  Solvent 	  Salt isn’t the only solute that dissolves in water. In fact, so many things dissolve in water that water is sometimes called the universal solvent. Water is such a good solvent because it is a very polar compound. A polar compound has positively and negatively charged ends. Solutes that are also charged are attracted to the oppositely charged ends of water molecules. This allows the water molecules to pull the solute particles apart. On the other hand, there are some substances that don’t dissolve in water. Did you ever try to clean a paintbrush with water after painting with an oil-based paint? It doesn’t work. Oil-based paint is nonpolar, so its particles aren’t charged. As a result, oil-based paint doesn’t dissolve in water. (You can see how to dissolve oil-based paint in the To dissolve a nonpolar solute such as oil-based paint, a nonpolar solvent such as paint thinner must be used. 
Like  Dissolves  Like 	  These examples illustrate a general rule about solutes and solvents: like dissolves like. In other words, polar solvents dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes. You can see a student’s video demonstrating solutes that do and solutes that don’t dissolve in water at this URL: URL OQ . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Ionic and  Covalent  Solutes 	  All solutes separate into individual particles when they dissolve, but the particles are different for ionic and covalent compounds. Ionic solutes separate into individual ions. Covalent solutes separate into individual molecules. Salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), is an ionic compound. When it dissolves in water, it separates into positive sodium ions (Na+) and negative chloride ions (Cl−). You can see how this happens in the Figure 3.90. The negative oxygen ends of water molecules attract the positive sodium ions, and the positive hydrogen ends of water molecules attract the negative chloride ions. These forces of attraction pull the ions apart. You can watch this happening in animations at these URLs: • URL • URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. The sugar glucose is a covalent compound. When sugar dissolves in water, it forms individual glucose molecules (C6H12O6). You can see how this happens in the Figure 3.91. Sugar is polar like water, so sugar molecules also have positive and negative ends. Forces of attraction between oppositely charged ends of water and sugar molecules pull individual sugar molecules away from the sugar crystal. Little by little, the sugar molecules are separated from the crystal and surrounded by water. You can watch this happening in the video at the following URL: URL outube.com/watch?v=hydUVGUbyvU Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • A solution forms when one substance dissolves in another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance that dissolves it is called the solvent. • Solutes and solvents may be any state of matter. • Many solutes dissolve in water because water is a very polar compound. • A general rule: like dissolves like. For example, polar solvents dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes. • Ionic solutes separate into individual ions when they dissolve. Covalent solutes separate into individual molecules. Watch the video about solutes and solvents at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.

If you’re like Tanya in this picture, you prefer your iced tea sweetened with sugar. Sweetened iced tea is a solution in which solid sugar (the solute) is dissolved in cold liquid tea, which is mostly water (the solvent). When you add sugar to tea, particles of water pull apart particles of sugar. The particles of sugar spread throughout the tea, making all of it taste sweet. 
Factors  That  Affect the  Rate of  Dissolving 	  Did you ever get impatient and start drinking a sweetened drink before all the sugar has dissolved? As you drink the last few drops, you notice that some of the sugar is sitting on the bottom of the container. Q: What could you do to dissolve the sugar faster? A: The rate of dissolving is influenced by several factors, including stirring, temperature of solvent, and size of solute particles. You can see videos demonstrating these factors at the following URLs: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Stirring 	  Stirring a solute into a solvent speeds up the rate of dissolving because it helps distribute the solute particles throughout the solvent. For example, when you add sugar to iced tea and then stir the tea, the sugar will dissolve faster. If you don’t stir the iced tea, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. 
Temperature 	  The temperature of the solvent is another factor that affects how fast a solute dissolves. Generally, a solute dissolves faster in a warmer solvent than it does in a cooler solvent because particles have more energy of movement. For example, if you add the same amount of sugar to a cup of hot tea and a cup of iced tea, the sugar will dissolve faster in the hot tea. 
Particle  Size 	  A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the size of solute particles. For a given amount of solute, smaller particles have greater surface area. With greater surface area, there can be more contact between particles of solute and solvent. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of iced tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube (see Figure 3.92). That’s because all those tiny particles of granulated sugar have greater total surface area than a single sugar cube. 
Summary 	  • The rate of dissolving of a solute in a solvent is faster when the solute and solvent are stirred, the solvent is warmer, or the solute consists of smaller particles with more surface area. Design an experiment to investigate the effects of temperature on the rate of dissolving. You can see an example in the video at the following URL. Identify dependent and independent variables and factors that need to be controlled. Make a list of materials needed for your experiment, and write a step-by-step procedure. URL atch?v=TO42FOay7rg Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Describe how solutes affect the properties of solvents in solutions. • Give examples of freezing point depression and boiling point elevation. Why hasn’t the ocean water in this photo turned to ice? The water in the glacier on shore is frozen solid, but the water in the ocean is still in a liquid state. Q: What is it about ocean water that keeps it from freezing when the temperature falls below the freezing point of pure water? A: Ocean water is salty. 
How  Solutes  Affect  Solvents 	  Salt water in the ocean is a solution. In a solution, one substance, called the solute, dissolves in another substance, called the solvent. In ocean water, salt is the solute and water is the solvent. When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes the physical properties of the solvent. In particular, the solute generally lowers the freezing point of the solvent, which is called freezing point depression, and raises the boiling point of the solvent, which is called boiling point elevation. For example, adding either salt to water lowers the freezing point and raises the boiling point of the water. To learn the why these effects occur, watch the excellent video at this URL: URL ?v=z9LxdqYntlU . 
Freezing  Point  Depression 	  Pure water freezes at 0 °C, but the salt water in the ocean freezes at -2.2 °C because of freezing point depression. We take advantage of the freezing point depression of salt in water by putting salt on ice to melt it. That’s why the truck in the Figure 3.93 is spreading salt on an icy road. Did you ever see anyone add a fluid to their car radiator? The fluid might be antifreeze, like in the Figure 3.94. Antifreeze lowers the temperature of the water in the car radiator so it won’t freeze, even when the temperature falls far below 0 °C. For example, a 50 percent antifreeze solution won’t freeze unless the temperature goes below -37 °C. 
Boiling  Point  Elevation 	  Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine. 
Summary 	  • When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes the physical properties of the solvent. • A solute generally lowers the freezing point of a solvent, which is called freezing point depression. For example, spreading salt on an icy road melts the ice. • A solute generally raises the boiling point of a solvent, which is called boiling point elevation. For example, adding antifreeze to the water in a car radiator prevents the water from boiling. Do the animated experiment at the following URL. First, select water as the solvent and sodium chloride as the solute. Then, determine the boiling and freezing points of a solution containing different masses of the solute, while holding the mass of solvent constant at 200 grams. Test at least five different masses of the solute, and record your results in a data table. Finally, write a brief summary of what your data reveal about boiling point elevation and freezing point depression of saltwater solutions.

How might it affect the time it takes the spaghetti to cook? • Define solubility. • Describe how temperature and pressure affect solubility. Rhonda wanted to see if salt or sugar dissolves faster in water. She added the same amount of salt and sugar to a half liter of room temperature (20 °C) water in separate glasses. Then she stirred both mixtures. All of the sugar dissolved in less than a minute, but after 5 minutes of stirring, some of the salt still hadn’t dissolved. Even if she had kept stirring the saltwater mixture all day, the remaining salt would not dissolve. Do you know why? The answer is their solubility. What Is Solubility? Solubility is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature. In a solution, the solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that does the dissolving. For a given solvent, some solutes have greater solubility than others. For example, sugar is much more soluble in water than is salt. But even sugar has an upper limit on how much can dissolve. In a half liter of 20 °C water, the maximum amount is 1000 grams. If you add more sugar than this, the extra sugar won’t dissolve. You can compare the solubility of sugar, salt, and some other solutes in the Table 3.11. For a video about solubility, go to this URL: URL atch?v=IKimraU21ws .

Table sugar 	  TABLE 3.11: (continued) Grams of Solute that Will Dissolve in 0.5 L of Water (20 °C) Q: How much salt do you think Rhonda added to the half-liter of water in her experiment? A: The solubility of salt is 180 grams per half liter of water at 20 °C. If Rhonda had added less than 180 grams of salt to the half-liter of water, then all of it would have dissolved. Because some of the salt did not dissolve, she must have added more than 180 grams of salt to the water. 
Factors  That  Affect  Solubility 	  Certain factors can change the solubility of a solute. Temperature is one such factor. How temperature affects solubility depends on the state of the solute, as you can see in the Figure 3.95. You can learn more about temperature and other factors that affect solubility at this URL: URL . • If a solute is a solid or liquid, increasing the temperature increases its solubility. For example, more sugar can dissolve in hot water than in cold water. • If a solute is a gas, increasing the temperature decreases its solubility. For example, less carbon dioxide can dissolve in warm water than in cold water. The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the force pushing against a given area. Increasing the pressure on a gas increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it fizzes out of the can? Soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide. Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas in solution, so it is less soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air. Q: Which do you think will fizz more when you open it, a can of warm soda or a can of cold soda? A: A can of warm soda will fizz more because increasing the temperature decreases the solubility of a gas. Therefore, less carbon dioxide can remain dissolved in warm soda than in cold soda. 
Summary 	  • Solubility is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature. Some solutes have greater solubility than others. • Temperature affects the solubility of solutes in all three states. Pressure also affects the solubility of gases. At the following URL, watch the video about solubility, and then answer the questions below. URL om/watch?v=IKimraU21ws why. faster or slower if you add ice? Why? • Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated solutions. • Decide whether a given solution is saturated or unsaturated. You could add all the sugar in this scoop to the water in the measuring container, and all the sugar would dissolve, forming a sugar-water solution. A solution is a mixture of two or more substances in which the substances are mixed evenly throughout. The substance that dissolves in a solution is the solute. In this case the solute is sugar. The substance that does the dissolving—in this case, the water—is the solvent. Sugar is one of the most soluble solutes in water. This means that more of it can dissolve in water than is true of many other solutes. However, there is a limit on how much of any solute—even sugar—will dissolve in water or other given solvent. 
Saturated vs.  Unsaturated  Solutions 	  The maximum amount of sugar that will dissolve in a liter of 20 °C water is 2000 grams. A sugar-water solution that contains 1 liter of water and 2000 grams of sugar is said to be saturated. A saturated solution is a solution that contains as much solute as can dissolve in a given solvent at a given temperature. If you add more than 2000 grams of sugar to a liter of 20 °C water, the extra sugar won’t dissolve. On the other hand, a solution containing less than a given temperature is called an unsaturated solution. You can learn more about saturated and unsaturated solutions by watching the video at this URL: URL . 
Saturation  Depends on the  Solute 	  The Figure 3.96 shows the amounts of several different solutes that will dissolve in a liter of water at 20 °C. As you can see from the graph, solutes vary greatly in how soluble they are in water. For example, you can dissolve almost Q: Assume that a solution contains 150 grams of Epsom salt in 1 liter of water at 20 °C. Is the solution saturated or unsaturated? A: A saturated solution of Epsom salt in 1 liter of 20 °C water would contain 250 grams of Epsom salt. Therefore, this solution is unsaturated. It can hold another 100 grams of Epsom salt. Q: What do you think would happen if you added more than 250 grams of Epsom salt to a liter of 20 °C water? A: Any Epsom salt over 250 grams would not dissolve in the solution. 
Summary 	  • A saturated solution is a solution that contains as much solute as can dissolve in a given solvent at a given temperature. An unsaturated solution is a solution that contains less solute than can dissolve in a given solvent at a given temperature. • Solutes differ in their solubility in a given solvent. Therefore, a saturated solution of one solute might contain more or less solute than a saturated solution of a different solute. At the following URL, watch the video on solubility. Pay special attention to minutes 3:50–6:55 (the section on saturation). Then answer the questions below. URL solution, he can’t get all of the baking soda to dissolve. Explain why. • Define the concentration of a solution. • Contrast concentrated and dilute solutions. • Show how to calculate the concentration of a solution. Dante was shopping for juice and saw a bottle of juice concentrate. He read the label and learned that some of the water had been removed from the juice before it was bottled, so the concentrate had to be mixed with water before drinking. Next to the bottle of juice was a can of juice. The canned juice was ready to drink. Juice concentrate is an example of a concentrated solution. Ready-to-drink juice is an example of a dilute solution. 
Concentrated and  Dilute  Solutions 	  A solution is a mixture of two or more substances in which dissolved particles are distributed evenly throughout the solution. The substance that dissolves in a solution is called the solute, and the substance that does the dissolving is called the solvent. The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute in a given amount of solution. A solution with a lot of dissolved solute has a high concentration and is called a concentrated solution. A solution with little dissolved solute has a low concentration and is called a dilute solution. 
Calculating the  Concentration of a  Solution 	  The concentration of a solution represents the percentage of the solution that is the solute. You can calculate the concentration of a solution using this formula: 
Mass (or volume) of  Solution × 100% 	  For example, if a 100-gram solution of salt water contains 3 grams of salt, then its concentration is: 
Concentration = 3g 	  Q: A 1000 mL container of brand A juice drink contains 250 mL of juice and 750 mL of water. A 600 mL container of brand B juice drink contains 200 mL of juice and 400 mL of water. Which brand of juice drink is more concentrated, brand A or brand B? 
Concentration( B) = 200 m 	  You can conclude that brand B is more concentrated. At the following URLs, you can learn how to solve concentration problems that are a little more challenging. URL URL 
Summary 	  • The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute in a given amount of solution. A concentrated solution has more solute in a given amount of solvent than a dilute solution. • The concentration of a solution can be calculated with this formula:

Look at the boy in the photo above. You can tell by the expression on his face that lemon juice tastes sour. Lemon juice is an acid, and all acids taste sour. They share certain other properties as well. You will learn more about acids and their properties in this article. For a musical introduction to acids and related concepts, watch the video at this What Are Acids? Acids are ionic compounds that produce positive hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water. Ionic compounds are compounds that contain positive metal ions and negative nonmetal ions held together by ionic bonds. (Ions are atoms that have become charged particles by gaining or losing electrons.) An example of an acid is hydrogen chloride (HCl). When it dissolves in water, it separates into positive hydrogen ions and negative chloride ions (Cl−). This is represented by the chemical equation: 
Properties of  Acids 	  You already know that a sour taste is one property of acids. (Warning: Never taste an unknown substance to see whether it is an acid!) Acids have certain other properties as well. For example, acids can conduct electricity when dissolved in water because they consist of charged particles in solution. (Electric current is a flow of charged particles.) Acids can also react with metals, and when they do they produce hydrogen gas. An example of this type of reaction is hydrochloric acid reacting with the metal zinc (Zn). The reaction is pictured in the Figure 3.97. It can be represented by the chemical equation: 
Hydrochloric acid reacting with the metal 	  zinc. Q: What sign indicates that a gas is being produced in this reaction? A: The bubbles are hydrogen gas rising through the acid. Q: Besides hydrogen gas, what else is produced in this reaction? A: This reaction also produces zinc chloride ZnCl2, which is a neutral ionic compound called a salt.

Detecting  Acids 	  Certain compounds, called indicators, change color when acids come into contact with them, so indicators can be used to detect acids. An example of an indicator is the compound called litmus. It is placed on small strips of paper that may be red or blue. If you place a few drops of acid on a strip of blue litmus paper, the paper will turn red. You can see this in the Figure 3.98. Litmus isn’t the only indicator for detecting acids. Red cabbage juice also works well, as you can see in this entertaining video: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Drawing of blue litmus paper turning red 	  in acid. 
Strength of  Acids 	  The strength of acids is measured on a scale called the pH scale. The pH value of a solution represents its concentration of hydrogen ions. A pH value of 7 indicates a neutral solution, and a pH value less than 7 indicates an acidic solution. The lower the pH value is, the greater is the concentration of hydrogen ions and the stronger the acid. The strongest acids, such as battery acid, have pH values close to zero. 
Uses of  Acids 	  Acids have many important uses, especially in industry. For example, sulfuric acid is used to manufacture a variety of different products, including paper, paint, and detergent. Some other uses of acids are be seen in the Figure 3.99. 
Summary 	  • Acids are ionic compounds that produce positive hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water. • Acids taste sour, conduct electricity when dissolved in water, and react with metals to produce hydrogen gas. • Certain indicator compounds, such as litmus, can be used to detect acids.

These blocks of baking chocolate may make your mouth water, but if you were to taste them, you would be in for an unpleasant surprise. The blocks are unsweetened chocolate. Without any added sugar, chocolate tastes bitter. Chocolate tastes bitter because it’s a base. What Are Bases? Bases are ionic compounds that produce negative hydroxide ions (OH−) when dissolved in water. An ionic compound contains positive metal ions and negative nonmetal ions held together by ionic bonds. (Ions are atoms that have become charged particles because they have either lost or gained electrons.) An example of a base is sodium hydroxide (NaOH). When it dissolves in water, it produces negative hydroxide ions and positive sodium ions (Na+). This can be represented by the equation: 
Properties of  Bases 	  All bases share certain properties, including a bitter taste. (Warning: Never taste an unknown substance to see whether it is a base!) Bases also feel slippery. Think about how slippery soap feels. That’s because it’s a base. In addition, bases conduct electricity when dissolved in water because they consist of charged particles in solution. (Electric current is a flow of charged particles.) Q: Bases are closely related to compounds called acids. How are their properties similar? How are they different? A: A property that is shared by bases and acids is the ability to conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Some ways bases and acids are different is that acids taste sour whereas bases taste bitter. Also, acids but not bases react with metals. For other differences between bases and acids, as well as why they differ in these ways, read the short article at this URL: URL 
Detecting  Bases 	  Certain compounds, called indicators, change color when bases come into contact with them, so they can be used to detect bases. An example of an indicator is a compound called litmus. It is placed on small strips of paper that may be red or blue. If you place a few drops of a base on a strip of red litmus paper, the paper will turn blue. You can see this in the Figure 3.100. Litmus isn’t the only detector of bases. Red cabbage juice can also detect bases, as you can see in this video: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Drawing of red litmus paper turning blue 	  in a base. 
Strength of  Bases 	  The strength of bases is measured on a scale called the pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14. On this scale, a pH value of 7 indicates a neutral solution, and a pH value greater than 7 indicates a basic solution. The higher the pH value is, the stronger the base. The strongest bases, such as drain cleaner, have a pH value close to 14. 
Uses of  Bases 	  Bases are used for a variety of purposes. For example, soaps contain bases such as potassium hydroxide (KOH). Other uses of bases can be seen in the Figure 3.101.

This scientist is collecting and testing samples of water from the river. One of the properties of the water she is testing is acidity. She wants to know how acidic the water is because water that is too acidic can harm the health of water organisms. 
Strength of  Acids and  Bases 	  Acids are ionic compounds that produce positively charged hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water. Acids taste sour and react with metals. Bases are ionic compounds that produce negatively charged hydroxide ions (OH−) when dissolved in water. Bases taste bitter and do not react with metals. Examples of acids are vinegar and battery acid. The acid in vinegar is weak enough to safely eat on a salad. The acid in a car battery is strong enough to eat through skin. Examples of bases include those in antacid tablets and drain cleaner. Bases in antacid tablets are weak enough to take for an upset stomach. Bases in drain cleaner are strong enough to cause serious burns. Q: What do you think causes these differences in the strength of acids and bases? A: The strength of an acid or a base depends on how much of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. 
Concentration of  Ions 	  The strength of an acid depends on how many hydrogen ions it produces when it dissolves in water. A stronger acid produces more hydrogen ions than a weaker acid. For example, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which is found in car batteries, is a strong acid because nearly all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. On the other hand, acetic acid (CH3CO2H), which is the acid in vinegar, is a weak acid because less than 1 percent of it breaks down into ions in water. The strength of a base depends on how many hydroxide ions it produces when it dissolves in water. A stronger base produces more hydroxide ions than a weaker base. For example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a base in drain cleaner, is a strong base because all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a base in antacids, is a weak base because only a small percentage of it breaks down into ions in water. 
The p H  Scale 	  The strength of acids and bases is measured on a scale called the pH scale, which is shown in the Figure 3.102. By definition, pH represents the acidity, or hydrogen ion (H+) concentration, of a solution. Pure water, which is neutral, has a pH of 7. With a higher the concentration of hydrogen ions, a solution is more acidic and has a lower pH. Acids have a pH less than 7, and the strongest acids have a pH close to zero. Bases have a pH greater than 7, and the strongest bases have a pH close to 14. It’s important to realize that the pH scale is based on powers of ten. For example, a solution with a pH of 8 is 10 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7, and a solution with a pH of 9 is 100 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7. Q: How much more acidic is a solution with a pH of 4 than a solution with a pH of 7? A: A solution with a pH of 4 is 1000 (10 × 10 × 10, or 103) times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 7. Q: Which solution on the pH scale in the Figure 3.102 is the weakest acid? Which solution is the strongest base? A: The weakest acid on the scale is milk, which has a pH value between 6.5 and 6.8. The strongest base on the scale is liquid drain cleaner, which has a pH of 14. For a deeper understanding of pH and the pH scale, watch the video at this URL: URL ?v=M8tTELZD5Ek . For an interactive exploration of pH, including an interactive pH scale, go to this URL: URL ph/index.html . 
Why p H  Matters 	  Acidity is an important factor for living things. For example, many plants grow best in soil that has a pH between 6 and 7. Fish may also need a pH between 6 and 7. Certain air pollutants form acids when dissolved in water droplets in the air. This results in acid fog and acid rain, which may have a pH of 4 or even lower. The pH chart in the Figure also lowers the pH of surface waters such as ponds and lakes. As a result, the water may become too acidic for fish and other water organisms to survive. 
Acid fog and acid rain killed the trees in 	  this forest. Even normal (clean) rain is somewhat acidic. That’s because carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air dissolves in raindrops, producing a weak acid called carbonic acid (H2CO3), which has a pH of about 5.5. When rainwater soaks into the ground, it can slowly dissolve rocks, particularly those containing calcium carbonate. This is how water forms underground caves. Q: How do you think acid rain might affect buildings and statues made of stone? A: Acid rain dissolves and damages stone buildings and statues. The Figure 3.104 shows a statue that has been damaged by acid rain. 
Summary 	  • The strength of an acid or base is called acidity. It depends on how much of the substance breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. • Acidity is measured by pH, which is the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. • Acidity is an important factor for living things because most can survive only within a relatively narrow range of acidity.

URL • Identify the ions produced when acids and bases dissolve in water. • Describe neutralization reactions and the formation of salts. What is one of the most important characteristics of a referee? A referee must be neutral. He can’t favor one team over the other. In chemistry, being neutral means not being an acid or a base. Pure water is an example of a neutral substance. In some chemical reactions, an acid and a base combine to form neutral products, including water. You’ll see how this happens when you read this article. 
Acids,  Bases, and  Ions 	  An acid is a compound that produces positive hydrogen ions (H+) and negative nonmetal ions when it dissolves in water. (Ions are atoms that have become charged by losing or gaining electrons.) Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is an example of an acid. When it dissolves in water, it produces positive hydrogen ions and negative chloride ions (Cl−). This can be represented by the chemical equation: 
Cl  H2 O→  H+ +  Cl− 	  A base is a compound that produces negative hydroxide ions (OH−) and positive metal ions when it dissolves in water. For example, when the base sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolves in water, it produces negative hydroxide ions and positive sodium ions (Na+). This can be represented by the chemical equation: 
Na H  H2 O→  H− +  Na+ 	  Q: If you were to combine acid and base solutions, what products do you think would be produced? A: Combining acid and base solutions produces water and a neutral ionic compound. 
Reactions of  Acids and  Bases 	  When an acid and a base react, the reaction is called a neutralization reaction. That’s because the reaction produces neutral products. Water is always one product, and a salt is also produced. A salt is a neutral ionic compound. You can learn more about salts and how they form at this URL: URL . Let’s see how a neutralization reaction produces both water and a salt, using as an example the reaction between solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. The overall equation for this reaction is: 
Na H +  Cl →  H2 O and  Na Cl 	  Now let’s break this reaction down into two parts to see how each product forms. • Positive hydrogen ions from HCl and negative hydroxide ions from NaOH combine to form water. This part of the reaction can be represented by the equation: 
H+ +  H− →  H2 	  • Positive sodium ions from NaOH and negative chloride ions from HCL combine to form the salt sodium chloride (NaCl), commonly called table salt. This part of the reaction can be represented by the equation: 
Na+ +  Cl− →  Na Cl 	  Another example of a neutralization reaction can be seen in the Figure 3.105. 
These antacid tablets contain the base 	  calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The base reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach. The reaction neutralizes the acid to relieve acid indigestion. Q: What products are produced when antacid tablets react with hydrochloric acid in the stomach? A: The products are water and the salt calcium chloride (CaCl2). Carbon dioxide (CO2) is also produced. The reaction is represented by the chemical equation:

The man in this old illustration was an alchemist. Alchemists, who lived during the Middle Ages, were people who strived to turn lead into gold. They tried all sorts of chemical reactions involving lead, but they were never able to produce gold. Today, scientists know that one element cannot be changed into another by chemical processes. However, there is a way that some elements can change into others. You’ll find out what it is when you read this article. 
Elements and  Protons 	  For an atom of one element to change into a different element, the number of protons in its nucleus must change. That’s because each element has a unique number of protons. For example, lead atoms always have 82 protons, and gold atoms always have 79 protons. Q: So how can one element change into another? A: The starting element must be radioactive, and its nuclei must gain or lose protons. 
Radioactive  Elements 	  Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from its nucleus. The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation. Only unstable nuclei emit radiation. They are unstable because they have too much energy, too many protons, or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. For example, all elements with more than 83 protons—such as uranium, radium, and polonium—have unstable nuclei. They are called radioactive elements. The nuclei of these elements must lose protons to become more stable. When they do, they become different elements. 
How  Radioactivity  Was  Discovered 	  Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by a French physicist named Antoine Henri Becquerel, who is pictured 3.106. Becquerel was experimenting with uranium, which was known to glow after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel wanted to see if the glow was caused by rays of energy, like rays of light or X-rays. He placed a bit of uranium on a photographic plate after exposing the uranium to sunlight. The plate was similar to the film that is used today to take X-rays, and Becquerel expected the uranium to leave an image on the plate. The next day, there was an image on the plate, just as Becquerel expected. This meant that uranium gives off rays after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel was a good scientist, so he wanted to repeat his experiment to confirm his results. He placed more uranium on another photographic plate. However, the day had turned cloudy, so he tucked the plate and uranium in a drawer to try again another day. He wasn’t expecting the uranium to leave an image on the plate without first being exposed to sunlight. To his surprise, there was an image on the plate in the drawer the next day. Becquerel had discovered that uranium gives off rays of energy on its own. He had discovered radioactivity, for which he received a Nobel prize. To learn more about the importance of Becquerel’s research, go to this URL: URL es/physics/laureates/1903/becquerel-bio.html Another scientist, who worked with Becquerel, actually came up with the term radioactivity. The other scientist was the French chemist Marie Curie. She went on to discover the radioactive elements polonium and radium. She won two Nobel Prizes for her discoveries. You can learn more about Marie Curie at this URL: URL bel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/marie-curie-bio.html 
Summary 	  • Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit charged particles and energy from its nucleus. The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation. • Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by Antoine Henri Becquerel when he found that uranium leaves an image like an X-ray on a photographic plate. Besides uranium, radioactive elements include radium and polonium, both of which were discovered by Marie Curie.

This fossil skull came from an ancient human ancestor. Scientists used carbon-14 dating to estimate its age. CarbonWhat Are Radioisotopes? All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus, but they may have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Many elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive. These isotopes are called radioisotopes. Their nuclei are unstable, so they break down, or decay, and emit radiation. Q: What makes the nucleus of a radioisotope unstable? A: The nucleus may be unstable because it has too many protons or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. For a nucleus with a small number of protons to be stable, the ratio of protons to neutrons should be 1:1. For a nucleus with a large number of protons to be stable, the ratio should be about 1:1.5. 
An  Example:  Carbon-14 	  Find carbon in the Figure 3.107, and you’ll see that its atomic number is 6. This means that all carbon atoms have carbon-12, where 12 is the number of protons (6) plus neutrons (6). This gives carbon-12 nuclei a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons, so carbon-12 nuclei are stable. Some carbon atoms have more than 6 neutrons, either 7 or 8. Carbon atoms with 8 neutrons are called carbon-14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons). The nuclei of carbon-14 atoms are unstable because they have too many neutrons relative to protons, so they gradually decay. Q: What is the proton-to-neutron ratio of carbon-14 nuclei? A: With six protons and 8 neutrons, the ratio is 6:8, or 1:1.3. Q: How is carbon-14 used to estimate the ages of fossils? A: Living things take in carbon, including tiny amounts of carbon-14, throughout life. The carbon-14 constantly decays, but more carbon-14 is taken in all the time to replace it. After living things die, no new carbon-14 is taken in, and the carbon-14 they already have keeps decaying. The older a fossil is, the less carbon-14 it still has, so the remaining amount can be measured to estimate the fossil’s age. You can learn more about carbon-14 dating at this URL: URL .

Radioactive  Elements 	  In elements with more than 83 protons, all of the isotopes are radioactive. In the Figure 3.107, these are the elements with a yellow background. The force of repulsion among all those protons makes the nuclei unstable. Elements with more than 92 protons have such unstable nuclei that they don’t even exist in nature. They have only been created in labs. 
Summary 	  • Many elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive. These isotopes are called radioisotopes. An example of a radioisotope is carbon-14. • The nuclei of radioisotopes are unstable, so they constantly decay and emit radiation. • In elements with more than 83 protons, all of the isotopes are radioactive.

Atomic  Number 	  >82 • Identify sources of environmental radiation. • Describe the dangers of radiation. • List uses of radiation. You may have seen this sign before—maybe in a hospital. The sign means there is danger of radiation in the area. Radiation consists of particles and energy that are given off by radioactive isotopes, which have unstable nuclei. But you don’t have to go to a hospital to be exposed to radiation. There is radiation in the world all around you. 
Radiation in the  Environment 	  A low level of radiation occurs naturally in the environment. This is called background radiation. One source of background radiation is rocks, which may contain small amounts of radioactive elements such as uranium. Another source is cosmic rays. These are charged particles that arrive on Earth from outer space. Background radiation is generally considered to be safe for living things. You can learn more about background radiation with the animation at this URL: URL 
Dangers of  Radiation 	  Long-term or high-dose exposure to radiation can harm both living and nonliving things. Radiation knocks electrons out of atoms and changes them to ions. It also breaks bonds in DNA and other compounds in living things. One source of radiation that is especially dangerous to people is radon. Radon is a radioactive gas that forms in rocks underground. It can seep into basements and get trapped inside buildings. Then it may build up and become harmful to people who breathe it. Long-term exposure to radon can cause lung cancer. Exposure to higher levels of radiation can be very dangerous, even if the exposure is short-term. A single large dose of radiation can burn the skin and cause radiation sickness. Symptoms of this illness include extreme fatigue, destruction of blood cells, and loss of hair. To learn more about the harmful health effects of radiation, go to this Click image to the left or use the URL below. Nonliving things can also be damaged by radiation. For example, high levels of radiation can weaken metals by removing electrons. This is a problem in nuclear power plants and space vehicles because they are exposed to very high levels of radiation. Q: Can you tell when you are being exposed to radiation? For example, can you sense radon in the air? A: Radiation can’t be detected with the senses. This adds to its danger. However, there are other ways to detect it. 
Detecting  Radiation 	  You generally can’t see, smell, taste, hear, or feel radiation. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure 3.108, contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. URL 
Using  Radiation 	  Despite its dangers, radioactivity has several uses. For example, it can be used to determine the ages of ancient rocks and fossils. It can also be used as a source of power to generate electricity. Radioactivity can even be used to diagnose and treat diseases, including cancer. Cancer cells grow rapidly and take up a lot of glucose for energy. Glucose containing radioactive elements can be given to patients. Cancer cells take up more of the glucose than normal cells do and give off radiation. The radiation can be detected with special machines like the one in the 
This machine scans a patient’s body and 	  detects radiation. 
Summary 	  • A low level of radiation occurs naturally in the environment. This background radiation is generally assumed to be safe for living things. • Long-term or high-dose exposure to radiation can harm living things and damage nonliving materials such as metals. • One reason radiation is dangerous is that it generally can’t be detected with the senses. It can be detected only with devices such as Geiger counters. • Radiation has several important uses, including diagnosing and treating cancer.

This diagram could almost illustrate a pinball game. It actually illustrates the process of radioactive decay. This is a process that occurs all around you. It may even occur inside your body. Q: Based on the diagram, what happens during radioactive decay? A: The nucleus of a radioactive atom gives off radiation in the form of energy and a particle of matter. 
Introducing  Radioactive  Decay 	  Radioactive decay is the process in which the nuclei of radioactive atoms emit charged particles and energy, which are called by the general term radiation. Radioactive atoms have unstable nuclei, and when the nuclei emit radiation, they become more stable. Radioactive decay is a nuclear—rather than chemical—reaction because it involves only the nuclei of atoms. In a nuclear reaction, one element may change into another. For a fun introduction to radioactive decay, watch the short video at this URL: URL 
Types of  Radioactive  Decay 	  There are several types of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay. In all three types, nuclei emit radiation, but the nature of the radiation differs. The Table 3.13 shows the radiation emitted in each type of decay. You can watch a video about the three types at this URL: URL . 
Radiation  Emitted 	  alpha particle (2 protons and 2 neutrons) + energy beta particle (1 electron or 1 positron) + energy energy (gamma ray) Both alpha and beta decay change the number of protons in an atom’s nucleus, thereby changing the atom to a different element. In alpha decay, the nucleus loses two protons. In beta decay, the nucleus either loses a proton or gains a proton. In gamma decay, no change in proton number occurs, so the atom does not become a different element. Q: If the radioactive element polonium (Po) undergoes alpha decay, what element does it become? A: From the periodic table, the atomic number of polonium is 84, so it has 84 protons. If it loses two protons through alpha decay, it will have 82 protons. Atoms with 82 protons are the element lead (Pb). 
Dangers of  Radioactive  Decay 	  The charged particles and energy emitted during radioactive decay can harm living things, but the three types of radioactive decay aren’t equally dangerous. That’s because they differ in how far they can travel and what they can penetrate. You can see this in the Figure 3.110 and in the animation at the following URL: URL ontents/cna_radiation/gamma_rays/ Alpha particles can travel only a few centimeters through air. They can burn the skin but not penetrate it. Beta particles can travel up to a meter through air. They can penetrate and damage skin. Gamma rays can travel thousands of meters through air. They can penetrate and damage cells deep inside the body. 
Summary 	  • Radioactive decay is the process in which unstable nuclei of radioactive atoms become stable by emitting charged particles and energy. • There are three types of radioactive decay: alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay. Alpha and beta decay change one element into another. Gamma decay does not. • Radioactive decay can damage living things. Alpha decay is the least damaging, and gamma decay is the most damaging.

You probably associate the term decay with images like the one above. But when it comes to atoms, decay has a different meaning. Decay in chemistry refers to changes in the nuclei of certain atoms. 
Why  Some  Nuclei  Decay 	  Radioactive elements and isotopes have unstable nuclei. To become more stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive decay. In radioactive decay, the nuclei give off, or emit, radiation in the form of energy and often particles as well. There are several types of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay. Energy is emitted in all three types of decay, but only alpha and beta decay also emit particles. What Is Alpha Decay? Alpha decay occurs when a nucleus is unstable because it has too many protons. The Figure 3.111 shows what happens during alpha decay. The nucleus emits an alpha particle and energy. An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, which is actually a helium nucleus. Losing the protons and neutrons makes the nucleus more stable. 
Equations for  Alpha  Decay 	  Radioactive nuclei and particles are represented by nuclear symbols that indicate their numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, an alpha particle (helium nucleus) is represented by the symbol 4 chemical symbol for helium, the subscript 2 is the number of protons, and the superscript 4 is the mass number (2 protons + 2 neutrons). Nuclear symbols are used to write nuclear equations for radioactive decay. Let’s consider an example. Uranium-238 undergoes alpha decay to become thorium-234. (The numbers following the chemical names refer to the number of protons plus neutrons.) In this reaction, uranium-238 loses two protons and two neutrons to become the element thorium-234. The reaction can be represented by this nuclear equation: If you count the number of protons (subscripts) as well as the number of protons plus neutrons (superscripts), you’ll see that the total numbers are the same on both sides of the arrow. This means that the equation is balanced. The thorium-234 produced in this reaction is also unstable, so it will undergo radioactive decay as well. The alpha particle (4 most of Earth’s helium formed. Q: Fill in the missing subscript and superscript to balance the following nuclear equation for alpha decay of Polonium-210. ?Pb + 4 A: The subscript of Pb is 82, and the superscript is 206. This means that the new element produced in the reaction has 82 protons. You can find the element with this number of protons in the periodic table. It is the element lead (Pb). The new element also has 124 neutrons (206 –82 protons = 124 neutrons). How Dangerous Is Alpha Decay? All types of radioactive decay pose risks to living things, but alpha decay is the least dangerous. That’s because alpha particles are relatively heavy, so they can travel only a few centimeters through the air. They also are not very penetrating. For example, they can’t pass through a sheet of paper or thin layer of clothing. They may burn the skin, but they can’t penetrate to the tissues underneath the skin. However, if alpha particles are emitted inside the body, they can do more damage. One way this can happen is by inhaling cigarette smoke. People who smoke actually inhale the radioactive element polonium-210. It undergoes alpha decay in the lungs. Over time, exposure to alpha particles may cause lung cancer. 
Summary 	  • Alpha decay is one of three types of nuclear decay in which unstable nuclei emit energy with or without a particle of matter. • In alpha decay, energy and an alpha particle are emitted by a nucleus that is unstable because it has too many protons. An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, so it is actually a helium nucleus. • Alpha decay is represented by a nuclear equation. The equation is balanced if the total numbers of protons and neutrons are the same on both sides of the arrow. • All radioactive decay is dangerous to living things, but alpha decay is the least dangerous.

When the nucleus of an atom decays, it becomes more stable. 
Which  Nuclei  Decay 	  Atoms with unstable nuclei are radioactive. To become more stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive decay. 
In 	  radioactive decay, the nuclei emit energy and usually particles of matter as well. There are several types of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay. Energy is emitted in all three types of decay, but only alpha and beta decay also emit particles. What Is Beta Decay? Beta decay occurs when an unstable nucleus emits a beta particle and energy. A beta particle is either an electron or a positron. An electron is a negatively charged particle, and a positron is a positively charged electron (or antielectron). When the beta particle is an electron, the decay is called beta-minus decay. When the beta particle is a positron, the decay is called beta-plus decay. Beta-minus decay occurs when a nucleus has too many neutrons relative to protons, and beta-plus decay occurs when a nucleus has too few neutrons relative to protons. Q: Nuclei contain only protons and neutrons, so how can a nucleus emit an electron in beta-minus decay or a positron in beta-plus decay? A: Beta decay begins with a proton or neutron. You can see how in the Figure 3.112. Q: How does beta decay change an atom to a different element? A: In beta-minus decay an atom gains a proton, and it beta-plus decay it loses a proton. In each case, the atom becomes a different element because it has a different number of protons. 
Equations for  Beta  Decay 	  Radioactive nuclei and particles are represented by nuclear symbols.. For example, a beta-minus particle (electron) is represented by the symbol 0−1e. The subscript -1 represents the particle’s charge, and the superscript 0 shows that the particle has virtually no mass (no protons or neutrons). Another example is the radioactive nucleus of thorium-234. 
It is represented by the symbol 234 	  Nuclear symbols are used to write nuclear equations for radioactive decay. Let’s consider the example of the betaminus decay of thorium-234 to protactinium-234. This reaction is represented by the equation: The equation shows that thorium-234 becomes protactinium-234 and loses a beta particle and energy. The protactiniumA nuclear equation is balanced if the total numbers of protons and neutrons are the same on both sides of the arrow. If you compare the subscripts and superscripts on both sides of the equation above, you’ll see that they are the same. Q: What happens to the electron produced in the reaction above? A: Along with another electron, it can combine with an alpha particle to form a helium atom. An alpha particle, which is emitted during alpha decay, consists of two protons and two neutrons. Q: Try to balance the following nuclear equation for beta-minus decay by filling in the missing subscript and superscript. ?Xe + 0−1e + energy A: The subscript of Xe is 54, and the superscript is 131. 
Dangers of  Beta  Decay 	  Beta particles can travel about a meter through air. They can pass through a sheet of paper or a layer of cloth but not through a sheet of aluminum or a few centimeters of wood. They can also penetrate the skin and damage underlying tissues. They are even more harmful if they are ingested or inhaled. 
Summary 	  • Beta decay occurs when a nucleus is unstable because it has too many or too few neutrons relative to protons. The nucleus emits a beta particle and energy. A beta particle is either an electron (beta-minus decay) or a positron (beta-plus decay). • In beta-minus decay, a neutron breaks down to a proton and an electron, and the electron is emitted from the nucleus. In beta-plus decay, a proton breaks down to a neutron and a positron, and the positron is emitted from the nucleus. • Balanced nuclear equations show how the numbers of protons and neutrons change in beta decay. • Beta radiation is harmful to living things.

How do you know? • Describe gamma rays. • State how and why gamma decay occurs. • Explain why gamma rays are the most harmful type of radiation. This stunning image is an artist’s rendition of a gamma ray burst. A gamma ray burst is a sudden, intense flash of gamma rays given off by an extremely energetic explosion. The bursts have been observed in distant galaxies. But gamma rays also occur on Earth. What Are Gamma Rays? Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are waves of electric and magnetic energy that travel through space at the speed of light. The energy travels in tiny “packets” of energy, called photons. Photons of gamma energy are called gamma particles. Other electromagnetic waves include microwaves, light rays, and X rays. Gamma rays have the greatest amount of energy of all electromagnetic waves. You can learn more about gamma radiation at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Gamma  Rays and  Radioactive  Decay 	  Gamma rays are produced when radioactive elements decay. Radioactive elements are elements with unstable nuclei. To become more stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive decay. In this process, the nuclei give off energy and may also emit charged particles of matter. Types of radioactive decay include alpha, beta, and gamma decay. In alpha and beta decay, both particles and energy are emitted. In gamma decay, only energy, in the form of gamma rays, is emitted. Alpha and beta decay occur when a nucleus has too many protons or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. When the nucleus emits a particle, it gains or loses one or two protons, so the atom becomes a different element. Gamma decay, in contrast, occurs when a nucleus is in an excited state and has too much energy to be stable. This often happens after alpha or beta decay has occurred. Because only energy is emitted during gamma decay, the number of protons remains the same. Therefore, an atom does not become a different element during this type of decay. Q: The Figure 3.113 shows how helium-3 (He-3) decays by emitting a gamma particle. How can you tell that the atom is still the same element after gamma decay occurs? A: The nucleus of the atom has two protons (red) before the reaction occurs. After the nucleus emits the gamma particle, it still has two protons, so the atom is still the same element. 
Dangers of  Gamma  Radiation 	  Gamma rays are the most dangerous type of radiation. They can travel farther and penetrate materials more deeply than can the charged particles emitted during alpha and beta decay. Gamma rays can be stopped only by several centimeters of lead or several meters of concrete. It’s no surprise that they can penetrate and damage cells deep inside the body. You can learn more about the effects of gamma radiation on people at this URL: URL quest.org/3471/radiation_effects_body.html . 
Summary 	  • Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves that carry photons of energy called gamma particles. They are the most energetic of all electromagnetic waves. • Gamma rays are produced during gamma decay of an excited nucleus. During gamma decay, the nucleus emits a “packet” of energy called a gamma particle. • Gamma rays are more dangerous than the particles of matter emitted during alpha or beta decay. article. • Define the half-life of a radioisotope. • Explain variation in half-lives. Assume that you cut a sheet of paper down the center to get two halves. Then you cut each half down the center to get four pieces. If you keep cutting the pieces of paper in half, you would soon a reach a point where the pieces are too small to cut again. A radioactive isotope is a little like that sheet of paper. What Is a Radioactive Isotope? A radioactive isotope, or radioisotope, has atoms with unstable nuclei. The unstable nuclei naturally decay, or break down, by losing energy and particles of matter to become more stable. If they gain or lose protons as they decay, they become different elements. Over time, as the nuclei continue to decay, less and less of the original radioisotope remains. 
Rate of  Radioactive  Decay 	  A radioisotope decays and changes to a different element at a constant rate. The rate is measured in a unit called the half-life. This is the length of time it takes for half of a given amount of the radioisotope to decay. This rate is always the same for a given radioisotope, regardless of temperature, pressure, or other conditions outside the nuclei of its atoms. Q: How is repeatedly cutting paper in half like the decay of a radioisotope? A: As a radioisotope decays, the amount of the radioisotope decreases by half during each half-life, just as a piece of paper decreases in size by half each time you cut it down the center. You can see a video of this half-life analogy at the following URL. URL 
Half- Life  Example 	  The concept of half-life is illustrated in the Figure 3.114 for the decay of phosphorus-32 to sulfur-32. The half-life of phosphorus-32 is 14 days. After 14 days, half of the original amount of phosphorus-32 has decayed, so only half remains. After another 14 days, half of the remaining amount (or a quarter of the original amount) is still left, and so on. Q: What fraction of the original amount of phosphorus-32 remains after three half-lives? A: After three half-lives, or 42 days, 1/8 (1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2) of the original amount of phosphorus-32 remains. 
Variation in  Half- Lives 	  Different radioisotopes may vary greatly in their rate of decay. That’s because they vary in how unstable their nuclei are. The more unstable the nuclei, the faster they break down. As you can see from the examples in the Table simulate radioactive decay of radioisotopes with different half-lives at the URL below. URL physics/2000/isotopes/radioactive_decay3.html 
Half-life 	  Q: If you had 1 gram of carbon-14, how many years would it take for radioactive decay to reduce it to 1/4 gram? 
Summary 	  • A radioisotope decays and changes to a different element at a certain constant rate called the half-life. This is the length of time it takes for half of a given amount of the radioisotope to decay. • Different radioisotopes may vary greatly in their rate of decay. The more unstable their nuclei are, the faster they decay.

The Grand Canyon, pictured above, was carved by the rushing waters of the Colorado River over millions of years. The exposed rocks at the bottom of the canyon are almost 2 billion years old. The youngest rocks near the top are about 230 million years old. Therefore, from top to bottom, the rocks provide a continuous record of more than 1.5 billion years of geological history in this region. Q: How have scientists been able to determine the ages of rocks in the Grand Canyon? A: The ages are based on the gradual decay, or break down, of radioactive isotopes. What Is Radioactive Dating? Radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes, can be used to estimate the ages of not only of rocks, but also of fossils and artifacts made long ago by human beings. Even the age of Earth has been estimated on the basis of radioisotopes. The general method is called radioactive dating. To understand how radioactive dating works, you need to understand radioisotopes and radioactive decay. 
Radioisotopes and  Radioactive  Decay 	  A radioisotope has atoms with unstable nuclei. Unstable nuclei naturally decay, or break down. They lose energy and particles and become more stable. As nuclei decay, they gain or lose protons, so the atoms become different elements. This is illustrated in the Figure 3.115. The original, unstable nucleus is called the parent nucleus. After it loses a particle (in this case a type of particle called an alpha particle), it forms a daughter nucleus, with a different number of protons. The nucleus of a given radioisotope decays at a constant rate that is unaffected by temperature, pressure, or other conditions outside the nucleus. This rate of decay is called the half-life. The half-life is the length of time it takes for half of the original amount of the radioisotope to decay to another element. Q: How can the half-life of a radioisotope be used to date a rock? A: After a rock forms, nuclei of a radioisotope inside the rock start to decay. As they decay, the amount of the original, or parent, isotope decreases, while the amount of its stable decay product, or daughter isotope, increases. By measuring the relative amounts of parent and daughter isotopes and knowing the rate of decay, scientists can determine how long the parent isotope has been decaying. This provides an estimate of the rock’s age. 
Different  Isotopes,  Different  Half- Lives 	  Different radioisotopes decay at different rates. You can see some examples in the Table 3.15. Radioisotopes with longer half-lives are used to date older rocks or other specimens, and those with shorter half-lives are used to date younger ones. For example, the oldest rocks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon were dated by measuring the amounts of potassium-40 in the rocks. Carbon-14 dating, in contrast, is used to date specimens that are much younger than the rocks in the Grand Canyon. You can read more carbon-14 dating below. 
Parent  Isotope 	  potassium-40 uranium-235 uranium-234 carbon-14 
Daughter  Isotope 	  argon-40 lead-207 thorium-230 nitrogen-14 
Focus on  Carbon-14  Dating 	  One of the most familiar types of radioactive dating is carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 forms naturally in Earth’s atmosphere when cosmic rays strike atoms of nitrogen-14. Living things take in and use carbon-14, just as they do carbon-12. The carbon-14 in living things gradually decays to nitrogen-14. However, as it decays, it is constantly replaced because living things keep taking in carbon-14. As a result, there is a constant ratio of carbon-14 to carbonAfter organisms die, the carbon-14 they already contain continues to decay, but it is no longer replaced (see the bottom part of the Figure 3.116). Therefore, the carbon-14 in a dead organism constantly declines at a fixed rate equal to the half-life of carbon-14. Half of the remaining carbon-14 decays every 5,700 years. If you measure how much carbon-14 is left in a fossil, you can determine how many half-lives (and how many years) have passed since the organism died. Carbon-14 dating is illustrated in the video at this URL: URL dkQwW6aLik . Q: Why can’t carbon-14 dating be used to date specimens older than about 60,000 years? A: Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5700 years. After about 60,000 years, too little carbon-14 is left in a specimen to be measured. 
Summary 	  • The age of a rock or other specimen can be estimated from the remaining amount of a radioisotope it contains and the radioisotope’s known rate of decay, or half-life. This method of dating specimens is called radioactive dating. • Radioisotopes with longer half-lives are used to date older specimens, and those with shorter half-lives are used to date younger ones. • Carbon-14 dating is used to date specimens younger than about 60,000 years old.

Steam rises from the cooling towers of this nuclear power plant. The steam is only harmless water vapor. Unlike a power plant that burns fossil fuel, a nuclear power plant doesn’t release pollution into the air. That’s because a nuclear power plant produces power by nuclear fission, a type of nuclear reaction. What Is Nuclear Fission? Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nucleus of a radioactive atom into two smaller nuclei. This type of reaction releases a great deal of energy from a very small amount of matter. Fission of a tiny pellet of radioactive uraniumQ: What causes the nucleus of uranium-235 atom to fission? A: Another particle collides with it. 
How  Nuclear  Fission  Occurs 	  The Figure 3.118 shows how nuclear fission of uranium-235 occurs. It begins when a uranium nucleus gains a neutron. This can happen naturally when a free neutron strikes it, or it can occur deliberately when a neutron is crashed into it in a nuclear power plant. In either case, the nucleus of uranium-235 becomes extremely unstable with the extra neutron. As a result, it splits into two smaller nuclei, krypton-92 and barium-141. The reaction also releases three neutrons and a great deal of energy. It can be represented by this nuclear equation: Note that the subscripts of the element symbols represent numbers of protons and the superscripts represent numbers of protons plus neutrons. To see an animated version of uranium-235 fission, go to this URL: URL /terc/content/visualizations/es0702/es0702page01.cfm?chapter_no=visualizationNuclear_Fission_of_Uranium-235 . 
Nuclear  Chain  Reaction 	  The neutrons released when uranium-235 fissions may crash into other uranium nuclei and cause them to fission as well. This can start a nuclear chain reaction. You can see how this happens in the Figure 3.119. In a chain reaction, one fission reaction leads to others, which lead to others, and so on. A nuclear chain reaction is similar to a pile of wood burning. If you start one piece of wood burning, enough heat is produced by the burning wood to start the rest of the pile burning without any further help from you. You can see another example of a chain reaction at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Using  Energy from  Nuclear  Fission 	  If a nuclear chain reaction is uncontrolled, it produces a lot of energy all at once. This is what happens in an atomic bomb. However, if a nuclear chain reaction is controlled, it produces energy much more slowly. This is what occurs in a nuclear power plant. The reaction is controlled by inserting rods of nonfissioning material into the fissioning material. You can see this in the Figure 3.120. The radiation from the controlled fission is used to heat water and turn it to steam. The steam is under pressure and causes a turbine to spin. The spinning turbine runs a generator, which produces electricity. 
Pros and  Cons of  Nuclear  Energy 	  In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. The main concern over the use of nuclear energy is the risk of radiation. Accidents at nuclear power plants can release harmful radiation that endangers people and other living things. Even without accidents, the used fuel that is left after nuclear fission reactions is still radioactive and very dangerous. It takes thousands of years for it to decay until it no longer releases harmful radiation. Therefore, used fuel must be stored securely to protect people and other living things.

Summary 	  • Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nucleus of an atom into two smaller nuclei. This type of reaction releases a great deal of energy from a very small amount of matter. It begins when the nucleus of a radioactive atom gains a neutron. • In uncontrolled nuclear fission, one fission reaction starts a chain reaction, in which neutrons produced in one reaction cause other reactions, which cause more reactions, and so on. • Energy released by nuclear fission is used to produce electrical energy in nuclear power plants. Production of nuclear energy doesn’t produce air pollution but it poses the risk of accidents that release harmful radiation.

Your answer should include the role of nuclear forces in the reaction. • Describe how and where nuclear fusion occurs. • Outline the pros and cons of using nuclear fusion to produce energy. What causes the sun to glow so brightly? The answer is nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is a type of nuclear reaction, and it releases a huge amount of energy. What Is Nuclear Fusion? In nuclear fusion, two or more small nuclei combine to form a single, larger nucleus. You can see an example in the Figure 3.121. In this example, nuclei of two hydrogen isotopes (tritium and deuterium) fuse to form a helium nucleus. A neutron and a tremendous amount of energy are also released. 
The  Power of  Stars 	  Nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium occurs naturally in the sun and other stars. It takes place only at extremely high temperatures. That’s because a great deal of energy is needed to overcome the force of repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. The sun’s energy comes from fusion in its core, shown in the Figure 3.122. In the core, temperatures reach millions of degrees Kelvin. The video at the following URL relates nuclear fusion to energy and high temperatures in the sun. URL 
Nuclear  Fusion 	  Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
The  Sun 	  Q: Why doesn’t nuclear fusion occur naturally on Earth? A: Nuclear fusion doesn’t occur naturally on Earth because it requires temperatures far higher than Earth temperatures. 
Using  Nuclear  Fusion 	  Scientists are searching for ways to create controlled nuclear fusion reactions on Earth. Their goal is develop nuclear fusion power plants, where the energy from fusion of hydrogen nuclei can be converted to electricity. You can see how this might work in the Figure 3.123. In the thermonuclear reactor, radiation from fusion is used to heat water and produce steam. The steam can then be used to turn a turbine and generate electricity. The use of nuclear fusion for energy has several pros. Unlike nuclear fission, which involves dangerous radioactive elements, nuclear fusion involves just hydrogen and helium. These elements are harmless. Hydrogen is also very plentiful. There is a huge amount of hydrogen in ocean water. The hydrogen in just a gallon of water could produce as much energy by nuclear fusion as burning 1,140 liters (300 gallons) of gasoline! The hydrogen in the oceans would generate enough energy to supply all the world’s people for a very long time. Unfortunately, using energy from nuclear fusion is far from a reality. Scientists are a long way from developing the necessary technology. One problem is raising temperatures high enough for fusion to take place. Another problem is that matter this hot exists only in the plasma state. There are no known materials that can contain plasma, although a magnet might be able to do it. That’s because plasma consists of ions and responds to magnetism. You can learn more about research on nuclear fusion at the URL below. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below.

It’s so simple that a baby can understand it! Well, not really, but Einstein’s famous equation is pretty simple: E = mc2. Do you know what it means and why it’s so famous? 
Einstein’s  Equation 	  Einstein’s equation is possibly the best-known equation of all time. There’s reason for that. The equation is incredibly important. It changed how scientists view energy and matter, which are two of the most basic concepts in all of science. The equation shows that energy and matter are two forms of the same thing. This new idea turned science upside down when Einstein introduced it in the early 1900s. Amazingly, the idea has withstood the test of time as more and more evidence has been gathered to support it. You can listen to a recording of Einstein explaining his famous equation at this URL: URL Q: What do the letters in Einstein’s equation stand for? A: E stands for energy, m stands for mass, and c stands for the speed of light. The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second, so c2 is a very big number. Therefore, the amount of energy in even a small mass of matter is tremendous. Suppose, for example, that you have 1 gram of matter. That’s about the mass of a paperclip. Multiplying this mass by c2 would yield enough energy to power 3,600 homes for a year! 
Mass and  Energy in  Nuclear  Reactions 	  Einstein’s equation helps scientists understand what happens in nuclear reactions and why they produce so much energy. When the nucleus of a radioisotope undergoes fission or fusion in a nuclear reaction, it loses a tiny amount of mass. What happens to the lost mass? It isn’t really lost at all. It is converted to energy. How much energy? E = mc2. The change in mass is tiny, but it results in a great deal of energy. Q: In a nuclear reaction, mass decreases and energy increases. What about the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy? Are mass and energy not conserved in nuclear reactions? Do we need to throw out these laws when it comes to nuclear reactions? A: No, the laws still apply. However, it’s more correct to say that the sum of mass and energy is always conserved in a nuclear reaction. Mass changes to energy, but the total amount of mass and energy combined remains the same. 
Summary 	  Einstein’s equation, E = mc2, shows that matter and energy are two forms of the same thing. It also shows that there is a tremendous amount of energy (E) in a small mass (m) of matter. • In nuclear reactions, matter changes to energy, but the total amount of mass and energy together does not change.

Introduction 	  It’s a bird! It’s plane! It’s a super skateboarder! This boy appears to be flying high in the sky, but he can’t stay airborne for long. Gravity will soon pull him back to the ground. How was he able to overcome the force of gravity and rise into the air? In this unit, you’ll learn about forces such as gravity and motions such as skateboarding, including how skateboarders can seem to defy gravity. Along the way, you can also pick up some cool skateboarding tips! • Define motion. • Explain how frame of reference is related to motion. The wings of this hummingbird are moving so fast that they’re just a blur of motion. You can probably think of many other examples of things in motion. If you can’t, just look around you. It’s likely that you’ll see something moving, and if nothing else, your eyes will be moving. So you know from experience what motion is. No doubt it seems like a fairly simple concept. However, when you read this article, you’ll find out that it’s not quite as simple as it seems. 
Defining  Motion 	  In science, motion is defined as a change in position. An object’s position is its location. Besides the wings of the hummingbird in the opening image, you can see other examples of motion in the Figure 4.1. In each case, the position of something is changing. Q: In each picture in the Figure 4.1, what is moving and how is its position changing? A: The train and all its passengers are speeding straight down a track to the next station. The man and his bike are racing along a curving highway. The geese are flying over their wetland environment. The meteor is shooting through the atmosphere toward Earth, burning up as it goes. 
Frame of  Reference 	  There’s more to motion than objects simply changing position. You’ll see why when you consider the following example. Assume that the school bus pictured in the Figure 4.2 passes by you as you stand on the sidewalk. It’s obvious to you that the bus is moving, but what about to the children inside the bus? The bus isn’t moving relative to them, and if they look at the other children sitting on the bus, they won’t appear to be moving either. If the ride is really smooth, the children may only be able to tell that the bus is moving by looking out the window and seeing you and the trees whizzing by. This example shows that how we perceive motion depends on our frame of reference. Frame of reference refers to something that is not moving with respect to an observer that can be used to detect motion. For the children on the bus, if they use other children riding the bus as their frame of reference, they do not appear to be moving. But if they use objects outside the bus as their frame of reference, they can tell they are moving. The video at the URL below illustrates other examples of how frame of reference is related to motion. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: What is your frame of reference if you are standing on the sidewalk and see the bus go by? How can you tell that the bus is moving? A: Your frame of reference might be the trees and other stationary objects across the street. As the bus goes by, it momentarily blocks your view of these objects, and this helps you detect the bus’ motion. 
Summary 	  • Motion is defined as a change of position. • How we perceive motion depends on our frame of reference. Frame of reference refers to something that is not moving with respect to an observer that can be used to detect motion. Do the frame of reference activity at the following URL. Watch the introduction and then do the nine trials. Repeat any trial you answer incorrectly until you get the correct answer. URL • Define distance. • Identify the SI unit for distance. • Demonstrate how to use the scale on a map to measure distance. Do you participate in track like the boys pictured here? If not, you may have attended a track meet. The boys in the picture are running a 100-meter sprint. Running events in track are named for their distance. What Is Distance? Distance is the length of the route between two points. The distance of a race, for example, is the length of the track between the starting and finishing lines. In a 100-meter sprint, that distance is 100 meters. 
I  Unit for  Distance 	  The SI unit for distance is the meter (m). Short distances may be measured in centimeters (cm), and long distances may be measured in kilometers (km). For example, you might measure the distance from the bottom to the top of a sheet of paper in centimeters and the distance from your house to your school in kilometers. 
Using  Maps to  Measure  Distance 	  Maps can often be used to measure distance. The map in the Figure 4.3 shows the route from Jordan’s house to his school. You can use the scale at the bottom of the map to measure the distance between these two points. Q: What is the distance from Jordan’s house to his school? A: The distance is 2 kilometers. For a video explaining how to find map distances, including curved distances, go to this URL: URL om/watch?v=t-ckG3ncM8E Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • Distance is the length of the route between two points. • The SI unit for distance is the meter. • The scale of a map can be used to find the distance between different locations. Find an online map tool, like the one at the following URL, that calculates the distance between any two points you select. Make a list of several pairs of locations between which you want to know the distance. Use the map scale to estimate the distance between locations in each pair. Then use the tool to find the actual distances. URL reemaptools.com/measure-distance.htm • State the importance of direction as a component of motion. • Use a compass rose to determine direction on a map. • Show how to represent direction and distance with vectors Imagine traveling several miles in one of the directions indicated by this sign. Now suppose that a friend travels the same distance in another direction indicated by the sign. You and your friend would end up in very different locations. Obviously, direction is an important component of motion. 
Introducing  Direction 	  Direction can be described in relative terms, such as up, down, in, out, left, right, forward, backward, or sideways. Direction can also be described with the cardinal directions: north, south, east, or west. On maps, cardinal directions are indicated with a compass rose. You can see one in the bottom left corner of the map in the Figure 4.4. You can use the compass rose to find directions on the map. For example, to go to the school from Jordan’s house, you would travel from east to west. If you wanted to go on to the post office, you would change direction at the school and then travel from south to north. 
Why  Direction  Is  Important 	  Look again at the map in the Figure 4.4. The distance from Jordan’s house to the post office is 3 km. But if Jordan told a friend how to reach the post office from his house, he couldn’t just say “go 3 kilometers.” The friend might end up at the park instead of the post office. Jordan would have to include direction as well as distance. He could say, “go west for 2 kilometers and then go north for 1 kilometer.” 
Motion and  Vectors 	  When both distance and direction are considered, motion can be represented by a vector. A vector is a measurement that has both size and direction. It may be represented by an arrow. If you are representing motion with an arrow, the length of the arrow represents distance, and the way the arrow points represents direction. The red arrows on the map in the Figure 4.4 are vectors for Jordan’s route from his house to the school and from the school to the post office. If you want to learn more about vectors, watch the video at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: How would you draw arrows to represent the distances and directions from the post office to the park on the map in the Figure 4.4? A: The vectors would look like this: 
Summary 	  • Direction is an important component of motion. • A compass rose shows cardinal directions on a map. • A vector is a measurement that has both size and direction and may be represented by an arrow. A vector can be used to represent both distance and direction of motion. At the following URL, read the introduction to vectors and try the animations. Then answer the questions below. URL school. Describe the direction(s) and distance(s) you travel over this route. a. moving 3 cm to the right b. moving 2 cm to the left • Define speed, and give the SI unit for speed. • Show how to calculate average speed from distance and time. • Describe instantaneous speed. • Show how to calculate distance or time from speed when the other variable is known. Did you ever play fast-pitch softball? If you did, then you probably have some idea of how fast the pitcher throws the ball. For a female athlete like the one in the opening image, the ball may reach a speed of 120 km/h (about 75 mi/h). For a male athlete, the ball may travel even faster. A fast-pitch pitcher uses a “windmill” motion to throw the ball. This is a different technique than other softball pitches, and it explains why the ball travels so fast. 
Introducing  Speed 	  How fast or slow something moves is its speed. Speed determines how far something travels in a given amount of time. The SI unit for speed is meters per second (m/s). Speed may be constant, but often it varies from moment to moment. 
Average  Speed 	  Even if speed varies during the course of a trip, it’s easy to calculate the average speed by using this formula: speed = distance time For example, assume you go on a car trip with your family. The total distance you travel is 120 miles, and it takes 3 hours to travel that far. The average speed for the trip is: speed = = 40 mi/h Q: Terri rode her bike very slowly to the top of a big hill. Then she coasted back down the hill at a much faster speed. The distance from the bottom to the top of the hill is 3 kilometers. It took Terri 1 What was her average speed for the entire trip? (Hint: The round-trip distance is 6 km.) A: Terri’s speed can be calculated as follows: speed = = 24 km/h 
Instantaneous  Speed 	  When you travel by car, you usually don’t move at a constant speed. Instead you go faster or slower depending on speed limits, traffic lights, the number of vehicles on the road, and other factors. For example, you might travel 65 miles per hour on a highway but only 20 miles per hour on a city street (see the pictures in the Figure 4.5.) You might come to a complete stop at traffic lights, slow down as you turn corners, and speed up to pass other cars. Therefore, your speed at any given instant, or your instantaneous speed, may be very different than your speed at other times. Instantaneous speed is much more difficult to calculate than average speed. If you want to learn more about calculating speed, watch the video at this URL: URL 
Cars race by in a blur of motion on an 	  open highway but crawl at a snail’s pace when they hit city traffic. 
Calculating  Distance or  Time from  Speed 	  If you know the average speed of a moving object, you can calculate the distance it will travel in a given period of time or the time it will take to travel a given distance. To calculate distance from speed and time, use this version of the average speed formula given above: distance = speed × time For example, if a car travels at an average speed of 60 km/h for 5 hours, then the distance it travels is: distance = 60 km/h × 5 h = 300 km To calculate time from speed and distance, use this version of the formula: time = distance speed Q: If you walk 6 km at an average speed of 3 km/h, how much time does it take? A: Use the formula for time as follows: time = = distance speed = 2 h 
Summary 	  • How fast or slow something moves is its speed. The SI unit for speed is meters per second (m/s). • Average speed is calculated with this formula: speed = distance time • Speed may be constant, but often it varies from moment to moment. Speed at any given instant is called instantaneous speed. It is much more difficult to calculate than average speed. • Distance or time can be calculated by solving the average speed formula for distance or time. Do problems 1–3 on the average speed worksheet at the following URL. URL • Describe how to draw a position-time graph. • Explain how a position-time graph shows the velocity of a moving object. • Show how to calculate the average velocity of a moving object from a position-time graph of its motion. Drawing line graphs can help you understand motion. In this article, you’ll learn how to draw position-time graphs and how they show velocity. Q: What’s missing from the graph being drawn in the picture above? A: The xand y-axes are missing. 
Graphing  Position and  Time 	  The motion of an object can be represented by a position-time graph like Graph 1 in the Figure 4.6. In this type of graph, the y-axis represents position relative to the starting point, and the x-axis represents time. A position-time graph shows how far an object has traveled from its starting position at any given time since it started moving. Q: In the Figure 4.6, what distance has the object traveled from the starting point by the time 5 seconds have elapsed? A: The object has traveled a distance of 50 meters. 
Slope  Equals  Velocity 	  In a position-time graph, the velocity of the moving object is represented by the slope, or steepness, of the graph line. If the graph line is horizontal, like the line after time = 5 seconds in Graph 2 in the Figure 4.7, then the slope is zero and so is the velocity. The position of the object is not changing. The steeper the line is, the greater the slope of the line is and the faster the object’s motion is changing. 
Calculating  Average  Velocity from a  Position- Time  Graph 	  It’s easy to calculate the average velocity of a moving object from a position-time graph. Average velocity equals the change in position (represented by ∆d) divided by the corresponding change in time (represented by ∆t): velocity = ∆d ∆t For example, in Graph 2 in the Figure 4.7, the average velocity between 0 seconds and 5 seconds is: velocity = = = ∆d ∆t = 5 m/s At the following URL, review the shape of a position-time graph and its relationship to velocity. Then use the widget at the bottom of the Web page to generate position-time graphs for an object with specified characteristics. URL 
Summary 	  • Motion can be represented by a position-time graph, which plots position relative to the starting point on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. • The slope of a position-time graph represents velocity. The steeper the slope is, the faster the motion is changing. • Average velocity can be calculated from a position-time graph as the change in position divided by the corresponding change in time. the bottom of the Web page. Be sure to check your answers and read the explanations for the correct solutions. URL Why or why not? • Distinguish between velocity and speed. • Represent velocity with vector arrows. • Describe objects that have different velocities. • Show how to calculate average velocity when direction is constant. Ramey and her mom were driving down this highway at 45 miles per hour, which is the speed limit on this road. As they approached this sign, Ramey’s mom put on the brakes and started to slow down so she could safely maneuver the upcoming curves in the road. This speed limit sign actually represents two components of motion: speed and direction. 
Speed and  Direction 	  Speed tells you only how fast or slow an object is moving. It doesn’t tell you the direction the object is moving. The measure of both speed and direction is called velocity. Velocity is a vector. A vector is measurement that includes both size and direction. Vectors are often represented by arrows. When using an arrow to represent velocity, the length of the arrow stands for speed, and the way the arrow points indicates the direction. If you’re still not sure of the difference between speed and velocity, watch the cartoon at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Using  Vector  Arrows to  Represent  Velocity 	  The arrows in the Figure 4.8 represent the velocity of three different objects. Arrows A and B are the same length but point in different directions. They represent objects moving at the same speed but in different directions. Arrow C is shorter than arrow A or B but points in the same direction as arrow A. It represents an object moving at a slower speed than A or B but in the same direction as A. 
Differences in  Velocity 	  Objects have the same velocity only if they are moving at the same speed and in the same direction. Objects moving at different speeds, in different directions, or both have different velocities. Look again at arrows A and B from the A and C represent objects that have different velocities only because they are moving at different speeds. Objects represented by B and C have different velocities because they are moving in different directions and at different speeds. Q: Jerod is riding his bike at a constant speed. As he rides down his street he is moving from east to west. At the end of the block, he turns right and starts moving from south to north, but he’s still traveling at the same speed. Has his velocity changed? A: Although Jerod’s speed hasn’t changed, his velocity has changed because he is moving in a different direction. Q: How could you use vector arrows to represent Jerod’s velocity and how it changes? A: The arrows might look like this: 
Calculating  Average  Velocity 	  You can calculate the average velocity of a moving object that is not changing direction by dividing the distance the object travels by the time it takes to travel that distance. You would use this formula: velocity = distance time This is the same formula that is used for calculating average speed. It represents velocity only if the answer also includes the direction that the object is traveling. Let’s work through a sample problem. Toni’s dog is racing down the sidewalk toward the east. The dog travels 36 meters in 18 seconds before it stops running. The velocity of the dog is: velocity = = distance time = 2 m/s east Note that the answer is given in the SI unit for velocity, which is m/s, and it includes the direction that the dog is traveling. Q: What would the dog’s velocity be if it ran the same distance in the opposite direction but covered the distance in A: In this case, the velocity would be: velocity = = distance time = 1.5 m/s west 
Summary 	  • Velocity is a measure of both speed and direction of motion. Velocity is a vector, which is a measurement that includes both size and direction. • Velocity can be represented by an arrow, with the length of the arrow representing speed and the way the arrow points representing direction. • Objects have the same velocity only if they are moving at the same speed and in the same direction. Objects moving at different speeds, in different directions, or both have different velocities. • The average velocity of an object moving in a constant direction is calculated with the formula: velocity = distance time . The SI unit for velocity is m/s, plus the direction the object is traveling. At the following URL, review how to calculate speed and velocity, and work through the sample problems. Then solve the 10 practice problems. URL eIntegation-827.htm mi/h. the car? • Define acceleration. • Give examples of acceleration. • Describe how it feels to accelerate. Imagine the thrill of riding on a roller coaster like this one! The coaster slowly crawls to the top of the track and then flies down the other side. It also zooms around twists and turns at breakneck speeds. These changes in speed and direction are what make a roller coaster ride so exciting. Changes in speed or direction are called acceleration. 
Defining  Acceleration 	  Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well. Q: Can you think of an example of acceleration that doesn’t involve a change in speed? A: Driving at a constant speed around a bend in a road is one example. Use your imagination to think of others. 
Examples of  Acceleration 	  You can see several examples of acceleration in the pictures from the Figure 4.9. In each example, velocity is changing but in different ways. For example, direction may be changing but not speed, or vice versa. Figure out what is moving and how it’s moving in each of the photos. Q: Describe how velocity is changing in each of the motions you identified from the Figure 4.9. A: You should describe how both direction and speed are changing. For example, the boy on the carousel is moving up and down and around in a circle, so his direction is constantly changing, but his speed changes only at the beginning and end of the ride. The skydiver is falling straight down toward the ground so her direction isn’t changing, but her speed keeps increasing as she falls until she opens her parachute. For a better understanding of the changing velocity of a skydiver, watch the animation at this URL: URL 
Feeling  Acceleration 	  If you are accelerating, you may be able to feel the change in velocity. This is true whether the change is in speed, direction, or both. You often feel acceleration when you ride in a car. As the car speeds up, you feel as though you are being pressed against the seat. When the car slows down, you feel like you are being pushed forward, especially if the change in speed is sudden. If the car changes direction and turns right, you feel as though you are being pushed to the left. With a left turn, you feel a push to the right. The next time you ride in a car, notice how it feels as the car accelerates in each of these ways. You can also simulate acceleration at this URL: URL lation/moving-man 
Summary 	  • Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which the change is occurring. It may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector. • Examples of acceleration include a person riding a carousel and a skydiver in free fall. • When you experience acceleration, you may be able to feel the changes in speed and/or direction. Watch the acceleration animation at the following URL. Then answer the questions on the Web page and check to see if your answers are correct. URL parachute first opens? 
Time 	  • Explain how to calculate average acceleration when direction is constant. • Identify the SI unit for acceleration. • Solve simple acceleration problems. This cyclist is in constant motion as he competes in an off-road mountain bike race. Both his speed and his direction keep changing. Velocity is a measure that represents both speed and direction. Changes in velocity are measured by acceleration. Acceleration reflects how quickly velocity is changing. It may involve a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. You can see off-road bikers accelerating in these ways in the exciting mountain bike race at this 
Calculating  Average  Acceleration in  One  Direction 	  Calculating acceleration is complicated if both speed and direction are changing or if you want to know acceleration at any given instant in time. However, it’s relatively easy to calculate average acceleration over a period of time when only speed is changing. Then acceleration is the change in velocity (represented by ∆v) divided by the change in time (represented by ∆t): acceleration = ∆v ∆t 
Accelerating on a  Bike 	  Look at the cyclist in the Figure 4.10. With the help of gravity, he speeds up as he goes downhill on a straight part of the trail. His velocity changes from 1 meter per second at the top of the hill to 6 meters per second by the time he reaches the bottom. If it takes him 5 seconds to reach the bottom, what is his average acceleration as he races down the hill? ∆v ∆t acceleration = = = = = 1 m/s2 In words, this means that for each second the cyclist travels downhill, his velocity (in this case, his speed) increases by 1 meter per second on average. Note that the answer to this problem is expressed in m/s2, which is the SI unit for acceleration. Q: The cyclist slows down at the end of the race. His velocity changes from 6 m/s to 2 m/s during a period of 4 seconds without any change in direction. What was his average acceleration during these 4 seconds? A: Use the equation given above for acceleration: ∆v ∆t acceleration = = = = = 1 m/s2 
Summary 	  • To calculate average acceleration when direction is not changing, divide the change in velocity by the change in time using the formula: acceleration = ∆v ∆t • The SI unit for acceleration is m/s2. Practice calculating acceleration by doing the worksheet at this URL: URL acceleration during those last 5 seconds? • Show how to draw a velocity-time graph. • Explain what the slope of a velocity-time graph represents. The sprinter in this image is just taking off from the starting blocks to run a short race down a straight track. She starts in a burst of speed and will pick up even more speed during the first few seconds of the race. She’ll keep running at top speed until she crosses the finish line. Only then will she slow down. Velocity is a measure of both speed and direction of motion. A change in velocity is called acceleration. In the case of the sprinter, she accelerates as she runs down the track because her speed is changing even though her direction stays the same. If you need a Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Plotting  Velocity  Against  Time 	  The changing velocity of the sprinter—or of any other moving person or object—can be represented by a velocitytime graph like the one in the Figure 4.11 for the sprinter. A velocity-time graph shows how velocity changes over time. The sprinter’s velocity increases for the first 4 seconds of the race, it remains constant for the next 3 seconds, and it decreases during the last 3 seconds after she crosses the finish line. 
Acceleration and  Slope 	  In a velocity-time graph, acceleration is represented by the slope, or steepness, of the graph line. If the line slopes upward, like the line between 0 and 4 seconds in the Figure 4.11, velocity is increasing, so acceleration is positive. If the line is horizontal, as it is between 4 and 7 seconds, velocity is constant and acceleration is zero. If the line slopes downward, like the line between 7 and 10 seconds, velocity is decreasing and acceleration is negative. Negative acceleration is called deceleration. Q: Assume that another sprinter is running the same race. The other runner reaches a top velocity of 9 m/s by different from the Figure 4.11? A: The graph line for this runner during seconds 0–4 would be steeper (have a greater slope). This would show that acceleration is greater during this time period for the other sprinter. 
Summary 	  • A velocity-time graph shows changes in velocity of a moving object over time. • The slope of a velocity-time graph represents acceleration of the moving object. At the following URL, read about the shape of velocity-time graphs and what it means.

E 4.1:  Data  Table for  Review 3 	  Time (s) • Define force. • Relate force to motion. • Identify the SI unit for force. • Explain how to represent forces with vector arrows. Carson has been riding a scooter for almost as long as he can remember. As you can see, he’s really good at it. He can even do tricks in the air. It takes a lot of practice to be able to control a scooter like this. Carson automatically applies just the right forces to control his scooter. 
Defining  Force 	  Force is defined as a push or pull acting on an object. There are several fundamental forces in the universe, including the force of gravity, electromagnetic force, and weak and strong nuclear forces. When it comes to the motion of everyday objects, however, the forces of interest include mainly gravity, friction, and applied force. Applied force is force that a person or thing applies to an object. Q: What forces act on Carson’s scooter? A: Gravity, friction, and applied forces all act on Carson’s scooter. Gravity keeps pulling both Carson and the scooter toward the ground. Friction between the wheels of the scooter and the ground prevent the scooter from sliding but also slow it down. In addition, Carson applies forces to his scooter to control its speed and direction. 
Force and  Motion 	  Forces cause all motions. Everytime the motion of an object changes, it’s because a force has been applied to it. Force can cause a stationary object to start moving or a moving object to change its speed or direction or both. A change in the speed or direction of an object is called acceleration. Look at Carson’s brother Colton in the Figure starts the scooter moving in the opposite direction. The harder he pushes against the ground, the faster the scooter will go. How much an object accelerates when a force is applied to it depends not only on the strength of the force but also on the object’s mass. For example, a heavier scooter would be harder to accelerate. Colton would have to push with more force to start it moving and move it faster. You can explore the how force, mass, and acceleration are related by doing the activity at this URL: URL Q: What units do you think are used to measure force? A: The SI unit for force is the Newton (N). A Newton is the force needed to cause a mass of 1 kilogram to accelerate at 1 m/s2, so a Newton equals 1 kg • m/s2. The Newton was named for the scientist Sir Isaac Newton, who is famous for his laws of motion and gravity. 
Force as a  Vector 	  Force is a vector, or a measure that has both size and direction. For example, Colton pushes on the ground in the opposite direction that the scooter moves, so that’s the direction of the force he is applies. He can give the scooter a strong push or a weak push. That’s the size of the force. Like other vectors, a force can be represented with an arrow. You can see some examples in the Figure 4.13. The length of each arrow represents the strength of the force, and the way the arrow points represents the direction of the force. Q: How could you use arrows to represent the forces that start Colton’s scooter moving? A: Colton pushes against the ground behind him (to the right in the Figure 4.12). The ground pushes back with equal force to the left, causing the scooter to move in that direction. Force arrows A and B in example 2 in the 
Summary 	  • Force is defined as a push or pull acting on an object. Forces include gravity, friction, and applied force. • Force causes changes in the speed or direction of motion. These changes are called acceleration. • The SI unit for force is the Newton (N). • Force is a vector because it has both size and direction. Like other vectors, it can be represented by an arrow.

To see an animation of this force and motion, go to the URL below. URL • Define net force. • Calculate the net force acting on an object and determine the direction it will move. It’s boys against girls in this friendly tug of war. The two teams are pulling the rope in opposite directions. Which team do you think will win? It depends on which side pulls on the rope with the greatest force. As this example shows, more than one force may act on an object at the same time. Would it surprise you to learn that at least two different forces are acting on you as you read this article? Can you guess what they are? 
Pulling  Down and  Pushing  Up 	  One force acting on you—and all the other objects on Earth—is gravity. Look at the physics book in the Figure table pushes upward on the book with the same amount of force. The combined force, or net force, acting on the book is 0 Newtons. That’s because upward and downward forces are balanced, so they cancel out. You can learn more about net force at this URL: URL 
Forces  Acting in  Opposite  Directions 	  In general, whenever forces act on an object in opposite directions—like the book on the table—the net force is equal to the difference between the two forces. In other words, one force is subtracted from the other to calculate the net force. If the opposing forces are equal, or balanced, the net force is zero, as it is for the book. That’s why the book doesn’t fall to the ground but instead remains resting on the table. However, if the opposing forces are unbalanced, the net force is greater than zero, although it will be less than either of the individual forces. In this case, the object will move in the same direction as the net force. Look at the dogs playing tug-of-war in the Figure 4.15. The dogs are pulling the rope in opposite directions, but one dog is pulling with more force than the other. The net force acting on the rope is 2 Newtons to the right, so the rope will move to the right. Q: The boys in the Figure 4.16 are about to kick the soccer ball in opposite directions. What will be the net force on the ball? In which direction will the ball move? A: The net force on the ball will be 50 N to the left (125 N –75 N = 50 N), so the ball will move to the left. 
Forces  Acting in the  Same  Direction 	  If two forces act on an object in the same direction, the net force is equal to the sum of the two forces. This always results in a stronger force than either of the individual forces alone. In the Figure 4.17, after the man on the left picks up the couch, he will push the couch to the right with a force of 25 Newtons, and the man on the right will pull the couch to the right with a force of 20 Newtons. The net force on the couch is 45 Newtons to the right, so that’s the way the couch will move. 
Summary 	  • The net force acting on an object is the combination of all of the individual forces acting on it. • If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the net force is the difference between the two forces. In this case, the net force is always greater than or equal to zero but less than either of the individual forces. • If two forces act on an object in the same direction, the net force is the sum of the two forces. In this case, the net force is always greater than either of the individual forces. Practice calculating net force and determining the direction of motion by completing the worksheet at the following URL • Define friction. • Explain why friction occurs. • Identify factors that affect friction. • Explain why friction produces heat. Did you ever rub your hands together to warm them up, like the young man in the opening image? Why does this make your hands warmer? The answer is friction. What Is Friction? Friction is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. Friction can work for or against us. For example, putting sand on an icy sidewalk increases friction so you are less likely to slip. On the other hand, too much friction between moving parts in a car engine can cause the parts to wear out. Other examples of friction are illustrated in the two Figures 4.19 and 4.20. You can see an animation showing how friction opposes motion at this URL For a musical introduction to friction from Bill Nye the Science Guy, go to this URL: URL 
These photos show two ways that friction 	  is useful 
These photos show two ways that friction 	  can cause problems 
Why  Friction  Occurs 	  Friction occurs because no surface is perfectly smooth. Even surfaces that look smooth to the unaided eye make look rough or bumpy when viewed under a microscope. Look at the metal surfaces in the Figure 4.21. The aluminum foil is so smooth that it’s shiny. However, when highly magnified, the surface of metal appears to be very bumpy. All those mountains and valleys catch and grab the mountains and valleys of any other surface that contacts the metal. This creates friction. 
Factors  That  Affect  Friction 	  Rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces. That’s why we put sand on icy sidewalks and roads. You can’t slide as far across ice with shoes as you can on the blades of skates (see Figure 4.22). The rougher surface of the soles of the shoes causes more friction and slows you down. Q: Heavier objects also have more friction. Can you explain why? A: Heavier objects press together with greater force, and this causes greater friction between them. Did you ever try to furniture across the floor? It’s harder to overcome friction between a heavier piece of furniture and the floor than between lighter pieces and the floor. 
Friction  Produces  Heat 	  You know that friction produces heat. That’s why rubbing your hands together makes them warmer. But do you know why? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, so they have more energy. This gives them a higher temperature, and they feel warmer. Heat from friction can be useful. It not only warms your hands. It also lets you light a match as shown in the Figure 4.23. On the other hand, heat from friction between moving parts inside a car engine can be a big problem. It can cause the car to overheat. Q: How is friction reduced between the moving parts inside a car engine? A: To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. The oil coats the surfaces of the moving parts and makes them slippery. They slide over each other more easily, so there is less friction. 
Summary 	  • Friction is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. • Friction occurs because no surface is perfectly smooth. • Rougher surfaces have more friction between them. Heavier objects also have more friction because they press together with greater force. • Friction produces heat because it causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster and have more energy. Experiment with the effects of friction on the motion of a toy car in the activity at the following URL. Then take the quiz to see how well you understand friction. URL • Identify four types of friction. • Compare and contrast static, sliding, and rolling friction. • Define fluid and describe fluid friction. Climbing a vertical rock wall means pitting your strength and stamina against the force of gravity, which pulls you down toward the ground. Another force helps you to climb the vertical rock wall by keeping your hands and feet from slipping. That force is friction. 
Four  Types of  Friction 	  Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are in contact. There are four types of friction: static, sliding, rolling, and fluid friction. Static, sliding, and rolling friction occur between solid surfaces. Fluid friction occurs in liquids and gases. All four types of friction are described below. You can see a video demonstration of the different types at this URL: URL 
Static  Friction 	  Static friction acts on objects when they are resting on a surface. For example, if you are hiking in the woods, there is static friction between your shoes and the trail each time you put down your foot (see Figure 4.24). Without this static friction, your feet would slip out from under you, making it difficult to walk. In fact, that’s exactly what happens if you try to walk on ice. That’s because ice is very slippery and offers very little friction. Q: Can you think of other examples of static friction? A: One example is the friction that helps the people climb the rock wall in the opening picture above. Static friction keeps their hands and feet from slipping. 
Sliding  Friction 	  Sliding friction is friction that acts on objects when they are sliding over a surface. Sliding friction is weaker than static friction. That’s why it’s easier to slide a piece of furniture over the floor after you start it moving than it is to get it moving in the first place. Sliding friction can be useful. For example, you use sliding friction when you write with a pencil. The pencil “lead” slides easily over the paper, but there’s just enough friction between the pencil and paper to leave a mark. Q: How does sliding friction help you ride a bike? A: There is sliding friction between the brake pads and bike rims each time you use your bike’s brakes. This friction slows the rolling wheels so you can stop. 
Rolling  Friction 	  Rolling friction is friction that acts on objects when they are rolling over a surface. Rolling friction is much weaker than sliding friction or static friction. This explains why most forms of ground transportation use wheels, including bicycles, cars, 4-wheelers, roller skates, scooters, and skateboards. Ball bearings are another use of rolling friction. You can see what they look like in the Figure 4.25. They let parts of a wheel or other machine roll rather than slide over on another. 
Fluid  Friction 	  Fluid friction is friction that acts on objects that are moving through a fluid. A fluid is a substance that can flow and take the shape of its container. Fluids include liquids and gases. If you’ve ever tried to push your open hand through the water in a tub or pool, then you’ve experienced fluid friction. You can feel the resistance of the water against The ball bearings in this wheel reduce friction between the inner and outer cylinders when they turn. your hand. Look at the skydiver in the Figure 4.26. He’s falling toward Earth with a parachute. Resistance of the air against the parachute slows his descent. The faster or larger a moving object is, the greater is the fluid friction resisting its motion. That’s why there is greater air resistance against the parachute than the skydiver’s body. 
Summary 	  • Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are in contact. There are four types of friction: static, sliding, rolling, and fluid friction. • Static, sliding, and rolling friction occur between solid surfaces. Static friction is strongest, followed by sliding friction, and then rolling friction, which is weakest. • Fluid friction occurs in fluids, which are liquids or gases.

You may have heard a story about Isaac Newton coming up with the idea of gravity when an apple fell out of a tree and hit him in the head. The story isn’t true, but seeing how things like apples fall to Earth helped Newton form his ideas about gravity, the force of attraction between things that have mass. Of course, people had known about the effects of gravity for thousands of years before Newton came along. After all, they constantly experienced gravity in their daily lives. They observed over and over again that things always fall toward the ground. However, it wasn’t until Newton developed his law of gravity in the late 1600s that people knew gravity applies to everything in the universe that has mass. 
Newton’s  Law of  Universal  Gravitation 	  Newton was the first one to suggest that gravity is universal and affects all objects in the universe. That’s why Newton’s law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation. Universal gravitation means that the force that causes an apple to fall from a tree to the ground is the same force that causes the moon to keep moving around Earth. Universal gravitation also means that while Earth exerts a pull on you, you exert a pull on Earth. In fact, there is gravity between you and every mass around you—your desk, your book, your pen. Even tiny molecules of gas are attracted to one another by the force of gravity. You can learn more about Newton’s law of gravity and how he developed it in the video at this URL: URL Q: Newton’s law of universal gravitation had a huge impact on how people thought about the universe. Why do you think it was so important? A: Newton’s law was the first scientific law that applied to the entire universe. It explains the motion of objects not only on Earth but in outer space as well. 
Factors  That  Influence the  Strength of  Gravity 	  Newton’s law also states that the strength of gravity between any two objects depends on two factors: the masses of the objects and the distance between them. • Objects with greater mass have a stronger force of gravity between them. For example, because Earth is so massive, it attracts you and your desk more strongly that you and your desk attract each other. That’s why you and the desk remain in place on the floor rather than moving toward one another. • Objects that are closer together have a stronger force of gravity between them. For example, the moon is closer to Earth than it is to the more massive sun, so the force of gravity is greater between the moon and Earth than between the moon and the sun. That’s why the moon circles around Earth rather than the sun. You can see this in the Figure 4.28. 
Summary 	  • Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that the force of gravity affects everything with mass in the universe. • Newton’s law also states that the strength of gravity between any two objects depends on the masses of the objects and the distance between them.

Why is jumping on a trampoline so much fun? Its springy surface helps you jump higher than you ever could on the hard ground. But even on a trampoline, you can’t keep jumping higher and higher. Gravity always pulls you back down. You’ve probably known about gravity since you were in elementary school. It’s the force that pulls all objects on Earth down toward the ground. Is that all there is to gravity? Absolutely not! 
It  Started with  Newton 	  In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton introduced his law of gravity, which identifies gravity as a force of attraction between all objects with mass in the universe. The law also states that the strength of gravity between two objects depends on their mass and distance apart. Newton’s law of gravity was accepted for more than two centuries. It can predict the motion of most objects and was even used by NASA to land astronauts on the moon. It’s still used for most practical purposes. However, Newton’s law doesn’t explain why gravity occurs. It only describes how gravity seems to affect objects. There are also some cases in which Newton’s law doesn’t even describe what happens. Q: Newton expressed his ideas about gravity as a law. A law in science is a description of what always occurs in nature. For example, according to Newton’s law, objects on Earth always fall down, not up. What is needed to explain gravity? A: A theory is needed to explain gravity. In science, a theory is a broad explanation that is supported by a great deal of evidence. 
Einstein  Explained  It  All 	  In the early 1900s, Albert Einstein came up with a theory of gravity that actually explains gravity rather than simply describing its effects. Einstein showed mathematically that gravity is not really a force that of attraction between all objects with mass, as Newton thought. Instead, Einstein showed that gravity is a result of the warping, or curving, of space and time, which made up the same space-time “fabric.” These ideas about space-time and gravity became known as Einstein’s theory of general relativity. If you watch the video at the URL below, you can see how Einstein developed his theory. The video may also help you understand how Einstein’s theory differs from Newton’s law. URL 
Visualizing  Einstein’s  Ideas 	  Einstein derived his theory using mathematics. However, you can get a good grasp of it with the help of a simple visual analogy. Imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a trampoline. The surface of the trampoline would curve downward instead of being flat. Now imagine placing a lighter ball at the edge of the trampoline. What will happen? It will roll down toward the bowling ball. This apparent attraction to the bowling ball occurs because the trampoline curves downward, not because the two balls are actually attracted to one another by an invisible force called gravity. Einstein theorized that the sun and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a way that is similar to the effect of the bowling ball on the trampoline. The more massive a body is, the more it causes space-time to curve. This idea is represented by the Figure 4.29. According to Einstein, objects move toward one another because of the curves in space-time, not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction. Einstein’s theory is supported by evidence and widely accepted today, although Newton’s law is still used for many calculations. You can see an animation of the warping of space-time at the following URL. URL For a live video demonstration, go to this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Summary 	  • Newton’s law of gravity can predict the motion of most but not all objects. It also doesn’t explain gravity. It only describes its effects on the motion of objects. • Einstein showed mathematically that gravity is not really a force of attraction between all objects with mass, as Newton thought. Instead, gravity is a result of the warping of space-time. • Einstein’s ideas have been supported by evidence and are widely accepted today. 
This diagram shows how  Earth’s mass 	  bends the “fabric” of space and time around it, causing smaller objects such as satellites to move toward Earth. Watch the video about Einstein’s “masterpiece” at the following URL. Then decide whether the statements below about Einstein and his work are true or false. URL • Describe the acceleration of falling objects due to gravity. • Explain why falling objects with different masses accelerate at the same rate. It’s a good thing this mountain climber’s safety gear is working, because it’s a long way down to the ground! If he were to fall, he’d be moving really fast by the time he got there. The higher any object starts falling from above Earth’s surface, the faster it’s traveling by the time it reaches the ground. Do you know why? The reason is gravity. 
Speeding up  While  Falling  Down 	  Gravity is a force that pulls objects down toward the ground. When objects fall to the ground, gravity causes them to accelerate. Acceleration is a change in velocity, and velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion. Gravity causes an object to fall toward the ground at a faster and faster velocity the longer the object falls. In fact, its velocity increases by 9.8 m/s2, so by 1 second after an object starts falling, its velocity is 9.8 m/s. By 2 seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 19.6 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s), and so on. The acceleration of a falling object due to gravity is illustrated in the Figure 4.30. For a more detailed explanation of acceleration due to gravity, watch this video: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. You can compare the acceleration due to gravity on Earth, the moon, and Mars with the interactive animation called “Freefall” at this URL: URL Q: In this diagram, the boy drops the object at time t = 0 s. By t = 1 s, the object is falling at a velocity of 9.8 m/s. What is its velocity by t = 5 s? What will its velocity be at t = 6 s if it keeps falling? A: Its velocity at t = 5 s is 49.0 m/s, and at t = 6 s, it will be 58.8 m/s (49.0 m/s + 9.8 m/s). 
Mass and  Acceleration  Due to  Gravity 	  What if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the same distance above the ground? The bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball, so the pull of gravity on it is greater. Would it fall to the ground faster? No, the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time. The reason? The more massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass, so it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the soccer ball. This is true of all falling objects. They all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity, unless air resistance affects one object more than another. For example, a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling acorn because of the leaf’s greater surface area. You can simulate the effect of air resistance on acceleration due to gravity by doing the interactive animation at this URL: URL pport-files/freefall.swf Q: If a leaf and an acorn were to fall to the ground in the absence of air (that is, in a vacuum), how would this affect their acceleration due to gravity? A: They would both accelerate at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time. 
Summary 	  • When gravity pulls objects toward the ground, it always causes them to accelerate at a rate of 9.8 m/s2. • Regardless of differences in mass, all objects accelerate at the same rate due to gravity unless air resistance affects one more than another. Watch the video at the following URL. Based on the teens interviewed in the video, identify two common misconceptions about gravity, mass, and acceleration due to gravity. Then explain why each misconception is false. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Describe projectile motion and state when it occurs. • Give examples of projectile motion. The archer in the opening image is aiming his arrow a little bit above the bull’s eye of the target, rather than directly at it. Why doesn’t he aim at the bull’s eye instead? The answer is projectile motion. 
Combining  Forces 	  When the archer releases the bowstring, the arrow will be flung forward toward the top of the target where she’s aiming. But another force will also act on the arrow in a different direction. The other force is gravity, and it will pull the arrow down toward Earth. The two forces combined will cause the arrow to move in the curved path shown in the Figure 4.31. This type of motion is called projectile motion. It occurs whenever an object curves down toward the ground because it has both a horizontal force and the downward force of gravity acting on it. Because of projectile motion, to hit the bull’s eye of a target with an arrow, you actually have to aim for a spot above the bull’s eye. You can see in the Figure 4.32 what happens if you aim at the bull’s eye instead of above it. 
Another  Example of  Projectile  Motion 	  You can probably think of other examples of projectile motion. One is shown in the Figure 4.33. The cannon shoots a ball straight ahead, giving it horizontal motion. At the same time, gravity pulls the ball down toward the ground. Q: How would you show the force of gravity on the cannon ball in the Figure 4.33? A: You would add a line pointing straight down from the cannon to the ground. To get a better feel for projectile motion, try these interactive animations: • URL • URL (Click on the applet “Cannon.”) 
Summary 	  • Projectile motion is movement of an object in a curved path toward the ground because it has both a horizontal force and the downward force of gravity acting on it. • Examples of objects that have projectile motion include arrows and cannon balls. Play the game at the following URL by shooting the cannon at a stationary target. Experiment with three variables—cannon power, height of barrel, and angle of barrel—until you find at least three different combinations of variables that allow the cannon ball to hit the target. Record the values for the three combinations of variables. Then summarize what you learned by doing the activity. URL • Define orbital motion and explain why it occurs. • Describe the orbits of Earth around the sun and the moon around Earth. As you can see in this NASA photo, Earth is tiny compared with the massive sun. The sun’s gravity is relatively strong because the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to their masses. Gravity between the sun and Earth pulls Earth toward the sun, but Earth never falls into the sun. Instead, it constantly revolves around the sun, making one complete revolution every 365 days. Q: Why doesn’t the sun’s gravity pull Earth down to the surface of the sun? A: Earth has enough forward velocity to partly counter the force of the sun’s gravity. What Is Orbital Motion? Earth and many other bodies—including asteroids, comets, and the other planets—move around the sun in curved paths called orbits. Generally, the orbits are elliptical, or oval, in shape. You can see the shape of Earth’s orbit in the but they stay far enough away from the sun because of their forward velocity to fall around the sun instead of into it. As a result, they keep orbiting the sun and never crash to its surface. The motion of Earth and the other bodies around the sun is called orbital motion. Orbital motion occurs whenever an object is moving forward and at the same time is pulled by gravity toward another object. You can explore orbital motion and gravity in depth with the animation at this URL: URL 
Orbital  Motion of the  Moon 	  Just as Earth orbits the sun, the moon also orbits Earth. The moon is affected by Earth’s gravity more than it is by the gravity of the sun because the moon is much closer to Earth. The gravity between Earth and the moon pulls the moon toward Earth. At the same time, the moon has forward velocity that partly counters the force of Earth’s gravity. So the moon orbits Earth instead of falling down to the surface of the planet. The Figure 4.35 shows the forces involved in the moon’s orbital motion around Earth. In the diagram, v represents the forward velocity of the moon, and a represents the acceleration due to gravity between Earth and the moon. The line encircling Earth shows the moon’s actual orbit, which results from the combination of v and a. You can see an animated version of this diagram at: URL 
Summary 	  • Orbital motion occurs whenever an object is moving forward and at the same time is pulled by gravity toward another object. • The forward velocity of the object combines with acceleration due to gravity toward the other object. The result is a circular or oval path called an orbit, in which one object keeps moving around the other. • Because of the relatively great gravity of the sun, Earth orbits the sun. The moon orbits Earth rather than the sun because it is much closer to Earth. At the following URL, experiment with the gravity-and-orbit simulator. Set different initial velocities for the cannon ball and observe whether the cannon ball crashes, escapes from Earth, or is set into orbit. Then answer the questions below. URL account to ensure that a satellite keeps orbiting Earth rather than falling back to Earth’s surface? pull Earth toward them and cause it to veer off its orbit around the sun. • Define elasticity and elastic force. • Give examples of the use of elastic force. What will happen to this bungee jumper when he reaches the end of the bungee cord? He won’t come to an abrupt stop. If he did, he might be seriously hurt. Instead, the cord will stretch while slowing his fall. Q: What will happen next? A: The cord will only stretch so far, and then it will snap back to its original shape, causing the jumper to bounce back up. Bungee cords are useful for this purpose because they are elastic. 
Elasticity and  Elastic  Force 	  Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity. As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force. The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. You can do some virtual bungee jumping at this URL: URL Q: What force stretches the bungee cord after the jumper jumps? When does the bungee cord snap back to its original shape? A: After the bungee jumper jumps, he accelerates toward the ground due to gravity. His weight stretches the bungee cord. As the bungee cord stretches, it exerts elastic force upward against the jumper, which slows his descent and brings him to a momentary stop. Then the bungee cord springs back to its original shape, and the jumper bounces upward. 
Using  Elastic  Force 	  Elastic force can be very useful and not just for bungee jumping. In fact, you probably use elastic force every day. A few common uses of elastic force are shown in the Figure 4.36. Do you use elastic force in any of these ways? Q: How does the resistance band work? How does it use elastic force? A: When you pull on the band, it stretches but doesn’t break. The resistance you feel when you pull on it is elastic force. The farther you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is. The resistance of the band to stretching is what gives your muscles a workout. After you stop pulling on the band, it returns to its original shape, ready for the next stretch. Springs like the spring toy pictured in the Figure 4.37 also have elastic force when they are stretched or compressed. And like stretchy materials, they return to their original shape when the stretching or compressing force is released. Springs are used in scales to measure weight. They also cushion the ride in a car. Q: Can you think of other uses of springs? A: Bedsprings provide springy support beneath a mattress. The spring in a door closer pulls the door shut. The spring in a retractable ballpoint pen retracts the point of the pen. The spring in a pogo stick bounces the rider up off the ground. 
Summary 	  • Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. When an elastic material is stretched or compressed, it exerts elastic force. This force increases the more the material is stretched or compressed. • Elastic force has many uses, from hair scrunchies to bed springs.

There’s no doubt from Corey’s face that he loves skateboarding! Corey and his friends visit Newton’s Skate Park every chance they get. They may not know it, but while they’re having fun on their skateboards, they’re actually applying science concepts such as forces and motion. 
Starting and  Stopping 	  Did you ever ride a skateboard? Even if you didn’t, you probably know that to start a skateboard rolling over a level surface, you need to push off with one foot against the ground. That’s what Corey’s friend Nina is doing in this picture 4.38. Do you know how to stop a skateboard once it starts rolling? Look how Nina’s friend Laura does it in the Figure the skateboard. Even if Laura didn’t try to stop the skateboard, it would stop sooner or later. That’s because there’s also friction between the wheels and the pavement. Friction is a force that counters all kinds of motion. It occurs whenever two surfaces come into contact. 
Video  Break 	  Laura learned how to use forces to start and stop her skateboard by watching the videos below. Watch the video to see how the forces are applied. You can pick up some skateboarding tips at the same time!

Laws of the  Park:  Newton’s  First  Law 	  If you understand how a skateboard starts and stops, then you already know something about Newton’s first law of motion. This law was developed by English scientist Isaac Newton around 1700. Newton was one of the greatest scientists of all time. He developed three laws of motion and the law of gravity, among many other contributions. Newton’s first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force. Without an unbalanced force, a moving object will not only keep moving, but its speed and direction will also remain the same. Newton’s first law of motion is often called the law of inertia because inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion. If an object is already at rest, inertia will keep it at rest. If an object is already in motion, inertia will keep it moving. Do You Get It? Q: How does Nina use Newton’s first law to start her skateboard rolling? A: The skateboard won’t move unless Nina pushes off from the pavement with one foot. The force she applies when she pushes off is stronger than the force of friction that opposes the skateboard’s motion. As a result, the force on the skateboard is unbalanced, and the skateboard moves forward. Q: How does Nina use Newton’s first law to stop her skateboard? A: Once the skateboard starts moving, it would keep moving at the same speed and in the same direction if not for another unbalanced force. That force is friction between the skateboard and the pavement. The force of friction is unbalanced because Nina is no longer pushing with her foot to keep the skateboard moving. That’s why the skateboard stops. 
Changing  Direction 	  Corey’s friend Jerod likes to skate on the flat banks at Newton’s Skate Park. That’s Jerod in the Figure 4.40. As he reaches the top of a bank, he turns his skateboard to go back down. To change direction, he presses down with his heels on one edge of the skateboard. This causes the skateboard to turn in the opposite direction. 
Video  Break 	  Can you turn a skateboard like Jerod? To see how to apply forces to change the direction of a skateboard, watch this video: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Do You Get It? Q: How does Jerod use Newton’s first law of motion to change the direction of his skateboard? A: Pressing down on just one side of a skateboard creates an unbalanced force. The unbalanced force causes the skateboard to turn toward the other side. In the picture, Jerod is pressing down with his heels, so the skateboard turns toward his toes. 
Summary 	  • Newton’s first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force. • Using unbalanced forces to control the motion of a skateboard demonstrates Newton’s first law of motion. Do you think you understand Newton’s first law? Go to the URL below to find out. Review Newton’s law and watch what happens to the skateboarder in the animation.

Explain what happened. • Define inertia. • Describe how inertia affects motion. • State the relationship between inertia and mass. • Explain how to overcome inertia. At Newton’s Skate Park, Lauren is pushing her twin cousins, Jonathan and Cody, on her skateboard. She has to push hard to get the skateboard started, but once it begins moving, it takes much less effort to keep it rolling over the smooth, flat pavement. In fact, if Lauren tries to stop the rolling skateboard, it may take as much effort to stop it as it did to start it rolling in the first place. Q: Why is it harder to start and stop the skateboard than it is to keep it rolling? A: The reason is inertia. What Is Inertia? Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion. All objects have inertia, whether they are stationary or moving. Inertia explains Newton’s first law of motion, which states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force. That’s why Newton’s first law of motion is sometimes called the law of inertia. You can see an animation of inertia at this URL: URL Q: You probably don’t realize it, but you experience inertia all the time, and you don’t have to ride a skateboard. For example, think about what happens when you are riding in a car that stops suddenly. Your body moves forward on the seat and strains against the seat belt. Why does this happen? A: The brakes stop the car but not your body, so your body keeps moving forward because of inertia. Inertia explains why it’s important to always wear a seat belt. 
Inertia and  Mass 	  The inertia of an object depends on its mass. Objects with greater mass also have greater inertia. It would be easier for Lauren to push just one of her cousins on her skateboard than both of them. With just one twin, there would be only about half as much mass on the skateboard, so there would be less inertia to overcome. 
Overcoming  Inertia 	  To change the motion of an object, inertia must be overcome by an unbalanced force acting on the object. The unbalanced force that starts Lauren’s cousins rolling along on the skateboard is applied by Lauren when she gives it a push. Once an object starts moving, inertia keeps it moving without any additional force being applied. In fact, it won’t stop moving unless another unbalanced force opposes its motion. For example, Lauren can stop the rolling skateboard by moving to the other end and pushing in the opposite direction. Q: What if Lauren didn’t stop the skateboard in this way? If it remained on a smooth, flat surface, would it just keep rolling forever? A: The inertia of the moving skateboard would keep it rolling forever if no other unbalanced force opposed its motion. However, another unbalanced force does act on the skateboard Q: What other force is acting on the skateboard? A: The other force is rolling friction between the skateboard’s wheels and the ground. The force of friction opposes the motion of the rolling skateboard and would eventually bring it to a stop without any help from Lauren. Friction opposes the motion of all moving objects, so—like the skateboard—all moving objects eventually stop moving even if no other forces oppose their motion. Later that day, Jonathan rode his skateboard and did some jumps. You can see him in the picture 4.43. When he’s in the air, there is no rolling friction between his wheels and the ground, but another unbalanced force is acting on the skateboard and changing its motion. Q: What force is acting on the skateboard when it is in the air above the ground? And how will this force change the skateboard’s motion? A: The force of gravity is acting on the skateboard. It will pull the skateboard back down to the ground. Once it’s on the ground, friction will slow its motion. 
Summary 	  • Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion. Because of inertia, a resting object will remain at rest, and a moving object will keep moving. • Objects with greater mass have greater inertia. • To change the motion of an object, inertia must be overcome by an unbalanced force acting on the object. At the following URL, read about inertia and watch the truck-and-ladder animation. Then answer the questions below. URL prevented? truck still crashes into the car. Explain how inertia is involved. at Newton’s Skate Park. Gravity is exerting a downward force on the skateboard, as seen in the picture. Why doesn’t it tip over the edge and start rolling down the side of the half-pipe? • State Newton’s second law of motion. • Compare and contrast the effects of force and mass on acceleration. These boys are racing around the track at Newton’s Skate Park. The boy who can increase his speed the most will win the race. Tony, who is closest to the camera in this picture, is bigger and stronger than the other two boys, so he can apply greater force to his skates. Q: Does this mean that Tony will win the race? A: Not necessarily, because force isn’t the only factor that affects acceleration. 
Force,  Mass, and  Acceleration 	  Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration occurs whenever an unbalanced force acts on an object. Two factors affect the acceleration of an object: the net force acting on the object and the object’s mass. Newton’s second law of motion describes how force and mass affect acceleration. The law states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the object’s mass. This can be represented by the equation: 
Mass 	  or a = F m Q: While Tony races along on his rollerblades, what net force is acting on the skates? A: Tony exerts a backward force against the ground, as you can see in the Figure 4.45, first with one skate and then with the other. This force pushes him forward. Although friction partly counters the forward motion of the skates, it is weaker than the force Tony exerts. Therefore, there is a net forward force on the skates. 
Direct and  Inverse  Relationships 	  Newton’s second law shows that there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration. The greater the force that is applied to an object of a given mass, the more the object will accelerate. For example, doubling the force on the object doubles its acceleration. The relationship between mass and acceleration is different. It is an inverse relationship. In an inverse relationship, when one variable increases, the other variable decreases. The greater the mass of an object, the less it will accelerate when a given force is applied. For example, doubling the mass of an object results in only half as much acceleration for the same amount of force. Q: Tony has greater mass than the other two boys he is racing (pictured in the opening image). How will this affect his acceleration around the track? A: Tony’s greater mass will result in less acceleration for the same amount of force. 
Summary 	  • Newton’s second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the object’s mass. • According to the second law, there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration and an inverse relationship between mass and acceleration. At the following URL, use the simulator to experiment with force, mass, and acceleration. First keep force constant at 1 N, and vary mass from 1–5 kg. Next keep mass constant at 1 kg, and vary force from 1–5 N. In each simulation, record the values you tested and the resulting acceleration. Finally, make two line graphs to plot your results.

Xander goes airborne on his scooter as he exits a half-pipe at Newton’s Skate Park. How did he gain enough speed in the half-pipe to fly into the air when he got to the top? His increase in speed was due partly to the force of gravity. 
Acceleration,  Force, and  Mass 	  A change in an object’s motion—such as Xander speeding up on his scooter—is called acceleration. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force. The greater the net force acting on the object, the greater its acceleration will be, but the mass of the object also affects its acceleration. The smaller its mass is, the greater its acceleration for a given amount of force. Newton’s second law of motion summarizes these relationships. According to this law, the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on it divided by its mass. This can be represented by the equation: 
Mass or a =  	  m 
Calculating  Acceleration 	  m = 25 N kg This equation for acceleration can be used to calculate the acceleration of an object that is acted on by a net force. For example, Xander and his scooter have a total mass of 50 kilograms. Assume that the net force acting on Xander and the scooter is 25 Newtons. What is his acceleration? Substitute the relevant values into the equation for acceleration: a = F The Newton is the SI unit for force. It is defined as the force needed to cause a 1-kilogram mass to accelerate at 1 m/s2. Therefore, force can also be expressed in the unit kg • m/s2. This way of expressing force can be substituted for Newtons in Xander’s acceleration so the answer is expressed in the SI unit for acceleration, which is m/s2: a = 0.5 N Q: Why are there no kilograms in the final answer to this problem? A: The kilogram units in the numerator and denominator of the fraction cancel out. As a result, the answer is expressed in the correct SI units for acceleration. = 0.5 m/s2 kg = kg 
Calculating  Force 	  It’s often easier to measure the mass and acceleration of an object than the net force acting on it. Mass can be measured with a balance, and average acceleration can be calculated from velocity and time. However, net force may be a combination of many unseen forces, such as gravity, friction with surfaces, and air resistance. Therefore, it may be more useful to know how to calculate the net force acting on an object from its mass and acceleration. The equation for acceleration above can be rewritten to solve for net force as: 
F = m × a 	  Look at Xander in the Figure 4.46. He’s riding his scooter down a ramp. Assume that his acceleration is 0.8 m/s2. How much force does it take for him to accelerate at this rate? Substitute the relevant values into the equation for force to find the answer: F = m × a = 50 kg × 0.8 m/s2 = 40 kg • m/s2, or 40 N Q: If Xander and his scooter actually had a mass of 40 kg instead of 50 kg, how much force would it take for him to accelerate at 0.8 m/s2? A: It would take only 32 N of force (40 kg × 0.8 m/s2). At the URL below, you can review how to calculate net force from mass and acceleration and try some practice problems. If you want to try more challenging problems, click on the relevant links at the bottom of the Web page. URL 
Summary 	  • According to Newton’s second law of motion, the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on it divided by its mass, or a = F m. • This equation for acceleration can be used to calculate the acceleration of an object when its mass and the net force acting on it are known. • The equation for acceleration can be rewritten as F = m × a to calculate the net force acting on an object when its mass and acceleration are known. At the following URL, solve the six problems on page 2. URL are known? the Figure 4.47. The combined mass of Corey and his skateboard is 60 kg. At the top of his jump, the net force acting on him is 30 Newtons. What is his acceleration at that moment? • Define weight. • Show how to calculate the weight of an object from its mass. This is Sam at Newton’s Skate Park. He’s standing on the back end of his skateboard to keep it from tipping over the edge of a half-pipe. The force of his weight pressing down on the skateboard prevents gravity from pulling it over the edge and down the side of the half-pipe. 
Weight,  Mass, and  Acceleration 	  Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object. It depends on the object’s mass, which is how much matter the object contains. It also depends on the downward acceleration of the object due to gravity, which is the same all over Earth. Weight can be represented by the equation: 
F = m × a 	  This is the general equation that relates force to mass and acceleration. When it relates weight to mass and acceleration, the letter F represents the object’s weight in Newtons (N), which is the SI unit for weight. The letter m in the equation represents the object’s mass in kilograms, and the letter a represents the downward acceleration due to gravity. As this equation shows, weight is directly related to mass. As an object’s mass increases, so does its weight. For example, if mass doubles, weight doubles as well. You can learn more about weight, mass, and acceleration at this URL: URL 
Calculating  Weight 	  All objects on Earth accelerate downward due to gravity at a rate of 9.8 m/s2. Therefore, if you know the mass of an object, you can calculate its weight using this equation: 
F = m × 9.8 m/s2 	  Q: Sam has a mass of 50 kilograms. What is his weight in Newtons? A: You can calculate Sam’s weight in Newtons by substituting his mass in kilograms into the weight formula: F = m × 9.8 m/s2 = 50 kg × 9.8 m/s2 = 490 kg *bull; m/s2, or 490 N You’re probably more familiar with weight in pounds (lb) than in Newtons. One Newton equals 0.225 pounds. In other words, there are 0.225 pounds per Newton. You can use this ratio to convert Newtons to pounds. Q: What is Sam’s weight in pounds? A: In pounds, Sam’s weight is 490 N x 0.225 lb/N = 110 lb. 
Summary 	  • Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object. It depends on the object’s mass and the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.8 m/s2 on Earth. • The formula for calculating weight is F = m × 9.8 m/s2, where F is the object’s weight in Newtons (N) and m is the object’s mass in kilograms.

How much does she weigh in pounds? on Earth? • State Newton’s Third Law of Motion. • Describe action and reaction forces. • Explain why action and reaction forces are not balanced forces. This is a sketch of Jerod on his skateboard. He’s on his way to Newton’s Skate Park. When he pushes his foot against the ground, what happens next? He moves on his skateboard in the opposite direction. How does this happen? 
Action and  Reaction 	  Newton’s third law of motion explains how Jerod starts his skateboard moving. This law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always act in pairs. First an action occurs—Jerod pushes against the ground with his foot. Then a reaction occurs—Jerod moves forward on his skateboard. The reaction is always equal in strength to the action but in the opposite direction. Q: If Jerod pushes against the ground with greater force, how will this affect his forward motion? A: His action force will be greater, so the reaction force will be greater as well. Jerod will be pushed forward with more force, and this will make him go faster and farther. 
Equal and  Opposite  Forces 	  The forces involved in actions and reactions can be represented with arrows. The way an arrow points shows the direction of the force, and the size of the arrow represents the strength of the force. Look at the skateboarders in the This is the action. In the bottom row, the arrows represent the forces with which the skateboarders move apart. This is the reaction. Compare the top and bottom arrows. They point in different directions, but they are the same size. This shows that the reaction forces are equal and opposite to the action forces. 
Equal and  Opposite but  Not  Balanced 	  Because action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, you might think they would cancel out, as balanced forces do. But you would be wrong. Balanced forces are equal and opposite forces that act on the same object. That’s why they cancel out. Action-reaction forces are equal and opposite forces that act on different objects, so they don’t cancel out. In fact, they often result in motion. Think about Jerod again. He applies force with his foot to the ground, whereas the ground applies force to Jerod and the skateboard, causing them to move forward. Q: Actions and reactions occur all the time. Can you think of an example in your daily life? A: Here’s one example. If you lean on something like a wall or your locker, you are applying force to it. The wall or locker applies an equal and opposite force to you. If it didn’t, you would go right through it or else it would tip over. You can watch a video about actions and reactions at this URL: URL 
Summary 	  • Newton’s third law of motion states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always act in pairs. • Action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, but they are not balanced forces because they act on different objects so they don’t cancel out.

URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. pack affect the motion of the astronaut named Alexander? • Define momentum. • Relate momentum to mass and velocity. • Calculate momentum from mass and velocity. Cody seems a little reluctant to launch himself down this ramp at Newton’s Skate Park. It will be his first time down the ramp, and he knows from watching his older brother Jerod that he’ll be moving fast by the time he gets to the bottom. The faster he goes, the harder it will be to stop. That’s because of momentum. What Is Momentum? Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop. The more mass it has or the faster it’s moving, the greater its momentum. Momentum equals mass times velocity and is represented by the equation: 
Momentum =  Mass ×  Velocity 	  Q: What is Cody’s momentum as he stands at the top of the ramp? A: Cody has no momentum as he stands there because he isn’t moving. In other words, his velocity is zero. However, Cody will gain momentum as he starts moving down the ramp and picks up speed. Q: Cody’s older brother Jerod is pictured in the Figure 4.50. If Jerod were to travel down the ramp at the same velocity as Cody, who would have greater momentum? Who would be harder to stop? A: Jerod obviously has greater mass than Cody, so he would have greater momentum. He would also be harder to stop. You can see an animation demonstrating the role of mass and velocity in the momentum of moving objects at this URL 
Calculating  Momentum 	  To calculate momentum with the equation above, mass is measured in (kg), and velocity is measured in meters per second (m/s). For example, Cody and his skateboard have a combined mass of 40 kg. If Cody is traveling at a velocity of 1.1 m/s by the time he reaches the bottom of the ramp, then his momentum is: Momentum = 40 kg × 1.1 m/s = 44 kg • m/s Note that the SI unit for momentum is kg • m/s. Q: The combined mass of Jerod and his skateboard is 68 kg. If Jerod goes down the ramp at the same velocity as Cody, what is his momentum at the bottom of the ramp? A: His momentum is: Momentum = 68 kg × 1.1 m/s = 75 kg • m/s 
Summary 	  • Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop. It equals the object’s mass times its velocity. • To calculate the momentum of a moving object, multiply its mass in kilograms (kg) by its velocity in meters per second (m/s). The SI unit of momentum is kg • m/s. At the following URL, review how to calculate momentum, and then solve the problems at the bottom of the Web page. URL a. Skateboarder A: mass = 60 kg; velocity = 1.5 m/s b. Skateboarder B: mass = 50 kg; velocity = 2.0 m/s • State the law of conservation of momentum. • Describe an example of momentum being transferred and conserved. These skaters are racing each other at Newton’s Skate Park. The first skater in line, the one on the left, is distracted by something he sees. He starts to slow down without realizing it. The skater behind him isn’t paying attention and keeps skating at the same speed. Q: Can you guess what happens next? A: Skater 2 runs into skater 1. 
Conserving  Momentum 	  When skater 2 runs into skater 1, he’s going faster than skater 1 so he has more momentum. Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop. It’s a product of the object’s mass and velocity. At the moment of the collision, skater 2 transfers some of his momentum to skater 1, who shoots forward when skater 2 runs into him. Whenever an action and reaction such as this occur, momentum is transferred from one object to the other. However, the combined momentum of the objects remains the same. In other words, momentum is conserved. This is the law of conservation of momentum. 
Modeling  Momentum 	  The Figure 4.51 shows how momentum is conserved in the two colliding skaters. The total momentum is the same after the collision as it was before. However, after the collision, skater 1 has more momentum and skater 2 has less momentum than before. Q: What if two skaters have a head-on collision? Do you think momentum is conserved then? A: As in all actions and reactions, momentum is also conserved in a head-on collision. You can see how at this URL: URL 
Summary 	  • Whenever an action and reaction occur, momentum is transferred from one object to the other. However, total momentum is conserved. This is the law of conservation of momentum. Watch the astropitch animation at the following URL. Experiment with different velocities. Then take the quiz and check your answers. URL is conserved. Solve for x. • Explain why fluids exert pressure. • Relate pressure to force and area. • Identify the SI unit for pressure. • Show how to calculate pressure. • Name factors that affect fluid pressure. Did you ever use a bicycle pump like the one seen in the opening image? When you push down on the handle, it forces air out through the hose, and the air enters the tire through a tiny opening. Like other fluids (liquids and gases), air can flow and take the shape of its container. The air that enters the tire from the pump quickly spreads out to fill the entire tire evenly. As the tire fills with air, it feels firmer. That’s because the air exerts pressure against the inside surface of the tire. 
Why  Fluids  Exert  Pressure 	  All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire. 
Pressure,  Force, and  Area 	  Pressure is defined as the amount of force acting on a given area. Therefore, pressure can be represented by this equation: 
Area 	  Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area. The smaller the area to which force is applied, the greater the pressure is. Think about pressing a pushpin, like the one in the Figure 4.53, into a bulletin board. You apply force with your thumb to the broad head of the pushpin. However, the force that the pushpin applies to the bulletin board acts only over the tiny point of the pin. This is a much smaller area, so the pressure the point applies to the bulletin board is much greater than the pressure you apply with your thumb. As a result, the pin penetrates the bulletin board with ease. 
I  Unit for  Pressure 	  In the above equation for pressure, force is expressed in Newtons (N) and area is expressed in square meters (m2). Therefore, pressure is expressed in N/m2, which is the SI unit for pressure. This unit is also called the Pascal (Pa). It is named for the scientist Blaise Pascal whose discoveries about pressure in fluids led to a law of the same name. Pressure may also be expressed in the kilopascal (kPa), which equals 1000 Pascals. For example, the correct air pressure inside a mountain bike tire is usually about 200 kPa. 
Calculating  Pressure or  Force 	  When you know how much force is acting on a given area, you can calculate the pressure that is being applied to the area using the equation for pressure given above. For example, assume that a rock weighs 5000 N and is resting on the ground on an area of 0.5 m2. The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is: 
Pressure = 5000  	  Sometimes pressure but not force is known. To calculate force, the equation for pressure can be rewritten as: 
Force =  Pressure ×  Area 	  For example, suppose another rock exerts 10 kPa of pressure over an area of 0.4 m2. How much does the rock weigh? Change 10 kPa (10,000 Pa) to 10,000 N/m2. Then substitute this value for pressure in the force equation as follows: Force (Weight) = 10,000 N/m2 × 0.4 m2 = 4,000 N Q: The break-dancer in the Figure 4.54 has a weight of 800 N. He is balancing on the palm of one hand. If the palm of his hand has an area of 0.02 m2, how much pressure is he exerting on the ground? A: Use the equation for pressure: 
Pressure = 800  	  Q: If the break-dancer lies down on the ground on his back, his weight is spread over an area of 0.75 m2. How much pressure does he exert on the ground in this position? A: On his back, the pressure he exerts is: 
Factors  That  Affect  Fluid  Pressure 	  Two factors influence the pressure of fluids. They are the depth of the fluid and its density. • A fluid exerts more pressure at greater depths. Deeper in a fluid, all of the fluid above it results in more weight pressing down. This causes greater pressure the deeper you go. You can watch a video demonstration of depth and fluid pressure at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Denser fluids such as water exert more pressure than less dense fluids such as air. The particles of denser fluids are closer together, so there are more collisions of particles in a given area. The difference in density of water and air is illustrated in the Figure 4.55. 
Summary 	  • All fluids exert pressure because their particles are constantly moving and bumping into things. • Pressure is defined as the amount of force acting on a given area. It measures how concentrated a force is. • The SI unit for pressure is the Pascal (Pa), or N/m2. • To calculate pressure, divide force in Newtons (N) by area in square meters (m2).

In 2012, the film director James Cameron, who directed the film Titanic, made headlines when he traveled to Challenger Deep. This is the deepest known point on the ocean floor, almost 11,000 meters below the surface. Cameron was the first person to travel there alone, and he made the trip in a deep-sea diving vehicle named Deepsea Challenger. The vehicle pictured above is another deep-sea diving vehicle, named Alvin. Alvin is no longer used for ocean exploration, but by the time it was retired, it had made thousands of dives. Alvin was even used to explore the Titanic on the North Atlantic Ocean floor. Q: Why must divers use special diving machines such as Alvin and Deepsea Challenger to go deep below the surface of the ocean? Why can’t they just use scuba diving gear? A: The pressure of the water is too great that far below the surface. It would crush divers long before they could reach the bottom. 
Water  Pressure and  Depth 	  Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area. As you go deeper in the ocean, the pressure exerted by the water increases steadily. That’s because there is more and more water pressing down on you from above. The Figure with increasing depth at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Adjusting to  Changing  Pressure 	  Scuba divers can dive without special vehicles because they don’t go very deep below the surface of the water. Nonetheless, because of the pressure of the water, scuba divers who go deeper than about 40 meters must return to the surface slowly. They must stop for several minutes at one or more points in their ascent. That’s what the divers in the Figure 4.57 are doing. The stops are needed to let the pressure inside their body adjust to the decreasing pressure of the water as they swim closer to the surface. If they were to rise to the surface too quickly, the gases dissolved in their blood would form bubbles and cause serious health problems. Q: Why would dissolved gases form bubbles as pressure decreases? A: Less gas can dissolve in a fluid at lower pressure. Therefore, as pressure decreases, gases come out of solution and form bubbles. 
Summary 	  • As you go deeper in the ocean, the pressure exerted by the water increases. For each additional meter below the surface, pressure increases by 10 kPa. • Water pressure makes it difficult to explore the deep ocean. The pressure is too great for divers unless they travel in pressure-resistant deep-sea vehicles. Even scuba divers have to take time to adjust to the changes in pressure as they return to the surface. Read about Challenger Deep in the article at the following URL.

URL the water pressure there? • Explain how and why the pressure of the atmosphere changes with increasing altitude. • Describe some ways that we use air pressure. Rays of sunlight pour into this old room and reflect off dust particles in the air. Did you ever see dust particles in the air like these? If so, you may have noticed that they constantly move about at random. Q: Why do dust particles move randomly in the air? A: Invisible particles of gases in the air are constantly moving and bumping into them. 
Pressure of  Gas  Particles 	  Because gas particles in the air—like particles of all fluids—are constantly moving and bumping into things, they exert pressure. The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greater close to Earth’s surface and decreases as you go higher above the surface. You can see this in the Figure 5.70. Q: Denver, Colorado, is called the “mile-high city” because it is located 1 mile (1.6 km) above sea level. What is the average atmospheric pressure that high above sea level? A: From the Figure 5.70, the average atmospheric pressure 1.6 km above sea level is about 85 kPa. 
Explaining  Changes in  Air  Pressure with  Altitude 	  There are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases: density and depth of the atmosphere. • Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity, so gas particles are denser near the surface. With more gas particles in a given volume, there are more collisions of particles and therefore greater pressure. • The depth (distance from top to bottom) of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases at higher altitudes. With greater depth of the atmosphere, more air is pressing down from above. Therefore, air pressure is greatest at sea level and falls with increasing altitude. On top of Mount Everest, which is the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. 
How  We  Use  Air  Pressure 	  The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows us to do many things, from sipping through a straw to simply breathing. You can see in the Figures 4.59 and 4.60 how we use air pressure in both of these ways. When you first suck on a straw, you remove air from the straw, so the air pressure in the straw is lower that the air pressure on the surface of the drink. A fluid always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure, so the drink moves up the straw and into your mouth. Q: Can you think of other ways that air pressure is useful? A: You can see more examples of ways we use air pressure by watching the video at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greatest at Earth’s surface and falls as altitude increases. The reason is that density and depth of the atmosphere are greatest at sea level and decline with increasing altitude. • The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows us to do many things, from sipping through a straw to breathing.

URL URL • State Pascal’s law. • Describe how Pascal’s law applies to a tube of toothpaste. • Explain how transmission of fluid pressure is used in brakes and other equipment. Did you ever watch someone make balloon animals like this turkey? When you blow up a balloon, you force air inside the balloon through a small opening. The air spreads out and presses against the inside of the balloon, forcing it to expand. Pressure always spreads throughout a contained fluid like air in a balloon. 
Pressure and  Force 	  Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area. It is represented by the equation: 
Area 	  The pressure exerted by a fluid increases if more force is applied or if the same force is applied over a smaller area. The equation for pressure can be rewritten as: 
Force =  Pressure ×  Area 	  This equation shows that the same pressure applied to a greater area increases the force. 
Pascal and  His  Law 	  Some of the earliest scientific research on pressure in fluids was conducted by a French mathematician and physicist named Blaise Pascal (1623–1662). The SI unit of pressure, the Pascal (Pa), is named for him because of his important research. One of Pascal’s major contributions is known as Pascal’s law. This law states that a change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid. To see a video about Pascal’s law, go to this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
A  Simple  Example 	  A simple example may help you understand Pascal’s law. Toothpaste is a fluid that is enclosed in a tube with a small opening at one end. Look at the toothpaste tube in the Figure 4.61. When any part of the tube is squeezed, toothpaste squirts out the open end. The pressure applied to the tube is transmitted equally throughout the toothpaste. When the pressure reaches the open end, it forces toothpaste out through the opening. 
Using  Fluid  Pressure 	  The ability of fluids to transmit pressure in this way can be very useful—besides getting toothpaste out of a tube! For example, hydraulic brakes in a car use fluid to transmit pressure, and when they do, they also increase force. You can see how hydraulic brakes work in the Figure 4.62. Q: In this diagram, how can you tell that the force applied by the brake cylinder is greater than the force applied by the brake pedal mechanism? A: The arrows representing the force applied by the break cylinder are larger than the arrow representing the force applied by the brake pedal mechanism. A larger arrow indicates greater force. Q: How do hydraulic brakes increase the force that is applied to the brake shoes? 
Hydraulic  Brakes 	  A: The pressure exerted by the fluid on the brake shoes is applied over a larger area. When pressure acts over a larger area, it increases the force (Force = Pressure × Area). Hydraulic car lifts also use fluid to transmit pressure and increase force. The lifts are used to raise cars, which are very heavy, so mechanics can work on them from underneath. Controls in airplanes use fluids to transmit pressure and increase force so a flick of a switch can raise or lower heavy landing gear.

Summary 	  • Pascal’s law states that a change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid. • The ability of fluids to transmit pressure in this way can be very useful—from getting toothpaste out of a tube to applying the brakes on a car.

URL small hole in one corner of a packet and then squeeze the packet. • State Bernoulli’s law. • Relate Bernoulli’s law to flight. Look at the large bar (labeled “TELMEX”) across the back of this racecar. The bar is called a spoiler. It causes air pressure to push the car toward the ground. This increases friction between the wheels and the pavement, helping the car to hug the track. How does a spoiler work? Bernoulli’s law has the answer. What Is Bernoulli’s Law? Bernoulli’s law states that the pressure of a moving fluid such as air is less when the fluid is moving faster. Pressure is the amount of force applied per given area. The law is named for Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician who discovered it during the 1700s. Bernoulli used mathematics to arrive at his law. For an animation of the law, go to the URL below. URL 
Using  Air  Pressure to  Fly 	  Did you ever wonder how the wings of airplanes or birds allow them to fly? Bernoulli’s law provides the answer. Look at the wings of the plane and hawk in the Figure 4.64. The shape of the wings causes air to flow more slowly below them than above them. This causes air pressure to be greater below the wings than above them. The difference in air pressure lifts the plane or bird above the ground. Q: How does a spoiler on a racecar use Bernoulli’s law? A: A spoiler on a racecar is like an upside-down wing. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly—and air pressure to be greater—above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, helping it to stay on the track. 
Summary 	  • Bernoulli’s law states that the pressure of a moving fluid such as air is less when the fluid is moving faster. • Bernoulli’s law explains how wings of airplanes and birds create lift and allow them to fly.

What could be more refreshing than floating in cool water on a hot summer day? Water and other fluids have a special force that allows people and things to float in them. The force is called buoyant force. What Is Buoyant Force? Buoyant force is an upward force that fluids exert on any object that is placed in them. The ability of fluids to exert this force is called buoyancy. What explains buoyant force? A fluid exerts pressure in all directions, but the pressure is greater at greater depth. Therefore, the fluid below an object, where the fluid is deeper, exerts greater pressure on the object than the fluid above it. You can see in the Figure 4.65 how this works. Buoyant force explains why the girl pictured above can float in water. Q: You’ve probably noticed that some things don’t float in water. For example, if you drop a stone in water, it will sink to the bottom rather than floating. If buoyant force applies to all objects in fluids, why do some objects sink instead of float? A: The answer has to do with their weight. 
Weight and  Buoyant  Force 	  Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object, whereas buoyant force pushes up on an object. Which force is greater determines whether an object sinks or floats. Look at the Figure 4.66. On the left, the object’s weight is the same as the buoyant force acting on it, so the object floats. On the right, the object’s weight is greater than the buoyant force acting on it, so the object sinks. Because of buoyant force, objects seem lighter in water. You may have noticed this when you went swimming and could easily pick up a friend or sibling under the water. Some of the person’s weight was countered by the buoyant force of the water. 
Density and  Buoyant  Force 	  Density, or the amount of mass in a given volume, is also related to the ability of an object to float. That’s because density affects weight. A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance. For example, ice is less dense than liquid water. This explains why the giant ice berg in the Figure 4.67 is floating in the ocean. You can see other examples of density and buoyant force at this URL: URL Q: Can you think of more examples of substances that float in a fluid because they are low in density? A: Oil is less dense than water, so oil from a spill floats on ocean water. Helium is less dense than air, so balloons filled with helium float in air. 
Summary 	  • Buoyant force is an upward force that fluids exert on any object that is placed in them. Buoyant force occurs because the fluid below an object exerts greater pressure on the object than the fluid above it. • If an object’s weight is less than the buoyant force acting on it, then the object floats. If an object’s weight is greater than the buoyant force acting on it, then the object sinks. • A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance. Therefore, density of an object also affects whether it sinks or floats. At the following URL, read the short article about submarines and do the animation of a submarine submerging and surfacing.

Explain your prediction. • State Archimedes’ law. • Explain how a heavy object such as a big ship can float in water. Do you see the man sitting on top of this tanker truck? He gives you a sense of how big the truck is. What’s behind the truck? Is it a huge apartment complex? It’s just as massive as a very large building, but it’s not even resting on land. It’s a giant cruise ship, and it’s floating on water. The ship weighs about 100,000 metric tons. How can such a tremendous weight float on water? Why doesn’t it sink to the bottom of the ocean instead? Archimedes’ law explains why. 
Archimedes  Takes a  Bath 	  Did you ever notice when you get into a bathtub of water that the level of the water rises? More than 2000 years ago, a Greek mathematician named Archimedes noticed the same thing. He observed that both a body and the water in a tub can’t occupy the same space at the same time. As a result, some of the water is displaced, or moved out of the way. How much water is displaced? Archimedes determined that the volume of displaced water equals the volume of the submerged object. So more water is displaced by a bigger body than a smaller one. Q: If you jump into swimming pool, how much water does your body displace? A: The water displaced by your body is equal to your body’s volume. Depending on your size, this volume might be about 0.07 m3. 
Displacement and  Buoyant  Force 	  Objects such as ships may float in a fluid like water because of buoyant force. This is an upward force that a fluid exerts on any object that is placed in it. Archimedes discovered that the buoyant force acting on an object equals the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This is known as Archimedes’ law (or Archimedes’ principle). For an entertaining video presentation of Archimedes’ law, go to this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Floating  Objects and  Archimedes’  Law 	  Archimedes’ law explains why some objects float in fluids even though they are very heavy. It all depends on how much fluid they displace. The cruise ship pictured in the opening image is extremely heavy, yet it stays afloat. If a steel ball with the same weight as the ship were placed in water, it would sink to the bottom. This is modeled in the volume of water displaced by the steel ball weighs less than the ball itself, so the buoyant force is not as great as the force of gravity pulling down on the ball. Thus, the ball sinks. Now look at the ship’s hull in the Figure 4.68. Its shape causes the ship to displace much more water than the ball. In fact, the weight of the displaced water is greater than the weight of the ship. As a result, the buoyant force is greater than the force of gravity acting on the ship, so the ship floats. Q: Why might you be more likely to float in water if you stretch out your body rather than curl up into a ball? A: You would displace more water by stretching out your body, so there would be more buoyant force acting on it. Therefore, you would be more likely to float in this position. 
Summary 	  • Archimedes determined that an object displaces the same volume of fluid as its own volume. • According to Archimedes’ law, the buoyant force acting on an object equals the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. • The shape of an object may affect how much fluid it displaces and therefore the buoyant force acting on it. This explains why one object may sink while another object with the same weight but a different shape may float.

(Hint: Form the two pieces of foil into different shapes.) • Define work. • Relate work to force and distance. The teens in the picture on the left are having fun playing basketball. The teen in the picture on the right is working hard studying for an exam. It’s obvious who is doing work—or is it? Would it surprise you to learn that the teens who are working are the ones who are having fun playing basketball, while the teen who is studying isn’t doing any work at all? The reason why has to do with how work is defined in physics. 
Defining  Work 	  Work is defined differently in physics than in everyday language. In physics, work means the use of force to move an object. The teens who are playing basketball in the picture above are using force to move their bodies and the basketball, so they are doing work. The teen who is studying isn’t moving anything, so she isn’t doing work. Not all force that is used to move an object does work. For work to be done, the force must be applied in the same direction that the object moves. If a force is applied in a different direction than the object moves, no work is done. The Q: If the box the man is carrying is very heavy, does he do any work as he walks across the room with it? A: Regardless of the weight of the box, the man does no work on it as he holds it while walking across the room. However, he does more work when he first lifts a heavier box to chest height. 
Work,  Force, and  Distance 	  Work is directly related to both the force applied to an object and the distance the object moves. It can be represented by the equation: 
Work =  Force ×  Distance 	  This equation shows that the greater the force that is used to move an object or the farther the object is moved, the more work that is done. You can see a short video introduction to work as the product of force and distance at this link: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. To see the effects of force and distance on work, compare the weight lifters in the Figure 4.70. The two weight lifters on the left are lifting the same amount of weight, but the one on the bottom is lifting the weight a greater distance. Therefore, this weight lifter is doing more work. The two weight lifters on the bottom right are both lifting the weight the same distance, but the weight lifter on the left is lifting a heavier weight, so she is doing more work. 
Summary 	  • In physics, work is defined as the use of force to move an object. For work to be done, the force must be applied in the same direction that the object moves. • Work is directly related to both the force applied to an object and the distance the object moves.

Clarissa is cutting the grass in her grandmother’s yard using an old-fashioned push mower. The mower has no motor, so Clarissa is doing all the work. How much work does Clarissa do pushing the mower around the yard? The amount of work depends on how much force she uses and how far she pushes the mower. 
Work,  Force, and  Distance 	  Work is the use of force to move an object. It is directly related to both the force applied to the object and the distance the object moves. Work can be calculated with this equation: Work = Force x Distance. How Much Work? The equation for work can be used to calculate work if force and distance are known. To use the equation, force is expressed in Newtons (N), and distance is expressed in meters (m). For example, assume that Clarissa uses 100 Newtons of force to push the mower and that she pushes it for a total of 200 meters as she cuts the grass in her grandmother’s yard. Then, the amount of work Clarissa does is: Work = 100 N × 200 m = 20,000 N • m Notice that the unit for work in the answer is the Newton • meter (N • m). This is the SI unit for work, also called the joule (J). One joule equals the amount of work that is done when 1 N of force moves an object over a distance of 1 m. Q: After Clarissa mows her grandmother’s lawn, she volunteers to mow a neighbor’s lawn as well. If she pushes the mower with the same force as before and moves it over a total of 234 meters, how much work does she do mowing the neighbor’s lawn? A: The work Clarissa does can be calculated as: Work = 100 N × 234 m = 23,400 N • m, or 23,400 J 
Calculating  Force or  Distance  When  Work  Is  Known 	  The work equation given above can be rearranged to find force or distance if the other variables are known: 
Force 	  After Clarissa finishes mowing both lawns, she pushes the lawn mower down the sidewalk to her own house. If she pushes the mower over a distance of 30 meters and does 2700 joules of work, how much force does she use? Substitute the known values into the equation for force: 
Force = 2700  	  Q: When Clarissa gets back to her house, she hangs the 200-Newton lawn mower on some hooks in the garage (see the Figure 4.71). To lift the mower, she does 400 joules of work. How far does she lift the mower to hang it? A: Substitute the known values into the equation for distance: 
Summary 	  • Work can be calculated with the equation: Work = Force × Distance. • The SI unit for work is the joule (J), or Newton • meter (N • m).

Did you ever sweep a floor with a broom, like the woman in the picture on the left? It can take a lot of effort to do the job. But if you use an electric vacuum cleaner, like the woman in the picture on the right, you can do the same work more easily and quickly. That’s because the vacuum cleaner provides more power. What Is Power? Power is a measure of the amount of work that can be done in a given amount of time. Power can be represented by the equation: 
Time 	  In this equation, work is measured in joules (J) and time is measured in seconds (s), so power is expressed in joules per second (J/s). This is the SI unit for power, also known as the watt (W). A watt equals 1 joule of work per second. You’re probably already familiar with watts. Light bulbs and small appliances such as microwave ovens are labeled with the watts of power they provide. For example, the package of light bulbs in the Figure 4.72 is labeled “14 watts.” Q: Assume you have two light bulbs of the same type, such as two compact fluorescent light bulbs like the one pictured in the Figure 4.72. If one light bulb is a 25-watt bulb and the other is a 60-watt bulb, which bulb produces brighter light? A: The 60-watt bulb is more powerful, so it produces brighter light. Compared with a less powerful device, a more powerful device can either do more work in the same time or do the same work in less time. For example, compared with a low-power microwave oven, a high-power microwave oven can cook more food in the same time or the same amount of food in less time. 
Time = 24000  	  Power can be calculated using the formula above if the amount of work and time are known. For example, assume that a microwave oven does 24,000 joules of work in 30 seconds. Then the power of the microwave is: 
Power =  Work 	  Q: Another microwave oven does 5,000 joules of work in 5 seconds. What is its power? A: The power of the other microwave oven is: 
Power = 5000  	  Q: Which microwave oven will heat the same amount of food in less time? A: The 1000-watt microwave oven has more power, so it will heat the same amount of food in less time. 
Calculating  Work from  Power and  Time 	  You can also calculate work if you know power and time by rewriting the power equation above as: 
Work =  Power ×  Time 	  For example, if you use a 1000-watt microwave oven for 20 seconds, how much work does it do? First express 1000 watts in J/s and then substitute this value for power the work equation: 
Work = 1000  J/s × 20 s = 20,000  	  You can watch a video about calculating work and power at this URL: URL 
Horsepower 	  Sometimes power is measured in a unit called the horsepower. For example, the power of car engines is usually expressed in horsepowers. One horsepower is the amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute. It equals 745 watts of power. Compare the horsepowers in the Figure 4.73 to the other Figure 4.74. This team of three horses provides 3 horsepowers of power. This big tractor provides 180 horsepowers of power. Q: If the team of horses and the tractor do the same amount of work plowing a field, which will get the job done faster? A: The tractor will get the job done faster because it has more power. In fact, because the tractor has 30 times the power of the six-horse team, ideally it can do the same work 30 times faster! 
Summary 	  • Power is a measure of the amount of work that can be done in a given amount of time. Power equals work (J) divided by time (s). • The SI unit for power is the watt (W), which equals 1 joule of work per second (J/s). • Power can be calculated from work and time using the equation: . • Power may be measured in a unit called the horsepower.

URL • Define machine. • Describe three ways that machines make work easier, and give examples of machines that work each way. When you hear the word machine, do you think of power tools or construction equipment, like the ones pictured above? While both of these examples are machines, you might be surprised to learn that devices as simple as hammers and screws are also machines. Q: Why are simple tools considered to be machines? A: Like all machines, they change forces and make work easier. What Is a Machine? A machine is any device that makes work easier by changing a force. Work is done whenever a force moves an object over a distance. The amount of work done is represented by the equation: 
Work =  Force x  Distance 	  When you use a machine, you apply force to the machine. This force is called the input force. The machine, in turn, applies force to an object. This force is called the output force. The output force may or may not be the same as the input force. The force you apply to the machine is applied over a given distance, called the input distance. The force applied by the machine to the object is also applied over a distance, called the output distance. The output distance may or may not be the same as the input distance. 
How  Machines  Make  Work  Easier 	  Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. For a humorous introduction to machines and how they make work easier, watch video chapters 1–3 at the following URL: URL Q: If a machine increases the force applied, what does this tell you about the distance over which the force is applied by the machine: A: The machine must apply the force over a shorter distance. That’s because a machine doesn’t change the amount of work and work equals force times distance. Therefore, if force increases, distance must decrease. For the same reason, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. 
Increasing  Force 	  Examples of machines that increase force are steering wheels and pliers (see Figure 4.75). Read below to find out how both of these machines work. In each case, the machine applies more force than the user applies to the machine, but the machine applies the force over a shorter distance. 
Increasing  Distance 	  Examples of machines that increase the distance over which force is applied are leaf rakes and hammers (see Figure which the force is applied, but it reduces the strength of the force. 
Changing the  Direction of  Force 	  Some machines change the direction of the force applied by the user. They may or may not also change the strength of the force or the distance over which the force is applied. Two examples of machines that work this way are the claw ends of hammers and flagpole pulleys. You can see in the Figure 4.77 how each of these machines works. In both cases, the direction of the force applied by the user is reversed by the machine. Q: If the pulley only changes the direction of the force, how does it make the work of raising the flag easier? A: The pulley makes it easier to lift the flag because it allows a person to pull down on the rope and add his or her own weight to the effort, rather than simply lifting the load. 
Simple and  Compound  Machines 	  There are six types of simple machines that are the basis of all other machines. They are the inclined plane, lever, wedge, screw, pulley, and wheel and axle. The six types are pictured in the Figure 4.78. You’ve probably used some of these simple machines yourself. Most machines are combinations of two or more simple machines. These machines are called compound machines. An example of a compound machine is a wheelbarrow (see bottom of more complex and consist of many simple machines. Examples include washing machines and cars. You can learn more about each of the six types of simple machines at these URLs: URL URL 
Summary 	  • A machine is any device that makes work easier by changing a force. • Machines may increase the strength of the force, increase the distance over which the force is applied, or change the direction in which the force is applied. • There are six types of simple machines. Machines that consist of two or more simple machines are called compound machines. Watch the video about simple machines at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.

This man is pushing heavy boxes on a dolly. If he were to push the boxes across the ground without the dolly, it would take a lot more force because he would have to overcome the sliding friction between the boxes and the ground. Using a dolly reduces the friction because rolling friction between the wheels and the ground is much less than sliding friction. 
Machines and  Friction 	  A dolly is a machine because it changes a force to make work easier. What is work? In physics, work is defined as the use of force to move an object over a distance. It is represented by the equation: 
Work =  Force x  Distance 	  All machines make work easier, but they don’t increase the amount of work that is done. You can never get more work out of a machine than you put into it. In fact, a machine always does less work on an object than the user does on the machine. That’s because a machine must use some of the work put into it to overcome friction. Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. All machines involve motion, so they all have friction. How much work is needed to overcome friction in a machine depends on the machine’s efficiency. 
Machine  Efficiency 	  Efficiency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user (input work) that becomes work done by the machine (output work). The output work is always less than the input work because some of the input work is used to overcome friction. Therefore, efficiency is always less than 100 percent. The closer to 100 percent a machine’s efficiency is, the better it is at reducing friction. Look at the ramp in the Figure 4.79. A ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane. It is easier to push the heavy piece of furniture up the ramp to the truck than to lift it straight up off the ground, but pushing the furniture over the surface of the ramp creates a lot of friction. Some of the force applied to moving the furniture must be used to overcome the friction with the ramp. Q: Why would it be more efficient to use a dolly to roll the furniture up the ramp? A: There would be less friction to overcome if you used a dolly because of the wheels. So the efficiency of the ramp would be greater with the dolly. 
Calculating  Efficiency 	  Efficiency can be calculated with the equation: Efficiency = 
Output work 	  Consider a machine that puts out 6000 joules of work. To produce that much work from the machine requires the user to put in 8000 joules of work. To find the efficiency of the machine, substitute these values into the equation for efficiency: Q: Rani puts 7500 joules of work into pushing a box up a ramp, but only 6700 joules of work actually go into moving the box. The rest of the work overcomes friction between the box and the ramp. What is the efficiency of the ramp? A: The efficiency of the ramp is: For an animated ramp and its efficiency, go to this URL: URL 
Summary 	  • A machine always does less work on an object than the user does on the machine, because the machine must use some of the work to overcome friction. • Efficiency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user (input work) that becomes work done by the machine (output work). It is a measure of how well a machine reduces friction. • You can calculate the efficiency of a machine with this equation: Efficiency = Output work 
Input work × 100% 	  At the following URL, review efficiency and how to calculate it. Then do the problems at the bottom of the Web page. Check the correct answers and the explanations for them. URL efficiency? • Define actual and ideal mechanical advantage. • Show how to calculate actual and ideal mechanical advantage. • Identify the mechanical advantage of different types of machines. Did you ever use a hammer to break open a piggy bank? When you use a hammer to hit something, you apply force to the end of the handle. The head of the hammer, in turn, applies force to the piggy bank or whatever object you are striking. The head of the hammer moves farther than you move the handle with your hand. For all machines—not just hammers—the user applies force (input force) to the machine over a certain distance (input distance). The machine, in turn, applies force (output force) to an object, also over a certain distance (output distance). A machine makes work easier by changing the force or the distance over which the force is applied. What Is Mechanical Advantage? How much a machine changes the input force is its mechanical advantage. Mechanical advantage is the ratio of the output force to the input force, so it can be represented by the equation: 
Input force 	  Note that this equation represents the actual mechanical advantage of a machine. The actual mechanical advantage takes into account the amount of the input force that is used to overcome friction. The equation yields the factor by which the machine changes the input force when the machine is actually used in the real world. 
Ideal  Mechanical  Advantage 	  It can be difficult to measure the input and output forces needed to calculate the actual mechanical advantage of a machine. Generally, an unknown amount of the input force is used to overcome friction. 
It’s usually easier 	  to measure the input and output distances than the input and output forces. The distance measurements can then be used to calculate the ideal mechanical advantage. The ideal mechanical advantage represents the change in input force that would be achieved by the machine if there were no friction to overcome. The ideal mechanical advantage is always greater than the actual mechanical advantage because all machines have to overcome friction. Ideal mechanical advantage can be calculated with the equation: 
Output  Distance 	  You can watch a video about actual and ideal mechanical advantage at this URL: URL 
A  Simple  Example 	  Look at the ramp in the Figure 4.80. A ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane. It can be used to raise an object off the ground. The input distance is the length of the sloped surface of the ramp. This is the distance over which the input force is applied. The output distance is the height of the ramp, or the vertical distance the object is raised. For this ramp, the input distance is 6 m and the output distance is 2 meters. Therefore, the ideal mechanical advantage of this ramp is: Ideal Mechanical Advantage = 
Output distance = 6 m 	  An ideal mechanical advantage of 3 means that the ramp ideally (in the absence of friction) multiplies the input force by a factor of 3. The trade-off is that the input force must be applied over a greater distance than the object is lifted. Q: Assume that another ramp has a sloping surface of 8 m and a vertical height of 4 m. What is the ideal mechanical advantage of this ramp? A: The ramp has an ideal mechanical advantage of: 
Mechanical  Advantage of  Different  Types of  Machines 	  Many machines—including inclined planes such as ramps—increase the strength of the force put into the machine but decrease the distance over which the force is applied. Other machines increase the distance over which the force is applied but decrease the strength of the force. Still other machines change the direction of the force, with or without also increasing its strength or distance. Which way a machine works determines its mechanical advantage, as shown in the Table 4.2. 
Strength of  Force 	  increases decreases stays the same (changes direction only)

Summary 	  • The actual mechanical advantage of a machine reflects the increase or decrease in force achieved by the machine. It takes into account the force needed to overcome friction. • The actual mechanical advantage can be calculated with the equation: Actual Mechanical Advantage = Output force 
Input force 	  • The ideal mechanical advantage of a machine reflects the increase or decrease in force there would be without It is always greater than the actual mechanical advantage because all machines must overcome friction. friction. • The ideal mechanical advantage can be calculated with the equation: Ideal Mechanical Advantage = Input Distance

The highway above switches back and forth as it climbs up the steep hillside. The much gentler slope of the road makes it easier for vehicles to reach the top of the mountain. The highway is an example of an inclined plane. What Is an Inclined Plane? An inclined plane is a simple machine that consists of a sloping surface connecting a lower elevation to a higher elevation. An inclined plane is one of six types of simple machines, and it is one of the oldest and most basic. In fact, two other simple machines, the wedge and the screw, are variations of the inclined plane. A ramp like the one in the Figure 4.81 is another example of an inclined plane. Inclined planes make it easier to move objects to a higher elevation. The sloping surface of the inclined plane supports part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope. As a result, it takes less force to move the object uphill. The trade-off is that the object must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved straight up to the higher elevation. You can see several other examples of inclined planes at this URL: URL 
Mechanical  Advantage of an  Inclined  Plane 	  The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine. It is the ratio of output force (the force put out by the machined) to input force (the force put into the machine). For an inclined plane, less force is put into moving an object up the slope than if the object were lifted straight up, so the mechanical advantage is greater than 1. The more gradual the slope of the inclined plane, the less input force is needed and the greater the mechanical advantage. Q: Which inclined plane pictured in the Figure 4.82 has a greater mechanical advantage? A: The inclined plane on the right has a more gradual slope, so it has a greater mechanical advantage. Less force is needed to move objects up the gentler slope, yet the objects attain the same elevation as they would if more force were used to push them up the steeper slope. 
Summary 	  • An inclined plane is a simple machine that consists of a sloping surface connecting a lower elevation to a higher elevation. It is used to move objects more easily to the higher elevation. • Less force is needed to move an object uphill with an inclined plane, but the force must be applied over a greater distance. • The mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is always greater than 1, because the machine puts out more force than the user puts into it. At the following URL, click on the inclined plane and go through the animation. Then answer the questions below. URL plane? • Describe a wedge. • Explain how a wedge changes force to make work easier. • Identify the mechanical advantage of a wedge. A chisel is a very useful tool for carving wood, rocks, and other hard substances. This man is using a chisel to remove large pieces of wood. A chisel is a type of machine called a wedge. What Is a Wedge? A wedge is simple machine that consists of two inclined planes, giving it a thin end and thick end, as you can see in the Figure 4.84. A wedge is used to cut or split apart objects. Force is applied to the thick end of the wedge, and the wedge, in turn, applies force to the object along both of its sloping sides. This force causes the object to split apart. A knife is another example of a wedge. In the Figure 4.85, a knife is being used to chop tough pecans. The job is easy to do with the knife because of the wedge shape of the blade. The very thin edge of the blade easily enters and cuts through the pecans. You can see other examples of wedges, as well as a history of the wedge, at the following URL 
Mechanical  Advantage of a  Wedge 	  The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine. It is the ratio of the output force to the input force. A wedge applies more force to the object (output force) than the user applies to the wedge (input force), so the mechanical advantage of a wedge is greater than 1. A longer, thinner wedge has a greater mechanical advantage than a shorter, wider wedge. With all wedges, the trade-off is that the output force is applied over a shorter distance, so force may need to be applied to the wedge repeatedly to push it through the object. Q: Which wedge in the Figure 4.86 do you think would do the same amount of work with less input force? A: The wedge on the left has a greater mechanical advantage, so it would do the same amount of work with less input force. 
Summary 	  • A wedge is a simple machine that consists of two inclined planes, giving it a thin end and thick end. Force is applied to the thick end of the wedge, and the sloping sides of the wedge apply force to the object, cutting it or splitting it apart. • A wedge makes work easier by increasing the force applied to the object, although it applies the force over a shorter distance. This gives the wedge a mechanical advantage greater than 1. At the following URL, click on the wedge to view the animation. Then answer the questions below.

This old chimney has a spiral staircase wrapped around it. The spiral staircase contains an inclined plane, or ramp. Do you see it? The stairs that wrap around the outside wall of the chimney make up the inclined plane. Together with the chimney, they represent a machine called a screw. 
What  Is a  Screw 	  A screw is a simple machine that consists of an inclined plane wrapped around a central cylinder. No doubt you are familiar with screws like the wood screw in the left-hand side of the Figure 4.88. The cap of the bottle pictured on the right is another example of a screw. Screws move objects to a greater depth (or higher elevation) by increasing the force applied to the screw. Many screws are used to hold things together, such as two pieces of wood or a screw cap and bottle. When you use a screw, you apply force to turn the inclined plane. The screw, in turn, applies greater force to the object, such as the wood or bottle top. You can watch an animation of a turning screw at the following URL To see some other examples of screws, go to this URL: URL Q: Can you identify the inclined plane in each example of a screw pictured in the Figure 4.88? A: The inclined plane of the screw on the left consists of the ridges, or threads, that wrap around the central cylinder of the screw. The inclined plane of the cap on the right consists of the ridges that wrap around the inner sides of the cap. 
Mechanical  Advantage of a  Screw 	  The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine. It is the ratio of the output force to the input force. The force applied by the screw (output force) is always greater than the force applied to the screw (input force). Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a screw is always greater than 1. Look at the two screws in the Figure 4.89. In the screw on the right, the threads of the inclined plane are closer together. This screw has a greater mechanical advantage and is easier to turn than the screw on the left, so it takes less force to penetrate the wood with the right screw. The trade-off is that more turns of the screw are needed to do the job because the distance over which the input force must be applied is greater. Q: Why is it harder to turn a screw with more widely spaced threads? A: The screw moves farther with each turn when the threads are more widely space, so more force must be applied to turn the screw and cover the greater distance. 
Summary 	  • A screw is a simple machine that consists of an inclined plane wrapped around a central cylinder. Screws move objects to a greater depth (or higher elevation) by increasing the force applied to the screw • The mechanical advantage of a screw is always greater than 1 because the output force applied by the screw is greater than the input force applied to the screw. Do the simple screw activity described at the following URL, and then answer the questions below. URL • Define lever. • Describe the three classes of levers. • Outline how each class of lever changes force. A hammer can be used to pull a nail out of a board. You can see how it’s done in this picture. When you push down on the handle of the hammer, the claw end of the hammer pulls up on the nail. A hammer is an example of a machine called a lever. What Is a Lever? A lever is a simple machine consisting of a bar that rotates around a fixed point. The fixed point of a lever is called the fulcrum. Like other machines, a lever makes work easier by changing the force applied to the machine or the distance over which the force is applied. For a video introduction to levers using skateboards as examples, go to this URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. How does a hammer make it easier to pull a nail out of a board? First, it changes the direction of the force applied to the hammer—the hand pushes down on the handle while the claw end of the hammer head pulls up. Often, you can push down with more force than you can push up because you can put your own weight behind it. The hammer also increases the strength of the force that is applied to it. It easily pulls the nail out of the board, which you couldn’t do with your hands alone. On the other hand, the hammer decreases the distance over which the force is applied. The hand pushing down on the handle moves the handle over a distance of several inches, whereas the hammer pulls up on the nail only an inch or two. Q: Where is the fulcrum of the hammer when it is used to pull a nail out of a board? In other words, around what point does the hammer rotate? A: The fulcrum is the point where the head of the hammer rests on the surface of the board. 
Classes of  Levers 	  Other levers change force or distance in different ways than a hammer removing a nail. How a lever changes force or distance depends on the location of the input and output forces relative to the fulcrum. The input force is the force applied by the user to the lever. The output force is the force applied by the lever to the object. Based on the location of input and output forces, there are three basic types of levers, called first-class, second-class, and third-class levers. The Table 4.3 describes the three classes. You can see animations of the classes, as well as more examples, at this URL 
Input 	  & Output Forces & 
Change in  Direction 	  of Force? <1 >1 >1 <1 yes yes yes no no 
Hockey stick 	  • ∆ = fulcrum I = input force O = output force The Table 4.3 includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. Q: Which class of lever is a hammer when it is used to pry a nail out of a board? What is its mechanical advantage? A: To pry a nail out of a board, the fulcrum is located between the input and output forces. Therefore, when a hammer is used in this way it is a first class lever. The fulcrum is closer to the output force than the input force, so the mechanical advantage is >1. In other words, the hammer increases the force applied to it, making it easier to pry the nail out of the board. 
Comparing  Classes of  Levers 	  All three classes of levers make work easier, but they do so in different ways. • When the input and output forces are on opposite sides of the fulcrum, the lever changes the direction of the applied force. This occurs only with first-class levers. • When both the input and output forces are on the same side of the fulcrum, the direction of the applied force does not change. This occurs with both second-class and third-class levers. • When the input force is applied farther from the fulcrum than the output force is, the output force is greater than the input force, and the ideal mechanical advantage is greater than 1. This always occurs with second-class levers and may occur with first-class levers. • When the input force is applied closer to the fulcrum than the output force is, the output force is less than the input force, and the ideal mechanical advantage is less than 1. This always occurs with third-class levers and may occur with first-class levers. • When the input and output forces are the same distance from the fulcrum, the output force equals the input force, and the ideal mechanical advantage is 1. This occurs only with first some first-class levers. 
Advantage of  Third  Class  Levers 	  You may be wondering why you would use a third-class lever when it doesn’t change the direction or strength of the applied force. The advantage of a third-class lever is that the output force is applied over a greater distance than the input force. The output end of the lever must move faster than the input end in order to cover the greater distance. Q: A broom is a third-class lever when it is used to sweep a floor (see the Figure 4.90), so the output end of the lever moves faster than the input end. Why is this useful? A: By moving more quickly over the floor, the broom does the work faster. 
Summary 	  • A lever is a simple machine consisting of a bar that rotates around a fixed point called the fulcrum. • Based on the location of the input and output forces relative to the fulcrum, there are three basic types of levers: first-class, second-class, and third-class levers. The classes differ in their mechanical advantage and whether they change the direction of the input force. At the following URL, review the three classes of levers and study the animations. Then click on and complete the worksheet. URL applied? screwdriver change the force that is applied to it? What is its ideal mechanical advantage? • Describe the simple machine known as a wheel and axle. • Relate the mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle to how the machine is used. Did you ever ride on a Ferris wheel like this one? If you did, then you know how thrilling the ride can be. The faster it goes, the more exciting it is. A Ferris wheel is an example of a machine called a wheel and axle. 
Round and  Round  It  Goes 	  A wheel and axle is a simple machine that consists of two connected rings or cylinders, one inside the other. Both rings or cylinders turn in the same direction around a single center point. The inner ring or cylinder is called the axle, and the outer one is called the wheel. Besides the Ferris wheel, the doorknob in the Figure 4.91 is another example of a wheel and axle. For more examples, go to this URL: URL In a wheel and axle, force may be applied either to the wheel or to the axle. This force is called the input force. A wheel and axle does not change the direction of the input force. However, the force put out by the machine, called the output force, is either greater than the input force or else applied over a greater distance. Q: Where is the force applied in a Ferris wheel and a doorknob? Is it applied to the wheel or to the axle? A: In a Ferris wheel, the force is applied to the axle by the Ferris wheel’s motor. In a doorknob, the force is applied to the wheel by a person’s hand. 
Mechanical  Advantage of a  Wheel and  Axle 	  The mechanical advantage of a machine is the factor by which the machine changes the input force. It equals the ratio of the output force to the input force. A wheel and axle may either increase or decrease the input force, depending on whether the input force is applied to the axle or the wheel. • When the input force is applied to the axle, as it is with a Ferris wheel, the wheel turns with less force. Because the output force is less than the input force, the mechanical advantage is less than 1. However, the wheel turns over a greater distance, so it turns faster than the axle. The speed of the wheel is one reason that the Ferris wheel ride is so exciting. • When the input force is applied to the wheel, as it is with a doorknob, the axle turns over a shorter distance but with greater force, so the mechanical advantage is greater than 1. This allows you to turn the doorknob with relatively little effort, while the axle of the doorknob applies enough force to slide the bar into or out of the doorframe. At the following URL, you can see how much a wheel and axle increases the input force when it is applied to the wheel. URL 
Summary 	  • A wheel and axle is a simple machine that consists of two connected rings or cylinders, one inside the other, which both turn in the same direction around a single center point. • A wheel and axle may either increase or decrease the input force, depending on whether the input force is applied to the axle or the wheel. Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle may be greater than Read about wheels and axles at the following URL, and then answer the questions below. URL the axle? What is the mechanical advantage of the bicycle wheel and axle? • Describe the simple machine called a pulley. • Compare and contrast the three basic types of pulleys. • Explain how to determine the ideal mechanical advantage of a pulley. This rusty iron wheel has a rope wrapped around it. The wheel and rope hang over a building. Together they make up a type of machine called a pulley. What Is a Pulley? A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a rope and grooved wheel. The rope fits into the groove in the wheel, and pulling on the rope turns the wheel. Pulleys are generally used to lift objects, especially heavy objects. The object lifted by a pulley is called the load. The force applied to the pulley is called the effort. Q: Can you guess what the pulley pictured above is used for? A: The pulley is used to lift heavy buckets full of water out of the well. 
Types of  Pulleys 	  Some pulleys are attached to a beam or other secure surface and remain fixed in place. They are called fixed pulleys. Other pulleys are attached to the object being moved and are moveable themselves. They are called moveable pulleys. Sometimes, fixed and moveable pulleys are used together. They make up a compound pulley. The three types of pulleys are compared in the Table 4.4. You can experiment with an interactive animation of compound pulleys with various numbers of pulleys at this link: URL Q: Which type of pulley is the old pulley in the opening image?

Mechanical  Advantage of  Pulleys 	  The mechanical advantage of a simple machine such as a pulley is the factor by which the machine changes the force applied to it. The ideal mechanical advantage of a machine is its mechanical advantage in the absence of friction. All machines must overcome friction, so the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. In a pulley, the ideal mechanical advantage is equal to the number of rope segments pulling up on the object. The more rope segments that are helping to do the lifting work, the less force that is needed for the job. Look at the table of types of pulleys. It gives the ideal mechanical advantage of each type. • In the single fixed pulley, only one rope segment pulls up on the load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is 1. In other words, this type of pulley doesn’t increase the force that is applied to it. However, it does change the direction of the force. This allows you to use your weight to pull on one end of the rope and more easily raise the load attached to the other end. • In the single moveable pulley, two rope segments pull up on the load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is 2. This type of pulley doesn’t change the direction of the force applied to it, but it increases the force by a factor of 2. • In a compound pulley, two or more rope segments pull up on the load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is depends on the number and arrangement of pulleys—but the increase in force may be great. To learn more about the mechanical advantage of different types of pulleys, watch the video at this link: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: If a compound pulley has four rope segments pulling up on the load, by what factor does it multiply the force applied to the pulley? A: With four rope segments, the ideal mechanical advantage is 4. This means that the compound pulley multiplies the force applied to it by a factor of 4. For example if 400 Newtons of force were applied to the pulley, the pulley would apply 1600 Newtons of force to the load. 
Summary 	  • A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a rope wrapped around a grooved wheel. Pulleys are generally used to lift a load. • There are three types of pulleys: fixed pulleys, moveable pulleys, and compound pulleys. Compound pulleys consist of two or more fixed and moveable pulleys. • The ideal mechanical advantage of a pulley equals the number of rope segments pulling up on the load.

A bicycle consists of many simple machines. It’s an example of a compound machine. Q: What simple machines can you identify in the bicycle parts pictured above? A: Find out if you are right at the following URL. Click on the parts of the bicycle in the animation to find the simple machines. URL What Is a Compound Machine? A compound machine is a machine that consists of more than one simple machine. Some compound machines consist of just two simple machines. You can read below about two examples—the wheelbarrow and corkscrew. Other compound machines, such as bicycles, consist of many simple machines. Big compound machines such as cars may consist of hundreds or even thousands of simple machines. You can see a student’s compound machine invention that includes several simple machines at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Wheelbarrow 	  Look at the wheelbarrow in the Figure 4.92. It is used to carry heavy objects. It consists of two simple machines: a lever and a wheel and axle. Effort is applied to the lever by picking up the handles of the wheelbarrow. The lever, in turn, applies upward force to the load. The force is increased by the lever, making the load easier to lift. Effort is applied to the wheel of the wheelbarrow by pushing it over the ground. The rolling wheel turns the axle and increases the force, making it easier to push the load. 
Corkscrew 	  The corkscrew in the Figure 4.93 is also a compound machine. It is used to pierce a cork and pull it out of the neck of a bottle. It consists of a screw and two levers. Turning the handle on top twists the screw down into the center of the cork. Then, pushing down on the two levers causes the screw to pull upward, bringing the cork with it. The levers increase the force and change its direction. 
Efficiency of  Compound  Machines 	  Friction is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. All machines have moving parts and friction, so they have to use some of the work that is applied to them to overcome friction. This makes all machines less than 100 percent efficient. Because compound machines have more moving parts than simple machines, they generally have more friction to overcome. As a result, compound machines tend to have lower efficiency than simple machines. When a compound machine consists of many simple machines, friction can become a serious problem, and it may produce a lot of heat. Lubricants such as oil or grease may be used to coat the moving parts of a machine so they slide over each other more easily. This is how friction is reduced in a car engine. 
Mechanical  Advantage of  Compound  Machines 	  The mechanical advantage of a machine is the factor by which it changes the force applied to the machine. Many machines increase the force applied to them, and this is how they make work easier. Compound machines tend to have a greater mechanical advantage than simple machines. That’s because the mechanical advantage of a compound machine equals the product of the mechanical advantages of all its component simple machines. The greater the number of simple machines it contains, the greater its mechanical advantage tends to be. Q: Assume that the lever and the wheel and axle of a wheelbarrow each have a mechanical advantage of 2. What is the mechanical advantage of the wheelbarrow? A: The mechanical advantage of the wheelbarrow is the product of the mechanical advantage of the lever (2) and the mechanical advantage of the wheel and axle (2). Therefore, the wheelbarrow has a mechanical advantage of 4. 
Summary 	  • A compound machine is a machine that consists of more than one simple machine. • Compound machines such as a wheelbarrow or corkscrew consist of just two simple machines. Big compound machines such as cars consist of hundreds or thousands of simple machines. • Compared with simple machines, compound machines generally have lower efficiency but greater mechanical advantage.

Introduction 	  The surfer in this photo is dwarfed by the immense wave he’s riding, yet he’s managing to use the incredible energy of the wave for a thrilling ride. Ocean waves like this one carry a huge amount of energy. Do you know what energy is? Can you identify other forms of energy besides ocean waves? In this unit, you’ll learn a lot about energy, including how it makes modern life possible—even if you never ride a surfboard! • Explain the source of chemical energy. • Describe ways chemical energy is generated and used. What are some types of chemical reactions? Some chemistry reactions can be very calm and boring, while other reactions release a great deal of energy. Dynamite is a chemical that can explode violently. Here we see dynamite being used to move boulders to clear a path for a road. The chemical reactions involved here release tremendous amounts of energy very quickly. Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1866. Nitroglycerin, a very unstable explosive, was already known. Nobel mixed the nitroglycerin with silica to stabilize it and form a solid material. He made a fortune with this discovery and established the Nobel Foundation, which funds the Nobel Prizes every year. 
Energy in  Chemical  Bonds 	  Chemical reactions either require energy or release energy. The amount of energy needed or released depends upon the structure of the molecules that are involved in the reaction. Some reactions need to be heated for long periods of time in order for change to take place. Other reactions release energy, allowing heat to be given off to the surroundings. This energy can be used in a variety of ways. 
Heating 	  Coal, natural gas, oil – these materials can be burned to produce heat. The reaction with oxygen releases a great deal of energy that can warm homes and offices. Wood is another example of a chemical (yes, a very complicated one) that will release energy when burned. 
Transportation 	  A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up. Rocket launch. 
Batteries 	  A major source of energy produced by chemical reactions involves batteries. There are many types of batteries that operate using a variety of chemical reactions. The general principle behind these reactions is the release of electrons that can then flow through a circuit, producing an electrical current. Car battery. Batteries are used in a wide variety of applications: Batteries in cars, computers, cell phones, and other devices are usually rechargeable. An electric current is passed through the battery to provide electrons that reverse (at least partially) the chemical reactions originally used to create the electric current. However, eventually the system can no longer be recharged and the battery has to be discarded. 
Hand- Warmers 	  Hikers, campers, and other outdoor folks take advantage of chemical reactions to keep their hands warm. Small containers of chemicals can undergo reaction to generate heat that can be used to avoid frostbite. Some products contain iron filings that will react with air to release thermal energy. These types of warmer cannot be reused. Other systems rely on heat being released when certain chemicals crystallize. If the warmer is placed in very hot water after use, the system can be regenerated. 
Summary 	  • Some chemical reactions release energy. • This energy can be used in a variety of ways. Use the link below to answer the following questions: • Chemical Energy at URL • energy: The ability to perform work. • chemical reaction: Chemical reactions either require energy or release energy. The amount of energy needed or released depends upon the structure of the molecules that are involved in the reaction. • Define kinetic energy. • Show how to calculate the kinetic energy of a moving object. What could these four photos possibly have in common? Can you guess what it is? All of them show things that have kinetic energy. 
Defining  Kinetic  Energy 	  Kinetic energy is the energy of moving matter. Anything that is moving has kinetic energy—from atoms in matter to stars in outer space. Things with kinetic energy can do work. For example, the spinning saw blade in the photo above is doing the work of cutting through a piece of metal. 
Calculating  Kinetic  Energy 	  The amount of kinetic energy in a moving object depends directly on its mass and velocity. An object with greater mass or greater velocity has more kinetic energy. You can calculate the kinetic energy of a moving object with this equation: 
Kinetic  Energy ( E) = 1 	  This equation shows that an increase in velocity increases kinetic energy more than an increase in mass. If mass doubles, kinetic energy doubles as well, but if velocity doubles, kinetic energy increases by a factor of four. That’s because velocity is squared in the equation. Let’s consider an example. The Figure 5.3 shows Juan running on the beach with his dad. Juan has a mass of 40 kg and is running at a velocity of 1 m/s. How much kinetic energy does he have? Substitute these values for mass and velocity into the equation for kinetic energy: 
E = 1 	  Notice that the answer is given in joules (J), or N • m, which is the SI unit for energy. One joule is the amount of energy needed to apply a force of 1 Newton over a distance of 1 meter. s2 = 20 N· m, or 20 J s )2 = 20 kg× m2 s )2 = 40 kg× m2 What about Juan’s dad? His mass 80 kg, and he’s running at the same velocity as Juan (1 m/s). Because his mass is twice as great as Juan’s, his kinetic energy is twice as great: s2 = 40 N· m, or 40 J 
E = 1 	  Q: What is Juan’s kinetic energy if he speeds up to 2 m/s from 1 m/s? A: By doubling his velocity, Juan increases his kinetic energy by a factor of four: 
E = 1 	  deo/faddf7cb14ade293baad/ s2 = 80 N· m, or 80 J s )2 = 80 kg× m2 
Summary 	  • Kinetic energy (KE) is the energy of moving matter. Anything that is moving has kinetic energy. • The amount of kinetic energy in a moving object depends directly on its mass and velocity.

This diver has just jumped up from the end of the diving board. After she dives down and is falling toward the water, she’ll have kinetic energy, or the energy of moving matter. But even as she is momentarily stopped high above the water, she has energy. Do you know why? 
Stored  Energy 	  The diver has energy because of her position high above the pool. The type of energy she has is called potential energy. Potential energy is energy that is stored in a person or object. Often, the person or object has potential energy because of its position or shape. Q: What is it about the diver’s position that gives her potential energy? A: Because the diver is high above the water, she has the potential to fall toward Earth because of gravity. This gives her potential energy. 
Gravitational  Potential  Energy 	  Potential energy due to the position of an object above Earth’s surface is called gravitational potential energy. Like the diver on the diving board, anything that is raised up above Earth’s surface has the potential to fall because of gravity. You can see another example of people with gravitational potential energy in the Figure 5.5. You can also watch a cartoon introduction to gravitational potential energy by playing video #10 at this URL: URL tedscience.co.uk/flv/ Gravitational potential energy depends on an object’s weight and its height above the ground. It can be calculated with the equation: 
Gravitational potential energy ( E) = weight × height 	  Consider the little girl on the sled, pictured in the Figure 5.5. She weighs 140 Newtons, and the top of the hill is 4 meters higher than the bottom of the hill. As she sits at the top of the hill, the child’s gravitational potential energy is: GPE = 140 N × 4 m = 560 N • m Notice that the answer is given in Newton • meters (N • m), which is the SI unit for energy. A Newton • meter is the energy needed to move a weight of 1 Newton over a distance of 1 meter. A Newton • meter is also called a joule (J). Q: The gymnast on the balance beam pictured in the Figure 5.5 weighs 360 Newtons. If the balance beam is 1.2 meters above the ground, what is the gymnast’s gravitational potential energy? A: Her gravitational potential energy is: GPE = 360 N × 1.2 m = 432 N • m, or 432 J 
Elastic  Potential  Energy 	  Potential energy due to an object’s shape is called elastic potential energy. This energy results when an elastic object is stretched or compressed. The farther the object is stretched or compressed, the greater its potential energy is. A point will be reached when the object can’t be stretched or compressed any more. Then it will forcefully return to its original shape. Look at the pogo stick in the Figure 5.6. Its spring has elastic potential energy when it is pressed down by the boy’s weight. When it can’t be compressed any more, it will spring back to its original shape. The energy it releases will push the pogo stick—and the boy—off the ground. You can see how a pogo stick spring compresses and then returns to its original shape in the animation at this URL: URL Q: The girl in the Figure 5.7 is giving the elastic band of her slingshot potential energy by stretching it. She’s holding a small stone against the stretched band. What will happen when she releases the band? A: The elastic band will spring back to its original shape. When that happens, watch out! Some of the band’s elastic potential energy will be transferred to the stone, which will go flying through the air. 
Other  Forms of  Potential  Energy 	  All of the examples of potential energy described above involve movement or the potential to move. The form of energy that involves movement is called mechanical energy. Other forms of energy also involve potential energy, including chemical energy and nuclear energy. Chemical energy is stored in the bonds between the atoms of compounds. For example, food and batteries both contain chemical energy. Nuclear energy is stored in the nuclei of atoms because of the strong forces that hold the nucleus together. Nuclei of radioactive elements such as uranium are unstable, so they break apart and release the stored energy. 
Summary 	  • Potential energy is energy that is stored in a person or object. • Gravitational potential energy is due to the position of an object above Earth’s surface. The object has the potential to fall due to gravity. Gravitational potential energy depends on an object’s weight and its height above the ground (GPE = weight x height). • Elastic potential energy is due to an object’s shape. It results when an elastic object is stretched or compressed. The more it is stretched or compressed, the greater its elastic potential energy is. • Chemical energy and nuclear energy are other forms of potential energy. Do the animation at the following URL, and then answer the questions below. URL potential energy greater? the ground. What is the diver’s gravitational potential energy? • Identify and describe different forms of energy. This musician’s electric guitar wails at a concert, as colored lights wash over the band. It’s hot on stage because of the lights, but they really add to the show. The fans are thrilled and screaming with excitement. The exciting concert wouldn’t be possible without several different forms of energy. Do you know what they are? 
Introducing  Forms of  Energy 	  Energy, or the ability to cause changes in matter, can exist in many different forms. Energy can also change from one form to another. The photo above of the guitar player represents six forms of energy: mechanical, chemical, electrical, light, thermal, and sound energy. Another form of energy is nuclear energy. For an introduction to all of these forms of energy, watch this video: URL (8:25). Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: Can you find the six different forms of energy in the photo of the guitar player (See opening image)? A: The guitarist uses mechanical energy to pluck the strings of the guitar. He gets the energy he needs to perform from chemical energy in food he ate earlier in the day. The stage lights use electrical energy, which they change to light energy and thermal energy (commonly called heat). The guitar produces sound energy when the guitarist plucks the strings. 
Seven  Forms of  Energy 	  The different forms of energy are defined and illustrated below. For an interactive animation about different forms of energy, visit this URL: URL . move. 
This drummer has mechanical energy as 	  he moves the drumsticks to hit the drums and cymbals. 
The moving drumsticks 	  also have mechanical energy, but they would have mechanical energy even if they weren’t moving. That’s because they have the potential to fall when the drummer is holding them above the floor. This potential energy is due to gravity. the energy is released and can be converted to other forms of energy. 
This portable guitar amplifier can run on 	  batteries. Batteries store chemical energy and change it to electrical energy. the stage in the Figure 5.10 is one type of electromagnetic energy. Other types include radio waves, microwaves, X rays, and gamma rays. matter are constantly moving. An object with more mass has greater thermal energy than an object with less mass because it has more atoms. The bright lights on this stage use electrical energy. They are wired into the electrical system of the of the hall. The guitars and microphone also use electrical energy. You can see the electrical cords running from them to the outlet on the floor below the musicians. 
Why is this jogger sweating so much?  His 	  sweat is soaking up his shirt because he has so much thermal energy. Jogging is hot work because of the heat from the sun and the hard work he puts into his run. starts with vibrations of his vocal cords, which are folds of tissue in his throat. The vibrations pass to surrounding particles of matter and then from one particle to another in waves. Sound waves can travel through air, water, and other substances, but not through empty space. together. The energy can be released in nuclear power plants by splitting nuclei apart. It is also released when unstable (radioactive) nuclei break down, or decay. Q: The fans at a rock concert also produce or use several forms of energy. What are they? A: The fans see the concert because of electromagnetic energy (light) that enters their eyes from the well-lit musicians on stage. They hear the music because of the sound energy that reaches their ears from the amplifiers. They use mechanical energy when they clap their hands and jump from their seats in excitement. Their bodies generate thermal energy, using the chemical energy stored in food they have eaten. 
Summary 	  • Energy, or the ability to cause changes in matter, can exist in many different forms. Energy can also change from one form to another. • Forms of energy include mechanical, chemical, electrical, electromagnetic, thermal, sound, and nuclear energy. Check your knowledge of forms of energy with the game at this URL: URL hView.cfm?guidAssetId=85592183-A6EE-42A8-8CFC-201BDE51DF1A%26skin=siemens article. Include an example of each form. • Define energy conversion. • Give examples of energy changing from one form to another. • Describe energy changes between kinetic and potential energy. Sari and Daniel are spending a stormy Saturday afternoon with cartons of hot popcorn and a spellbinding movie. They are obviously too focused on the movie to wonder where all the energy comes from to power their weekend entertainment. They’ll give it some thought halfway through the movie when the storm causes the power to go out! 
Changing  Energy 	  Watching movies, eating hot popcorn, and many other activities depend on electrical energy. Most electrical energy comes from the burning of fossil fuels, which contain stored chemical energy. When fossil fuels are burned, the chemical energy changes to thermal energy and the thermal energy is then used to generate electrical energy. These are all examples of energy conversion. Energy conversion is the process in which one kind of energy changes into another kind. When energy changes in this way, the energy isn’t used up or lost. The same amount of energy exists after the conversion as before. Energy conversion obeys the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. 
How  Energy  Changes  Form 	  Besides electrical, chemical, and thermal energy, some other forms of energy include mechanical and sound energy. Any of these forms of energy can change into any other form. Often, one form of energy changes into two or more different forms. For example, the popcorn machine below changes electrical energy to thermal energy. The thermal energy, in turn, changes to both mechanical energy and sound energy. You can read the Figure 5.13 how these changes happen. You can see other examples of energy changing form at this URL: URL ychangeex.html trical to thermal energy, which heats the popcorn. 2. The heat causes the popcorn to pop. You can see that the popping corn has mechanical energy (energy of movement). It overflows the pot and falls into the pile of popcorn at the bottom of the machine. 3. The popping corn also has energy. That’s why it makes popping sounds. 
Kinetic- Potential  Energy  Changes 	  Mechanical energy commonly changes between kinetic and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of moving objects. Potential energy is energy that is stored in objects, typically because of their position or shape. Kinetic energy can be used to change the position or shape of an object, giving it potential energy. Potential energy gives the object the potential to move. If it does, the potential energy changes back to kinetic energy. That’s what happened to Sari. After she and Daniel left the theater, the storm cleared and they went for a swim. That’s Sari in the Figure 5.14 coming down the water slide. When she was at the top of the slide, she had potential energy. Why? She had the potential to slide into the water because of the pull of gravity. As she moved down the slide, her potential energy changed to kinetic energy. By the time she reached the water, all the potential energy had changed to kinetic energy. Q: How could Sari regain her potential energy? A: Sari could climb up the steps to the top of the slide. It takes kinetic energy to climb the steps, and this energy would be stored in Sari as she climbed. By the time she got to the top of the slide, she would have the same amount of potential energy as before. A roller coaster is another fun example of changes between kinetic and potential energy. Watch the roller coaster animation at the URL below to see the energy changes. Notice how the roller coaster’s total energy (kinetic energy + potential energy) does not change. URL my_co.uk.us.en/mechanics_forces_gravitation_energy_interactive/energy_potental_kinetic_mechanical.htm Q: Can you think of other fun examples of energy changing between kinetic and potential energy? A: Playground equipment such as swings, slides, and trampolines involve these changes. 
Summary 	  • Energy conversion is the process in which energy changes from one form or type to another. Energy is always conserved in energy conversions. • Different forms of energy—such as electrical, chemical, and thermal energy—often change to other forms of energy. • Mechanical energy commonly changes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy. You can check your understanding of how energy changes form by doing the quizzes at these URLs: • URL • URL trampoline. Include a sketch to help explain the energy conversions. • Define nonrenewable resource. • Identify nonrenewable energy resources. • State drawbacks of using nonrenewable energy resources. It may look beautiful, but this oil slick threatens the environment and living things. Unfortunately, oil spills are common because we rely heavily on oil as an energy resource. Oil is an example of a nonrenewable resource. What Are Nonrenewable Resources? Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that are limited in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up. A natural resource is anything people can use that comes from nature. Energy resources are some of the most important natural resources because everything we do requires energy. Nonrenewable energy resources include fossil fuels such as oil and the radioactive element uranium. 
Types of  Fossil  Fuels 	  Oil, or petroleum, is one of several fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are mixtures of hydrocarbons (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon) that formed over millions of years from the remains of dead organisms. In addition to oil, they include coal and natural gas. Fossil fuels provide most of the energy used in the world today. They are burned in power plants to produce electrical energy, and they also fuel cars, heat homes, and supply energy for many other purposes. You can see some ways they are used in the Figure 5.15. For a more detailed introduction to fossil fuels, go to this URL: URL Q: Why do fossil fuels have energy? A: Fossil fuels contain stored chemical energy that came originally from the sun. 
How  Fossil  Fuels  Formed 	  When ancient plants underwent photosynthesis, they changed energy in sunlight to stored chemical energy in food. The plants used the food and so did the organisms that ate the plants. After the plants and other organisms died, their remains gradually changed to fossil fuels as they were covered and compressed by layers of sediments. Petroleum and natural gas formed from ocean organisms and are found together. Coal formed from giant tree ferns and other swamp plants. 
Fossil  Fuels and the  Environment 	  When fossil fuels burn, they release thermal energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. The thermal energy can be used to generate electricity or do other work. The carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere and is a major cause of global climate change. The burning of fossil fuels also releases many pollutants into the air. Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide form acid rain, which kills living things and damages metals, stonework, and other materials. Pollutants such as nitrogen oxides cause smog, which is harmful to human health. Tiny particles, or particulates, released when fossil fuels burn also harm human health. The Figure 5.16 shows the amounts of pollutants released by different fossil fuels. Natural gas releases the least pollution; coal releases the most. Petroleum has the additional risk of oil spills, which may seriously damage ecosystems. To learn about other ways that our dependence on fossil fuels damages the environment and threatens human life, watch the video at this URL: URL Q: Some newer models of cars and other motor vehicles can run on natural gas. Why would a natural gas vehicle be better for the environment than a vehicle that burns gasoline, which is made from oil? A: Natural gas produces much less pollution and carbon dioxide when it burns than gasoline does. So a natural gas vehicle would contribute less to global climate change, acid rain, and air pollution that harms health. Besides being better for the environment, burning natural gas instead of gasoline results in less engine wear and provides more energy for a given amount of fuel. 
Nuclear  Energy 	  Like fossil fuels, the radioactive element uranium can be used to generate electrical energy in power plants. This source of energy is known as nuclear energy. In a nuclear power plant, the nuclei of uranium atoms are split apart into smaller nuclei in the process of nuclear fission. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy from just a small amount of uranium. The total supply of uranium in the world is quite limited, however, and cannot be replaced once it is used up. That’s why nuclear energy is a nonrenewable resource. The use of nuclear energy also produces dangerous radioactive wastes. In addition, accidents at nuclear power plants have the potential to release large amounts of harmful radiation into the environment. Q: Why is nuclear energy often considered to be “greener” than energy from fossil fuels? A: Unlike energy from fossil fuels, nuclear energy doesn’t produce air pollution or carbon dioxide that contributes to global climate change. 
Summary 	  • Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that are limited in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up. Nonrenewable energy resources include fossil fuels and uranium. • Fossil fuels—including oil, natural gas, and coal—provide most of the energy used in the world today. Burning fossil fuels produces air pollution as well as carbon dioxide that causes global climate change. • Nuclear energy is produced by splitting the nuclei of radioactive uranium. This doesn’t release air pollution or carbon dioxide, but it does produce dangerous radioactive wastes. At the following URL, do the word search puzzle for nonrenewable energy resources. URL cience/words/games/word_search888.html • Define renewable resource. • Describe several renewable energy resources. Acre upon acre of wind turbines stretch over the landscape in this photo. The blades of the turbines spin in the wind like giant pinwheels. The energy of the moving blades is used to generate useful electrical energy. Wind is one of several renewable energy resources. Q: What are some other renewable energy resources? A: You can read about the major renewable energy resources in this article. But here’s a hint in advance. Renewable energy resources include mechanical, electromagnetic, chemical, and thermal forms of energy. What Are Renewable Resources? Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limitless in supply. In addition to wind, renewable energy resources include sunlight, moving water, biomass, and geothermal energy. All of these resources are freely available and won’t run out. Most of them also have the advantage of producing little if any pollution or carbon dioxide, which contributes to global climate change. Nonetheless, these energy resources are used far less than nonrenewable energy resources, especially fossil fuels. You can see where renewable energy resources are used in the U.S., as well as learn more about them, at this URL: URL 
Wind 	  Wind is moving air, so it has mechanical energy that can do work. People have been using wind for energy for thousands of years. The old-fashioned windmill in the Figure 5.17 is one way that wind energy can be used. The wind turbines in the opening photo above are a much newer way of using wind energy. They change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy. However, only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind to produce much electricity. Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy, dangerous to birds, and unattractive in the landscape. At the URL below, you can watch a video about the development of wind energy in China, which aims to become a world leader in renewable energy production. URL This old windmill uses wind energy to operate a mechanical pump that lifts water out of a well. Windmills like this one have been used for centuries. Q: Where does the energy of the wind come from? Why does air move in the atmosphere? A: Wind is caused by unequal heating of the atmosphere by the sun. In other words, differences in thermal energy cause air to move in the atmosphere. 
Sunlight 	  The sunlight that reaches Earth is the planet’s most important source of energy. The energy in sunlight, called solar energy, is electromagnetic energy. This is a form of energy that travels through space in electric and magnetic waves. Solar energy can be used to heat homes and produce electricity in solar cells like those on the roof seen in the Figure that are often cloudy. Q: In addition to the roofs of homes and other buildings, where else can you find solar cells? A: Calculators often have solar cells. Solar-powered outdoor lights are very common as well. 
Moving  Water 	  The mechanical energy of rapidly flowing water can turn a turbine and generate electricity. Electricity produced in this way is called hydroelectric power. The water may flow over a waterfall or through a dam. You can see a picture of a dam in the Figure 5.19. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream from the dam and reduce water flow downstream from the dam, and this can destroy ecosystems. At the following URL, you can learn more about hydroelectric power and see an animation of a hydroelectric power plant. URL 
Solar panels on the roof of this family 	  home generate enough electricity to supply the family’s needs. 
This is  Hoover dam on the  Colorado  River 	  between Arizona and Nevada. Water flowing through the dam generates electricity for both of these states and southern California. Q: Does a hydroelectric power plant release air pollution or carbon dioxide? Why or why not. A: No, it is doesn’t. A hydroelectric plant doesn’t burn fuel, which is what produces air pollution in power plants that generate electricity from fossil fuels or biomass. 
Biomass 	  The stored chemical energy in organic matter or wastes is called biomass energy. The organic matter may be trees or other plants, or it may be wastes from homes and industries. When biomass is burned, it produces thermal energy that can be used for heating homes, cooking, or generating electricity. Biomass—especially wood—is an important energy source in the poorer nations where most people can’t afford fossil fuels. However, burning biomass releases air pollution and contributes to global climate change. Biomass can be used to make ethanol, a fuel that is added to gasoline. Although ethanol releases less pollution than gasoline, large areas of land are needed to grow the plants needed to make it (see Figure 5.20). This reduces the amount of land available for food production. 
This large machine is harvesting and 	  grinding plants to make ethanol. 
Geothermal  Energy 	  Geothermal energy is thermal (“heat”) energy from below Earth’s surface. It can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. A geothermal system pumps water underground where it is heated and then pumps the warm water back to the home or power plant (see Figure 5.21). The thermal energy of the water can be used directly to heat the home. Or it can be used to produce steam and generate electricity. Installing a geothermal system can be expensive because of the need to drill through underground rocks, but the energy it uses is free. This power plant uses geothermal energy. 
Summary 	  • Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limitless in supply. • Renewable energy resources include wind, sunlight, moving water, biomass, and geothermal energy. Except for biomass, which is burned, these renewable energy resources produce little if any pollution, although each has other drawbacks.

Based on your research, make a list of main points about the energy source you chose. URL • Describe energy use in the U.S. • Compare oil use in the U.S. and other top oil-using nations. This woman in Burkina Faso uses a simple wood fire for cooking. For many people in the world, wood is their main energy resource. They burn it to stay warm as well as to cook their food. Other energy resources, such as oil or gas, are simply not available to them or are far too expensive for most people to use. However, if you live in the U.S. or another of the richer nations of the world, you probably depend almost totally on these more expensive energy resources, especially oil. 
Use of  Energy  Resources 	  Look at the circle graph in the Figure 5.22. It shows that oil is the single most commonly used energy resource in the U.S., followed by natural gas, and then by coal. All of these energy resources are nonrenewable. Nonrenewable resources are resources that are limited in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up. Renewable resources, in contrast, provide only 8 percent of all energy used in the U.S. Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limitless in supply. They include solar energy from sunlight, geothermal energy from under Earth’s surface, wind, biomass (from once-living things or their wastes), and hydropower (from running water). 
Oil  Use by  Nation 	  People in the U.S. use far more energy—especially energy from oil—than people in any other nation. The bar graph in the Figure 5.23 compares the amount of oil used by the top ten oil-using nations. The U.S. uses more oil than several other top-ten countries combined. If you also consider the population size in these countries, the differences are even more stunning. The average person in the U.S. uses a whopping 23 barrels of oil a year! In comparison, the average person in India or China uses just 1 or 2 barrels of oil a year. At the following URL, you can explore energy use per person in the U.S. and other countries or regions of the world over the past 50 years. URL dl=en&hl=en&q=energy+use Q: How does the use of oil and other fossil fuels relate to pollution? A: Greater use of oil and other fossil fuels causes more pollution. Q: How do people in the U.S. use all that energy? 
Summary 	  • Oil is the single most commonly used energy resource in the U.S., followed by natural gas, and then by coal. These are all nonrenewable energy resources. Only 8 percent of all energy used in the U.S. comes from renewable energy resources, such as solar, wind, and biomass energy. • People in the U.S. use far more energy per person—especially energy from oil—than people in any other nation.

It’s a concept car that was developed by a major automaker. Instead of burning gasoline, it runs on hydrogen gas. Using hydrogen for fuel doesn’t produce pollution, and it doesn’t depend on nonrenewable fossil fuels. New technologies like this car may one day help solve our energy resource problems. But even without new technologies such as this, there are many ways we can help solve the problems right now. 
Conserving  Energy 	  Everyone can reduce their use of energy resources and the pollution the resources cause by conserving energy. Conservation means saving resources by using them more efficiently, using less of them, or not using them at all. You can read below about some of the ways you can conserve energy on the road and in the home. You can find more energy-saving tips at this URL: URL 
Conserving  Energy in  Transportation 	  Much of the energy used in the U.S. is used for transportation. You can conserve transportation energy in several ways. For example, you can: • plan ahead to avoid unnecessary trips. • take public transit such as subways (see Figure 5.24) instead of driving. • drive an energy-efficient vehicle when driving is the only way to get there. Q: What are some other ways you could save energy in transportation? A: You could carpool to save transportation energy. Even if you carpool with just one other person, that’s one less vehicle on the road. For short trips, you could ride a bike or walk to you destination. The extra exercise is another benefit of using your own muscle power to get where you need to go. 
Conserving  Energy at  Home 	  Many people waste energy at home, so a lot of energy can be saved there as well. What can you do to conserve energy? You can: • turn off lights and unplug appliances and other electrical devices when not in use. • use energy-efficient light bulbs and appliances. • turn the thermostat down in winter and up in summer.

The temperature of the air near the ground can be as high as 57 °C (134 °F)—and that’s in the shade (if you can find any)! The temperature of the sand in the baking sun can be much higher. If you were to walk barefoot on the hot sand, it would burn your feet. The air and sand in Death Valley have a lot of thermal energy. What Is Thermal Energy? Why do the air and sand of Death Valley feel so hot? It’s because their particles are moving very rapidly. Anything that is moving has kinetic energy, and the faster it is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. The total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter is called thermal energy. It’s not just hot things such as the air and sand of Death Valley that have thermal energy. All matter has thermal energy, even matter that feels cold. That’s because the particles of all matter are in constant motion and have kinetic energy. 
Thermal  Energy,  Temperature, and  Mass 	  Thermal energy and temperature are closely related. Both reflect the kinetic energy of moving particles of matter. However, temperature is the average kinetic energy of particles of matter, whereas thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of particles of matter. Does this mean that matter with a lower temperature has less thermal energy than matter with a higher temperature? Not necessarily. Another factor also affects thermal energy. The other factor is mass. Q: Look at the pot of soup and the tub of water in the Figure 5.27. Which do you think has greater thermal energy? A: The soup is boiling hot and has a temperature of 100 °C, whereas the water in the tub is just comfortably warm, with a temperature of about 38 °C. Although the water in the tub has a much lower temperature, it has greater thermal energy. The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” URL Q: Could a block of ice have more thermal energy than a pot of boiling water? A: Yes, the block of ice could have more thermal energy if its mass was much greater than the mass of the boiling water. 
Summary 	  • The total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter is called thermal energy. • The thermal energy of matter depends on how fast its particles are moving on average, which is measured by temperature, and also on how many particles there are, which is measured by mass. /schools/ks3bitesize/science/energy_electricity_forces/energy_transfer_storage/activity.shtml temperature. • Define temperature. • Explain how temperature is measured and how a thermometer works. • Describe three temperature scales, and show how to convert temperatures from one scale to another. This boy has a fever, and it makes him feel miserable. He feels achy and really tired. He also feels hot because his temperature is higher than normal. He has a thermometer in his mouth to measure his temperature. What Is Temperature? No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. 
How a  Thermometer  Measures  Temperature 	  Many thermometers measure temperature with a liquid that expands when it gets warmer and contracts when it gets cooler. Look at the common household thermometer pictured in the Figure 5.28. The red liquid rises or falls in the glass tube as the temperature changes. Temperature is read off the scale at the height of the liquid in the tube. To learn more about measuring temperature, watch the animation “Measuring Temperature” at this URL: URL ciencehelpdesk.com/unit/science2/3 Q: Why does the liquid in the thermometer expand and contract when temperature changes? A: When the temperature is higher, particles of the liquid have greater kinetic energy, so they move about more and spread apart. This causes the liquid to expand. The opposite happens when the temperature is lower and particles of liquid have less kinetic energy. The particles move less and crowd closer together, causing the liquid to contract. 
Temperature  Scales 	  The thermometer pictured in the Figure 5.28 measures temperature on two different scales: Celsius (C) and Fahrenheit (F). Although some scientists use the Celsius scale, the SI scale for measuring temperature is the Kelvin scale. If you live in the U.S., you are probably most familiar with the Fahrenheit scale. The Table 5.1 compares all three temperature scales. Each scale uses as reference points the freezing and boiling points of water. Notice that temperatures on the Kelvin scale are not given in degrees (°). 
Boiling  Point of  Water 	  Because all three temperature scales are frequently used, it’s useful to know how to convert temperatures from one scale to another. It’s easy to convert temperatures between the Kelvin and Celsius scales. Each 1-degree change on the Kelvin scale is equal to a 1-degree change on the Celsius scale. Therefore, to convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, just add 273 to the Celsius temperature. For example, 10 °C equals 283 Kelvin. Q: How would you convert a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius? A: You would subtract 273 from the Kelvin temperature. For example, a temperature of 300 Kevin equals 27 °C. Converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit is more complicated. The following conversion factors can be used:

To find out, convert the Kelvin temperature to Fahrenheit. (Hint: Convert the Kelvin temperature to Celsius first.) • Define heat. • Explain how thermal energy is transferred. This chef is taking corn bread out of a hot oven. What happened to the batter when it was put in the oven? Did the hot oven add “heat energy” to the batter? Not exactly. Contrary to popular belief, heat is not a form of energy. What Is Heat? Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between substances. Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, measured by their temperature. Thermal energy always moves from matter with greater thermal energy to matter with less thermal energy, so it moves from warmer to cooler substances. You can see this in the Figure 5.29. Faster-moving particles of the warmer substance bump into and transfer some of their energy to slower-moving particles of the cooler substance. Thermal energy is transferred in this way until both substances have the same thermal energy and temperature. For a visual introduction to these concepts, watch the animation “Temperature vs. Heat” at this URL: URL Q: How is thermal energy transferred in an oven? A: Thermal energy of the hot oven is transferred to the cooler food, raising its temperature. 
Cooling  Down by  Heating  Up 	  How do you cool down a glass of room-temperature cola? You probably add ice cubes to it, as in the Figure 5.30. You might think that the ice cools down the cola, but in fact, it works the other way around. The warm cola heats up the ice. Thermal energy from the warm cola is transferred to the much colder ice, causing it to melt. The cola loses thermal energy in the process, so its temperature falls. 
Summary 	  • Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between substances. Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, measured by their temperature. • Thermal energy always moves from warmer to cooler substances until both substances have the same temperature.

This girl and her brother are having fun at the beach. It’s a warm, sunny day, and the sand feels hot on their bare feet. They take a dip in the water whenever they want to cool off because the water feels much cooler than the sand. Why does the sand—but not the water—get hot in the sun? The answer has to do with specific heat. 
Be  Specific 	  Specific heat is a measure of how much energy it takes to raise the temperature of a substance. It is the amount of energy (in joules) needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 °C. Specific heat is a property that is specific to a given type of matter. That’s why it’s called specific. 
Variation in  Specific  Heat 	  The Table 5.2 compares the specific heat of four different substances. Metals such as iron have low specific heat. It doesn’t take much energy to raise their temperature. That’s why a metal spoon heats up quickly when placed in a cup of hot coffee. Sand also has a relatively low specific heat. Water, on the other hand, has a very high specific heat. It takes a lot more energy to increase the temperature of water than sand. This explains why the sand on a beach gets hot while the water stays cool. Differences in the specific heat of water and land even affect climate.

E 5.2:  Specific  Heat 	  Specific Heat (joules) Q: Metal cooking pots and pans often have wooden handles. Can you explain why? A: Wood has a higher specific heat than metal, so it takes more energy to heat a wooden handle than a metal handle. As a result, a wooden handle would heat up more slowly and be less likely to burn your hand when you touch it. 
Summary 	  • Specific heat is a measure of how much energy it takes to raise the temperature of a substance. It is the amount of energy (in joules) needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 °C. • Specific heat is a property that is specific to a given type of matter, and substances vary in their specific heat.

Yummy! These cookies look delicious. But watch out! They just finished baking in a hot oven, so the cookie sheet is too hot to handle without an oven mitt. Touching the cookie sheet with bare hands could cause a painful burn. Do you know why? The answer is conduction. What Is Conduction? Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter that are touching. Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, and the transfer of thermal energy is called heat. Conduction is one of three ways that thermal energy can be transferred (the other ways are convection and thermal radiation). Thermal energy is always transferred from matter with a higher temperature to matter with a lower temperature. 
Pass  It  On 	  To understand how conduction works, you need to think about the tiny particles that make up matter. The particles of all matter are in constant random motion, but the particles of warmer matter have more energy and move more quickly than the particles of cooler matter. When particles of warmer matter collide with particles of cooler matter, they transfer some of their thermal energy to the cooler particles. From particle to particle, like dominoes falling, thermal energy moves through matter. Click on the animation “Conduction” at this URL to see an animation of conduction: URL In the opening photo above, conduction occurs between particles of metal in the cookie sheet and anything cooler that comes into contact with it—hopefully, not someone’s bare hands! For a deeper understanding of this method of heat transfer, watch the animation “Conduction” at this URL: URL 
Examples of  Conduction 	  The cookie sheet in the opening image transfers thermal energy to the cookies and helps them bake. There are many other common examples of conduction. The Figure 5.31 shows a few situations in which thermal energy is transferred in this way. 
Hot  Iron:  A hot iron removes the wrinkles 	  in a shirt. Hot Cocoa: Holding a cup of hot cocoa feels good when you have cold hands. Camp Stove: This camp stove can be used to cook food in a small pot. 
Snow:  Ouch!  Can you imagine how cold 	  this snow must feel on bare feet? Q: How is thermal energy transferred in each of the situations pictured in the Figure 5.31? A: Thermal energy is transferred by conduction from the hot iron to the shirt, from the hot cup to the hand holding it, from the flame of the camp stove to the bottom of the pot as well as from the bottom of the pot to the food inside, and from the feet to the snow. The shirt, hand, pot, food, and snow become warmer because of the transferred energy. Because the feet lose thermal energy, they feel colder. 
Summary 	  • Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter that are touching. Thermal energy is always transferred from particles of warmer matter to particles of cooler matter. • When particles of warmer matter collide with particles of cooler matter, they transfer some of their thermal energy to the cooler particles. Watch the video about conduction at the following URL. Then write a paragraph explaining how conduction is related to state of matter. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Define convection, and explain how it occurs. • Describe convection currents. • Give examples of the transfer of thermal energy by convection. Do you see the water bubbling in this pot? The water is boiling hot. How does all of the water in the pot get hot when it is heated only from the bottom by the gas flame? The answer is convection. 
Defining  Convection 	  Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by particles moving through a fluid (either a gas or a liquid). Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, and the transfer of thermal energy is called heat. Convection is one of three ways that thermal energy can be transferred (the other ways are conduction and thermal radiation). Thermal energy is always transferred from matter with a higher temperature to matter with a lower temperature. How Does Convection Occur? The Figure 5.32 shows how convection occurs, using hot water in a pot as an example. When particles in one area of a fluid (in this case, the water at the bottom of the pot) gain thermal energy, they move more quickly, have more collisions, and spread farther apart. This decreases the density of the particles, so they rise up through the fluid. As they rise, they transfer their thermal energy to other particles of the fluid and cool off in the process. With less energy, the particles move more slowly, have fewer collisions, and move closer together. This increases their density, so they sink back down through the fluid. When they reach the bottom of the fluid, the cycle repeats. The result is a loop of moving particles called a convection current. You can learn more about convection currents by watching the cartoon video called “Convection” at this URL: URL 
Examples of  Convection 	  Convection currents transfer thermal energy through many fluids, not just hot water in a pot. For example, convection currents transfer thermal energy through molten rock below Earth’s surface, through water in the oceans, and through air in the atmosphere. Convection currents in the atmosphere create winds. You can see one way this happens in the land gets warmer during the day and cooler at night than the water does. During the day, warm air rises above the land and cool air from the water moves in to take its place. During the night, the opposite happens. Warm air rises above the water and cool air from the land moves out to take its place. Q: During the day, in which direction is thermal energy of the air transferred? In which direction is it transferred during the night? A: During the day, thermal energy is transferred from the air over the land to the air over the water. During the night, thermal energy is transferred in the opposite direction. 
Summary 	  • Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by particles moving through a fluid. Thermal energy is always transferred from an area with a higher temperature to an area with a lower temperature. • Moving particles transfer thermal energy through a fluid by forming convection currents. • Convection currents move thermal energy through many fluids, including molten rock inside Earth, water in the oceans, and air in the atmosphere.

Label areas of the room that are warm and cool. • Describe how thermal energy is transferred by thermal radiation. • Give examples of thermal radiation. Someone is warming his hands over a bonfire. He doesn’t have to touch the fire to feel its warmth. How is warmth from the fire transferred to his hands? In this article, you’ll find out. 
Introducing  Thermal  Radiation 	  The bonfire from the opening image has a lot of thermal energy. Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, and the transfer of thermal energy is called heat. Thermal energy from the bonfire is transferred to the hands by thermal radiation. Thermal radiation is the transfer of thermal energy by waves that can travel through air or even through empty space, as shown in the Figure 5.35. When the waves of thermal energy reach objects, they transfer the energy to the objects, causing them to warm up. This is how the fire warms the hands of someone sitting near the bonfire. This is also how the sun’s energy reaches Earth and heats its surface. Without the energy radiated from the sun, Earth would be too cold to support life as we know it. Thermal radiation is one of three ways that thermal energy can be transferred. The other two ways are conduction and convection, both of which need matter to transfer energy. Radiation is the only way of transferring thermal energy that doesn’t require matter. To learn more about thermal radiation, watch “Radiation” at the URL below. URL 
Sources of  Thermal  Radiation 	  You might be surprised to learn that everything radiates thermal energy, not just really hot things such as the sun or a fire. For example, when it’s cold outside, a heated home radiates some of its thermal energy into the outdoor environment. A home that is poorly insulated radiates more energy than a home that is well insulated. Special cameras can be used to detect radiated heat. In the Figure 5.36, you can see an image created by one of these cameras. The areas that are yellow are the areas where the greatest amount of thermal energy is radiating from the home. Even people radiate thermal energy. In fact, when a room is full of people, it may feel noticeably warmer because of all the thermal energy the people radiate! Q: Where is thermal radiation radiating from the home in the picture? A: The greatest amount of thermal energy is radiating from the window on the upper left. A lot of thermal energy is also radiating from the edges of the windows and door. 
Summary 	  • Thermal radiation is the transfer of thermal energy by waves that can travel through air or even through empty space. This is how thermal energy from a fire is transferred to your hands and how thermal energy from the sun is transferred to Earth. • Everything radiates thermal energy, even objects that aren’t very warm. Watch the video “Thermal Radiation” at the following URL. Then answer the questions below. URL eyes but you can see them with a night vision camera. Explain why. you. • Define and give examples of thermal conductors. • Describe thermal insulators and ways they are used. Do you like toast? Did you ever look inside a toaster while it’s toasting bread? When you push down the lever to turn on the toaster, the metal heating element inside starts to glow orange or red almost instantly. You can see the glowing heating element inside this yellow toaster. The glowing metal shows that the heating element has become very hot. It gets hot so quickly because metals are good conductors of thermal energy. 
Thermal  Conductors 	  Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter that are touching. Thermal conduction occurs when particles of warmer matter bump into particles of cooler matter and transfer some of their thermal energy to the cooler particles. Conduction is usually faster in certain solids and liquids than in gases. Materials that are good conductors of thermal energy are called thermal conductors. Metals are especially good thermal conductors because they have freely moving electrons that can transfer thermal energy quickly and easily. Besides the heating element inside a toaster, another example of a thermal conductor is a metal radiator, like the one in the Figure 5.37. When hot water flows through the coils of the radiator, the metal quickly heats up by conduction and then radiates thermal energy into the surrounding air. Q: Thermal conductors have many uses, but sometimes it’s important to prevent the transfer of thermal energy. Can you think of an example? A: One example is staying warm on a cold day. You will stay warmer if you can prevent the transfer of your own thermal energy to the outside air. 
Thermal  Insulators 	  One way to retain your own thermal energy on a cold day is to wear clothes that trap air. That’s because air, like other gases, is a poor conductor of thermal energy. The particles of gases are relatively far apart, so they don’t bump into each other or into other things as often as the more closely spaced particles of liquids or solids. Therefore, particles of gases have fewer opportunities to transfer thermal energy. Materials that are poor thermal conductors are called thermal insulators. Down-filled snowsuits, like those in the Figure 5.38, are good thermal insulators because their feather filling traps a lot of air. Another example of a thermal insulator is pictured in the Figure 5.39. The picture shows fluffy pink insulation inside the attic of a home. Like the down filling in a snowsuit, the insulation traps a lot of air. The insulation helps to prevent the transfer of thermal energy into the house on hot days and out of the house on cold days. Other materials that are thermal insulators include plastic and wood. That’s why pot handles and cooking utensils are often made of these materials. Notice that the outside of the toaster pictured in the opening image is made of plastic. The plastic casing helps prevent the transfer of thermal energy from the heating element inside to the outer surface of the toaster where it could cause burns. You can learn more about thermal insulators at this URL: URL ons.com/science/thermal_insulation.htm . Q: Thermal insulators have many practical uses besides the uses mentioned above. Can you think of others? A: Thermal insulators are often used to keep food or drinks hot or cold. For example, Styrofoam® coolers and thermos containers are used for these purposes. With the interactive activity at the following URL, you can test different materials to see how well they prevent the transfer of thermal energy. URL 
Summary 	  • Materials that are good conductors of thermal energy are called thermal conductors. Metals are very good thermal conductors. • Materials that are poor conductors of thermal energy are called thermal insulators. Gases such as air and materials such as plastic and wood are thermal insulators.

A roaring blaze in a fireplace is a good way to keep toes toasty on a cold winter day. But you probably wouldn’t use a fireplace to heat an entire house. Do you know how your home is heated? 
Heating the  Home 	  Modern home heating systems keep us comfortable in cold weather. We may even depend on them for our survival. But we often take them for granted. Two common types of home heating systems are hot-water and warm-air heating systems. Both types are described below. You can watch an animation showing how a solar heating system works at the following URL. URL mations/4e_solar_heating_system.html Thermal energy is the total energy of moving particles of matter. The transfer of thermal energy is called heat. Therefore, a heating system is a system for the transfer of thermal energy. Regardless of the type of heating system in a home, the basic function is the same: to produce thermal energy and transfer it to air throughout the house. 
Hot- Water  Heating  System 	  A hot-water heating system produces thermal energy to heat water and then pumps the hot water throughout the building in a system of pipes and radiators. You can see a simple diagram of this type of heating system in the • Water is heated in a boiler that burns a fuel such as natural gas or heating oil. The boiler converts the chemical energy stored in the fuel to thermal energy. • The heated water is pumped from the boiler through pipes and radiators throughout the house. There is usually a radiator in each room. The radiators get warm when the hot water flows through them. • The warm radiators radiate thermal energy to the air around them. The warm air then circulates throughout the rooms in convection currents. • The hot water cools as it flows through the system and transfers its thermal energy. When it finally returns to the boiler, it is heated again and the cycle repeats. Q: Look closely at the hot-water heating system in the Figure 5.40. The radiator is a coiled pipe through which hot water flows. What happens to the water as it flows through the radiator? Why is each radiator connected to two pipes? Why can’t water flow directly from one radiator to another through a single pipe? A: The radiator is where most of the energy transfer occurs. Water passes through such a great length of pipe in the radiator that it transfers a lot of thermal energy to the radiator. As the water transfers thermal energy, it gets cooler. The cool water flows into a return pipe rather than going directly to another radiator because the cool water no longer has enough thermal energy to heat a room. 
Warm- Air  Heating  System 	  A warm-air heating system uses thermal energy to heat air and then forces the warm air through a system of ducts and registers. You can see a this type of heating system in the Figure 5.41. • The air is heated in a furnace that burns fuel such as natural gas, propane, or heating oil. • After the air gets warm, a fan blows it through the ducts and out through the registers that are located in each room. • Warm air blowing out of a register moves across the room, pushing cold air out of the way. • The cold air enters a return register across the room and returns to the furnace with the help of another fan. • In the furnace, the cold air is heated, and the cycle repeats. Q: How does a home heating system “know” when to run and when to stop running? A: A home heating system is turned on or off by a thermostat. Warm-air heating system. 
How a  Thermostat  Works 	  A thermostat, like the one seen in the Figure 5.42, is an important part of any home heating system. It is like the “brain” of the entire system. It constantly monitors the temperature in the home and “tells” the boiler or furnace when to turn on or off. The thermostat is set at a selected temperature, say 71 °F. When the temperature in the home starts to fall below this point, the thermostat triggers the boiler or furnace to start running. When the temperature starts to rise above this point, the thermostat triggers the boiler or furnace to stop running. In this way, the thermostat maintains the home’s temperature at the set point. 
Summary 	  • Types of home heating systems include hot-water, warm-air, and solar heating systems. All of them have the same basic function: producing thermal energy and transferring it to air throughout the house. • A hot-water heating system burns fuel in a boiler to produce thermal energy. The thermal energy is used to heat water, which is pumped through a system of pipes and radiators. • A warm-air heating system burns fuel in a furnace to produce thermal energy. The thermal energy is used to heat air, which is forced through a system of ducts and registers. • A thermostat controls a home heating system.

Its smooth metal surface is perfect for sticky notes and magnets. In most homes, a refrigerator is one of the hardest working appliances, but not just because it holds messages. Unlike most other home appliances, a refrigerator generally runs nonstop every day of the year. Can you think of another home appliance that gets such constant use? 
Purpose of a  Cooling  System 	  A refrigerator is an example of a cooling system. Another example is an air conditioner. The purpose of any cooling system is to transfer thermal energy in order to keep things cool. A refrigerator, for example, transfers thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator to the warm air in the kitchen. If you’ve ever noticed how warm the back of a running refrigerator gets, then you know that it releases a lot of thermal energy into the room. Q: Thermal energy always moves from a warmer area to a cooler area. How can thermal energy move from the cooler air inside a refrigerator to the warmer air in a room? A: The answer is work. 
How a  Refrigerator  Works 	  A refrigerator must do work to reverse the normal direction of thermal energy flow. Work involves the use of force to move something, and doing work takes energy. In a refrigerator, the energy is usually provided by electricity. You can read in detail in the Figure 5.43 how a refrigerator does its work. For an animation of how a refrigerator works, go to this URL: URL fridge_movie.html 
The  Refrigerant 	  The key to how a refrigerator or other cooling system works is the refrigerant. A refrigerant is a substance such as FreonTM that has a low boiling point and changes between liquid and gaseous states as it passes through the refrigerator. As a liquid, the refrigerant absorbs thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator and changes to a gas. As a gas, it transfers thermal energy to the warm air outside the refrigerator and changes back to a liquid. Work is done by a refrigerator to move the refrigerant through the different components of the refrigerator. 
Summary 	  • The purpose of a cooling system such as a refrigerator or air conditioner is to transfer thermal energy in order to keep things cool. • A refrigerator transfers thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator to the warm air in the kitchen. Thermal energy normally moves from a warmer area to a cooler area, so a refrigerator must do work to reverse the normal direction of heat flow. • The key to how a refrigerator or other cooling system works is the refrigerant.

URL • Identify the purpose of a combustion engine. • Define external combustion engine. • Outline how an external combustion engine works. This picture was taken in 1899 (the color was added later). The picture shows the inventor of an early automobile, along with his wife, driving one of his inventions. The man and woman were on their way to the top of Mount Washington, the highest mountain in the eastern U.S. The purpose of the trip up the mountain was to get publicity for the steam-powered automobile. The inventor and his wife were the first people to ever reach the top of the mountain by car. Steam engines are not used very much anymore, because more efficient and powerful engines have been developed. But inventors and engineers learned a lot from these early combustion engines. Q: How else were steam engines used? A: Starting in the 1700s and up until the early 1900s, steam engines were commonly used to run factory machines, train locomotives, and ships. Their power led to a revolution in industry and transportation. What Is a Combustion Engine? A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the thermal energy to do work. There are two types of combustion engines: external and internal. A steam engine is an external combustion engine. 
How an  External  Combustion  Engine  Works 	  An external combustion engine burns fuel externally, or outside the engine. The burning fuel releases thermal energy, which is used to heat water and change it to steam. The pressure of the steam moves a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. The kinetic energy of the moving piston can be used to turn a vehicle’s wheels, a turbine, or other mechanical device. The Figure 5.44 explains in greater detail how this type of engine works. You can see an animated external combustion engine at this URL: URL /steam1.htm . Q: What type of energy does the piston have when it moves back and forth inside the cylinder? A: Like anything else that is moving, the moving piston has kinetic energy. 
Summary 	  • A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the thermal energy to do work. • An external combustion engine burns fuel externally, or outside the engine. • An external combustion engine burns fuel to heat water and produce steam. The steam is under pressure and is used to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. As the piston moves back and forth, it moves a piston rod, which can do work. Do a Web quest to learn more about steam engines, including when they were invented and how they changed industry and transportation. Make a list of all the other uses of steam engines that you find. Start your Web quest with the following URLs: URL URL URL • Define combustion engine and internal combustion engine. • Explain how an internal combustion engine works. • Describe how kinetic energy from an internal combustion engine is used to turn the wheels of a car. This racecar isn’t really burning up the road. The flames were added to show that the car is zooming down the road at a high rate of speed. A racecar can move so fast because it has a powerful combustion engine. 
Introducing  Combustion  Engines 	  A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the energy to do work. In a car, the engine does the work of providing kinetic energy that turns the wheels. The combustion engine in a car is a type of engine called an internal combustion engine. (Another type of combustion engine is an external combustion engine.) 
How an  Internal  Combustion  Engine  Works 	  An internal combustion engine burns fuel internally, or inside the engine. This type of engine is found not only in cars but in most other motor vehicles as well. The engine works in a series of steps, which keep repeating. You can follow the steps in the Figure 5.45. mixture is now under a lot of pressure and very warm. of the closed cylinder. You can watch animations of internal combustion engines in action at these URLs: URL m/engine1.htm and URL . Q: The internal combustion engine converts thermal energy to another form of energy. Which form of energy is it? A: The engine converts thermal energy to kinetic energy, or the energy of a moving object—in this case, the moving piston. 
How  Energy from the  Engine  Turns the  Wheels 	  In a car, the piston in the engine is connected by the piston rod to the crankshaft. The crankshaft rotates when the piston moves up and down. The crankshaft, in turn, is connected to the driveshaft. When the crankshaft rotates, so does the driveshaft. The rotating driveshaft turns the wheels of the car. How Many Cylinders? Most cars have at least four cylinders connected to the crankshaft. Their pistons move up and down in sequence, one after the other. A powerful car may have eight pistons, and some racecars may have even more. The more cylinders a car engine has, the more powerful its engine can be. 
Summary 	  • A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the energy to do work. An internal combustion engine burns fuel internally, or inside the engine. • In an internal combustion engine, a mixture of fuel and air is burned in a closed cylinder, forcing a piston to move up and down. • In a car, the moving piston rotates a crankshaft, which turns a driveshaft. The turning driveshaft causes the wheels of the car to turn. answer the questions below. URL • Describe mechanical waves. • Define the medium of a mechanical wave. • Identify three types of mechanical waves. No doubt you’ve seen this happen. Droplets of water fall into a body of water, and concentric circles spread out through the water around the droplets. The concentric circles are waves moving through the water. 
Waves in  Matter 	  The waves in the picture above are examples of mechanical waves. A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter that transfers energy through the matter. A mechanical wave starts when matter is disturbed. A source of energy is needed to disturb matter and start a mechanical wave. Q: Where does the energy come from in the water wave pictured above? A: The energy comes from the falling droplets of water, which have kinetic energy because of their motion. 
The  Medium 	  The energy of a mechanical wave can travel only through matter. The matter through which the wave travels is called the medium (plural, media). The medium in the water wave pictured above is water, a liquid. But the medium of a mechanical wave can be any state of matter, even a solid. Q: How do the particles of the medium move when a wave passes through them? A: The particles of the medium just vibrate in place. As they vibrate, they pass the energy of the disturbance to the particles next to them, which pass the energy to the particles next to them, and so on. Particles of the medium don’t actually travel along with the wave. Only the energy of the wave travels through the medium. 
Types of  Mechanical  Waves 	  There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. They differ in how particles of the medium move. You can see this in the Figure 5.46 and in the animation at the following URL. URL cs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/waves/wavemotion.html • In a transverse wave, particles of the medium vibrate up and down perpendicular to the direction of the wave. • In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium vibrate back and forth parallel to the direction of the wave. • In a surface wave, particles of the medium vibrate both up and down and back and forth, so they end up moving in a circle. Q: How do you think surface waves are related to transverse and longitudinal waves? A: A surface wave is combination of a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave. 
Summary 	  • A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter that transfers energy through the matter. • The matter through which a mechanical wave travels is called the medium (plural, media). • There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. They differ in how particles of the medium move when the energy of the wave passes through. At the following URL, read the short introduction to waves and watch the animations. Then answer the questions below. URL • Describe transverse waves. • Identify the crests and troughs of a transverse wave. • Define S waves. Can you guess what this picture shows? Here’s a hint: the objects in the picture have been magnified, and one of them is moving rapidly. The objects are guitar strings, and the moving string is the one on the bottom right. The string is moving because it has just been plucked. Plucking the string gave it energy, which is moving through the string in a mechanical wave. A mechanical wave is a wave that travels through matter. The matter a mechanical wave travels through is called the medium. The type of mechanical wave passing through the vibrating guitar string is a transverse wave. What Is a Transverse Wave? A transverse wave is a wave in which particles of the medium vibrate at right angles, or perpendicular, to the direction that the wave travels. Another example of a transverse wave is the wave that passes through a rope with you shake one end of the rope up and down, as in the Figure 5.47. The direction of the wave is down the length of the rope away from the hand. The rope itself moves up and down as the wave passes through it. You can watch a video of a transverse wave in a rope at this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. To see a transverse wave in slow motion, go to this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: When a guitar string is plucked, in what direction does the wave travel? In what directions does the string vibrate? A: The wave travels down the string to the end. The string vibrates up and down at right angles to the direction of the wave. 
Crests and  Troughs 	  A transverse wave is characterized by the high and low points reached by particles of the medium as the wave passes through. The high points are called crests, and the low points are called troughs. You can see both in the Figure below. 
S  Waves 	  Transverse waves called S waves occur during earthquakes. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends transverse waves through underground rocks in all directions away from the disturbance. S waves may travel for hundreds of miles. An S wave is modeled in the Figure 5.49. 
Summary 	  • A transverse wave is a wave in which particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction that the wave travels. • The high points of a transverse wave are called crests, and the low points are called troughs. • S waves are transverse waves that travel through underground rocks during earthquakes. At the following URL, review transverse waves and watch the animations. Be sure to view the slow motion video of a transverse wave moving through a bungee cord. Then answer the questions below. URL .ac.uk/feschools/waves/wavetypes.htm#trans transverse wave. Include arrows to show the direction the particles move and the direction the wave travels. • Describe a longitudinal wave. • Identify compressions and rarefactions of a longitudinal wave. • Define P waves. You’ve probably played with Slinky spring toys like these. They’re simple toys, but they can move in very interesting ways. Pushing in on the end of a spring toy, for example, gives it energy that moves through the spring in a longitudinal wave. What Is a Longitudinal Wave? A longitudinal wave is a type of mechanical wave. A mechanical wave is a wave that travels through matter, called the medium. In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium vibrate in a direction that is parallel to the direction that the wave travels. You can see this in the Figure 5.50. The person’s hand pushes and pulls on one end of the spring. The energy of this disturbance passes through the coils of the spring to the other end. You can see a video of a longitudinal wave in a spring at this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Compressions and  Rarefactions 	  Notice in the Figure 5.50 that the coils of the spring first crowd closer together and then spread farther apart as the wave passes through them. Places where particles of a medium crowd closer together are called compressions, and places where the particles spread farther apart are called rarefactions. The more energy the wave has, the closer together the particles are in compressions and the farther apart they are in rarefactions. 
P  Waves 	  Earthquakes cause longitudinal waves called P waves. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends longitudinal waves through underground rocks in all directions away from the disturbance. P waves are modeled in the Figure Q: Where are the compressions and rarefactions of the medium in this model of P waves? A: The compressions are the places where the vertical lines are closest together. The rarefactions are the places where the vertical lines are farthest apart. 
Summary 	  • A longitudinal wave is a type of mechanical wave, or wave that travels through matter, called the medium. In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium vibrate in a direction that is parallel to the direction that the wave travels. • Places where particles of the medium crowd closer together are called compressions. Places where particles of the medium spread farther apart are called rarefactions. • Earthquakes cause longitudinal waves called P waves, which pass through underground rocks. Use these resources of longitudinal waves to answer the questions that follow: URL mmedia/waves/lw.cfm and URL . vibrating particles of the medium. Add labels to identify the compressions and rarefactions. • Define surface wave and give an example. • Describe the motion of particles of the medium in a surface wave. • Explain why ocean waves break near the shore. This immense wall of moving water gives the surfer an amazing ride. The swelling surf raises him up and pushes him forward as though he’s as light as a feather. All he needs to do is keep his balance on the surfboard. The incredible power of the wave will do the rest. Ocean waves like this one are examples of surface waves. 
Waves on the  Surface 	  A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium. The medium is the matter through which the wave travels. Ocean waves are the best-known examples of surface waves. They travel on the surface of the water between the ocean and the air. Q: What do you think causes ocean waves? A: Most ocean waves are caused by wind blowing across the water. Moving air molecules transfer some of their energy to molecules of ocean water. The energy travels across the surface of the water in waves. The stronger the winds are blowing, the larger the waves are and the more energy they have. 
How the  Medium  Moves 	  A surface wave is a combination of a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave. A transverse wave is a wave in which particles of the medium move up and down perpendicular to the direction of the wave. A longitudinal wave is a wave in which particles of the medium move parallel to the direction of the wave. In a surface wave, particles of the medium move up and down as well as back and forth. This gives them an overall circular motion. You can see how the particles move in the Figure 5.52 and at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Why  Waves  Break 	  In deep water, particles of water just move in circles. They don’t actually move closer to shore with the energy of the waves. However, near the shore where the water is shallow, the waves behave differently. Look at the Figure 5.53. You can see how the waves start to drag on the bottom in shallow water. This creates friction that slows down the bottoms of the waves, while the tops of the waves keep moving at the same speed. The difference in speed causes the waves to get steeper until they topple over and break. The crashing waves carry water onto the shore as surf. Q: In this diagram of a wave breaking near shore, where do you think a surfer would try to catch the wave? A: The surfer would try to catch the wave where it starts to steepen and lean forward toward the shore. 
Summary 	  • A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium. Ocean waves are the best-known examples of surface waves. • In a surface wave, particles of the medium move up and down as well as back and forth in an overall circular motion. The particles don’t actually move closer to shore as the waves pass through. • In shallow water close to shore, waves start to drag on the bottom of the water. The bottoms—but not the tops—of the wave slow down because of friction. This causes the waves to steepen until they break and fall over, carrying water onto the shore as surf.

URL ww.exploratorium.edu/theworld/surfing/makingwaves.html • Define wave amplitude. • State how to measure the amplitude of transverse and longitudinal waves. • Explain what determines the amplitude of a wave. On a windy day, moving air particles strike these flags and transfer their energy of motion to particles of fabric. The energy travels through the fabric in waves. You can see the waves rippling through the brightly colored cloth. The windier the day is, the more vigorously the flags wave. What’s the Matter? Waves that travel through matter—such as the fabric of a flag—are called mechanical waves. The matter they travel through is called the medium. When the energy of a wave passes through the medium, particles of the medium move. The more energy the wave has, the farther the particles of the medium move. The distance the particles move is measured by the wave’s amplitude. What Is Wave Amplitude? Wave amplitude is the maximum distance the particles of the medium move from their resting positions when a wave passes through. The resting position of a particle of the medium is where the particle would be in the absence of a wave. The Figure 5.54 show the amplitudes of two different types of waves: transverse and longitudinal waves. • In a transverse wave, particles of the medium move up and down at right angles to the direction of the wave. Wave amplitude of a transverse wave is the difference in height between the crest and the resting position. The crest is the highest point particles of the medium reach. The higher the crests are, the greater the amplitude of the wave. • In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium move back and forth in the same direction as the wave. Wave amplitude of a longitudinal wave is the distance between particles of the medium where it is compressed by the wave. The closer together the particles are, the greater the amplitude of the wave. You can simulate waves with different amplitudes in the animation at this URL: URL 
E/sine%20wave%20simulator.html 	  Q: What do you think determines a wave’s amplitude? A: Wave amplitude is determined by the energy of the disturbance that causes the wave. 
Energy and  Amplitude 	  A wave caused by a disturbance with more energy has greater amplitude. Imagine dropping a small pebble into a pond of still water. Tiny ripples will move out from the disturbance in concentric circles. The ripples are lowamplitude waves with very little energy. Now imagine throwing a big boulder into the pond. Very large waves will be generated by the disturbance. These waves are high-amplitude waves and have a great deal of energy. 
Summary 	  • Wave amplitude is the maximum distance the particles of the medium move from their resting positions when a wave passes through. • Wave amplitude of a transverse wave is the difference in height between a crest and the resting position. Wave amplitude of a longitudinal wave is the distance between particles of the medium where it is compressed by the wave. • Wave amplitude is determined by the energy of the disturbance that causes the wave.

URL the resting position of the medium? • Define wavelength. • Describe the wavelength of transverse and longitudinal waves. • Relate wavelength to the energy of a wave. Nobody really has such colorful eyes! The colors were added digitally after the photo was taken. They represent all the different colors of light. Light is a form of energy that travels in waves. Light of different colors has different wavelengths. 
Defining  Wavelength 	  Wavelength is one way of measuring the size of waves. It is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves, and it is usually measured in meters. How it is measured is a little different for transverse and longitudinal waves. • In a transverse wave, particles of the medium vibrate up and down at right angles to the direction that the wave travels. The wavelength of a transverse wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent crests, or high points, as shown in the Figure 5.57. • In a longitudinal wave, particles of matter vibrate back and forth in the same direction that the wave travels. The wavelength of a longitudinal wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent compressions, as shown in the Figure 5.58. Compressions are the places where particles of the medium crowd close together as the energy of the wave passes through. At the following URL, watch the animation to see examples of wavelength. Also, get a feel for wavelength by playing with the wave generator. URL 
Wavelength and  Wave  Energy 	  The wavelength of a wave is related to the wave’s energy. Short-wavelength waves have more energy than longwavelength waves of the same amplitude. (Amplitude is a measure of how far particles of the medium move up and down or back and forth when a wave passes through them.) You can see examples of transverse waves with shorter and longer wavelengths in the Figure 5.59. Q: Of all the colors of visible light, red light has the longest wavelength and violet light has the shortest wavelength. Which color of light has the greatest energy? A: Violet light has the greatest energy because it has the shortest wavelength. 
Summary 	  • Wavelength is one way of measuring the size of waves. It is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves, usually measured in meters. • The wavelength of a transverse wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent crests. The wavelength of a longitudinal wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent compressions. • Short-wavelength waves have more energy than long-wavelength waves of the same amplitude. At the following URL, read about the anatomy of a wave. Then do the Check Your Understanding questions at the bottom of the Web page. Be sure to check your answers. URL fm • Define wave frequency. • Identify the SI unit for wave frequency. • Explain how wave frequency is related to the energy of a wave. Imagine making transverse waves in a rope, like the person in the sketch above. You tie one end of the rope to a tree or other fixed point, and then you shake the other end of the rope up and down with your hand. You can move the rope up and down slowly or quickly. How quickly you move the rope determines the frequency of the waves. What Is Wave Frequency? The number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time is wave frequency. Wave frequency can be measured by counting the number of crests (high points) of waves that pass the fixed point in 1 second or some other time period. The higher the number is, the greater the frequency of the waves. The SI unit for wave frequency is the hertz (Hz), where 1 hertz equals 1 wave passing a fixed point in 1 second. The Figure 5.60 shows highfrequency and low-frequency transverse waves. You can simulate transverse waves with different frequencies at these URLs: URL and URL ysics/waves/partsOfAWave/waveParts.htm Q: The wavelength of a wave is the distance between corresponding points on adjacent waves. For example, it is the distance between two adjacent crests in the transverse waves in the diagram. Infer how wave frequency is related to wavelength. A: Waves with a higher frequency have crests that are closer together, so higher frequency waves have shorter wavelengths. 
Wave  Frequency and  Energy 	  The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure 5.61 (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.) 
Summary 	  • Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. • The SI unit for wave frequency is the hertz (Hz), where 1 hertz equals 1 wave passing a fixed point in 1 second. • A higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. At the following URL, use the wave simulator to make waves with various amounts of energy. Measure the frequency and wavelength of the waves, and check your measurements. Then answer the question at the bottom of the Web page. URL • Define wave speed. • Relate wave speed to wavelength and wave frequency. • Show how to calculate wave speed. • Explain how wave speed is related to the medium of a wave. Assume that you move one end of a rope up and down just once to generate a wave in the rope. How long will take the wave to travel down the rope to the other end? It depends on the speed of the wave. 
The  Speed of a  Wave 	  Wave speed is the distance a wave travels in a given amount of time, such as the number of meters it travels per second. Wave speed (and speed in general) can be represented by the equation: 
Wave  Speed,  Wavelength, and  Wave  Frequency 	  Wave speed is related to both wavelength and wave frequency. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. This equation shows how the three factors are related: 
Speed =  Wavelength x  Wave  Frequency 	  In this equation, wavelength is measured in meters and frequency is measured in hertz (Hz), or number of waves per second. Therefore, wave speed is given in meters per second, which is the SI unit for speed. Q: If you increase the wavelength of a wave, does the speed of the wave increase as well? A: Increasing the wavelength of a wave doesn’t change its speed. That’s because when wavelength increases, wave frequency decreases. As a result, the product of wavelength and wave frequency is still the same speed. At the following URL, you can see what happens to the wavelength when the frequency of a wave increases. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Calculating  Wave  Speed from  Wavelength and  Wave  Frequency 	  The equation for wave speed can be used to calculate the speed of a wave when both wavelength and wave frequency are known. Consider an ocean wave with a wavelength of 3 meters and a frequency of 1 hertz. The speed of the wave is: 
Speed = 3 m x 1 wave/s = 3 m/s 	  Q: Kim made a wave in a spring by pushing and pulling on one end. The wavelength is 0.1 m, and the wave frequency is 2 hertz. What is the speed of the wave? A: Substitute these values into the equation for speed: 
Calculating  Wave  Frequency or  Wavelength from  Wave  Speed 	  The equation for wave speed (above) can be rewritten as: Frequency = 
Frequency 	  Therefore, if you know the speed of a wave and either the wavelength or wave frequency, you can calculate the missing value. For example, suppose that a wave is traveling at a speed of 2 meters per second and has a wavelength of 1 meter. Then the frequency of the wave is: 
Frequency = 2m/s 	  Q: A wave is traveling at a speed of 2 m/s and has a frequency of 2 Hz. What is its wavelength? A: Substitute these values into the equation for wavelength: 
The  Medium  Matters 	  The speed of most waves depends on the medium, or the matter through which the waves are traveling. Generally, waves travel fastest through solids and slowest through gases. That’s because particles are closest together in solids and farthest apart in gases. When particles are farther apart, it takes longer for the energy of the disturbance to pass from particle to particle through the medium. At the following URL, you can watch an animation showing what happens when a wave passes from one medium to another. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • Wave speed is the distance a wave travels in a given amount of time, such as the number of meters it travels per second. • Wave speed is related to wavelength and wave frequency by the equation: Speed = Wavelength x Frequency. This equation can be used to calculate wave speed when wavelength and frequency are known. • The equation for wave speed can be written to solve for wavelength or frequency if the speed and the other value are known. • The speed of most waves depends on the medium, or the matter through which they are traveling. Generally, waves travel fastest through solids and slowest through gases. Practice calculating wave speed from wavelength and frequency by doing the problems at this URL: URL hysicsclassroom.com/class/waves/u10l2e.cfm your answer. • Identify ways that waves can interact with matter. • Define and give examples of wave reflection, refraction, and diffraction. Did you ever hear an echo of your own voice? An echo occurs when sound waves bounce back from a surface that they can’t pass through. The woman pictured here is trying to create an echo by shouting toward a large building. When the sound waves strike the wall of the building, most of them bounce back toward the woman, and she hears an echo of her voice. An echo is just one example of how waves interact with matter. 
How  Waves  Interact with  Matter 	  Waves interact with matter in several ways. The interactions occur when waves pass from one medium to another. The types of interactions are reflection, refraction, and diffraction. Each type of interaction is described in detail below. You can see animations of the three types at this URL: URL esson3/flash/whiteboardcomplete.swf . 
Reflection 	  An echo is an example of wave reflection. Reflection occurs when waves bounce back from a surface they cannot pass through. Reflection can happen with any type of waves, not just sound waves. For example, light waves can also be reflected. In fact, that’s how we see most objects. Light from a light source, such as the sun or a light bulb, shines on the object and some of the light is reflected. When the reflected light enters our eyes, we can see the object. Reflected waves have the same speed and frequency as the original waves before they were reflected. However, the direction of the reflected waves is different. When waves strike an obstacle head on, the reflected waves bounce straight back in the direction they came from. When waves strike an obstacle at any other angle, they bounce back at the same angle but in a different direction. This is illustrated in the Figure 5.62. In this diagram, waves strike a wall at an angle, called the angle of incidence. The waves are reflected at the same angle, called the angle of reflection, but in a different direction. Notice that both angles are measured relative to a line that is perpendicular to the wall. 
Refraction 	  Refraction is another way that waves interact with matter. Refraction occurs when waves bend as they enter a new medium at an angle. You can see an example of refraction in the Figure 5.63. Light bends when it passes from air to water or from water to air. The bending of the light traveling from the fish to the man’s eyes causes the fish to appear to be in a different place from where it actually is. Waves bend as they enter a new medium because they start traveling at a different speed in the new medium. For example, light travels more slowly in water than in air. This causes it to refract when it passes from air to water or from water to air. Q: Where would the fish appear to be if the man looked down at it from straight above its actual location? A: The fish would appear to be where it actually is because refraction occurs only when waves (in this case light waves from the fish) enter a new medium at an angle other than 90°. 
Diffraction 	  Did you ever notice that you can hear sounds around the corners of buildings even though you can’t see around them? The Figure 5.64 shows why this happens. As you can see from the figure, sound waves spread out and travel around obstacles. This is called diffraction. It also occurs when waves pass through an opening in an obstacle. All waves may be diffracted, but it is more pronounced in some types of waves than others. For example, sound waves bend around corners much more than light does. That’s why you can hear but not see around corners. For a given type of waves, such as sound waves, how much the waves diffract depends on the size of the obstacle (or opening in the obstacle) and the wavelength of the waves. The Figure 5.65 shows how the amount of diffraction is affected by the size of the opening in a barrier. Note that the wavelength of the wave is the distance between the vertical lines. 
Summary 	  • Three ways that waves may interact with matter are reflection, refraction, and diffraction. • Reflection occurs when waves bounce back from a surface that they cannot pass through. • Refraction occurs when waves bend as they enter a new medium at an angle and start traveling at a different speed. • Diffraction occurs when waves spread out as they travel around obstacles or through openings in obstacles.

When raindrops fall into still water, they create tiny waves that spread out in all directions away from the drops. What happens when the waves from two different raindrops meet? They interfere with each other. 
When  Waves  Meet 	  When two or more waves meet, they interact with each other. The interaction of waves with other waves is called wave interference. Wave interference may occur when two waves that are traveling in opposite directions meet. The two waves pass through each other, and this affects their amplitude. Amplitude is the maximum distance the particles of the medium move from their resting positions when a wave passes through. How amplitude is affected by wave interference depends on the type of interference. Interference can be constructive or destructive. 
Constructive  Interference 	  Constructive interference occurs when the crests, or highest points, of one wave overlap the crests of the other wave. You can see this in the Figure 5.66. As the waves pass through each other, the crests combine to produce a wave with greater amplitude. You can see an animation of constructive interference at this URL: URL u/phys_anim/waves/embederQ1.20100.html 
Destructive  Interference 	  Destructive interference occurs when the crests of one wave overlap the troughs, or lowest points, of another wave. The Figure 5.67 shows what happens. As the waves pass through each other, the crests and troughs cancel each other out to produce a wave with zero amplitude. You can see an animation of destructive interference at this URL: URL 
Standing  Waves 	  Waves may reflect off an obstacle that they are unable to pass through. When waves are reflected straight back from an obstacle, the reflected waves interfere with the original waves and create standing waves. These are waves that appear to be standing still. Standing waves occur because of a combination of constructive and destructive interference. You can see animations of standing waves at the URLs below. • URL • URL Q: How could you use a rope to produce standing waves? A: You could tie one end of the rope to a fixed object, such as doorknob, and move the other end up and down to generate waves in the rope. When the waves reach the fixed object, they are reflected back. The original waves and the reflected waves interfere to produce a standing wave. Try it yourself and see if the waves appear to stand still. 
Summary 	  • Wave interference is the interaction of waves with other waves. • Constructive interference occurs when the crests of one wave overlap the crests of the other wave, causing an increase in wave amplitude. • Destructive interference occurs when the crests of one wave overlap the troughs of the other wave, causing a decrease in wave amplitude. • When waves are reflected straight back from an obstacle, the reflected waves interfere with the original waves and create standing waves. the Web page.

That’s what you’d hear if you were in the forest when this old tree cracked and came crashing down to the ground. But what if there was nobody there to hear the tree fall? Would it still make these sounds? This is an old riddle. To answer the riddle correctly, you need to know the scientific definition of sound. 
Defining  Sound 	  In science, sound is defined as the transfer of energy from a vibrating object in waves that travel through matter. Most people commonly use the term sound to mean what they hear when sound waves enter their ears. The tree above generated sound waves when it fell to the ground, so it made sound according to the scientific definition. But the sound wasn’t detected by a person’s ears if there was nobody in the forest. So the answer to the riddle is both yes and no! 
How  Sound  Waves  Begin 	  All sound waves begin with vibrating matter. Look at the first guitar string on the left in the Figure 5.68. Plucking the string makes it vibrate. The diagram below the figure shows the wave generated by the vibrating string. The moving string repeatedly pushes against the air particles next to it, which causes the air particles to vibrate. The vibrations spread through the air in all directions away from the guitar string as longitudinal waves. In longitudinal waves, particles of the medium vibrate back and forth parallel to the direction that the waves travel. You can see an animation of sound waves traveling through air at this URL: URL .html Q: If there were no air particles to carry the vibrations away from the guitar string, how would sound reach the ear? A: It wouldn’t unless the vibrations were carried by another medium. Sound waves are mechanical waves, so they can travel only though matter and not through empty space. 
A  Ticking  Clock 	  The fact that sound cannot travel through empty space was first demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still ticking, but the ticking sound could no longer be heard. That’s because the sound couldn’t travel away from the clock without air particles to pass the sound energy along. You can see an online demonstration of the same experiment—with a modern twist—at this Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Sound  Waves and  Matter 	  Most of the sounds we hear reach our ears through the air, but sounds can also travel through liquids and solids. If you swim underwater—or even submerge your ears in bathwater—any sounds you hear have traveled to your ears through the water. Some solids, including glass and metals, are very good at transmitting sounds. Foam rubber and heavy fabrics, on the other hand, tend to muffle sounds. They absorb rather than pass on the sound energy. Q: How can you tell that sounds travel through solids? A: One way is that you can hear loud outdoor sounds such as sirens through closed windows and doors. You can also hear sounds through the inside walls of a house. For example, if you put your ear against a wall, you may be able to eavesdrop on a conversation in the next room—not that you would, of course. 
Summary 	  • In science, sound is defined as the transfer of energy from a vibrating object in waves that travel through matter. • All sound waves begin with vibrating matter. The vibrations generate longitudinal waves that travel through matter in all directions. • Most sounds we hear travel through air, but sounds can also travel through liquids and solids.

Has this ever happened to you? You see a flash of lightning on the horizon, but several seconds pass before you hear the rumble of thunder. The reason? The speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound. What Is the Speed of Sound? The speed of sound is the distance that sound waves travel in a given amount of time. You’ll often see the speed of sound given as 343 meters per second. But that’s just the speed of sound under a certain set of conditions, specifically, through dry air at 20 °C. The speed of sound may be very different through other matter or at other temperatures. 
Speed of  Sound in  Different  Media 	  Sound waves are mechanical waves, and mechanical waves can only travel through matter. The matter through which the waves travel is called the medium (plural, media). The Table 5.3 gives the speed of sound in several different media. Generally, sound waves travel most quickly through solids, followed by liquids, and then by gases. Particles of matter are closest together in solids and farthest apart in gases. When particles are closer together, they can more quickly pass the energy of vibrations to nearby particles. You can explore the speed of sound in different URL =tcm:4-248291-64 Medium (20 °C) 
E 5.3:  Speed of  Sound in  Various  Media 	  Speed of Sound Waves (m/s) Q: The table gives the speed of sound in dry air. Do you think that sound travels more or less quickly through air that contains water vapor? (Hint: Compare the speed of sound in water and air in the table.) A: Sound travels at a higher speed through water than air, so it travels more quickly through air that contains water vapor than it does through dry air. 
Temperature and  Speed of  Sound 	  The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium. For a given medium, sound has a slower speed at lower temperatures. You can compare the speed of sound in dry air at different temperatures in the following Table 5.4. At a lower temperature, particles of the medium are moving more slowly, so it takes them longer to transfer the energy of the sound waves. TABLE 5.4: Speed of Sound in Dry Air at Different Temperatures 
Temperature of  Air 	  Speed of Sound Waves (m/s) Q: What do you think the speed of sound might be in dry air at a temperature of -20 °C? A: For each 1 degree Celsius that temperature decreases, the speed of sound decreases by 0.6 m/s. So sound travels through dry, -20 °C air at a speed of 319 m/s. 
Summary 	  • The speed of sound is the distance that sound waves travel in a given amount of time. The speed of sound in dry air at 20 °C is 343 meters per second. • Generally, sound waves travel most quickly through solids, followed by liquids, and then by gases. • For a given medium, sound waves travel more slowly at lower temperatures. At the following URL, read about the speed of sound in different materials. Be sure to play the animation. Then answer the questions below. URL • Define intensity of sound and relate it to loudness. • Compare decibel levels of different sounds. • Identify factors that affect sound intensity. A friend whispers to you in a voice so soft that she has to lean very close so you can hear what she’s saying. Later that day, your friend shouts to you from across the gymnasium. Now her voice is loud enough for you to hear her clearly even though she’s several meters away. Obviously, sounds can vary in loudness. 
It’s  All  About  Energy 	  Loudness refers to how loud or soft a sound seems to a listener. The loudness of sound is determined, in turn, by the intensity of the sound waves. Intensity is a measure of the amount of energy in sound waves. The unit of intensity is the decibel (dB). 
Decibel  Levels 	  The Figure 5.70 shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Q: How much louder than a 20-decibel whisper is the 60-decibel sound of a vacuum cleaner? A: The vacuum cleaner is 10,000 times louder than the whisper! 
Amplitude and  Distance 	  The intensity of sound waves determines the loudness of sounds, but what determines intensity? Intensity results from two factors: the amplitude of the sound waves and how far they have traveled from the source of the sound. • Amplitude is a measure of the size of sound waves. 
It depends on the amount of energy that started the 	  waves. Greater amplitude waves have more energy and greater intensity, so they sound louder. For a video demonstration of the amplitude and loudness of sounds, go to this URL: URL rqfGYD2UKw • As sound waves travel farther from their source, the more spread out their energy becomes. You can see how this works in the Figure 5.71. As distance from the sound source increases, the area covered by the sound waves increases. The same amount of energy is spread over a greater area, so the intensity and loudness of the sound is less. This explains why even loud sounds fade away as you move farther from the source. Q: Why can low-amplitude sounds like whispers be heard only over short distances? A: The sound waves already have so little energy that spreading them out over a wider area quickly reduces their intensity below the level of hearing. 
Summary 	  • Loudness refers to how loud or soft a sound seems to a listener. The loudness of sound is determined, in turn, by the intensity, or amount of energy, in sound waves. The unit of intensity is the decibel (dB). • As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. • Intensity of sound results from two factors: the amplitude of the sound waves and how far they have traveled from the source of the sound.

A marching band passes you as it parades down the street. You heard it coming from several blocks away. Now that the different instruments have finally reached you, their distinctive sounds can be heard. The tiny piccolos trill their bird-like high notes, and the big tubas rumble out their booming bass notes. Clearly, some sounds are higher or lower than others. 
High or  Low 	  How high or low a sound seems to a listener is its pitch. Pitch, in turn, depends on the frequency of sound waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. High-pitched sounds, like the sounds of the piccolo in the Figure 5.72, have high-frequency waves. Low-pitched sounds, like the sounds of the tuba Figure 5.72, have low-frequency waves. For a video demonstration of frequency and pitch, go to this URL: URL Can You Hear It? The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound. Infrasound is too low-pitched for humans to hear. Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound. Ultrasound is too high-pitched for humans to hear. Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs—but not people—can hear. The whistles produce sounds with frequencies too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, like the one pictured in the Figure 5.73, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz! Q: Bats use ultrasound to navigate in the dark. Can you explain how? A: Bats send out ultrasound waves, which reflect back from objects ahead of them. They sense the reflected sound waves and use the information to detect objects they can’t see in the dark. This is how they avoid flying into walls and trees and also how they find flying insects to eat. 
Summary 	  • How high or low a sound seems to a listener is its pitch. Pitch, in turn, depends on the frequency of sound waves. • High-frequency sound waves produce high-pitched sounds, and low-frequency sound waves produce lowpitched sounds. • Infrasound has wave frequencies too low for humans to hear. Ultrasound has wave frequencies too high for humans to hear. At the following URL, complete the interactive module to review and test your knowledge of the frequency and pitch of sound. URL • Describe the Doppler effect. • Explain why the Doppler effect occurs. Has this ever happened to you? You hear a siren from a few blocks away. The source is a police car that is racing in your direction. As the car approaches, zooms past you, and then speeds off into the distance, the sound of its siren keeps changing in pitch. First the siren gets higher in pitch, and then it suddenly gets lower. Do you know why this happens? The answer is the Doppler effect. What Is the Doppler Effect? The Doppler effect is a change in the frequency of sound waves that occurs when the source of the sound waves is moving relative to a stationary listener. (It can also occur when the sound source is stationary and the listener is moving.) The Figure 5.74 shows how the Doppler effect occurs. The sound waves from the police car siren travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (to the left), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it. Sound waves that are closer together have a higher frequency, and sound waves that are farther apart have a lower frequency. The frequency of sound waves, in turn, determines the pitch of the sound. Sound waves with a higher frequency produce sound with a higher pitch, and sound waves with a lower frequency produce sound with a lower pitch. For an interactive animation of a diagram like the one below, go to the following 
Experiencing the  Doppler  Effect 	  As the car approaches listener A, the sound waves get closer together, increasing their frequency. This listener hears the pitch of the siren get higher. As the car speeds away from listener B, the sound waves get farther apart, decreasing their frequency. This listener hears the pitch of the siren get lower. You can experience the Doppler effect with a moving siren in the following animation: URL mation/ Q: What will the siren sound like to listener A after the police car passes him? A: The siren will suddenly get lower in pitch because the sound waves will be much more spread out and have a lower frequency. 
Summary 	  • The Doppler effect is a change in the frequency of sound waves that occurs when the source of the sound waves is moving relative to a stationary listener. • As the source of sound waves approaches a listener, the sound waves get closer together, increasing their frequency and the pitch of the sound. The opposite happens when the source of sound waves moves away from the listener. At the following URL, observe the Doppler effect in the animation and then answer the question.

This boy is cupping his hands behind his ears in order to hear better. Do you think this will help? To answer this question, you need to know more about sound, the ear, and how we hear. 
The  Sounds  We  Hear 	  Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves through matter. The ability to sense sound energy and perceive sound is called hearing. The organ that we use to sense sound energy is the ear. Almost all the structures in the ear are needed for this purpose. Together, they gather sound waves, amplify the waves, and change their kinetic energy to electrical signals. The electrical signals travel to the brain, which interprets them as the sounds we hear. The Figure 5.75 shows the three main parts of the ear: the outer, middle, and inner ear. It also shows the specific structures in each part of the ear. The roles of these structures in hearing are described below and in this animation: URL . 
Outer  Ear 	  The outer ear includes the pinna, ear canal, and eardrum. • The pinna is the only part of the ear that extends outward from the head. Its position and shape make it good at catching sound waves and funneling them into the ear canal. • The ear canal is a tube that carries sound waves into the ear. The sound waves travel through the air inside the ear canal to the eardrum. • The eardrum is like the head of a drum. It is a thin membrane stretched tight across the end of the ear canal. The eardrum vibrates when sound waves strike it, and it sends the vibrations on to the middle ear. Q: How might cupping his hands behind his ears help the boy pictured in the opening image hear better? A: His hands might help the pinna of his ears catch sound waves and direct them into the ear canal. 
Middle  Ear 	  The middle ear contains three tiny bones (ossicles) called the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. If you look at these bones in the Figure 5.75, you might notice that they resemble the objects for which they are named. The three bones transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. The arrangement of the three bones allows them to work together as a lever that increases the amplitude of the waves as they pass to the inner ear. Q: Wave amplitude is the maximum distance particles of matter move when a wave passes through them. Why would amplifying the sound waves as they pass through the middle ear improve hearing? A: Amplified sound waves have more energy. This increases the intensity and loudness of the sounds, so they are easier to hear. 
Inner  Ear 	  The stirrup in the middle ear passes the amplified sound waves to the inner ear through the oval window. When the oval window vibrates, it causes the cochlea to vibrate as well. The cochlea is a shell-like structure that is full of fluid and lined with nerve cells called hair cells. Each hair cell has many tiny “hairs,” as you can see in the magnified image 5.76. When the cochlea vibrates, it causes waves in the fluid inside. The waves bend the “hairs” on the hair cells, and this triggers electrical impulses. The electrical impulses travel to the brain through nerves. Only after the nerve impulses reach the brain do we hear the sound. 
Summary 	  • Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves through matter. The ear gathers and amplifies sound waves and changes them to electrical signals. The brain receives the signals and interprets them as the sounds we hear. • The outer ear includes the pinna, ear canal, and eardrum. These structures gather sound waves, funnel them into the ear, and pass the vibrations to the middle ear. • The middle ear contains three tiny bones that amplify the vibrations as they transmit them to the inner ear. • In the inner ear, the vibrations are changed to electrical signals by hair cells lining the cochlea. The electrical signals then travel to the brain. At the following URL, review the information about the ear and hearing. Be sure to watch the hearing animation.

The  Ear and  Hearing 	  The ear is a complex organ that senses sound energy so we can hear. Hearing is the ability to sense sound energy and perceive sound. All of the structures of the ear that are involved in hearing must work well for a person to have normal hearing. Damage to any of the structures, through illness or injury, may cause hearing loss. Total hearing loss is called deafness. To learn more about hearing loss, watch the animation at this URL: URL om/watch?v=YpIptQSEEjY . 
Loud  Sounds 	  The most common cause of hearing loss is exposure to loud sounds. Loud sounds can damage hair cells inside the ears. Hair cells change sound waves to electrical signals that the brain can interpret as sounds. Louder sounds, which have greater intensity than softer sounds, can damage hair cells more quickly than softer sounds. You can see the relationship between sound intensity, exposure time, and hearing loss in the following Figure 5.77. The intensity of sounds is measured in decibels (dB). Q: What is the maximum amount of time you should be exposed to a sound as intense as 100 dB? What might make a sound this intense? A: You should be exposed to a 100-dB sound for no longer than 15 minutes. An example of a sound this intense is the sound of a car horn. Shhhh! Hearing loss caused by loud sounds is permanent. However, this type of hearing loss can be prevented by protecting the ears from loud sounds. People who work in jobs that expose them to loud sounds must wear hearing protectors. Examples include construction workers who work around loud machinery for many hours each day. But anyone exposed to loud sounds for longer than the permissible exposure time should wear hearing protectors. Many home and yard chores and even recreational activities are loud enough to cause hearing loss if people are exposed to them for too much time. You can see examples in the Figure 5.78. 
How  Hearing  Protectors  Work 	  You can see two different types of hearing protectors in the Figure 5.79. Earplugs are simple hearing protectors that just muffle sounds by partially blocking all sound waves from entering the ears. This type of hearing protector is suitable for lower noise levels, such as the noise of a lawnmower or snowmobile. Electronic ear protectors work differently. They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction. This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified instead so they can be heard more clearly. This type of hearing protector is recommended for higher noise levels and situations where it’s important to be able to hear lower-decibel sounds. 
Summary 	  • Hearing is the ability to sense sound energy and perceive sound. The ear is the organ that senses sound and allows us to hear. Damage to structures of the ear may cause hearing loss. Total hearing loss is called deafness. These activities expose people to dangerously loud sounds that can cause hearing loss. • The most common cause of hearing loss is exposure to loud sounds. Loud sounds damage hair cells in the ear that are needed for hearing. Louder sounds damage hair cells more quickly than softer sounds. • Hearing loss caused by loud sounds can be prevented by protecting the ears from loud sounds with hearing protectors. They keep sound waves out of the ears or reduce the amplitude of sound waves. Watch the video about two types of hearing loss at the following URL. Then compare and contrast the two types.

Do you ever see a colorful drum like this one before? It’s a traditional musical instrument of Uruguay. The drummer is equally colorful. Each time he strikes the drum, it produces a loud, pounding sound. There are hundreds of different kinds of musical instruments, from drums to horns to stringed instruments. Would it surprise you to learn that all of them make sound in the same basic way? 
Making  Music 	  People have been using sound to make music for thousands of years. They have invented many different kinds of musical instruments. Despite their diversity, however, musical instruments share certain similarities. • All musical instruments create sound by causing matter to vibrate. The vibrations start sound waves moving through the air. • Most musical instruments use resonance to amplify the sound waves and make the sounds louder. Resonance occurs when an object vibrates in response to sound waves of a certain frequency. In a musical instrument such as a drum, the whole instrument and the air inside it may vibrate when the head of the drum is struck. • Most musical instruments have a way of changing the frequency of the sound waves they produce. This changes the pitch of the sounds, or how high or low the sounds seem to a listener. 
Categories of  Musical  Instruments 	  There are three basic categories of musical instruments: percussion, wind, and stringed instruments. You can read in the Figure 5.80 how instruments in each category make sound and change pitch. Q: Can you name other instruments in each of the three categories of musical instruments? A: Other percussion instruments include drums and cymbals. Other wind instruments include trumpets and flutes. Other stringed instruments include guitars and harps.

What could this smiling dolphin and yawning bat possibly have in common? It’s not just that both of them are mammals. Both of them also use ultrasound to find things in the dark. What Is Ultrasound? Ultrasound is sound that has a wave frequency higher than the human ear can detect. It includes all sound with wave frequencies higher than 20,000 waves per second, or 20,000 hertz (Hz). Although we can’t hear ultrasound, it is very useful to humans and some other animals. Uses of ultrasound include echolocation, sonar, and ultrasonography. 
Echolocation 	  Animals such as bats and dolphins send out ultrasound waves and use their echoes, or reflected waves, to identify the locations of objects they cannot see. This is called echolocation. Animals use echolocation to find prey and avoid running into objects in the dark. You can see in the Figure 5.81 and also at the following URL how a bat uses echolocation to find insect prey. URL 
Sonar 	  Sonar uses ultrasound in a way that is similar to echolocation. Sonar stands for sound navigation and ranging. It is used to locate underwater objects such as submarines. That’s how the ship pictured in the Figure 5.82 is using it. A sonar device is both a sender and a receiver. It sends out ultrasound waves and detects the waves after they reflect from underwater objects. If you watch the video at the URL below, you can see how sonar is used on a submarine. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. The distance to underwater objects can be calculated from the known speed of sound in water and the time it takes for the sound waves to travel to the object. The equation for distance traveled when speed and time are known is: 
Distance =  Speed ×  Time 	  Consider the ship and submarine pictured in the Figure 5.82. If an ultrasound wave travels from the ship to the submarine and back again in 2 seconds, what is the distance from the ship to the submarine? The sound wave travels from the ship to the submarine in just 1 second, or half the time it takes to make the round trip. The speed of sound waves through ocean water is 1437 m/s. Therefore, the distance from the ship to the submarine is: 
Distance = 1437 m/s × 1 s = 1437 m 	  Q: Now assume that the sonar device on the ship sends an ultrasound wave to the bottom of the water. If the sound wave is reflected back to the device in 4 seconds, how deep is the water? A: The time it takes the wave to reach the bottom is 2 seconds. So the distance from the ship to the bottom of the water is: 
Ultrasonography 	  Another use of ultrasound is to “see” inside the human body. This use of ultrasound is called ultrasonography. Harmless ultrasound waves are sent inside the body, and the reflected waves are used to create an image on a screen. This technology is used to examine internal organs and unborn babies without risk to the patient. You can see a doctor using ultrasound in the Figure 5.83. You can watch an animation showing how ultrasonography works at this

Did you ever wonder how a microwave works? It directs invisible waves of radiation toward the food placed inside of it. The radiation transfers energy to the food, causing it to get warmer. The radiation is in the form of microwaves, which are a type of electromagnetic waves. What Are Electromagnetic Waves? Electromagnetic waves are waves that consist of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves transfer energy from one place to another. The transfer of energy by electromagnetic waves is called electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic waves can transfer energy through matter or across empty space. For an excellent video introduction to electromagnetic waves, go to this URL: URL h3KadE Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: How do microwaves transfer energy inside a microwave oven? A: They transfer energy through the air inside the oven to the food. 
May the  Force  Be with  You 	  A familiar example may help you understand the vibrating electric and magnetic fields that make up electromagnetic waves. Consider a bar magnet, like the one in the Figure 5.84. The magnet exerts magnetic force over an area all around it. This area is called a magnetic field. The field lines in the diagram represent the direction and location of the magnetic force. Because of the field surrounding a magnet, it can exert force on objects without touching them. They just have to be within its magnetic field. Q: How could you demonstrate that a magnet can exert force on objects without touching them? A: You could put small objects containing iron, such as paper clips, near a magnet and show that they move toward the magnet. An electric field is similar to a magnetic field. It is an area of electrical force surrounding a positively or negatively charged particle. You can see electric fields in the following Figure 5.85. Like a magnetic field, an electric field can exert force on objects over a distance without actually touching them. 
How an  Electromagnetic  Wave  Begins 	  An electromagnetic wave begins when an electrically charged particle vibrates. The Figure 5.86 shows how this happens. A vibrating charged particle causes the electric field surrounding it to vibrate as well. A vibrating electric field, in turn, creates a vibrating magnetic field. The two types of vibrating fields combine to create an electromagnetic wave. You can see animations of electromagnetic waves at these URLs: • URL • URL 
How an  Electromagnetic  Wave  Travels 	  As you can see in the Figure 5.86, the electric and magnetic fields that make up an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular (at right angles) to each other. Both fields are also perpendicular to the direction that the wave travels. Therefore, an electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave. However, unlike a mechanical transverse wave, which can only travel through matter, an electromagnetic transverse wave can travel through empty space. When waves travel through matter, they lose some energy to the matter as they pass through it. But when waves travel through space, no energy is lost. Therefore, electromagnetic waves don’t get weaker as they travel. However, the energy is “diluted” as it travels farther from its source because it spreads out over an ever-larger area. 
Electromagnetic  Wave  Interactions 	  When electromagnetic waves strike matter, they may interact with it in the same ways that mechanical waves interact with matter. Electromagnetic waves may: • reflect, or bounce back from a surface; • refract, or bend when entering a new medium; • diffract, or spread out around obstacles. Electromagnetic waves may also be absorbed by matter and converted to other forms of energy. Microwaves are a familiar example. When microwaves strike food in a microwave oven, they are absorbed and converted to thermal energy, which heats the food. 
Sources of  Electromagnetic  Waves 	  The most important source of electromagnetic waves on Earth is the sun. Electromagnetic waves travel from the sun to Earth across space and provide virtually all the energy that supports life on our planet. Many other sources of electromagnetic waves depend on technology. Radio waves, microwaves, and X rays are examples. We use these electromagnetic waves for communications, cooking, medicine, and many other purposes. 
Summary 	  • Electromagnetic waves are waves that consist of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. They transfer energy through matter or across space. The transfer of energy by electromagnetic waves is called electromagnetic radiation. • The electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave are areas of electric or magnetic force.

What a beautiful sunset! You probably know that sunlight travels in waves through space from the sun to Earth. But do you know what light really is? Is it just energy, or is it something else? In this article you’ll find out that light may be more than it seems. 
The  Question 	  Electromagnetic radiation, commonly called light, is the transfer of energy by waves called electromagnetic waves. These waves consist of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. Where does electromagnetic energy come from? It is released when electrons return to lower energy levels in atoms. Electromagnetic radiation behaves like continuous waves of energy most of the time. Sometimes, however, electromagnetic radiation seems to behave like discrete, or separate, particles rather than waves. So does electromagnetic radiation consist of waves or particles? 
The  Debate 	  This question about the nature of electromagnetic radiation was debated by scientists for more than two centuries, starting in the 1600s. Some scientists argued that electromagnetic radiation consists of particles that shoot around like tiny bullets. Other scientists argued that electromagnetic radiation consists of waves, like sound waves or water waves. Until the early 1900s, most scientists thought that electromagnetic radiation is either one or the other and that scientists on the other side of the argument were simply wrong. Q: Do you think electromagnetic radiation is a wave or a particle? A: Here’s a hint: it may not be a question of either-or. Keep reading to learn more. 
A  New  Theory 	  In 1905, the physicist Albert Einstein developed a new theory about electromagnetic radiation. The theory is often called the wave-particle theory. It explains how electromagnetic radiation can behave as both a wave and a particle. Einstein argued that when an electron returns to a lower energy level and gives off electromagnetic energy, the energy is released as a discrete “packet” of energy. We now call such a packet of energy a photon. According to Einstein, a photon resembles a particle but moves like a wave. You can see this in the Figure 5.87. The theory posits that waves of photons traveling through space or matter make up electromagnetic radiation. 
Energy of a  Photon 	  A photon isn’t a fixed amount of energy. Instead, the amount of energy in a photon depends on the frequency of the electromagnetic wave. The frequency of a wave is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time, such as the number of waves per second. In waves with higher frequencies, photons have more energy. 
Evidence for the  Wave- Particle  Theory 	  After Einstein proposed his theory, evidence was discovered to support it. For example, scientists shone laser light through two slits in a barrier made of a material that blocked light. You can see the setup of this type of experiment in the Figure 5.88. Using a special camera that was very sensitive to light, they took photos of the light that passed through the slits. The photos revealed tiny pinpoints of light passing through the double slits. This seemed to show that light consists of particles. However, if the camera was exposed to the light for a long time, the pinpoints accumulated in bands that resembled interfering waves. Therefore, the experiment showed that light seems to consist of particles that act like waves. 
Summary 	  • Electromagnetic radiation behaves like waves of energy most of the time, but sometimes it behaves like particles. From the 1600s until the early 1900s, most scientists thought that electromagnetic radiation consists either of particles or of waves but not both. • In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed the wave-particle theory of electromagnetic radiation. This theory states that electromagnetic energy is released in discrete packets of energy—now called photons—that act like waves. • After Einstein presented his theory, scientists found evidence to support it. For example, double-slit experiments showed that light consists of tiny particles that create patterns of interference just as waves do. Watch the animation “Let There Be Light” at the following URL. Then create a timeline of ideas and discoveries about the nature of light. URL the theory? • State the speed of light. • Describe wavelengths and frequencies of electromagnetic waves. • Relate wave frequency to wave energy. • Show how to calculate wavelength or wave frequency if the other value is known. What do these two photos have in common? They both represent electromagnetic waves. These are waves that consist of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. They transmit energy through matter or across space. Some electromagnetic waves are generally harmless. The light we use to see is a good example. Other electromagnetic waves can be very harmful and care must be taken to avoid too much exposure to them. X rays are a familiar example. Why do electromagnetic waves vary in these ways? It depends on their properties. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves have properties of speed, wavelength, and frequency. 
Speed of  Electromagnetic  Waves 	  All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through empty space. That speed, called the speed of light, is about 300 million meters per second (3.0 x 108 m/s). Nothing else in the universe is known to travel this fast. The sun is about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) from Earth, but it takes electromagnetic radiation only 8 minutes to reach Earth from the sun. If you could move that fast, you would be able to travel around Earth 7.5 times in just 1 second! You can learn more about the speed of light at this URL: URL y/29407-assignment-discovery-speed-of-light-video.htm Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Wavelength and  Frequency of  Electromagnetic  Waves 	  Although all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed across space, they may differ in their wavelengths, frequencies, and energy levels. • Wavelength is the distance between corresponding points of adjacent waves (see the Figure 5.89). Wavelengths of electromagnetic waves range from longer than a soccer field to shorter than the diameter of an atom. • Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Frequencies of electromagnetic waves range from thousands of waves per second to trillions of waves per second. • The energy of electromagnetic waves depends on their frequency. Low-frequency waves have little energy and are normally harmless. High-frequency waves have a lot of energy and are potentially very harmful. Q: Which electromagnetic waves do you think have higher frequencies: visible light or X rays? A: X rays are harmful but visible light is harmless, so you can infer that X rays have higher frequencies than visible light. 
Speed,  Wavelength, and  Frequency 	  The speed of a wave is a product of its wavelength and frequency. Because all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through space, a wave with a shorter wavelength must have a higher frequency, and vice versa. This relationship is represented by the equation: 
Speed =  Wavelength ×  Frequency 	  The equation for wave speed can be rewritten as: Frequency = 
Speed 	  Wavelength or Wavelength = 
Frequency 	  Therefore, if either wavelength or frequency is known, the missing value can be calculated. Consider an electromagnetic wave that has a wavelength of 3 meters. Its speed, like the speed of all electromagnetic waves, is 3.0 × 108 meters per second. Its frequency can be found by substituting these values into the frequency equation: 
Frequency = 3.0×108 m/s 	  Q: What is the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave that has a frequency of 3.0 × 108 hertz? A: Use the wavelength equation: 
Wavelength = 3.0×108 m/s 	  You can learn more about calculating the frequency and wavelength of electromagnetic waves at these URLs: http ://URL and URL 
Summary 	  • All electromagnetic waves travel across space at the speed of light, which is about 300 million meters per second (3.0 x 108 m/s). • Electromagnetic waves vary in wavelength and frequency. Longer wavelength electromagnetic waves have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelength waves have higher frequencies. Higher frequency waves have more energy. • The speed of a wave is a product of its wavelength and frequency. Because the speed of electromagnetic waves through space is constant, the wavelength or frequency of an electromagnetic wave can be calculated if the other value is known.

It’s a warm sunny Saturday, and Michael and Lavar have a big day planned. They’re going to ride across town to meet their friends and then go to the zoo. The boys may not realize it, but they will be bombarded by electromagnetic radiation as they ride their bikes and walk around the zoo grounds. The only kinds of radiation they can detect are visible light, which allows them to see, and infrared light, which they feel as warmth on their skin. Q: Besides visible light and infrared light, what other kinds of electromagnetic radiation will the boys be exposed to in sunlight? A: Sunlight consists of all the different kinds of electromagnetic radiation, from harmless radio waves to deadly gamma rays. Fortunately, Earth’s atmosphere prevents most of the harmful radiation from reaching Earth’s surface. You can read about the different kinds of electromagnetic radiation in this article. 
Electromagnetic  Radiation 	  Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in waves across space as well as through matter. Most of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy. 
A  Spectrum of  Electromagnetic  Waves 	  Visible light and infrared light are just a small part of the full range of electromagnetic radiation, which is called the electromagnetic spectrum. You can see the waves of the electromagnetic spectrum in the Figure 5.90. At the top of the diagram, the wavelengths of the waves are given.

How do the sounds travel through air and buildings and everything else in between you and the station? The answer is by electromagnetic waves. 
A  Spectrum of  Waves 	  Electromagnetic waves consist of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. They transfer energy across space as well as through matter. Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths and frequencies, and higher-frequency waves have more energy. The full range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves is called the electromagnetic spectrum. It is outlined in the following Figure 5.91. 
Introducing  Radio  Waves 	  Electromagnetic waves on the left side of the Figure 5.91 are called radio waves. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves with the longest wavelengths. They may have wavelengths longer than a soccer field. They are also the electromagnetic waves with the lowest frequencies. With their low frequencies, they have the least energy of all electromagnetic waves. Nonetheless, radio waves are very useful. They are used for radio and television broadcasts and many other purposes. You can learn more about radio waves, including how they were discovered, at this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: Based on the electromagnetic spectrum Figure 5.91, what is the range of frequencies of radio waves? A: The range of frequencies of radio waves is between 105 and 1012 Hz, or waves per second. 
M and  M  Radio 	  In radio broadcasts, sounds are encoded in radio waves, and then the waves are sent out through the atmosphere from a radio tower. A radio receiver detects the waves and changes them back to sounds. You may have listened to both AM and FM radio stations. How sounds are encoded in radio waves differs between AM and FM broadcasts. • AM stands for amplitude modulation. In AM broadcasts, sound signals are encoded by changing the amplitude, or maximum height, of radio waves. AM broadcasts use longer wavelength radio waves than FM broadcasts. Because of their longer wavelengths, AM waves reflect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called the ionosphere. You can see how this happens in the Figure 5.92. Because the waves are reflected, they can reach radio receivers that are very far away from the radio tower. • FM stands for frequency modulation. In FM broadcasts, sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency of radio waves. Frequency modulation allows FM waves to encode more information than does amplitude modulation, so FM broadcasts usually produce clearer sounds than AM broadcasts. However, the relatively short wavelengths of FM waves means that they don’t reflect off the ionosphere as AM waves do. Instead, FM waves pass through the ionosphere and out into space. This is also shown in the Figure 5.92. As a result, FM waves cannot reach very distant receivers. Q: The composition of the ionosphere changes somewhat from day to night. The changes make the nighttime ionosphere even better at reflecting AM radio waves. How do you think this might affect the distance AM radio waves travel at night? A: With greater reflection off the ionosphere, AM waves can travel even farther at night than they can during the day. Radio receivers can often pick up radio broadcasts at night from cities that are hundreds of miles away. 
Television 	  Television broadcasts also use radio waves (see Figure 5.92). For TV broadcasts, sounds are encoded with frequency modulation, and pictures are encoded with amplitude modulation. The encoded waves are broadcast from a TV tower. When the waves are received by television sets, they are decoded and changed back to sounds and pictures. 
Summary 	  • Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths, frequencies, and energy levels. The full range of electromagnetic waves makes up the electromagnetic spectrum. • Radio waves are electromagnetic waves with the longest wavelengths, lowest frequencies, and least amount of energy. They are used for radio and television broadcasts and many other purposes. • In radio broadcasts, sounds are encoded in radio waves by changing either the amplitude (AM) or frequency (FM) of the waves. The encoded waves are broadcast from a tower and changed back to sounds by radio receivers. • In television broadcasts, sounds and pictures are encoded in radio waves, broadcast from a tower, and changed back to sounds and pictures by television sets. Observe the three radio waves in the animation at the following URL. Then write a short paragraph comparing and contrasting the three waves. URL • Outline the electromagnetic spectrum. • Describe microwaves and list their uses. • Explain how microwaves are used in cell phone transmissions. • Define radar and explain how it works. This person is pointing a gun at a kid practicing his baseball pitch. But it’s not the type of gun that can be used as a weapon. It’s a radar gun, and it’s used to detect the speed of moving objects. It has measured this pitch to be going at 51 miles per hour. Do you know how a radar gun works? Instead of shooting bullets, it “shoots” electromagnetic waves. 
Defining  Electromagnetic  Waves 	  Electromagnetic waves carry energy through matter or space as vibrating electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic waves have a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies. The complete range is called the electromagnetic spectrum. The Figure 5.93 shows all the waves of the spectrum. The waves used in radar guns are microwaves. 
Defining  Microwaves 	  Find the microwave in the Figure 5.93. A microwave is an electromagnetic wave with a relatively long wavelength and low frequency. Microwaves are often classified as radio waves, but they have higher frequencies than other radio waves. With higher frequencies, they also have more energy. That’s why microwaves are useful for heating food in microwave ovens. Microwaves have other important uses as well, including cell phone transmissions and radar. These uses are described below. You can learn more about microwaves and their uses in the video at this URL: http ://URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Cell  Phones 	  Cell phone signals are carried through the air as microwaves. You can see how this works in the Figure 5.94. A cell phone encodes the sounds of the caller’s voice in microwaves by changing the frequency of the waves. This is called frequency modulation. The encoded microwaves are then sent from the phone through the air to a cell tower. From the cell tower, the waves travel to a switching center. From there they go to another cell tower and from the tower to the receiver of the person being called. The receiver changes the encoded microwaves back to sounds. Q: Cell towers reach high above the ground. Why do you think such tall towers are used? A: Microwaves can be interrupted by buildings and other obstructions, so cell towers must be placed high above the ground to prevent the interruption of cell phone signals. 
Radar 	  Radar stands for radio detection and ranging. In police radar, a radar gun sends out short bursts of microwaves. The microwaves reflect back from oncoming vehicles and are detected by a receiver in the radar gun. The frequency of the reflected waves is used to compute the speed of the vehicles. Radar is also used for tracking storms, detecting air traffic, and other purposes. Q: How are reflected microwaves used to determine the speed of oncoming cars (see Figure 5.95)? A: As the car approaches the radar gun, the reflected microwaves get bunched up in front of the car. Therefore, the waves the receiver detects have a higher frequency than they would if they were being reflected from a stationary object. The faster the car is moving, the greater the increase in the frequency of the waves. This is an example of the Doppler effect, which can also occur with sound waves. 
Summary 	  • Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelength, frequency, and energy. The full range of electromagnetic waves makes up the electromagnetic spectrum. • Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with relatively long wavelengths and low frequencies. They are used for microwave ovens, cell phones, and radar. • A cell phone encodes the sounds of the caller’s voice in microwaves by changing the frequency of the waves.

The slogan originated in Australia in the 1980s, but it has since been adopted in many other places around the globe. It sums up simple steps you can take to protect your skin from sunlight. Sunlight consists of a wide range of electromagnetic waves, some of which are harmful. 
The  Waves in  Sunlight 	  Electromagnetic waves are waves that carry energy through matter or space as vibrating electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic waves have a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies. Sunlight contains the complete range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves, which is called the electromagnetic spectrum. The Figure 5.96 shows all the waves in the spectrum. 
Let  There  Be  Light 	  Light includes infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light. As you can see from the Figure 5.96, light falls roughly in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
It has shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than 	  microwaves, but not as short and high as X rays. Q: Which type of light do you think is harmful to the skin? A: Waves of light with the highest frequencies have the most energy and are harmful to the skin. Use the electromagnetic spectrum in the Figure 5.96 to find out which of the three types of light have the highest frequencies. 
Infrared  Light 	  Light with the longest wavelengths is called infrared light. The term infrared means “below red.” Infrared light is the range of light waves that have longer wavelengths and lower frequencies than red light in the visible range of light waves. The sun gives off infrared light as do flames and living things. You can’t see infrared light waves, but you can feel them as heat. But infrared cameras and night vision goggles can detect infrared light waves and convert them to visible images.

Visible  Light 	  The only light that people can see is called visible light. This light consists of a very narrow range of wavelengths that falls between infrared light and ultraviolet light. Within the visible range, we see light of different wavelengths as different colors of light, from red light, which has the longest wavelength, to violet light, which has the shortest wavelength (see Figure 5.97). When all of the wavelengths of visible light are combined, as they are in sunlight, visible light appears white. You can learn more about visible light at this URL: URL MtC34pzKGc . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Visible light spectrum. 
Ultraviolet  Light 	  Light with wavelengths shorter than visible light is called ultraviolet light. The term ultraviolet means “above violet.” Ultraviolet light is the range of light waves that have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than violet light in the visible range of light. With higher frequencies than visible light, ultraviolet light has more energy. It can be used to kill bacteria in food and to sterilize surgical instruments. The human skin also makes vitamin D when it is exposed to ultraviolet light. Vitamin D, in turn, is needed for strong bones and teeth. You can learn more about ultraviolet light and its discovery at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Too much exposure to ultraviolet light can cause sunburn and skin cancer. As the “slip, slop, slap” slogan suggests, you can protect your skin from ultraviolet light by wearing clothing that covers your skin, applying sunscreen to any exposed areas, and wearing a hat to protect your head from exposure. The SPF, or sun-protection factor, of sunscreen gives a rough idea of how long it protects the skin from sunburn (see Figure 5.98). A sunscreen with a higher SPF value protects the skin longer. Sunscreen must be applied liberally and often to be effective, and no sunscreen is completely waterproof. You can learn more about the dangers of ultraviolet light at this URL: URL om/watch?v=np-BBJyl-go Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: You should apply sunscreen even on cloudy days. Can you explain why? A: Ultraviolet light can travel through clouds, so it can harm unprotected skin even on cloudy days. 
Summary 	  • Sunlight contains the complete range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves. The entire range is called the electromagnetic spectrum. • Electromagnetic waves that are commonly called light fall roughly in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum. Light includes infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light. • Infrared light is light with the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies.

You probably recognize this somewhat startling image as an X-ray image of a human skull. X-rays, which are used to make images like this one, are electromagnetic waves. 
Putting  X- Rays in  Context 	  Electromagnetic waves are vibrating electric and magnetic fields that transfer energy across space as well as through matter. There are several different types of electromagnetic waves that vary in their frequencies and wavelengths. Waves with higher frequencies have more energy. The electromagnetic spectrum pictured in the Figure 5.99 represents the full range of frequencies of electromagnetic waves. 
High  Energy  Waves 	  Electromagnetic waves with the highest frequencies and greatest energy are on the right side of the electromagnetic spectrum in the Figure 5.99. X-rays have more energy than any other electromagnetic waves except gamma rays. For example, X-rays have enough energy to pass through soft tissues such as skin, although not enough to pass through bones and teeth, which are very dense. The bright areas in the skull X-ray shows where X-rays were absorbed by teeth and bones. X-rays are used not only for medical and dental purposes but also to screen luggage at airports (see Figure 5.100). You can learn about the discovery of X-rays as well as other uses of X-rays at this Q: What do the dark areas in an X-ray image represent? A: The dark areas represent materials that do not absorb X-rays. Instead, the X-rays pass through these areas. For example, in the X-ray image pictured in the Figure 5.100, the bag doesn’t show up because X-rays pass through the soft cloth, but not the dense objects inside. 
Dangers of  X- Rays 	  Because X-rays are so energetic, they can penetrate many substances, including living cells. Therefore, too much X-ray exposure can be dangerous. It may damage cells and cause cancer. If you’ve had dental X-rays, you may have noticed that a heavy apron was placed over your body to protect it from stray X-rays. Protective aprons like this are made of lead, which X-rays can’t pass through.

The  Range of  Electromagnetic  Waves 	  Electromagnetic waves transfer energy across space as well as through matter. They vary in their wavelengths and frequencies, and higher-frequency waves have more energy. The full range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves, shown in the Figure 5.101, is called the electromagnetic spectrum. What Are Gamma Rays? As you can see in the Figure 5.101, gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies of all electromagnetic waves. Their wavelengths are shorter than the diameter of atomic nuclei, and their frequencies are greater than 1019 hertz (Hz). That’s 10 quadrillion waves per second! Because of their high frequencies, gamma rays are also the most energetic of all electromagnetic waves. If you want to learn more about gamma rays, watch the video at the URL below.

Sources of  Gamma  Rays 	  Gamma rays are given off by radioactive atoms and nuclear explosions. They are also given off by the sun and other stars, as well as by collapsing stars in gamma ray bursts. Fortunately, gamma rays from space are absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere before they can reach the surface. Q: Predict how gamma rays might affect living things on Earth if they weren’t absorbed by the atmosphere. A: Gamma rays would destroy most living things on Earth because they have so much energy. 
Dangers and  Uses of  Gamma  Rays 	  The extremely high energy of gamma rays allows them to penetrate just about anything. They can even pass through bones and teeth. This makes gamma rays very dangerous. They can destroy living cells, produce gene mutations, and cause cancer. Ironically, the deadly effects of gamma rays can be used to treat cancer. In this type of treatment, a medical device sends out focused gamma rays that target cancerous cells. The gamma rays kill the cells and destroy the cancer. 
Summary 	  • Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths and frequencies. Higher-frequency waves have more energy. • Of all electromagnetic waves, gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies.

Imagine scuba diving and coming upon a jellyfish. Would you be startled if the jellyfish suddenly started to glow with bright yellow light, like the jellyfish in the picture above? If so, then the jellyfish would have done its job. Jellyfish give off light to startle possible predators. The light they emit is visible light. 
The  Light  We  See 	  Visible light includes all the wavelengths of light that the human eye can detect. It allows us to see objects in the world around us. Without visible light, we would only be able to sense most objects by sound, touch, or smell. Like humans, most other organisms also depend on visible light, either directly or indirectly. Many animals—including predators of jellyfish—use visible light to see. Plants and certain other organisms use visible light to make food in the process of photosynthesis. Without this food, most other organisms would not be able to survive. Q: Do you think that some animals might be able to see light that isn’t visible to humans? A: Some animals can see light in the infrared or ultraviolet range of wavelengths. For example, mosquitoes can see infrared light, which is emitted by warm objects. By seeing infrared light, mosquitoes can tell where the warmest, blood-rich areas of the body are located. 
Incandescence 	  Most of the visible light on Earth comes from the sun. The sun and other stars produce light because they are so hot. They glow with light due to their extremely high temperatures. This way of producing light is called incandescence. Incandescent light bulbs also produce light in this way. When electric current passes through a wire filament inside an incandescent bulb, the wire gets so hot that it glows. Do you see the glowing filament inside the incandescent light bulb in the Figure 5.102? Q: What are some other sources of incandescent light? A: Flames also produce incandescent light. For example, burning candles, oil lamps, and bonfires produce light in this way. 
Luminescence 	  Some objects produce light without becoming very hot. They generate light through chemical reactions or other processes. Producing light without heat is called luminescence. Luminescence, in turn, can occur in several different ways: • One type of luminescence is called fluorescence. 
In this process, a substance absorbs shorter-wavelength 	  ultraviolet light and then gives off light in the visible range of wavelengths. Certain minerals produce light in this way, including gemstones such as amethyst, diamond, and emerald. At the following URL, move your mouse over the minerals in the picture to see the magic of fluorescence: URL . • Another type of luminescence is called electroluminescence. In this process, a substance gives off light when an electric current passes through it. Gases such as neon, argon, and krypton produce light by this means. The car dash lights in the Figure 5.103 are produced by electroluminescence. • A third type of luminescence is called bioluminescence. This is the production of light by living things as a result of chemical reactions. The jellyfish in the opening photo above produces light by bioluminescence. So does the firefly in the Figure 5.104. Fireflies give off visible light to attract mates. You can learn more about bioluminescence in the video at this URL: URL erwater_world.html 
Illumination 	  Many other objects appear to produce their own light, but they actually just reflect light from another source. Being lit by another source is called illumination. The moon in the Figure 5.105 is glowing so brightly that you can see shadows under the trees. It appears to glow from its own light, but it’s really just illuminated by light from the sun. Everything you can see that doesn’t produce its own light is illuminated by light from some other source. 
Summary 	  • Visible light includes all the wavelengths of light that the human eye can detect. Humans and virtually all other organisms depend on visible light to survive. Humans and many other animals use it to see. Plants use it to make food for themselves and most other organisms. • Most of the visible light on Earth comes from the sun. The sun produces light because it is so hot. Glowing with visible light because of a high temperature is called incandescence. • Producing light without a high temperature is called luminescence. Types of luminescence include fluorescence, electroluminescence, and bioluminescence. • All objects you can see that do not produce their own light are reflecting light from another source. This is known as illumination. Watch the amazing ocean animals in the video at the following URL. Then write a concise paragraph describing different ways they make use of visible light. URL nts.html Click image to the left or use the URL below. bright? • Identify five different types of artificial lights. • Explain how each type of artificial light produces visible light. What an exciting scene! The picture above shows Times Square in New York City. There are so many artificial lights that it’s almost as bright as day even after the sun has gone down. Sunlight provides most of the visible light on Earth, but artificial lights are also important. That’s obvious to someone in Times Square at night. It’s also obvious to anyone who’s ever experienced a power outage after dark. 
Turn on the  Lights 	  If you’re like most people, you don’t give it a thought when you flick a switch to turn on a light—at least not until the power goes out and you’re left in the dark! When you flick on a light switch, electricity normally flows through the light, and some type of light bulb converts the electrical energy to visible light. This can happen in various ways, depending on the type of light bulb. Several different types of light bulbs are described below. All of them are examples of artificial light, as opposed to natural light from the sun or other sources in nature. 
Incandescent  Light 	  An incandescent light bulb like the one pictured in the Figure 5.106 produces visible light by incandescence. Incandescence occurs when something gets so hot that it glows. An incandescent light bulb contains a thin wire filament made of tungsten. When electric current passes through the filament, it gets extremely hot and emits light. 
Fluorescent  Light 	  A fluorescent light bulb produces visible light by fluorescence. Fluorescence occurs when a substance absorbs shorter-wavelength ultraviolet light and then gives off the energy as visible light. The compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) in the Figure 5.107 contains mercury gas that gives off ultraviolet light when electricity passes through it. The inside of the bulb is coated with a substance called phosphor. Phosphor absorbs the ultraviolet light and then gives off most of the energy as visible light. 
Neon  Light 	  A neon light produces visible light by electroluminescence. In this process, neon or some other gas gives off light when an electric current passes through it. Other halogen gases besides neon—including krypton and argon—also produce light in this way. The word “OPEN” in the sign 5.108 is a neon light. It is a long glass tube that contains neon gas. When electricity passes through the gas, it excites electrons of neon atoms, and the electrons jump to a higher energy level. As the excited electrons return to their original energy level, they give off visible light. Neon produces red light. Other gases produce light of different colors. For example, krypton produces violet light, and argon produces blue light. 
Vapor  Light 	  A vapor light also produces visible light by electroluminescence The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like the streetlight pictured in the Figure 5.109, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. In addition to lighting city streets, vapor lights are used to light highways and stadiums. The bulbs are very bright and long lasting so they are a good choice for these places. 
D  Light 	  LED stands for “light-emitting diode.” An LED light contains a material called a semi-conductor, which gives off visible light when an electric current flows through it. LED lights are used for traffic lights (see Figure 5.110) and also indicator lights on computers, cars, and many other devices. This type of light is very reliable and durable. Q: Some light bulbs produce a lot of heat in addition to visible light, so they waste energy. Other bulbs produce much less heat, so they use energy more efficiently. Which light bulbs described above would you place in each category? A: Incandescent light bulbs, which produce light by incandescence, give off a lot of heat as well as light, so they waste energy. The other light bulbs produce light by some type of luminescence, in which light is produced without heat. These light bulbs use energy more efficiently. Which types of light bulbs do you use? 
Summary 	  • Most artificial lights use electricity for energy and have a light bulb that changes the electrical energy to visible light. The production of visible light can happen in various ways, depending on the type of bulb. • Types of light bulbs include incandescent, fluorescent, neon, vapor, and LED bulbs. They produce light in different ways and have different uses. Incandescent lights use heat to produce visible light, so they are not as energy efficient as the other types of lights.

Finally, write a paragraph addressing the After Reading question. URL h_bulbs.htm • Describe how visible light interacts with matter. • Compare and contrast transparent, translucent, and opaque matter. A mime is an actor who uses movement and facial expressions rather than words to communicate with an audience. The mime in this picture is using a mirror to apply stage makeup that will accentuate her features so she can communicate more expressively. When light strikes a mirror, it is reflected back from the shiny surface. The reflected light forms an image of whatever is in front of the mirror. Reflection is just one way that visible light may interact with matter. 
Reflection 	  Reflection of light occurs when light bounces back from a surface that it cannot pass through. Reflection may be regular or diffuse. • If the surface is very smooth, like a mirror, the reflected light forms a very clear image. This is called regular, or specular, reflection. In the Figure 5.111, the smooth surface of the still water in the pond on the left reflects light in this way. • When light is reflected from a rough surface, the waves of light are reflected in many different directions, so a clear image does not form. This is called diffuse reflection. In the Figure 5.111, the ripples in the water in the picture on the right cause diffuse reflection of the blooming trees. For more details about regular and diffuse reflection, go to this URL: URL 
Transmission 	  Transmission of light occurs when light passes through matter. As light is transmitted, it may pass straight through matter or it may be refracted or scattered as it passes through. • When light is refracted, it changes direction as it passes into a new medium and changes speed. The straw in the Figure 5.112 looks bent where light travels from water to air. Light travels more quickly in air than in water and changes direction. For a detailed explanation of how this happens, watch the animation at this URL: URL • Scattering occurs when light bumps into tiny particles of matter and spreads out in all directions. In the droplets in the air, giving the headlights a “halo” appearance. Q: What might be another example of light scattering? A: When light passes through smoky air, it is scattered by tiny particles of soot. 
Absorption 	  Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption. When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. Q: In hot sunny climates, people often dress in light-colored clothes. Why is this a good idea? A: Light-colored clothes absorb less light and reflect more light than dark-colored clothes, so they keep people cooler. 
Classifying  Matter in  Terms of  Light 	  Matter can be classified on the basis of its interactions with light. Matter may be transparent, translucent, or opaque. An example of each type of matter is pictured in the Figure 5.114. • Transparent matter is matter that transmits light without scattering it. Examples of transparent matter include air, pure water, and clear glass. You can see clearly through transparent objects, such as the top panes of the window 5.114, because just about all of the light that strikes them passes through to the other side. • Translucent matter is matter that transmits light but scatters the light as it passes through. Light passes through translucent objects but you cannot see clearly through them because the light is scattered in all directions. The frosted glass panes at the bottom of the window 5.114 are translucent. • Opaque matter is matter that does not let any light pass through it. Matter may be opaque because it absorbs light, reflects light, or does some combination of both. Examples of opaque objects are objects made of wood, like the shutters in the Figure 5.115. The shutters absorb most of the light that strikes them and reflect just a few wavelengths of visible light. The glass mirror 5.115 is also opaque. That’s because it reflects all of the light that strikes it. 
Summary 	  • Reflection of light occurs when light bounces back from a surface that it cannot pass through. If the surface is very smooth, the reflected light forms an image. • Transmission of light occurs when light passes through matter. As light is transmitted, it may pass straight through matter or it may be refracted or scattered by matter. • Absorption of light occurs when light transfers its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. The temperature of matter increases with the added energy. • Matter can be classified as transparent, translucent, or opaque depending on how it interacts with light.

This rainbow contains all the colors that you can see in the land below it—the yellow of the hills, the green of the leaves and grasses. It contains other colors as well. In fact, a rainbow contains all of the colors of visible light. 
Wavelength and  Color 	  Visible light is light that has wavelengths that can be detected by the human eye. The wavelength of visible light determines the color that the light appears. As you can see in the Figure 5.116, light with the longest wavelength appears red, and light with the shortest wavelength appears violet. In between are all the other colors of light that we can see. Only seven main colors of light are actually represented in the diagram. 
Separating  Colors of  Light 	  A prism, like the one in the Figure 5.117, can be used to separate visible light into its different colors. A prism is a pyramid-shaped object made of transparent matter, usually clear glass or plastic. Matter that is transparent allows light to pass through it. A prism transmits light but slows it down. When light passes from air to the glass of the prism, the change in speed causes the light to change direction and bend. Different wavelengths of light bend at different angles. This makes the beam of light separate into light of different wavelengths. What we see is a rainbow of colors. For an animated version of the prism below, go to this URL: URL ersion_conceptual_waves.gif Q: Look back at the rainbow that opened this article. Do you see all the different colors of light, from red at the top to violet at the bottom? What causes a rainbow to form? A: Individual raindrops act as tiny prisms. They separate sunlight into its different wavelengths and create a rainbow of colors. 
Colors of  Objects 	  An opaque object is one that doesn’t let light pass through it. Instead, it reflects or absorbs the light that strikes it. Many objects, such as the leaves pictured in the Figure 5.118, reflect just one or a few wavelengths of visible light and absorb the rest. The wavelengths that are reflected determine the color that an object appears to the human eye. For example, the leaves appear green because they reflect green light and absorb light of other wavelengths. A transparent or translucent material, such as window glass, transmits some or all of the light that strikes it. This means that the light passes through the material rather than being reflected by it. In this case, we see the material because of the transmitted light. Therefore, the wavelength of the transmitted light determines the color that the object appears. Look at the beautiful stained glass windows in the Figure 5.119. The different colors of glass transmit light of different colors. The color of light that strikes an object may also affect the color that the object appears. For example, if only blue light strikes green leaves, the blue light is absorbed and no light is reflected. Q: What color do you see if an object absorbs all of the light that strikes it? A: When all of the light is absorbed, none is reflected, so the object looks black. But black isn’t a color of light. Black is the absence of light. 
The  Colors  We  See 	  The human eye can distinguish only red, green, and blue light. These three colors are called the primary colors of light. All other colors of light can be created by combining the primary colors. Look at the Venn diagram 5.120. Red and green light combine to form yellow light. Red and blue light combine to form magenta light, and blue and green light combine to form cyan light. Yellow, magenta, and cyan are called the secondary colors of light. Look at the center of the diagram, where all three primary colors of light combine. The result is white light. You can explore the colors of visible light and how they combine at this URL: URL l 
Pigments 	  Many objects have color because they contain pigments. A pigment is a substance that colors materials by reflecting light of certain wavelengths and absorbing light of other wavelengths. A very common pigment is the dark green pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in plants. Chlorophyll absorbs all but green wavelengths of visible light. Pigments are also found in many manufactured products. They are used to color paints, inks, and dyes. Just three pigments, called primary pigments, can be combined to produce all other colors. The primary colors of pigments are the same as the secondary colors of light: cyan, magenta, and yellow. Q: A color printer needs just three colors of ink to print all of the colors that we can see. Which colors are they? A: The three colors of ink in a color printer are the three primary pigment colors: cyan, magenta, and yellow. These three colors can be combined in different ratios to produce all other colors, so they are the only colors needed for full-color printing. 
Summary 	  • The wavelength of visible light determines the color that the light appears. Light with the longest wavelength appears red, and light with the shortest wavelength appears violet. In between are the wavelengths of all the other colors of light. • A prism separates visible light into its different colors. As light passes through the prism, it slows and bends, but different wavelengths bend at different angles.

These dancers are practicing in front of a mirror so they can see how they look as they performs. They’re watching their image in the mirror as they dance. What is an image, and how does it get “inside” a mirror? In this article, you’ll find out. 
Reflected  Light and  Images 	  Reflection is one of several ways that light can interact with matter. Light reflects off surfaces such as mirrors that do not transmit or absorb light. When light is reflected from a smooth surface, it may form an image. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reflected (or refracted) light. Q: Is an image an actual object? If not, what is it? A: No, an image isn’t an actual object. It is focused rays of light that make a copy of an object, like a picture projected on a screen. 
Regular and  Diffuse  Reflection 	  If a surface is extremely smooth, as it is in a mirror, then the image formed by reflection is sharp and clear. This is called regular reflection (also called specular reflection). However, if the surface is even slightly rough or bumpy, an image may not form, or if there is an image, it is blurry or fuzzy. This is called diffuse reflection. Q: Look at the boats and their images in the Figure 5.122. Which one represents regular reflection, and which one represents diffuse reflection? A: Reflection of the boat on the left is regular reflection. The water is smooth and the image is sharp and clear. Reflection of the boat on the right is diffuse reflection. The water has ripples and the image is blurry and wavy. In the Figure 5.123, you can see how both types of reflection occur. Waves of light are represented by arrows called rays. Rays that strike the surface are referred to as incident rays, and rays that reflect off the surface are known as reflected rays. In regular reflection, all the rays are reflected in the same direction. This explains why regular reflection forms a clear image. In diffuse reflection, the rays are reflected in many different directions. This is why diffuse reflection forms, at best, a blurry image. You can see animations of both types of reflection at this URL: http ://toolboxes.flexiblelearning.net.au/demosites/series5/508/Laboratory/StudyNotes/snReflectionMirrors.htm 
Law of  Reflection 	  One thing is true of both regular and diffuse reflection. The angle at which the reflected rays leave the surface is equal to the angle at which the incident rays strike the surface. This is known as the law of reflection. The law is illustrated in the Figure 5.124 and also in this animation: URL According to the law of reflection, the angle of reflection always equals the angle of incidence. The angles of both reflected and incident light are measured relative to an imaginary line, called normal, that is perpendicular (at right angles) to the reflective surface. 
Summary 	  • Reflection is one of several ways that light can interact with matter. When light is reflected from a smooth surface, it may form an image. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reflected (or refracted) light. • Regular reflection occurs when light reflects off a very smooth surface and forms a clear image. Diffuse reflection occurs when light reflects off a rough surface and forms a blurry image or no image at all. • According to the law of reflection, the angle at which light rays reflect off a surface is equal to the angle at which the incident rays strike the surface. At the following URL, review the law of reflection and watch the animation. Then fill in the blanks in the sentence below. URL reflection or diffuse reflection? How do you know? • Explain how mirrors form images. • Distinguish between real and virtual images. • Describe the images formed by plane, concave, and convex mirrors. What does this picture show? Is it a photo of identical twin sisters, or is it just one girl looking in a mirror? The picture shows a single girl and her mirror image. 
How  Mirrors  Form  Images 	  A mirror is typically made of glass with a shiny metal backing that reflects all the light that strikes it. When a mirror reflects light, it forms an image. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reflection or refraction. Mirrors may have flat or curved surfaces. The shape of a mirror’s surface determines the type of image it forms. For example, some mirrors form real images, and other mirrors form virtual images. What’s the difference between real and virtual images? • A real image forms in front of a mirror where reflected light rays actually meet. It is a true image that could be projected on a screen. • A virtual image appears to be on the other side of the mirror. Of course, reflected rays don’t actually go through the mirror to the other side, so a virtual image doesn’t really exist. It just appears to exist to the human brain. Q: Look back at the image of the girl pointing at her image in the mirror. Which type of image is it, real or virtual? A: The image of the girl is a virtual image. It appears to be on the other side of the mirror from the girl. 
Plane  Mirror 	  The mirror in the opening photo is a plane mirror. This is the most common type of mirror. It has a flat reflective surface and forms only virtual images. The image formed by a plane mirror is also right-side up and life sized. But something is different about the image compared with the real object in front of the mirror. Left and right are reversed. Look at the girl brushing her teeth in the Figure 5.127. She is using her left hand to brush her teeth, but her image (on the left) appears to be brushing her teeth with the right hand. All plane mirrors reverse left and right in this way. The term mirror image refers to how left and right are reversed in an image compared with the object. 
Concave  Mirror 	  Some mirrors have a curved rather than flat surface. Curved mirrors can be concave or convex. A concave mirror is shaped like the inside of a bowl. This type of mirror forms either real or virtual images, depending on where the object is placed relative to the focal point. The focal point is the point in front of the mirror where the reflected rays meet. You can see how concave mirrors form images in the Figure 5.128 and at the following URL. Concave mirrors are used behind car headlights. They focus the light and make it brighter. Concave mirrors are also used in some telescopes. URL 
Convex  Mirror 	  The other type of curved mirror, a convex mirror, is shaped like the outside of a bowl. Because of its shape, it can gather and reflect light from a wide area. As you can see in the Figure 5.129, a convex mirror forms only virtual images that are right-side up and smaller than the actual object. You can see how a convex mirror forms an image in the animation at this URL: URL Q: Convex mirrors are used as side mirrors on cars. You can see one in the Figure 5.130. Why is a convex mirror good for this purpose? A: Because it gathers light over a wide area, a convex mirror gives the driver a wider view of the area around the vehicle than a plane mirror would. 
Summary 	  • When a mirror reflects light, it forms an image. An image is a copy of an object formed by reflection (or refraction). A real image is a true image that forms in front of a mirror where reflected light rays actually meet. A virtual image appears to be on the other side of the mirror and doesn’t really exist. • Most mirrors are plane mirrors that have a flat reflective surface. A plane mirror forms only virtual, right-side up, and life-sized images. • A concave mirror is shaped like the inside of a bowl. The type of image it forms depends on where the object is relative to the focal point. The image may be real, upside down, and reduced in size; or it may be virtual, right-side up, and enlarged. • A convex mirror is shaped like the outside of a bowl. It forms only virtual images that are right-side up and reduced in size relative to the object. At the following URL, review how a plane mirror forms an image, and watch the animation.

Is this some kind of magic trick? Or is this straw really broken where it enters the water? The answer to both questions is no. There’s nothing wrong with the straw, and no magic is involved. It’s simply how light may behave when it enters a new medium. 
Speed of  Light and  Matter 	  Light always travels at the same speed across space. That speed, represented by the letter c, is about 300 million meters per second. However, when light travels through a medium, it travels more slowly. The speed varies for different kinds of matter. The Table 5.5 gives the speed of visible light in six different materials. 
Diamond 	  Speed of Visible Light (m/s) Q: Predict the speed of visible light through vinegar. A: Vinegar is mostly water, so if you predicted that the speed of light through vinegar would be close to its speed through water, you are correct. The speed of visible light through Heinz® vinegar is about 230 million m/s. 
Bending  Light 	  When light passes from one medium to another, it changes speed. For example, when light passes from air to glass, it slows down. If light strikes a sheet of glass at a 90° angle, or perpendicular to the glass, it slows down but still passes straight through the glass. However, if light enters the glass at an angle other than 90°, the light bends as it slows down. The bending of light as it changes speed in a new medium is called refraction. The Figure 5.132 shows how refraction occurs. Notice that the speed of light changes again as it passes from the glass back to the air. In this case, the speed increases, and the ray of light resumes its initial direction. For a more detailed explanation of refraction, watch this video: URL . What’s Your Angle? The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium depends on its change in speed. The greater the change in speed, the greater the angle of refraction is. For example, light refracts more when it passes from air to diamond than it does when it passes from air to water. That’s because the speed of light is slower in diamond than it is in water. Q: Now can you explain why the straw in the opening image appears to be broken where it enters the water? A: The straw appears to be broken because of refraction. Light slows down and bends when it passes from the water in the glass to the air on its way to your eyes. 
Summary 	  • Light always travels at the same speed through empty space. That speed, represented by the letter c, is about • If light passes from one medium to another at an angle other than 90 °, the light changes speed and bends. This bending of light is called refraction. • The angle at which light refracts when it enters a different medium depends on its change in speed. The greater the change in speed, the greater the angle of refraction is. Have you ever seen a mirage? At the following URL, explore how refraction forms a mirage.

The tiny object on this man’s finger is life-changing for him. It lets him see clearly without wearing glasses. You probably recognize the object as a contact lens. You may even wear contact lenses yourself. What Is a Lens? A lens is a transparent object with one or two curved surfaces. It is typically made of glass (or clear plastic in the case of a contact lens). A lens refracts, or bends, light and forms an image. An image is a copy of an objected formed by the refraction (or reflection) of visible light. The more curved the surface of a lens is, the more it refracts the light that passes through it. There are two basic types of lenses: concave and convex. The two types of lenses have different shapes, so they bend light and form images in different ways. 
Concave  Lens 	  A concave lens is thicker at the edges than it is in the middle. You can see the shape of a concave lens in the Figure it. Note that the image formed by a concave lens is on the same side of the lens as the object. It is also smaller than the object and right-side up. However, it isn’t a real image. It is a virtual image. Your brain “tricks” you into seeing an image there. The light rays actually pass through the glass to the other side and spread out in all directions. You can explore the formation of images by a concave lens at this URL: URL eometric-optics_en.html 
Convex  Lens 	  A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges. You can see the shape of a convex lens in the Figure 5.134. A convex lens causes rays of light to converge, or meet, at a point called the focus (F). A convex lens forms either a real or virtual image. It depends on how close the object is to the lens relative to the focus. You can interact with an animated convex lens at this URL: URL Q: An example of a convex lens is a hand lens. Which of the three convex lens diagrams in the Figure 5.134 shows how a hand lens makes an image? A: You’ve probably looked through a hand lens before. If you have, then you know that the image it produces is right-side up. Therefore, the first diagram must show how a hand lens makes an image. It’s the only one that produces a right-side up image. 
Summary 	  • A lens is a transparent object, typically made of glass, with one or two curved surfaces. A lens refracts light and forms an image. • A concave lens is thicker at the edges than it is in the middle. This causes rays of light to diverge. The light forms a virtual image that is right-side up and smaller than the object. • A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges. This causes rays of light to converge. The light forms a real or virtual image depending on the distance of the object from the lens. At the following URL, vary the location of the object in the animation and observe what happens to the image. What can you infer from your observations? URL • Define optics. • Explain how optical instruments form images. • Describe how lasers and optical fibers work. This colorful burst of “spaghetti” is really a bundle of optical fibers. These are hair-thin threads of glass that transmit laser light that has been encoded with messages. Optical fibers are a crucial component of modern communications. The use of light in devices such as these is possible because of optics. 
Optics and  Optical  Instruments 	  Optics is the study of visible light and the ways it can be used to extend human vision and do other tasks. Knowledge of light was needed for the invention of optical instruments such as microscopes, telescopes, and cameras, in addition to optical fibers. These instruments use mirrors and lenses to reflect and refract light and form images. Q: What is an image? A: An image is a copy of an object created by the reflection or refraction of visible light. 
Light  Microscope 	  A light microscope is an instrument that uses lenses to make enlarged images of objects that are too small for the unaided eye to see. A common type of light microscope is a compound microscope, like the one shown in the more eyepiece lenses. The objective lenses are close to the object being viewed. They form an enlarged image of the object inside the microscope. The eyepiece lenses are close to the viewer’s eyes. They form an enlarged image of the first image. The magnifications of all the lenses are multiplied together to yield the overall magnification of the microscope. Some light microscopes can magnify objects more than 1000 times! For more on light microscopes and the images they create, watch the video at this URL: URL Q: How has the microscope advanced scientific knowledge? A: The microscope has revealed secrets of the natural world like no other single invention. The microscope let scientists see entire new worlds, leading to many discoveries—especially in biology and medicine—that could not have been made without it. Some examples include the discovery of cells and the identification of bacteria and other single-celled organisms. With the development of more powerful microscopes, viruses were discovered and even atoms finally became visible. These discoveries changed our ideas about the human body and the nature of life itself. 
Telescope 	  Like microscopes, telescopes use convex lenses to make enlarged images. However, telescopes make enlarged images of objects—such as distant stars—that only appear tiny because they are very far away. There are two basic types of telescopes: reflecting telescopes and refracting telescopes. The two types are compared in the Figure 5.136. They differ in how they collect light, but both use convex lenses to form enlarged images. You can learn more about telescopes and how they evolved in the video at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Camera 	  A camera is an optical instrument that forms and records an image of an object. The image may be recorded on film or it may be detected by an electronic sensor that stores the image digitally. Regardless of how the image is recorded, all cameras form images in the same basic way, as shown in the Figure 5.137. • Light passes through the lens at the front of the camera and enters the camera through an opening called the aperture. • As light passes through the lens, it forms a reduced real image. The image focuses on film (or a sensor) at the back of the camera. The lens may be moved back and forth to bring the image into focus. • The shutter controls the amount of light that actually strikes the film (or sensor). It stays open longer in dim light to let more light in. For a series of animations showing how a camera works, go to this URL: URL -3.html 
Lasers 	  Did you ever see a cat chase after a laser light, like the one in Figure 5.138? A laser is a device that produces a very focused beam of visible light of just one wavelength and color. Waves of laser light are synchronized so the crests and troughs of the waves line up. The diagram in Figure 5.138 shows why a beam of laser light is so focused compared with ordinary light from a flashlight. The following Figure 5.139 provides a closer look at the tube where laser light is created. Electrons in a material such as a ruby crystal are stimulated to radiate photons of light of one wavelength. At each end of the tube is a concave mirror. The photons of light reflect back and forth in the tube off these mirrors. This focuses the light. The mirror at one end of the tube is partly transparent. A constant stream of photons passes through the transparent part, forming the laser beam. You can see an animation showing how a laser works at this URL: URL om/watch?v=gUbBzEXlEho Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Optical  Fibers 	  Besides entertaining a cat, laser light has many other uses. One use is carrying communication signals in optical fibers. Sounds or pictures are encoded in pulses of laser light, which are then sent through an optical fiber. All of the light reflects off the inside of the fiber, so none of it escapes. As a result, the signal remains strong even over long distances. More than one signal can travel through an optical fiber at the same time, as you can see in the Figure Q: When lasers were invented in 1960, they were called "a solution looking for a problem.” Since then, they have been put to thousands of different uses. Can you name other ways that lasers are used? A: The first widespread use of lasers was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974. The compact disc (CD) player was the first laser-equipped device commonly used by consumers, starting in 1982. The CD player was 
The optical fiber in the diagram is much 	  larger than a real optical fiber, which is only about as wide as a human hair. quickly followed by the laser printer. Some other uses of lasers include bloodless surgery, cutting and welding of metals, guiding missiles, thermometers, laser light shows, and acne treatments. 
Summary 	  • Optics is the study of visible light and the ways it can be used to extend human vision and do other tasks. Optical instruments are based on optics. They use mirrors and lenses to reflect and refract light and form images. • The light microscope and telescope use convex lenses and mirrors to make enlarged images of very tiny or distant objects. A camera uses a convex lens to make a reduced image of an object. • A laser is a device that produces a very focused beam of visible light of just one wavelength and color. Pulses of laser light carry communication signals through optical fibers. At the following URL, practice using a telescope with the telescope simulator. Select an object to view, and then try different combinations of aperture and eyepiece size. For each combination, adjust the focus until the image is sharp and clear. Make a data table to record 10 different combinations of aperture and eyepiece size and the resulting magnification. Draw one conclusion based on the data in your completed table. URL Draw a sketch as a visual aid. • Describe how the eye collects and focuses light. • Explain the role of the brain in vision. Did you ever hear the proverb, “the eyes are the windows to the soul”? While it’s true that our eyes often express what we are thinking or feeling, they are windows in another sense as well. Like windows made of glass, the eyes let light in and allow us to see. 
Structure and  Function of the  Eye 	  The human eye is an organ that is specialized to collect light and focus images. The structures of the human eye are shown in the Figure 5.141. Examine each structure in the diagram as you read about it below. • The sclera, also known as the white of the eye, is an opaque outer covering that protects the eye. It keeps light out of the eye except at the center front of the eye. • The cornea is a transparent outer covering of the front of the eye. It protects the eye and also acts as a convex lens. A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges and makes rays of light converge, or meet at a point. The shape of the cornea helps focus light that enters the eye. • The pupil is an opening in the front of the eye. It looks black because it doesn’t reflect any light. All the light passes through it instead. The pupil controls the amount of light that enters the eye. It automatically gets bigger or smaller to let more or less light in as needed. • The iris is the colored part of the eye. It controls the size of the pupil. • The lens of the eye is a convex lens. It fine-tunes the focus so an image forms on the retina at the back of the eye. Tiny muscles control the shape of the lens to focus images of close or distant objects. • The retina is a membrane lining the back of the eye. The retina has nerve cells called rods and cones that change images to electrical signals. Rods are good at sensing dim light but can’t distinguish different colors of light. Cones can sense colors but not dim light. There are three different types of cones. Each type senses one of the three primary colors of light (red, green, or blue). • The optic nerve carries electrical signals from the rods and cones to the brain. Q: The lens of the eye is a convex lens. How would vision be affected if the lens of the eye was concave instead of convex? A: A concave lens causes rays of light to diverge, or spread apart. It forms a virtual image on the same side of the lens at the object being viewed. Therefore, a concave lens would focus the image in front of the eye, not on the retina inside the eye. No signals would be sent to the brain so vision would not be possible. 
How  We  See 	  The ability to see is called vision. This ability depends on more than healthy eyes. It also depends on certain parts of the brain, because the brain and eyes work together to allow us to see. The eyes collect and focus visible light. The lens and other structures of the eye work together to focus an image on the retina. The image is upside-down and reduced in size, as you can see in the Figure 5.142. Cells in the retina change the image to electrical signals that travel to the brain through the optic nerve. The brain interprets the electrical signals as shape, color, and brightness. It also interprets the image as though it were right-side up. The brain does this automatically, so what we see always appears right-side up. The brain also interprets what we are seeing. Q: The part of the brain that processes information from the eyes is the visual cortex. It is located at the back of the brain. How might an injury to the visual cortex affect vision? A: An injury to the visual cortex might cause abnormal vision or even blindness regardless of how well the eyes can gather and focus light. 
Summary 	  • The human eye is an organ that is specialized to collect light and focus images. Light enters through transparent structures at the front of the eye. It is focused by the cornea and lens on the retina at the back of the eye. • The ability to see is called vision. The brain and eyes work together to allow us to see. The eyes collect and focus visible light and change it to electrical signals that travel to the brain. The brain interprets the signals and “tells” us what we are seeing.

URL Single-Bulb Simulation: Red-Green-Blue Bulbs Simulation: • Identify common vision problems. • Explain how lenses can correct vision problems. If you’ve ever had your vision checked, you’ve no doubt been asked to read an eye chart like the one in this cartoon. The patient in the cartoon must be having trouble making out the letters in the second row of the chart, because he asks the doctor for a hint (in the style of a popular TV game show). The patient clearly has a vision problem. 
Problems with  Vision 	  Many people have problems with their vision, or ability to see. Often, the problem is due to the shape of the eyes and how they focus light. Two of the most common vision problems are nearsightedness and farsightedness, which you can read about below. You may even have one of these vision problems yourself. Usually, the problems can be corrected with contact lenses or lenses in eyeglasses. In many people, they can also be corrected with laser surgery, which reshapes the outer layer of the eye. For a video about vision problems, go to this URL: URL om/watch?v=ekSGbXt4XdI Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Nearsightedness 	  Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the condition in which nearby objects are seen clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. The Figure 5.143 shows how it occurs. The eyeball is longer (from front to back) than normal. This causes images to be focused in front of the retina instead of on the retina. Myopia can be corrected with concave lenses. The lenses focus images farther back in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of in front of it. Q: Sometimes squinting the eyes can help someone see more clearly. Why do you think this works? A: Squinting may improve focus by slightly changing the shape of the eyes. When you squint, you tighten muscles around the eyes, putting pressure on the eyeballs. 
Farsightedness 	  Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure 5.144). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. Q: Joey has hyperopia. When is he more likely to need his glasses: when he reads a book or when he watches TV? A: With hyperopia, Joey is farsighted. He can probably see the TV more clearly than the words in a book because the TV is farther away. Therefore, he is more likely to need his glasses when he reads than when he watches TV.

A lightning bolt is like the spark that gives you a shock when you touch a metal doorknob. Of course, the lightning bolt is on a much larger scale. But both the lightning bolt and spark are a sudden transfer of electric charge. 
Introducing  Electric  Charge 	  Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge, and an electron has a negative electric charge. In the Figure 5.145, you can see that positively charged protons (+) are located in the nucleus of the atom, while negatively charged electrons (-) move around the nucleus. 
Electric  Force 	  When it comes to electric charges, opposites attract, so positive and negative particles attract each other. You can see this in the Figure 5.146. This attraction explains why negative electrons keep moving around the positive nucleus of the atom. Like charges, on the other hand, repel each other, so two positive or two negative charges push apart. This is also shown in the diagram. The attraction or repulsion between charged particles is called electric force. The strength of electric force depends on the amount of electric charge on the particles and the distance between them. Larger charges or shorter distances result in greater force. You can experiment with electric force with the animation at the following URL. URL Q: How do positive protons stay close together inside the nucleus of the atom if like charges repel each other? A: Other, stronger forces in the nucleus hold the protons together. 
Summary 	  • Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching. • Particles that have opposite charges attract each other. Particles that have like charges repel each other. The force of attraction or repulsion is called electric force. Read the first four boxes of text at the following URL.

This science fiction image shows a human hand surrounded by a green force field. It’s supposed to represent an electric field generated by a hand. What is an electric field? Read on to find out. What Is an Electric Field? An electric field is a space around a charged particle where the particle exerts electric force on other charged particles. Because of their force fields, charged particles can exert force on each other without actually touching. Electric fields are generally represented by arrows, as you can see in the Figure 5.147. The arrows show the direction of electric force around a positive particle and a negative particle. For an animated diagram, go to this URL: URL cw.mit.edu/ans7870/8/8.02T/f04/visualizations/electrostatics/15-CreateField/CreateField_640.mpg 
Interacting  Electric  Fields 	  When charged particles are close enough to exert force on each other, their electric fields interact. This is illustrated in the Figure 5.148. The lines of force bend together when particles with different charges attract each other. The lines bend apart when particles with like charges repel each other. At the following URL, play “Electric Field of Dreams” to experience interacting fields of two or more charged particles. URL /Physics/Electric_Forces_Fields.html Note: +q = positive charge and –q = negative charge Q: What would the lines of force look like around two negative particles? A: They would look like the lines around two positive particles, except the arrows would point toward, rather than away from, the negative particles.

Particles with opposite charges attract each other. Particles with like charges repel each other. Play electric field hockey at the following URL until you score at least one goal. Then write a brief paragraph describing what you did to score a goal. URL • Describe how the transfer of electrons changes the charge of matter. • Relate the transfer of electrons to the law of conservation of charge. • Compare and contrast three ways that electric charge can be transferred. Why is this girl’s hair standing straight up? She is touching a device called a van de Graaff generator. The dome on top of the device has a negative electric charge. When the girl places her hand on the dome, she becomes negatively charged as well—right down to the tip of each hair! You can see a video demonstrating a van de Graff generator at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: What causes the hair to stand on end? A: All of the hairs have all become negatively charged, and like charges repel each other. Therefore, the hairs are pushing away from each other, causing them to stand on end. 
Transferring  Electrons 	  The girl pictured above became negatively charged because electrons flowed from the van de Graaff generator to her. Whenever electrons are transferred between objects, neutral matter becomes charged. This occurs even with individual atoms. Atoms are neutral in electric charge because they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons. However, if atoms lose or gain electrons, they become charged particles called ions. You can see how this happens in the Figure 5.149. When an atom loses electrons, it becomes a positively charged ion, or cation. When an atom gains electrons, it becomes a negative charged ion, or anion. 
Conservation of  Charge 	  Like the formation of ions, the formation of charged matter in general depends on the transfer of electrons, either between two materials or within a material. Three ways this can occur are referred to as conduction, polarization, and friction. All three ways are described below. However, regardless of how electrons are transferred, the total charge always remains the same. Electrons move, but they aren’t destroyed. This is the law of conservation of charge. 
Conduction 	  The transfer of electrons from the van de Graaff generator to the man is an example of conduction. Conduction occurs when there is direct contact between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. A van de Graff generator produces a negative charge on its dome, so it tends to give up electrons. Human hands are positively charged, so they tend to accept electrons. Therefore, electrons flow from the dome to the man’s hand when they are in contact. You don’t need a van de Graaff generator for conduction to take place. It may occur when you walk across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes. Wool tends to give up electrons and rubber tends to accept them. Therefore, the carpet transfers electrons to your shoes each time you put down your foot. The transfer of electrons results in you becoming negatively charged and the carpet becoming positively charged. 
Polarization 	  Assume that you have walked across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes and become negatively charged. If you then reach out to touch a metal doorknob, electrons in the neutral metal will be repelled and move away from your hand before you even touch the knob. In this way, one end of the doorknob becomes positively charged and the other end becomes negatively charged. This is called polarization. Polarization occurs whenever electrons within a neutral object move because of the electric field of a nearby charged object. It occurs without direct contact between the two objects. The Figure 5.150 models how polarization occurs. Q: What happens when the negatively charged plastic rod in the diagram is placed close to the neutral metal plate? A: Electrons in the plate are repelled by the positive charges in the rod. The electrons move away from the rod, causing one side of the plate to become positively charged and the other side to become negatively charged. 
Friction 	  Did you ever rub an inflated balloon against your hair? You can see what happens in the Figure 5.151. Friction between the balloon and hair cause electrons from the hair to “rub off” on the balloon. That’s because a balloon attracts electrons more strongly than hair does. After the transfer of electrons, the balloon becomes negatively charged and the hair becomes positively charged. The individual hairs push away from each other and stand on end because like charges repel each other. The balloon and the hair attract each other because opposite charges attract. Electrons are transferred in this way whenever there is friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. Watch the animation “Balloons and Static Electricity” at the following URL to see how electrons are transferred by friction between a sweater and a balloon. URL c_Forces_Fields.html Q: If you rub a balloon against a wall, it may stick to the wall. Explain why. A: Electrons are transferred from the wall to the balloon, making the balloon negatively charged and the wall positively charged. The balloon sticks to the wall because opposite charges attract. 
Summary 	  • Whenever electrons are transferred between objects, neutral matter becomes charged. For example, when atoms lose or gain electrons they become charged particles called ions. • Three ways electrons can be transferred are conduction, friction, and polarization. In each case, the total charge remains the same. This is the law of conservation of charge. • Conduction occurs when there is direct contact between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. • Polarization is the movement of electrons within a neutral object due to the electric field of a nearby charged object. It occurs without direct contact between the two objects. • Electrons are transferred whenever there is friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons.

(Hint: Plastic tends to accept electrons and tissue paper tends to give up electrons.) • Describe static electricity. • Explain static discharge. • Outline how lightning occurs. You’re a thoughtful visitor, so you wipe your feet on the welcome mat before you reach out to touch the brass knocker on the door. Ouch! A spark suddenly jumps between your hand and the metal, and you feel an electric shock. Q: Why do you think an electric shock occurs? A: An electric shock occurs when there is a sudden discharge of static electricity. What Is Static Electricity? Static electricity is a buildup of electric charges on objects. Charges build up when negative electrons are transferred from one object to another. The object that gives up electrons becomes positively charged, and the object that accepts the electrons becomes negatively charged. This can happen in several ways. One way electric charges can build up is through friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. When you wipe your rubber-soled shoes on the wool mat, for example, electrons rub off the mat onto your shoes. As a result of this transfer of electrons, positive charges build up on the mat and negative charges build up on you. Once an object becomes electrically charged, it is likely to remain charged until it touches another object or at least comes very close to another object. That’s because electric charges cannot travel easily through air, especially if the air is dry. Q: You’re more likely to get a shock in the winter when the air is very dry. Can you explain why? A: When the air is very dry, electric charges are more likely to build up objects because they cannot travel easily through the dry air. This makes a shock more likely when you touch another object. 
Static  Discharge 	  What happens when you have become negatively charged and your hand approaches the metal doorknocker? Your negatively charged hand repels electrons in the metal, so the electrons move to the other side of the knocker. This makes the side of the knocker closest to your hand positively charged. As your negatively charged hand gets very close to the positively charged side of the metal, the air between your hand and the knocker also becomes electrically charged. This allows electrons to suddenly flow from your hand to the knocker. The sudden flow of electrons is static discharge. The discharge of electrons is the spark you see and the shock you feel. Watch the animation “John Travoltage” at the following URL to see an example of static electricity and static discharge. URL 
How  Lightning  Occurs 	  Another example of static discharge, but on a much larger scale, is lightning. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram ( Figure 5.152) and animation as you read about it below. URL During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of positive and negative charge due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds, and the positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground beneath them, so the ground below the clouds becomes positively charged. At first, the atmosphere prevents electrons from flowing away from areas of negative charge and toward areas of positive charge. As more charges build up, however, the air between the oppositely charged areas also becomes charged. When this happens, static electricity is discharged as bolts of lightning. At the URL below, you can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike. Be sure to wait for the real-time lightning strike at the end of the video. You’ll be amazed when you realize how much has occurred during that split-second discharge of static electricity. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • Static electricity is a buildup of electric charges on objects. It occurs when electrons are transferred from one object to another. • A sudden flow of electrons from one charged object to another is called static discharge. • Examples of static discharge include lightning and the shock you sometimes feel when you touch another object.

He’s attaching cables to the terminals of the car battery. Then he will connect the other ends of the cables to the terminals of a “live” battery. The cables will carry electric current to the dead battery, providing the energy needed for the car to start. 
Flowing  Charges 	  Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charges (electrons). Current is measured as the amount of charge that flows past a given point in a certain amount of time. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), or amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction (direct current), or it may keep reversing direction (alternating current). You can watch an animation of electric current at this URL: URL ectric_current/index.html Q: Why do you think charges flow in an electric current? A: Electric charges flow when they have electric potential energy. Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape. 
Electric  Potential  Energy 	  Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. 
Voltage 	  For an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential energy between the two positions. A difference in electric potential energy is called voltage. The SI unit for voltage is the volt (V). Look at the Figure 5.153. It shows a simple circuit. The source of voltage in the circuit is a 1.5-volt battery. The difference of 1.5 volts between the two battery terminals results in a spontaneous flow of charges, or electric current, between them. Notice that the current flows from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, because electric current is a flow of electrons. Q: You might put a 1.5-volt battery in a TV remote. The battery in a car is a 12-volt battery. How do you think the current of a 12-volt battery compares to the current of a 1.5-volt battery? A: Greater voltage means a greater difference in potential energy, so the 12-volt battery can produce more current than the 1.5-volt battery. 
Summary 	  • Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charges. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A). • An electric charge flows when it has electric potential energy due to its position in an electric field. An electric charge always moves spontaneously from a position of higher to lower potential energy. • For an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential energy between the two positions. This difference is called voltage. The SI unit for voltage is the volt (V). Watch the animation at the following URL, and then answer the questions below. URL m/media/item.action;jsessionid=F8363688D2EB985E8D7DE56E99426EED?quick=110 terminals. • Distinguish between direct current and alternating current. To use an electric appliance, you have to plug it into an outlet unless it has batteries. This may be all you need to know in order to use electric current. But did you ever wonder what electric current is or how it flows through wires inside the walls of your home? Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charges. The charges may flow in just one direction, or they may keep reversing direction. You can watch an animation of both types of current at this Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Direct  Current 	  When current flows in just one direction, it is called direct current (DC). The diagram below shows how direct current flows through a simple circuit. An example of direct current is the current that flows through a batterypowered flashlight. In addition to batteries, solar cells and fuel cells can also provide direct current. 
Alternating  Current 	  When current keeps reversing direction, it is called alternating current (AC). You can see how it works in the two diagrams below. The current that comes from a power plant and supplies electricity to homes and businesses is alternating current. The current changes direction 60 times per second. It happens so quickly that the light bulb doesn’t have a chance to stop glowing when the reversals occur. Q: Which type of current flows through the wires in your home? A: Alternating current from a power plant flows through the wires in a home. 
Summary 	  • Direct current (DC) keeps flowing in just one direction. Batteries provide direct current. • Alternating current (AC) keeps reversing direction. Power plants provide alternating current. At the following URL, watch the video comparing direct and alternating current. Then answer the questions below. URL • Explain how a chemical cell works. • Outline how a solar cell produces electric current. Can you identify the two objects pictured above? You’ve probably used objects like these many times. The photos show a TV remote (left) and a calculator (right). Both of them run on electric current. Current requires a source of voltage, which is a difference in electric potential energy. Q: The source of voltage is different in the remote and the calculator. Do you know what source of voltage each device uses? A: The TV remote uses chemical cells as a source of voltage. The calculator uses a solar cell. 
Chemical  Cells 	  Chemical cells are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions. Chemical cells have two electrodes, which are strips of different materials, such as zinc and carbon. The electrodes are suspended in an electrolyte. This is a substance that contains free ions, which can carry electric current. The electrolyte may be either a paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in which case the cell is called a wet cell. Flashlight batteries contain dry cells. Car batteries contain wet cells. The Figure 5.154 shows how a battery works. The diagram represents the simplest type of battery, one that contains a single chemical cell. Both dry and wet cells work the same basic way. The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte, causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to accept electrons. Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the negative to positive electrode. The electrodes extend out of the battery for the attachment of wires that carry the current. The current can be used to power a light bulb or other electric device. For a video demonstration of how a battery works, go to the following URL. URL 
Solar  Cells 	  Solar cells convert the energy in sunlight to electrical energy. Solar cells are also called photovoltaic (PV) cells because they use light (photo-) to produce voltage (-voltaic). Solar cells contain a material such as silicon that absorbs light energy. The energy knocks electrons loose so they can flow freely and produce a difference in electric potential energy, or voltage. The flow of electrons creates electric current. Solar cells have positive and negative contacts, like the terminals in chemical cells. If the contacts are connected with wire, current flows from the negative to positive contact. The Figure 5.155 and following URL show how a solar cell works. URL com/solarElectricity/howCellsWork.asp 
Summary 	  • Current requires a source of voltage, which is a difference in electric potential energy. Sources of voltage include chemical cells and solar cells. • Chemical cells are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions. They contain electrodes and an electrolyte, which may be a paste (dry cell) or a liquid (wet cell). • Solar cells convert the energy in sunlight to electrical energy.

Then answer the questions below. http ://URL • Define resistance and identify the SI unit for resistance. • List factors that affect resistance. • Explain why resistance can be a help or a hindrance. These athletes are playing rugby, a game that is similar to American football. The players in red and blue are trying to stop the player in blue and black from running across the field with the ball. They are resisting his forward motion. This example of resistance in rugby is a little like resistance in physics. What Is Resistance? In physics, resistance is opposition to the flow of electric charges in an electric current as it travels through matter. The SI unit for resistance is the ohm. Resistance occurs because moving electrons in current bump into atoms of matter. Resistance reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transferred through matter. That’s because some of the electrical energy is absorbed by the atoms and changed to other forms of energy, such as heat. You can see an animation of resistance at the level of atoms and electrons at this URL: URL d=1738&q=electricalresistance&currentpage=1&age=0&knowledge=0&item=3 Q: In the rugby analogy to resistance in physics, what do the players on each team represent? A: The player on the blue and black team represents a moving electron in an electric current. The players on the red and blue team represent particles of matter through which the current is flowing. 
Factors  That  Affect  Resistance 	  How much resistance a material has depends on several factors: the type of material, its width, its length, and its temperature. • All materials have some resistance, but certain materials resist the flow of electric current more or less than other materials do. Materials such as plastics have high resistance to electric current. They are called electric insulators. Materials such as metals have low resistance to electric current. They are called electric conductors. • A wide wire has less resistance than a narrow wire of the same material. Electricity flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. More water can flow through a wide hose than a narrow hose. In a similar way, more current can flow through a wide wire than a narrow wire. • A longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire. Current must travel farther through a longer wire, so there are more chances for it to collide with particles of matter. • A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler particles have less kinetic energy, so they move more slowly. Therefore, they are less likely to collide with moving electrons in current. Materials called superconductors have virtually no resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures. You can learn more about superconductors at this URL: URL Is Resistance Good or Bad? Resistance can be helpful or just a drain on electrical energy. If the aim is to transmit electric current through a wire from one place to another, then resistance is a drawback. It reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transmitted because some of the current is absorbed by particles of matter. On the other hand, if the aim is to use electricity to produce heat or light, then resistance is useful. When particles of matter absorb electrical energy, they change it to heat or light. For example, when electric current flows through the tungsten wire inside an incandescent light bulb like the one in the Figure 5.156, the tungsten resists the flow of electric charge. It absorbs electrical energy and converts some of it to light and heat. Q: The tungsten wire inside a light bulb is extremely thin. How does this help it do its job? A: The extremely thin wire has more resistance than a wider wire would. This helps the wire resist electric current and change it to light. 
Summary 	  • In physics, resistance is opposition to the flow of electric charges that occurs as electric current travels through matter. The SI unit for resistance is the ohm. • All materials have resistance. How much resistance a material has depends on the type of material, its width, its length, and its temperature. • Resistance is a hindrance when a material is being used to transmit electric current. Resistance is helpful when a material is being used to produce heat or light. Explore the interactive simulation at the following URL. Then answer the questions below. URL /en/simulation/battery-resistor-circuit current, voltage, and resistance. What’s wrong with this picture? How does current get to the light bulb?) (Hint: tungsten as a filament in an incandescent light bulb? • Relate electric current to matter. • Define electric conductor, and give examples of conductors. • Describe electric insulators, and identify materials that are insulators. Do you see the wires and peaks on top of this old house? They are lightning rods, and their purpose is to protect the building in the event of a lightning strike. Each lightning rod is connected to a wire that goes down the side of the house and into the ground. If lightning strikes the building, it will target the rod and be conducted by the rod and wire into the ground. There the electricity can be safely absorbed. Lightning rods may differ in style, but to work they must be good at conducting electricity. 
Electric  Current and  Matter 	  Electrical energy is transmitted by moving electrons in an electric current. In order to travel, electric current needs matter. It cannot pass through empty space. However, matter resists the flow of electric current. That’s because flowing electrons in current collide with particles of matter, which absorb their energy. Some types of matter offer more or less resistance to electric current than others. 
Electric  Conductors 	  Materials that have low resistance to electric current are called electric conductors. Many metals—including copper, aluminum, and steel—are good conductors of electricity. The outer electrons of metal atoms are loosely bound and free to move, allowing electric current to flow. Water that has even a tiny amount of impurities is an electric conductor as well. Q: What do you think lightning rods are made of? A: Lightning rods are made of metal, usually copper or aluminum, both of which are excellent conductors of electricity. 
Electric  Insulators 	  Materials that have high resistance to electric current are called electric insulators. Examples include most nonmetallic solids, such as wood, rubber, and plastic. Their atoms hold onto their electrons tightly, so electric current cannot flow freely through them. Dry air is also an electric insulator. You can learn more about electric insulators—as well as how to test whether a material is an insulator—by doing the activity at this URL: URL Q: You may have heard that rubber-soled shoes will protect you if you are struck by lightning. Do you think this is true? Why or why not? A: It isn’t true. Rubber is an electric insulator, but a half-inch layer on the bottom of a pair of shoes is insignificant when it comes to lightning. The average lightning bolt has 100 million volts and can burn through any insulator, even the insulators on high-voltage power lines. 
The  Path of  Least  Resistance 	  Look at the electric wires in the Figure 5.157. They are made of copper and coated with plastic. Copper is very good conductor, and plastic is a very good insulator. When more than one material is available for electric current to flow through, the current always travels through the material with the least resistance. That’s why all the current passes through the copper wire and none flows through its plastic coating. 
Summary 	  • Electricity must travel through matter. All matter offers some resistance to the flow of electrons in an electric current. Some materials resist current more or less than others. • Materials that have low resistance to electric current are called electric conductors. Many metals are good electric conductors. • Materials that have high resistance to electric current are called electric insulators. Wood, rubber, and plastic are good electric insulators. • When more than one material is available for electric current to flow through, the current always travels through the material with the least resistance. At the following URL, do the simulation lab “Conductor or Insulator.” After you work through the lab, identify which rod insulates and explain how you can tell. URL .html • Explain Ohm’s law. • Use Ohm’s law to calculate current from voltage and resistance. Look at the water spraying out of this garden hose. You have to be careful using water around power tools and electric outlets because water can conduct an electric current. But in some ways, water flowing through a hose is like electric current flowing through a wire. 
Introducing  Ohm’s  Law 	  For electric current to flow through a wire, there must be a source of voltage. Voltage is a difference in electric potential energy. As you might have guessed, greater voltage results in more current. As electric current flows through matter, particles of matter resist the moving charges. This is called resistance, and greater resistance results in less current. These relationships between electric current, voltage, and resistance were first demonstrated in the early 1800s by a German scientist named Georg Ohm, so they are referred to as Ohm’s law. Ohm’s law can be represented by the following equation. Current(amps) = Voltage(volts) Resistance(ohms) 
Understanding  Ohm’s  Law 	  Ohm’s law may be easier to understand with an analogy. Current flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. Increasing voltage with a higher-volt battery increases the current. This is like opening the tap wider so more water flows through the hose. Increasing resistance reduces the current. This is like stepping on the hose so less water can flow through it. If you still aren’t sure about the relationships among current, voltage, and resistance, watch the video at this URL: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Using  Ohm’s  Law to  Calculate  Current 	  You can use the equation for current (above) to calculate the amount of current flowing through a circuit when the voltage and resistance are known. Consider an electric wire that is connected to a 12-volt battery. If the wire has a resistance of 2 ohms, how much current is flowing through the wire? 
Current = 12 volts 	  Q: If a 120-volt voltage source is connected to a wire with 10 ohms of resistance, how much current is flowing through the wire? A: Substitute these values into the equation for current: 
Summary 	  • According to Ohm’s law, greater voltage results in more current and greater resistance results in less current. • Ohm’s law can be represented by the equation: Current (amps) = Voltage (volts) Resistance (ohms) • This equation can be used to calculate current when voltage and resistance are known. bottom of the Web page.

Jose made this sketch of a battery and light bulb for science class. If this were a real set up, the light bulb wouldn’t work. The problem is the loose wire on the left. It must be connected to the positive terminal of the battery in order for the bulb to light up. Q: Why does the light bulb need to be connected to both battery terminals? A: Electric current can flow through a wire only if it forms a closed loop. Charges must have an unbroken path to follow between the positively and negatively charged parts of the voltage source, in this case, the battery. 
Electric  Circuit  Basics 	  A closed loop through which current can flow is called an electric circuit. In homes in the U.S., most electric circuits have a voltage of 120 volts. The amount of current (amps) a circuit carries depends on the number and power of electrical devices connected to the circuit. Home circuits generally have a safe upper limit of about 20 or 30 amps. 
Parts of an  Electric  Circuit 	  All electric circuits have at least two parts: a voltage source and a conductor. They may have other parts as well, such as light bulbs and switches, as in the simple circuit seen in the Figure 5.158. To see an animation of a circuit like this one, go to: URL • The voltage source of this simple circuit is a battery. In a home circuit, the source of voltage is an electric power plant, which may supply electric current to many homes and businesses in a community or even to many communities. • The conductor in most circuits consists of one or more wires. The conductor must form a closed loop from the source of voltage and back again. In the Figure 5.158, the wires are connected to both terminals of the battery, so they form a closed loop. • Most circuits have devices such as light bulbs that convert electrical energy to other forms of energy. In the case of a light bulb, electrical energy is converted to light and thermal energy. • Many circuits have switches to control the flow of current. When the switch is turned on, the circuit is closed and current can flow through it. When the switch is turned off, the circuit is open and current cannot flow through it. 
Circuit  Diagrams 	  When a contractor builds a new home, she uses a set of plans called blueprints that show her how to build the house. The blueprints include circuit diagrams. The diagrams show how the wiring and other electrical components are to be installed in order to supply current to appliances, lights, and other electric devices. You can see an example of a very simple circuit in the Figure 5.159. Different parts of the circuit are represented by standard circuit symbols. An ammeter measures the flow of current through the circuit, and a voltmeter measures the voltage. A resistor is any device that converts some of the electricity to other forms of energy. For example, a resistor might be a light bulb or doorbell. Q: Only one of the circuit symbols in the Figure 5.159 must be included in every circuit. Which symbol is it? A: The battery symbol (or a symbol for some other voltage source) must be included in every circuit. Without a source of voltage, there is no electric current. 
Summary 	  • An electric circuit is a closed loop through which current can flow. The circuit diagram in the middle represents the circuit drawing on the left. On the right are some of the standard symbols used in circuit diagrams. • All electric circuits must have a voltage source, such as a battery, and a conductor, which is usually wire. They may have one or more electric devices as well. • An electric circuit can be represented by a circuit diagram, which uses standard symbols to represent the parts of the circuit.

Only a licensed professional electrician like this one is qualified to install or repair the electrical system inside a home. It’s a complicated system that consists of a maze of electric circuits. One Loop or Two? An electric circuit consists of at least one closed loop through which electric current can flow. Every circuit has a voltage source such as a battery and a conductor such as metal wire. A circuit may have other parts as well, such as lights and switches. In addition, a circuit may consist of one loop or two loops. 
Series  Circuit 	  A circuit that consists of one loop is called a series circuit. You can see a simple series circuit below. If a series circuit is interrupted at any point in its single loop, no current can flow through the circuit and no devices in the circuit will work. In the series circuit below, if one light bulb burns out, the other light bulb won’t work because it won’t receive any current. Series circuits are commonly used in flashlights. You can see an animation of a series circuit at this URL: URL Q: If one light bulb burns out in this series circuit, how can you tell which bulb it is? A: It may not be obvious, because neither bulb will light if one is burned out. You can tell which one it is only by replacing first one bulb and then the other to see which replacement results in both bulbs lighting up. 
Parallel  Circuit 	  A circuit that has two loops is called a parallel circuit. A simple parallel circuit is sketched below. If one loop of a parallel circuit is interrupted, current can still flow through the other loop. In the parallel circuit below, if one light bulb burns out, the other light bulb will still work because current can bypass the burned-out bulb. The wiring in a house consists of parallel circuits. You can see an animation of a parallel circuit at this URL: URL ep.org/regents/physics/phys03/bparcir/default.htm

Miranda has to use a hair dryer in order to dry her long hair quickly enough to get to school on time. She has a powerful hair dryer that dries her hair faster than a less powerful hair dryer would. That’s because a more powerful hair dryer changes electric current to thermal energy more quickly. 
Electric  Power 	  The rate at which a device changes electric current to another form of energy is called electric power. The SI unit for power—including electric power—is the watt. A watt equals 1 joule of energy per second. High wattages are often expressed in kilowatts, where 1 kilowatt equals 1000 watts. The power of an electric device, such as a hair dryer, can be calculated if you know the voltage of the circuit and how much current the device receives. The following equation is used: Power (watts) = Current (amps) × Voltage (volts) Assume that Miranda’s hair dryer is the only electric device in a 120-volt circuit that carries 15 amps of current. Then the power of her hair dryer in kilowatts is: Power = 15 amps × 120 volts = 1800 watts, or 1.8 kilowatts Q: If a different hair dryer is plugged into a 120-volt circuit that carries 10 amps of current. What is the power of the other hair dryer? A: Substitute these values in the power equation: Power = 10 amps × 120 volts = 1200 watts, or 1.2 kilowatts 
Electrical  Energy  Use 	  Did you ever wonder how much electrical energy it takes to use an appliance such as a hair dryer? Electrical energy use depends on the power of the appliance and how long it is used. It can be calculated with this equation: 
Electrical  Energy =  Power ×  Time 	  If Miranda uses her 1.8-kilowatt hair dryer for 0.2 hours, how much electrical energy does she use? Electrical Energy = 1.8 kilowatts × 0.2 hours = 0.36 kilowatt-hours Electrical energy use is typically expressed in kilowatt-hours, as in this example. How much energy is this? One kilowatt-hour equals 3.6 million joules of energy. Q: Suppose Miranda were to use a 1.2-kilowatt hair dryer for 0.2 hours. How much electrical energy would she use then? A: She would use: Electrical Energy = 1.2 kilowatts × 0.2 hour = 0.24 kilowatt-hours You can learn much more about electrical energy use—including your own—at the URL below. Use the tables and other information, along with the handy electrical energy calculator, to estimate how much electrical energy you use. URL 
Summary 	  • Electric power is the rate at which a device changes electric current to another form of energy. The SI unit of power is the watt. Electric power can be calculated as current times voltage. • Electrical energy use equals the power of the appliance multiplied by the amount of time the appliance is used.

URL electric power of the microwave? • Explain how a short circuit occurs. • Identify safety features built into electric circuits and devices. • List rules for using electricity safely. Electricity isn’t really an evil cloud, but the sign makes the point that electricity is dangerous. Contact with electric current can cause severe burns and even death. Electricity can also cause serious fires. Q: A common cause of electric hazards and fires is a short circuit. Do you know what a short circuit is? A: As its name suggests, a short circuit is damage that allows electric current to travel through a shorter loop than it should. To find out how this can occur and why it is dangerous, keep reading. 
How a  Short  Circuit  Occurs 	  Did you ever see an old appliance with a damaged cord, like the old shown in the Figure 5.160? A damaged electric cord can cause a severe shock if it allows current to pass from the cord to a person who touches it. A damaged cord can also cause a short circuit. A short circuit occurs when electric current follows a shorter path than the intended loop of the circuit. An electric cord contains two wires: one that carries current from the outlet to the appliance and one that carries current from the appliance back to the outlet. If the two wires in a damaged cord come into contact with each other, current flows from one wire to the other and bypasses the appliance. This may cause the wires to overheat and start a fire. 
Electric  Safety  Features 	  Because electricity can be so dangerous, safety features are built into modern electric circuits and devices. They include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets. You can read about these three safety features in the ://URL . GFCI Outlet: GFCI stands for groundfault circuit interrupter. GFCI outlets are typically found in bathrooms and kitchens where the use of water poses a risk of shock (because water is a good electric conductor). A GFCI outlet contains a device that monitors the amount of current leaving and returning to the outlet. 
If 	  less current is returning than leaving, this means that current is escaping. When this occurs, a tiny circuit breaker in the outlet interrupts the circuit. The breaker can be reset by pushing a button on the outlet cover. Q: Can you think of any other electric safety features? A: One safety feature is the label on a lamp that warns the user of the maximum safe wattage for light bulbs. Another safety feature is double insulation on many electric devices. Not only are the electric wires insulated with a coating of plastic but so is the entire device. The old toaster pictured in the Figure 5.160 lacks this safety feature, but most modern toasters have a plastic casing. This reduces the risk of current leaving the device except through the cord. 
Using  Electricity  Safely 	  Even with electric safety features, electricity is still dangerous if it is misused. Follow the safety rules below to reduce the risk of injury or fire from electricity. • Never mix electricity and water. Don’t plug in or turn on electric lights or appliances when your hands are wet, you are standing in water, or you are in the shower or bathtub. The current could flow through the water—and you—because water is a good conductor of electricity. • Never overload circuits. Avoid plugging too many devices into one outlet or extension cord. The more devices that are plugged in, the more current the circuit carries. Too much current can overheat a circuit and start a fire. • Never use devices with damaged cords or plugs. They can cause shocks, shorts, and fires. • Never put anything except plugs into electric outlets. Putting any other object into an outlet is likely to cause a serious shock that could be fatal. • Never go near fallen electric lines. They could have very high voltage. Report fallen lines to the electric company as soon as possible. 
Summary 	  • A short circuit occurs when electric current follows a shorter path than the intended loop of the circuit. A short circuit may cause wires to overheat and start a fire. • Several safety features are built into modern electric circuits and devices. They include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets. • Following safety rules can reduce the risk of injury or fire from electricity.

Did you ever make a secret code by assigning each letter of the alphabet a unique symbol? The code shown above is believed to have been used by George Washington to send secret messages during the American Revolutionary War. A different type of code can be sent with electric current. Q: How do you think electric current can be used to encode messages? A: The short answer is by changing the voltage in an electric circuit. Keep reading to learn more. 
Electronic  Messages 	  Electric devices, such as lights and household appliances, change electric current to other forms of energy. For example, an electric stove changes electric current to thermal energy. Other common devices, such as mobile phones and computers, use electric current for another purpose: to encode information. A message encoded this way is called an electronic signal, and the use of electric current for this purpose is called electronics. For an overview of electronics and electronic signals, read the short article at this URL: URL ize/standard/physics/electronics/overview_rev1.shtml . To encode a message with electric current, the voltage is changed rapidly, over and over again. Voltage is a difference in electric potential energy that is needed in order for electric current to flow. There are two different ways voltage can be changed, resulting in two different types of electronic signals, called analog signals and digital signals. 
Analog  Signals 	  Analog signals consist of continuously changing voltage in an electric circuit. The Figure 5.162 represents analog signals. These were the first electronic signals to be invented. They were used in early computers and other early electronic devices. Analog signals are subject to distortion and noise, so they aren’t used as often anymore. They are used mainly in microphones and some mobile phones to encode sounds as electronic signals. 
Digital  Signals 	  Today, most electronic signals are digital signals. Digital signals consist of rapid pulses of voltage that repeatedly switch the current off and on. The Figure 5.163 represents digital signals. This type of signal encodes information as a string of 0’s (current off) and 1’s (current on). This is called a binary (“two-digit”) code. The majority of modern electronic devices, including computers and many mobile phones, encode data as digital signals. Compared with analog signals, digital signals are easier to transmit and more accurate. 
Summary 	  • A message encoded by changing the voltage of an electric current is called an electronic signal. The use of electric current for this purpose is known as electronics. • Electronic signals may be analog or digital signals. Analog signals consist of continuously changing voltage in an electric circuit. Digital signals, which are the main type of signals used today, consist of rapid pulses of voltage that repeatedly switch the current off and on. Assume you are explaining analog and digital signals to a younger student. Write an original analogy that helps explain how the two types of signals differ. You can learn more about analogies, including many examples, at the following URL. URL • Define electronic component. • Describe semiconductors. • Outline the structure and function of diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. You’ve probably heard of Silicon Valley. You may even know that it’s a region in northern California. But do you know how the region got its name? Silicon Valley is the birthplace of modern electronics and continues to be a hub of electronic innovation. The word silicon in the name refers to the element silicon, which is the chief “ingredient” of electronic components. What Are Electronic Components? Electronic components are the parts used in electronic devices such as computers. The components change electric current so it can carry information. Types of electronic components include diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits, all of which you can read about below. However, to understand how these components work, you first need to know about semiconductors. That’s because electronic components consist of semiconductors—sometimes millions of them! 
Semiconductors 	  A semiconductor is a solid crystal, consisting mainly of silicon. It gets its name from the fact that it can conduct current better than an electric insulator but not as well as an electric conductor. As you can see in the Figure 5.164, each silicon atom has four valence electrons that it shares with other silicon atoms in the crystal. A semiconductor is formed by replacing a few silicon atoms with other atoms, such as phosphorus or boron, which have more or less valence electrons than silicon. This is called doping, and it’s what allows the semiconductor to conduct electric current. Q: Why wouldn’t a pure silicon crystal be able to conduct electric current? A: Electric current is a flow of electrons. All of the valence electrons of silicon atoms in a pure crystal are shared with other silicon atoms, so they are not free to move and carry current. There are two different types of semiconductors: n-type and p-type. • An n-type (negative-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as phosphorus that gives the silicon crystal extra electrons. You can see this in the Figure 5.164. An n-type semiconductor is like the negative terminal of a battery. • A p-type (positive-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as boron that gives the silicon positively charged “holes” where electrons are missing. This is also shown in the Figure 5.164. A p-type semiconductor is like the positive terminal of a battery. 
Diode 	  A diode is an electronic component that consists of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor placed side by side, as shown in the Figure 5.165. When a diode is connected by leads to a source of voltage, electrons flow from the n-type to the p-type semiconductor. This is the only direction that electrons can flow in a diode. This makes a diode useful for changing alternating current to direct current. 
Transistor 	  A transistor consists of three semiconductors, either p-n-p or n-p-n. Both arrangements are illustrated in the Figure (through the base). Then a much larger current can flow through the transistor from end to end (from collector to emitter). This means that a transmitter can be used as a switch, with pulses of a small current turning a larger current on and off. A transistor can also be used to increase the amount of current flowing through a circuit.

Integrated  Circuit 	  An integrated circuit—also called a microchip—is a tiny, flat piece of silicon that consists of layers of many electronic components such as transistors. You can see an integrated circuit in the Figure 5.167. Look how small it is compared with the finger it’s resting on. Although the integrated circuit is tiny, it may contain millions of smaller electronic components. Current flows extremely rapidly in an integrated circuit because it doesn’t have far to travel. Integrated circuits are used in virtually all modern electronic devices to carry out specific tasks. You can see how integrated circuits are made at this URL: URL .

If you were born in the last few decades, it’s probably impossible for you to imagine life without the computer. The computer is just one of many electronic devices that make modern life possible. What are Electronic Devices? Many of the devices people commonly use today are electronic devices. Electronic devices use electric current to encode, analyze, or transmit information. In addition to computers, they include mobile phones, TV remotes, DVD and CD players, and digital cameras, to name just a few. Q: Can you think of other electronic devices that you use? A: Other examples include game systems and MP3 players. 
Focus on the  Computer 	  Let’s take a close look at the computer as an example of an electronic device. A computer contains integrated circuits, or microchips, that consist of millions of tiny electronic components. Information is encoded in digital electronic signals. Rapid pulses of voltage switch electric current on and off, producing long strings of 1’s (current on) and 0’s (current off). The 1’s and 0’s are the “letters” of the code, and a huge number of them are needed. One digit (either 0 or 1) is called a bit, which stands for “binary digit.” Each group of eight digits is called a byte, and a billion bytes is called a gigabyte. Because a computer’s circuits are so tiny and close together, the computer can be very fast and capable of many complex tasks while remaining small. The parts of a computer that transmit, process, or store digital signals are pictured and described in the Figure 5.168. They include the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. The motherboard ties all these parts of the computer together. • The CPU, or central processing unit, carries out program instructions. You can learn more about CPUs and how they work by watching the video at this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. • The hard drive is a magnetic disc that provides long-term storage for programs and data. • ROM (read-only memory) is a microchip that provides permanent storage. It stores important information such as start-up instructions. This memory remains even after the computer is turned off. • RAM (random-access memory) is a microchip that temporarily stores programs and data that are currently being used. Anything stored in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off. • The motherboard is connected to the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. It allows all these parts of the computer to receive power and communicate with one another. Q: Which part(s) of a computer are you using when you type a school report? A: You are using the RAM to store the word processing program and your document as you type it. You are using the CPU to carry out instructions in the word processing program, and you are probably using the hard drive to save your document.

The train in this photo is called a maglev train. The word maglev stands for “magnetic levitation.” Magnets push the train upward so it hovers, or levitates, above the track without actually touching it. This eliminates most of the friction acting against the train when it moves. Other magnets pull the train forward along the track. Because of all the magnets, the train can go very fast. It can fly over the tracks at speeds up to 480 kilometers (300 miles) per hour! What are magnets and how do they exert such force? In this article, you’ll find out.

Magnetic  Poles 	  A magnet is an object that attracts certain materials such as iron. You’re probably familiar with common bar magnets, like the one shown in the Figure 5.169. Like all magnets, this bar magnet has north and south magnetic poles. The red end of the magnet is the north pole and the blue end is the south pole. The poles are regions where the magnet is strongest. The poles are called north and south because they always line up with Earth’s north-south axis if the magnet is allowed to move freely. (Earth’s axis is the imaginary line around which the planet rotates.) Q: What do you suppose would happen if you cut the bar magnet pictured in the Figure 5.169 along the line between the north and south poles? A: Both halves of the magnet would also have north and south poles. If you cut each of the halves in half, all those pieces would have north and south poles as well. Pieces of a magnet always have both north and south poles no matter how many times you cut the magnet. 
Magnetic  Force and  Magnetic  Field 	  The force that a magnet exerts on certain materials, including other magnets, is called magnetic force. The force is exerted over a distance and includes forces of attraction and repulsion. North and south poles of two magnets attract each other, while two north poles or two south poles repel each other. A magnet can exert force over a distance because the magnet is surrounded by a magnetic field. In the Figure 5.170, you can see the magnetic field surrounding a bar magnet. Tiny bits of iron, called iron filings, were placed under a sheet of glass. When the magnet was placed on the glass, it attracted the iron filings. The pattern of the iron filings shows the lines of force that make up the magnetic field of the magnet. The concentration of iron filings near the poles indicates that these areas exert the strongest force. You can also see how the magnetic field affects the compasses placed above the magnet. To see an animated magnetic field of a bar magnet, go to this URL: URL lines/ When two magnets are brought close together, their magnetic fields interact. You can see how they interact in the each other. The animations at the following URL show how magnetic field lines change as two or more magnets move in relation to each other. URL

This collection of magnets is located in a familiar place: a refrigerator door. No doubt you’ve handled refrigerator magnets like the ones in this photo. You probably know first-hand that they stick to metal refrigerators but not to surfaces such as wooden doors and glass windows. Wood and glass aren’t attracted to a magnet, whereas the steel refrigerator is. Obviously, only certain materials respond to magnetic force. What Makes a Material Magnetic? Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets. In other materials, there are regions where the north and south poles of atoms are all lined up in the same direction. These regions are called magnetic domains. Generally, the magnetic domains point in different directions, so the material is still not magnetic. However, the material can be magnetized (made into a magnet) by placing it in a magnetic field. When this happens, all the magnetic domains line up, and the material becomes a magnet. You can see this in the Figure 5.172. Materials that can be magnitized are called ferromagnetic materials. They include iron, cobalt, and nickel. 
Magnetic domains must be lined up by an 	  outside magnetic field for most ferromagnetic materials to become magnets. 
Temporary and  Permanent  Magnets 	  Materials that have been magnetized may become temporary or permanent magnets. • If you bring a bar magnet close to pile of paper clips, the paper clips will become temporarily magnetized, as all their magnetic domains line up. As a result, the paper clips will stick to the magnet and also to each other (see the Figure 5.173). However, if you remove the paper clips from the bar magnet’s magnetic field, their magnetic domains will no longer align. As a result, the paper clips will no longer be magnetized or stick together. You can follow the five easy steps at the following URL to make a temporary magnet from a paper clip that will retain its magnetism somewhat longer. URL • If you stroke an iron nail with a bar magnet, the nail will become a permanent (or at least long-lasting) magnet. You can see how it’s done in the Figure 5.174. The nail’s magnetic domains will remain aligned even after you remove the nail from the magnetic field of the bar magnet. Q: Even permanent magnets can be demagnetized if they are dropped or heated to high temperatures. Can you explain why? A: Jarring or heating a magnet moves the magnetic domains out of alignment. When the magnetic domains no longer line up in the same direction, the material is no longer magnetic. 
Magnetite 	  Some materials are natural permanent magnets. The most magnetic material in nature is the mineral magnetite, also called lodestone (see Figure 5.175). The magnetic domains of magnetite naturally align with Earth’s axis. The picture on the left shows a chunk of magnetite attracting small bits of iron. The magnetite spoon compass shown on the right dates back about 2000 years and comes from China. The handle of the spoon always points north. Clearly, the magnetic properties of magnetite have been recognized for thousands of years. 
Summary 	  • Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. A material can be magnetized if all of its magnetic domains can be aligned. Magnetic domains are regions of matter where north and south poles of atoms line up in the same direction. • Only certain materials, called ferromagnetic materials, can be magnetized. They include iron, cobalt, and nickel. Materials that have been magnetized may become temporary or permanent magnets. • Some materials are natural permanent magnets. The most magnetic material in nature is the mineral magnetite. At the following URL, read the short article and use the animation to magnetize the ferromagnetic material. Then answer the questions below. URL • Describe how Earth is a magnet. • Distinguish between Earth’s geographic and magnetic poles. • Describe the magnetosphere. Did you ever use a compass like the one in this picture? Even if you’ve never used a compass, you probably know that the needle of a compass always points north. That’s because a compass needle is magnetized, so it is attracted by a magnet. Q: What magnet attracts a compass needle? A: A compass needle is attracted by magnet Earth. It always points north because Earth acts as a giant magnet. 
Earth’s  Magnetic  Poles 	  Imagine a huge bar magnet passing through Earth’s axis, as in the Figure 5.176. This is a good representation of Earth as a magnet. Like a bar magnet, Earth has north and south magnetic poles. A magnetic pole is the north or south end of a magnet, where the magnet exerts the most force. 
Two  North  Poles 	  Although the needle of a compass always points north, it doesn’t point to Earth’s north geographic pole. Find the north geographic pole in the Figure 5.177. As you can see, it is located at 90° north latitude. Where does a compass needle point instead? It points to Earth’s north magnetic pole, which is located at about 80° north latitude. Earth also has two south poles: a south geographic pole and a south magnetic pole. Q: The north end of a compass needle points toward Earth’s north magnetic pole. The like poles of two magnets repel each other, and the opposite poles attract. So why doesn’t the north end of a compass needle point to Earth’s south magnetic pole instead? A: The answer may surprise you. The compass needle actually does point to the south pole of magnet Earth. However, it is called the north magnetic pole because it is close to the north geographic pole. This naming convention was adopted a long time ago to avoid confusion. 
Earth’s  Magnetic  Field 	  Like all magnets, Earth has a magnetic field. Earth’s magnetic field is called the magnetosphere. You can see a model of the magnetosphere in the Figure 5.178. It is a huge region that extends outward from Earth in all directions. Earth exerts magnetic force over the entire field, but the force is strongest at the poles, where lines of force converge. For an animated model of the magnetosphere, watch this video: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • Earth acts as a giant magnet with magnetic poles and a magnetic field over which it exerts magnetic force. • Earth has north and south magnetic poles like a bar magnet. Earth’s magnetic poles are not the same as the geographic poles. • Earth’s magnetic field is called the magnetosphere. It is strongest at the poles.

Why or why not? • Describe a magnetic field reversal. • Identify evidence for magnetic field reversals. Do you like science fiction? This is a fictional scene that is set in the future. Science fiction artists are so creative! They might even describe a time when compasses point south instead of north. Actually, this idea isn’t fiction—it’s a fact. 
Changing  Places 	  Earth’s magnetic poles have switched places repeatedly in the past. As you can see in the Figure 5.179, each time the switch occurred, Earth’s magnetic field was reversed. The magnetic field is the region around a magnet over which it exerts magnetic force. We think of today’s magnetic field direction as “normal,” but that’s only because it’s what we’re used to. You can watch a simulation of a magnetic field reversal at this URL: URL nova/earth/when-our-magnetic-field-flips.html 
Fact, not  Fiction 	  Scientists don’t know for certain why magnetic reversals occur, but there is hard evidence that they have for hundreds of millions of years. The evidence comes from rocks on the ocean floor. Look at Figure 5.180. They show the same ridge on the ocean floor during different periods of time. A. At the center of the ridge, hot magma pushes up through the crust and hardens into rock. Once the magma hardens, the alignment of magnetic domains in the rock is frozen in place forever. Magnetic domains are regions in the rocks where all the atoms are lined up and pointing toward Earth’s north magnetic pole. B. The newly hardened rock is gradually pushed away from the ridge in both directions as more magma erupts and newer rock forms. The alignment of magnetic domains in this new rock is in the opposite direction, showing that a magnetic reversal has occurred. C. A magnetic reversal occurs again. It is frozen in rock to document the change. Rock samples from many places on the ocean floor show that the north and south magnetic poles reversed hundreds of times over the last 330 million years. The last reversal was less than a million years ago. Q: What might happen if a magnetic reversal occurred in your lifetime? How might it affect you?

Magnets in the globe and its stand repel each other, allowing the globe to hover in midair. The globe is a good model for Earth the magnet. 
Earth the  Magnet 	  Like the real Earth, the globe pictured above is a magnet. A magnet is an object that has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field. The magnetic globe is a modern device, but the idea that Earth is a magnet is far from new. It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. He used a spherical magnet to represent Earth. With a compass, he demonstrated that it the spherical magnet causes a compass needle to behave the same way that Earth causes a compass needle to behave. This showed that a spherical magnet is a good model for Earth and therefore that Earth is a magnet. Q: Can you describe Earth’s magnetic poles and magnetic field? A: Earth has north and south magnetic poles. The North Pole is located at about 80 degrees north latitude. The magnetic field is an area around Earth that is affected by its magnetic field. The field is strongest at the poles, and lines of magnetic force move from the north to the south magnetic pole. 
Spinning  Like a  Top 	  Although the idea that Earth is a magnet is centuries old, the discovery of why Earth is a magnet is a relatively new. In the early 1900s, scientists started using seismographic data to learn about Earth’s inner structure. A seismograph detects and measure earthquake waves. Evidence from earthquakes showed that Earth has a solid inner core and a liquid outer core (see the Figure 5.181). The outer core consists of molten metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earth’s magnetic field is generated by the movement of charged particles through these molten metals in the outer core. The particles move as Earth spins on its axis. The video at the URL below takes a closer look at how this occurs. URL 
Summary 	  • In the 1600s, William Gilbert demonstrated that Earth is basically a spherical magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. • In the 1900s, scientists used earthquake data to determine that Earth has a solid inner core and molten outer core. Scientists think that Earth is a magnet because of charged particles moving through the molten outer core as Earth spins on its axis.

You may recognize the eerie green glow in this cold northern sky as the northern lights, or aurora borealis. But do you know what causes the northern lights? Earth’s magnetic field is a major factor. 
Earth’s  Magnetic  Field 	  Like a bar magnet, planet Earth has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field over which it exerts magnetic force. Earth’s magnetic field is called the magnetosphere. You can see it in the Figure 5.182. 
Like an  Umbrella 	  The sun gives off radiation in solar winds. You can see solar winds in the Figure 5.182. Notice what happens to solar winds when they reach the magnetosphere. They are deflected almost completely by Earth’s magnetic field. Radiation in solar wind would wash over Earth and kill most living things were it not for the magnetosphere. It protects Earth’s organisms from radiation like an umbrella protects you from rain. Q: Now can you explain the northern lights? A: Energetic particles in solar wind collide with atoms in the atmosphere over the poles, and energy is released in the form of light. The swirling patterns of light follow lines of magnetic force in the magnetosphere. 
Finding the  Way 	  Another benefit of Earth’s magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earth’s magnetic north pole and tell direction. Many animals have natural “compasses” that work just as well. For example, the loggerhead turtle in the Figure 5.183 senses the direction and strength of Earth’s magnetic field and uses it to navigate along migration routes. Many migratory bird species can also sense the magnetic field and use it for navigation. Recent research suggests that they may have structures in their eyes that let them see Earth’s magnetic field as a visual pattern. You can learn more at this URL: URL 
Birds- Find- Their- Way- Home.html 	  Q: In the past, Earth’s magnetic poles have switched places and reversed Earth’s magnetic field. How might a magnetic reversal affect loggerhead turtle navigation?

URL • Define electromagnetism. • State the right hand rule. • Explain why electromagnetism is very useful. What a clever dog! He wants to go inside to get out of the rain, so he’s ringing the doorbell. Does your home have a doorbell? Did you ever wonder how a doorbell works? The answer is electromagnetism. What Is Electromagnetism? Electromagnetism is magnetism produced by an electric current. When electric current flows through a wire, it creates a magnetic field that surrounds the wire in circles. You can see this in the diagram below. Note that electric current is conventionally shown moving from positive to negative electric potential, as in this diagram. However, electrons in current actually flow in the opposite direction, from negative to positive potential. Q: If more current flows through a wire, how might this affect the magnetic field surrounding the wire? A: With more current, the magnetic field is stronger. 
Right  Hand  Rule 	  The direction of the magnetic field created when current flows through a wire depends on the direction of the current. A simple rule, called the right hand rule, makes it easy to find the direction of the magnetic field if the direction of the current is known. The rule is illustrated in the Figure 5.184. When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction as the current, the fingers of the right hand curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. You can see the right hand rule in action at this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Uses of  Electromagnetism 	  Electromagnetism is used not only in a doorbells but in many other electric devices as well, such as electric motors and loudspeakers. It is also used to store information on computer disks. An important medical use of electromagnetism is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a technique for making images of the inside of the body in order to diagnose diseases or injuries. Magnetism created with electric current is so useful because it can be turned on or off simply by turning the current on or off. The strength of the magnetic field is also easy to control by changing the amount of current. You can’t do either of these things with a regular magnet. 
Summary 	  • Electromagnetism is magnetism produced by an electric current. Current flowing through a wire creates a magnetic field that surrounds the wire in concentric circles. • When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction as the current flowing through a wire, the fingers of the right hand curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. • Electromagnetism is very useful because it can be turned on or off by turning the current on or off, and it can be made stronger or weaker by using more or less current.

Tamara made the simple device in this picture for science class. She wrapped a wire around a nail and connected the ends of the wire to the terminals of a battery.

A: The device shows that you can use electricity to create magnetism. 
Electricity and  Magnetism 	  Magnetism produced by electricity is called electromagnetism. Today, electromagnetism is used in many electric devices. However, until electromagnetism was discovered, scientists thought that electricity and magnetism were unrelated. A Danish scientist named Hans Christian Oersted (pictured in the Figure 5.185) changed all that. He made the important discovery that electric current creates a magnetic field. But like many other important discoveries in science, Oersted’s discovery was just a lucky accident. 
An  Accidental  Discovery 	  In 1820, Oersted was presenting a demonstration to some science students. Ironically, he was trying to show them that electricity and magnetism are not related. He placed a wire with electric current flowing through it next to a compass, which has a magnetic needle. As he expected, the needle of the compass didn’t move. It just kept pointing toward Earth’s north magnetic pole. After the demonstration, a curious student held the wire near the compass again, but in a different direction. To Oersted’s surprise, the needle of the compass swung toward the wire so it was no longer pointing north. Oersted was intrigued. He turned off the current in the wire to see what would happen to the compass needle. The needle swung back to its original position, pointing north once again. Oersted had discovered that an electric current creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field created by the current was strong enough to attract the needle of the nearby compass. 
Oersted  Learns  More 	  Oersted wanted to learn more about the magnetic field created by a current. He placed a compass at different locations around a wire with current flowing through it. You can see what he found in the Figure 5.186. The lines of magnetic force circle around the wire in a counterclockwise direction. You can learn more about Oersted’s investigations at the URL below. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
From  Magnets to  Electricity 	  Just about a decade after Oersted discovered that electric current can produce a magnetic field, an English scientist named Michael Faraday discovered that the opposite is also true. A magnetic field can produce an electric current. This is known as Faraday’s law. The process by which a magnetic field produces current is called electromagnetic induction. It occurs when a conductor, such as a wire, crosses lines of force in a magnetic field. This can happen when a wire is moving relative to a magnet or a magnet is moving relative to a wire. 
Summary 	  • Electricity can be used to produce a magnetic field. Magnetism produced by electricity is called electromagnetism. • In 1820, Oersted discovered by accident that electric current creates a magnetic field. Prior to that, scientists thought that electricity and magnetism were unrelated. • Oersted also used a compass to find the direction of the magnetic field around a wire carrying current. • Around 1830, Michael Faraday discovered that a magnetic field can generate an electric current if a conductor crosses the lines of force in a magnetic field. This is known as Faraday’s law. At the following URL, review Oersted’s discovery of electromagnetism.

Did you ever play this extreme game? The trigger on a paintball gun is electronic and uses a device called a solenoid. What Is a Solenoid? A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it. You can see a solenoid in the Figure 5.187. Current flowing through the coil produces a magnetic field that has north and south poles. You can see an actual solenoid with a compass showing its magnetic north pole at this URL: URL fIBkUI . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Q: How is a solenoid like a bar magnet? A: Like a bar magnet, a solenoid has north and south magnetic poles and is surrounded by a magnetic field. 
Strength of a  Solenoid 	  Any wire with current flowing through it has a magnetic field. However, the magnetic field around a coiled wire is stronger than the magnetic field around a straight wire. That’s because each turn of the wire in the coil has its own magnetic field. Adding more turns to the coil of wire increases the strength of the field. Increasing the amount of current flowing through the coil also increases the strength of the magnetic field. 
Uses of  Solenoids 	  A solenoid is generally used to convert electromagnetic energy into motion. Solenoids are often used in devices that need a sudden burst of power to move a specific part. In addition to paintball markers, you can find solenoids in machines ranging from motor vehicles to electric dishwashers. Another device that uses solenoids is pictured in the

This crane is dangling a big round magnet that has picked up metal car parts in a junk yard. The parts practically leap up to the magnet because it’s so strong. That’s because it’s an electromagnet. What Is an Electromagnet? An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material. A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it. This gives the coil north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field. The magnetic field of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar by aligning its magnetic domains. You can see this in the Figure 5.189. You can learn how to make an electromagnet at this URL: URL mlzh9XXWgQ 
Strength of an  Electromagnet 	  The combined magnetic force of the magnetized wire coil and iron bar makes an electromagnet very strong. In fact, electromagnets are the strongest magnets made. An electromagnet is stronger if there are more turns in the coil of wire or there is more current flowing through it. A bigger bar or one made of material that is easier to magnetize also increases an electromagnet’s strength. At the following URL, you can see an animation demonstrating how these factors affect the strength of an electromagnet. URL ml 
Easy  On and  Off 	  Besides their strength, another pro of electromagnets is the ability to control them by controlling the electric current. Turning the current on or off turns the magnetic field on or off. The amount of current flowing through the coil can also be changed to control the strength of the electromagnet. Q: Why might it be useful to be able to turn an electromagnet on and off? A: Look back at the electromagnet hanging from the crane in the opening photo. It is useful to turn on its magnetic field so it can pick up the metal car parts. It is also useful to turn off its magnetic field so it can drop the parts into the train car.

The little boy on the left is pressing the doorbell on his playhouse. The doorbell is connected to a battery, so it actually rings when he pushes the button. The little girl on the right is using a hand-held fan to cool off on a hot day. The fan is also battery-operated, and the blades of the fan turn in a blur of motion. What do the doorbell and fan have in common? Both of them work because they contain electromagnets. 
Devices with  Electromagnets 	  Many common electric devices contain electromagnets. An electromagnet is a coil of wire wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material. When electric current flows through the wire, it causes the coil and iron bar to become magnetized. An electromagnet has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field. Turning off the current turns off the electromagnet. To understand how electromagnets are used in electric devices, we’ll focus on two common devices: doorbells and electric motors like the one that turns the blades of a fan. Q: Besides doorbells and fans, what are some other devices that contain electromagnets? A: Any device that has an electric motor contains electromagnets. Some other examples include hairdryers, CD players, power drills, electric saws, and electric mixers. 
How a  Doorbell  Works 	  The Figure 5.190 represents a simple doorbell. Like most doorbells, it has a button located by the front door. Pressing the button causes two electric contacts to come together and complete an electric circuit. In other words, the button is a switch. The circuit is also connected to a source of current, an electromagnet, and a clapper that strikes a bell. You can see an animation of a doorbell at this URL: URL ectric_bell/index.html What happens when current flows through the doorbell circuit? • The electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic field attracts the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making it ring. • Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike the bell, it breaks the circuit. Without current flowing through the circuit, the electromagnet turns off, and the clapper returns to its original position. • When the clapper moves back to its original position, this closes the circuit again and turns the electromagnet back on. The electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell once more. • This sequence of events keeps repeating. Q: How can you stop the sequence of events so the doorbell will stop ringing? A: Stop pressing the button! This interrupts the circuit so no current can flow through it. 
Electric  Motor 	  An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy. You can see a simple diagram of an electric motor in the Figure 5.191. The motor contains an electromagnet that is connected to a shaft. When current flows through the motor, the electromagnet rotates, causing the shaft to rotate as well. The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device. For example, in an electric fan, the rotating shaft turns the blades of the fan. You can make a very simple electric motor by following the instructions at this URL: URL om/watch?v=VhaYLnjkf1E Why does the motor’s electromagnet rotate? • The electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets. When current flows through the electromagnet, it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to rotate toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets. • A device called a commutator then changes the direction of the current so the poles of the electromagnet are reversed. The reversed poles are again repelled by the poles of the permanent magnets, which have not reversed. This causes the electromagnet to continue to rotate. • These events keep repeating, so the electromagnet rotates continuously. You can see an animation of an electric motor in action at this URL: URL ectric_motor/index.html 
Summary 	  • Electromagnetic devices are devices that contain electromagnets. Examples of electromagnetic devices include doorbells and any devices that have electric motors, such as electric fans. • The electromagnet in a doorbell attracts the clapper, which hits the bell and makes it ring. • An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy. When current flows through the motor, the electromagnet rotates, causing a shaft to rotate as well. The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device. Explore the electric motor animation at the following URL. Then describe two ways you can make the electromagnet in the motor rotate more quickly. URL tyworld/thecostofelectricityrev1.shtml • Define electromagnetic induction. • Explain how electromagnetic induction occurs. • Describe the current produced by electromagnetic induction. • Identify ways that electromagnetic induction is used. The girl on the left in this photo is riding a stationary bike. She’s getting exercise, but that’s not the real reason she’s riding the bike. She’s using her muscle power to generate electricity through a process called electromagnetic induction. What Is Electromagnetic Induction? Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic field. It occurs whenever a magnetic field and an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another. As long as the conductor is part of a closed circuit, current will flow through it whenever it crosses lines of force in the magnetic field. One way this can happen is illustrated in the Figure 5.192. The sketch shows a magnet moving through a wire coil. You can watch an animated version of the illustration at this URL: URL the-magnet-car/ . Q: What is another way that a coil of wire and magnet can move relative to one another and generate an electric current? A: The coil of wire could be moved back and forth over the magnet. 
The  Current  Produced by a  Magnet 	  The device with the pointer in the Figure 5.192 is an ammeter. It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil or a stronger magnet were used, this would produce more current as well. The Figure 5.193 shows the direction of the current that is generated by a moving magnet. If the magnet is moved back and forth repeatedly, the current keeps changing direction. In other words, alternating current (AC) is produced. Alternating current is electric current that keeps reversing direction. 
How  Electromagnetic  Induction  Is  Used 	  Two important devices depend on electromagnetic induction: electric generators and electric transformers. Both devices play critical roles in producing and regulating the electric current we depend on in our daily lives. Electric generators use electromagnetic induction to change kinetic energy to electrical energy. They produce electricity in power plants. Electric transformers use electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current. Some transformers increase voltage and other decrease voltage. Q: How do you think the girl on the exercise bike in the opening photo is using electromagnetic induction? A: As she pedals the bike, the kinetic energy of the turning pedals is used to move a conductor through a magnetic field. This generates electric current by electromagnetic induction. 
Summary 	  • Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic field. 
It occurs 	  whenever a magnetic field and an electric conductor move relative to one another so the conductor crosses lines of force in the magnetic field. • The current produced by electromagnetic induction is greater when the magnet or coil moves faster, the coil has more turns, or the magnet is stronger. If the magnet or coil is moved back and forth repeatedly, alternating current is produced. • Electric generators and electric transformers use electromagnetic induction to generate electricity or change the voltage of electric current.

The sprawling machines in this plant aren’t factory machines, but they do produce something. They are electric generators in a hydroelectric power plant, and they produce electricity. 
Generating  Electricity 	  An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic field. 
It occurs when a 	  magnetic field and an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in the Figure 5.194. In any electric generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. The turning shaft causes a coil of wire to rotate between the opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works. URL Q: What might happen to the current produced by an electric generator if the poles of the magnet kept reversing? A: The direction of the current would also keep reversing. In other words, the electric generator would generate alternating current. 
From  Kinetic to  Electrical  Energy 	  Generators may be set up to produce either direct or alternating current. Generators in cars and most power plants produce alternating current. Regardless of the type of current, all generators change kinetic energy to electrical energy. • A car generator produces electricity with some of the kinetic energy of the turning crankshaft. The electricity is used to run the car’s lights, power windows, radio, and other electric devices. Some of the electricity is stored in the car’s battery to provide electrical energy when the car isn’t running. • A power plant generator produces electricity with the kinetic energy of a turning turbine. The energy to turn the turbine may come from burning fuel, falling water, or some other energy source. You can see how falling water is used to generate electricity in a hydroelectric power plant in the Figure 5.195. Q: The water flowing through the dam and over the turbine has kinetic energy because it is moving. Where does the water get the energy to move? A: When the water is in the reservoir, it has potential energy because of gravity. Potential energy is stored in the water because of its position behind the dam. When the water flows into the intake pipe, gravity pulls it downhill to the power plant. 
Summary 	  • An electric generator is a device that produces electricity through electromagnetic induction. Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic field. • Generators may produce either alternating or direct current, but they all change kinetic energy to electrical energy. Explore the electric generator simulation at the following URL. Then describe factors that affect the voltage of the generated current. URL an electric motor in reverse? • Describe an electric transformer and how it changes electric current. • Distinguish between step-up and step-down electric transformers. You’ve probably noticed big drums like this one at the tops of electric poles. A pole close to your home is likely to have one. The drum is an electric transformer. Without it, the current entering your home would have too much voltage for your home’s electric circuits to handle. What Is an Electric Transformer? An electric transformer is a device that uses electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current. Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating current with a magnetic field. It occurs when a magnetic field and electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another. A transformer may either increase or decrease voltage. You can see the basic components of an electric transformer in the Figure 5.196. For an animation showing how a transformer works, go to this URL: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. The transformer in the diagram consists of two wire coils wrapped around an iron core. Each coil is part of a different circuit. When alternating current passes through coil P, it magnetizes the iron core. Because the current is alternating, the magnetic field of the iron core keeps reversing. This is where electromagnetic induction comes in. The changing magnetic field induces alternating current in coil S of the other circuit. 
Stepping  Up or  Stepping  Down 	  Notice that coil P and coil S in the Figure 5.196 have the same number of turns of wire. In this case, the voltages of the primary and secondary currents are the same. Usually, the two coils of a transformer have different numbers of turns. In that case, the voltages of the two currents are different. • When coil S has more turns than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is greater than the voltage in the primary current (see Figure 5.197). This type of transformer is called a step-up transformer. That’s because it steps up, or increases, the voltage. • When coil S has fewer turns of wire than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is less than the voltage in the primary current (see Figure 5.198). This type of transformer is called a step-down transformer because it steps down, or decreases, the voltage. Q: Both step-up and step-down transformers are used in the electrical grid that carries electricity from a power plant to your home. Where in the grid do you think step-down transformers might be used? A: One place that step-down transformers are used is on the electric poles that supply current to homes. They reduce the voltage of the electric current before it enters home circuits. 
Summary 	  • An electric transformer is a device that uses electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of an electric current. • A step-up transformer increases voltage. A step-down transformer decreases voltage. Explore the electric transformer simulation at the following URL. Then answer the questions below. URL rado.edu/en/simulation/generator you tell? • Describe an electrical grid. • Identify the roles of power plants, transmission lines, and electric substations in an electrical grid. These electric power towers carry high-voltage electric lines. The lines transmit electricity from power plants to homes like yours. The towers are a crucial part of the electrical grid. What Is an Electrical Grid? An electrical grid is the entire electrical system that generates, transmits, and distributes electric power throughout a region or country. A very simple electrical grid is sketched in the Figure 5.199. The grid includes a power plant, transmission lines, and electric substations, all of which work together to provide alternating current to customers.

Power  Plants 	  Electricity originates in power plants. They have electric generators that produce electricity by electromagnetic induction. In this process, a changing magnetic field is used to generate electric current. The generators convert kinetic energy to electrical energy. The kinetic energy may come from flowing water, burning fuel, wind, or some other energy source. 
Transmission  Lines 	  Transmission lines on big towers—like those in the opening photo above—carry high-voltage electric current from power plants to electric substations. Smaller towers and individual power poles carry lower-voltage current from electric substations to homes and businesses. 
Electric  Substations 	  Electric substations have several functions. Many substations distribute electricity from a few high-voltage lines to several lower-voltage lines. They have electric transformers, which use electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of the current. Some transformers increase the voltage; others decrease the voltage. In the Figure 5.200, you can see how both types of transformers are used in an electrical grid. • A step-up transformer increases the voltage of the current as it leaves the power plant. After the voltage has been increased, less current travels through the high-voltage power lines. This reduces the amount of power that is lost due to resistance of the power lines. • A step-down transformer decreases the voltage of the current so it can be distributed safely to businesses and homes. A high-voltage power line may have 750,000 volts, whereas most home circuits have a maximum of it enters homes. Q: Assume that a home needs a 14-volt circuit for a light and a 120-volt circuit for a microwave oven. If the main power line entering home has 240 volts, what can you infer about the home’s electrical system? A: The home’s electrical system must have step-down transformers that lower the voltage for some of the home’s circuits. 
Summary 	  • The electrical grid is the entire electrical system that generates, transmits, and distributes electric power throughout a region or country. It includes power plants, transmission lines, and electric substations. • Power plants are where electric power originates. They have electric generators that generate electric current through electromagnetic induction. • Transmission lines carry electric current from power plants to substations and from substations to homes and other places where electric power is needed. • Electric substations have step-up or step-down transformers to increase or decrease the voltage of current as needed.
