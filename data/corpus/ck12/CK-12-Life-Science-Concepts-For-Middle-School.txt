Foreword

The study of life is one of the fundamental ﬁelds of the middle school curriculum. The CK-12 Life Science Concept
Collection presents life science as a set of 12 chapters, each centered around a general area of study, such as cell
biology or human biology. Each chapter is broken down into concepts. Each concept is a mini-lesson that addresses
one speciﬁc topic or key objective. The complete CK-12 Life Science Concept Collection is comprised of 272
concepts.

Introduction

What does it mean to be alive?
Scientiﬁcally, there is an actual deﬁnition of living. Living organisms must have certain characteristics. If they do
not have these characteristics, are they living? This butterﬂy, like all other insects, animals, plants, and every other
living organism, shares common characteristics with all life. What exactly does it mean to be alive? This chapter will

1

answer this question. These concepts will serve as an introduction to life science, discussing the basics of studying
the life sciences and addressing the question, "What is a living organism?"

Introduction to Life Science

1.1 Scientiﬁc Ways of Thinking

• Describe the role of a scientist.
• Describe what is meant by "thinking like a scientist."

What was that noise?
If you let your emotions rule your thinking, you might think a thumping noise was a ghost. If you think like a
scientist, however, you ask questions and make observations. You’d observe the shutters are loose and blowing in
the wind.

Scientiﬁc Ways of Thinking

Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world, based on observable evidence, reasoning, and repeated
testing. That means scientists explain the world based on their own observations. If they develop new ideas about
the way the world works, they set up a way to test these new ideas.

Thinking Like a Scientist

A scientist is always trying to ﬁnd the truth and discover new truths. How can you think like a scientist? Thinking
like a scientist is based on asking and answering questions. Though you may not know it, you do this all day long.
Scientists ask questions, and then make detailed observations to try to ask more speciﬁc questions and develop a
hypothesis. They may design and perform an experiment to try to answer their question and test their hypothesis.
From the results of their experiment, scientists draw conclusions. A conclusion describes what the evidence tells
the scientist.

• Scientists ask questions: The key to being a great scientist is to ask questions. Imagine you are a scientist in
the African Congo. While in the ﬁeld, you observe one group of healthy chimpanzees on the north side of the

1.1. Scientiﬁc Ways of Thinking

jungle. On the other side of the jungle, you ﬁnd a group of chimpanzees that are mysteriously dying. What
questions might you ask? A good scientist might ask the following two questions:
1. "What differs between the two environments where the chimpanzees live?"
2. "Are there differences in behavior between the two groups of chimpanzees?"

•

• Scientists make detailed observations: To observe means to watch and study attentively. A person untrained
in the sciences may only observe, "The chimps on one side of the jungle are dying, while chimps on the other
side of the jungle are healthy." A scientist, however, will make more detailed observations. Can you think of
ways to make this observation more detailed? What about the number of chimps? Are they male or female?
Young or old? What do they eat? A good scientist may observe, "While all seven adult females and three adult
males on the north side of the jungle are healthy and show normal behavior, four female and ﬁve male chimps
under the age of ﬁve on the south side have died." Detailed observations can ultimately help scientists design
their experiments and answer their questions. From these observations, a scientist will develop a hypothesis
to explain the observations. A hypothesis is the scientist’s proposed explanation for his observations. The
scientist’s hypothesis may be that "Young chimps on the south side die due to a lack of nutrients in their diet."

FIGURE 1.1

troglodytes).

• Scientists ﬁnd answers using tests: When scientists want to answer a question, they search for evidence
using experiments. An experiment is a test to see if their explanation is right or wrong. Evidence is made up
of the observations a scientist makes during an experiment. To study the cause of death in the chimpanzees,
scientists may give the chimps nutrients in the form of nuts, berries, and vitamins to see if they are dying from
a lack of food. This test is the experiment. If fewer chimps die, then the experiment shows that the chimps
may have died from not having enough food. This is the evidence.

• Scientists question the answers: Good scientists are skeptical. Scientists never use only one piece of evidence
to form a conclusion. For example, the chimpanzees in the experiment may have died from a lack of food, but
can you think of another explanation for their death? They may have died from a virus, or from another less
obvious cause. More experiments need to be completed before scientists can be sure. Science is about ﬁnding
the truth, no matter what. So good scientists constantly question their own conclusions. They also ﬁnd other
scientists to conﬁrm or disagree with their evidence.

1.2 Fields in the Life Sciences

• Deﬁne life science.
• Describe the major ﬁelds within the life sciences.
• Explain what is studied in cell biology, genetics, and evolution.

What kind of scientist studies dolphins?
Dolphins are living organisms, so studying them is part of the life sciences. The life sciences, however, are broken
down into many ﬁelds. Scientists that study dolphins and other life in the ocean are called marine biologists.

Fields in the Life Sciences

The life sciences are the study of living organisms. They deal with every aspect of living organisms, from the
biology of cells, to the biology of individual organisms, to how these organisms interact with other organisms and
their environment.
The life sciences are so complex that most scientists focus on just one or two subspecialties. If you want to study
insects, what would you be called? An entomologist. If you want to study the tiny things that give us the ﬂu, then
you need to enter the ﬁeld of virology, the study of viruses. If you want to study the nervous system, which life
science ﬁeld is right for you ( Table 1.1, Table 1.2, and Table 1.3)?

During the study of the life sciences, you will study cell biology, genetics, molecular biology, botany, microbi-
ology, zoology, evolution, ecology, and physiology. Cell biology is the study of cellular structure and function (
Figure 1.2). Genetics is the study of heredity, which is the passing of traits (and genes) from one generation to the
next. Molecular biology is the study of molecules, such as DNA and proteins. Ecologists study ecosystems, which
are made of both living and nonliving parts of the environment. A botanist may work in a botanical garden, where
plant life can be studied. What will you study with the other subspecialties?

www.ck12.org

1.3 Scientiﬁc Theories

• Explain the concepts of a hypothesis and scientiﬁc evidence.
• Distinguish between a scientiﬁc theory and a scientiﬁc law.

What causes disease?
Today most people realize that microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, are the cause of disease. This concept
is known as the germ theory of disease, one of the few scientiﬁc theories in the ﬁeld of the life sciences. Although it
seems obvious now, people did not always understand the cause of disease. How does a theory such as this become
established?

Scientiﬁc Evidence and Theories

One goal of a scientist is to ﬁnd answers to scientiﬁc questions. To do this, scientists ﬁrst develop a hypothesis,
which is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation. To collect evidence to support (or disprove)
their hypothesis, scientists must do experiments. Evidence is:

1. A direct, physical observation of something or a process over time.
2. Usually something measurable or "quantiﬁable."
3. The data resulting from an experiment.

For example, an apple falling to the ground is evidence in support of the law of gravity. A bear skeleton in the woods
would be evidence of the presence of bears.

10

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Life Science

Looking at the image below might be confusing at ﬁrst because this evidence seems to defy the law of gravity (
Figure 1.4). Of course water cannot be poured out of bottle and ﬂow upward. The law of gravity is a scientiﬁc
law, which is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions in nature. Scientiﬁc laws are
developed from lots of collected information.

FIGURE 1.4
Water going upward against gravity.

If many experiments are performed, and lots of evidence is collected in support of a general hypothesis, a scientiﬁc
theory can be developed. Scientiﬁc theories are well established explanations of evidence, usually tested and
conﬁrmed by many different people. Scientiﬁc theories usually have a lot of evidence in support of the theory,
and no evidence disproving the theory. Scientiﬁc theories produce information that helps us understand our world.
For example, the idea that matter is made up of atoms is a scientiﬁc theory. Scientists accept this theory as a
fundamental principle of basic science.
A scientiﬁc theory must stand up to all scientiﬁc testing. Thus, when scientists ﬁnd new evidence, they can change
their theories. In addition to the germ theory of disease, other scientiﬁc theories are the cell theory and the theory of
evolution.

Summary

• Evidence is a direct, physical observation of something or a process.
• Scientiﬁc theories are explanations of some aspect of the natural world based on repeated observations.

1.4 Scientiﬁc Investigation

• Deﬁne and describe the scientiﬁc method.
• Summarize the characteristics of a scientiﬁc hypothesis.
• Develop a scientiﬁc hypothesis.
• Explain the importance of communicating results.

How do scientists obtain new knowledge?
All the information in textbooks had to come from somewhere. In the sciences, new information about the natural
world is a result of scientiﬁc investigations. These investigations are shaped by the scientiﬁc method.

Scientiﬁc Method

The scientiﬁc method is a process used to investigate the unknown ( Figure 1.5). It is the general process of a
scientiﬁc investigation. This process uses evidence and testing. Scientists use the scientiﬁc method so they can ﬁnd
information. A common method allows all scientists to answer questions in a similar way. Scientists who use this
method can reproduce another scientist’s experiments.
Almost all versions of the scientiﬁc method include the following steps, although some scientists do use slight
variations.

1. Make observations.
2. Identify a question you would like to answer based on the observation.
3. Find out what is already known about your observation (research).
4. Form a hypothesis.
5. Test the hypothesis.
6. Analyze your results and draw conclusions.
7. Communicate your results.

13

1.4. Scientiﬁc Investigation

FIGURE 1.5
Steps of a Scientiﬁc Investigation. A scientiﬁc investigation typically has
these steps.

Making Observations

Imagine that you are a scientist. While collecting water samples at a local pond, you notice a frog with ﬁve legs
instead of four ( Figure 1.6). As you start to look around, you discover that many of the frogs have extra limbs,
extra eyes, or no eyes. One frog even has limbs coming out of its mouth. These are your observations, or things
you notice about an environment using your ﬁve senses.

FIGURE 1.6
A frog with an extra leg.

Identify a Question Based on Your Observations

The next step is to ask a question about the frogs. You may ask, "Why are so many frogs deformed?" Or, "Is
there something in their environment causing these defects, like water pollution?" Yet, you do not know if this large
number of deformities is "normal" for frogs. What if many of the frogs found in ponds and lakes all over the world
have similar deformities? Before you look for causes, you need to ﬁnd out if the number and kind of deformities is
unusual. So besides ﬁnding out why the frogs are deformed, you should also ask: "Is the percentage of deformed
frogs in this pond greater than the percentage of deformed frogs in other places?"

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Life Science

FIGURE 1.7
A pond with frogs.

Research Existing Knowledge About the Topic

No matter what you observe, you need to ﬁnd out what is already known about your questions. For example, is
anyone else doing research on deformed frogs? If yes, what did they ﬁnd out? Do you think that you should repeat
their research to see if it can be duplicated? During your research, you might learn something that convinces you to
change or reﬁne your question. From this, you will construct your hypothesis.

Construct a Hypothesis

A hypothesis is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation. A good hypothesis allows you to make
more predictions. For example, you might hypothesize that a pesticide from a nearby farm is running into the pond
and causing frogs to have extra legs. If that’s true, then you can predict that the water in a pond of non-deformed
frogs will have lower levels of that pesticide. That’s a prediction you can test by measuring pesticide levels in two
sets of ponds, those with deformed frogs and those with nothing but healthy frogs. Every hypothesis needs to be
written in a way that it can:

1. Be tested using experiments to collect evidence.
2. Be proven wrong.
3. Provide measurable results.
4. Provide yes or no answers.

For example, do you think the following hypothesis meets the four criteria above? Let’s see. Hypothesis: "The
number of deformed frogs in ﬁve ponds that are polluted with chemical X is higher than the number of deformed
frogs in ﬁve ponds without chemical X." Of course, next you will have to test your hypothesis.

Test Your Hypothesis

To test the hypothesis, an experiment will be done. You would count the healthy and deformed frogs and measure
the amount of chemical X in all of the ponds. The hypothesis will be either true or false. Doing an experiment will
test most hypotheses. The experiment may generate evidence in support of the hypothesis. The experiment may also
generate evidence proving the hypothesis false. Once you collect your data, it will need to be analyzed.

15

1.4. Scientiﬁc Investigation

www.ck12.org

Analyze Data and Draw a Conclusion

If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed, the experiment will produce results that you can measure, collect,
and analyze. The analysis should tell you if the hypothesis is true or false. Refer to the table for the experimental
results ( Table 1.4).

Your results show that pesticide levels in the two sets of ponds are different, but the average number of deformed
frogs is almost the same. Your results demonstrate that your hypothesis is false. The situation may be more
complicated than you thought. This gives you new information that will help you decide what to do next. Even
if the results supported your hypothesis, you would probably ask a new question to try to better understand what is
happening to the frogs and why.

Drawing Conclusions and Communicating Results

If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed, the results will indicate whether your hypothesis is true or false. If
a hypothesis is true, scientists will often continue testing the hypothesis in new ways to learn more. If a hypothesis
is false, the results may be used to come up with and test a new hypothesis. A scientist will then communicate
the results to the scientiﬁc community. This will allow others to review the information and extend the studies.
The scientiﬁc community can also use the information for related studies. Scientists communicate their results in a
number of ways. For example, they may talk to small groups of scientists and give talks at large scientiﬁc meetings.
They will also write articles for scientiﬁc journals. Their ﬁndings may also be communicated to journalists.
If you conclude that frogs are deformed due to a pesticide not previously measured, you would publish an article
and give talks about your research. Your conclusion could eventually help ﬁnd solutions to this problem.

Discovering the Scientiﬁc Method

video by MIT students: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDNgeEUtMg .

• Deﬁne basic science and applied science.
• Distinguish between basic science and applied science.

Why should we study the rainforest?
Some scientists study problems that seem to have very little impact on our lives. For example, scientists are working
to describe every type of plant and animal in the rainforest. What is the purpose? Many of our medicines come from
plants and animals of the rainforest. So what medicines have not yet been discovered? There might be new cures to
diseases yet to be identiﬁed. This is an example of how science can be applied to our lives.

Basic and Applied Science

Science can be "basic" or "applied." The goal of basic science is to understand how things work—whether it is
a single cell, an organism made of trillions of cells, or a whole ecosystem. Scientists working on basic science
questions are simply looking to increase human knowledge of nature and the world around us. The knowledge
obtained through the study of the subspecialties of the life sciences is mostly basic science.
Basic science is the source of most scientiﬁc theories. For example, a scientist that tries to ﬁgure out how the
body makes cholesterol, or what causes a particular disease, is performing basic science. This is also known as
basic research. Additional examples of basic research would be investigating how glucose is turned into cellular
energy or determining how elevated blood glucose levels can be harmful. The study of the cell (cell biology), the
study of inheritance (genetics), the study of molecules (molecular biology), the study of microorganisms and viruses
(microbiology and virology), the study of tissues and organs (physiology) are all types of basic research, and have
all generated lots of information that is applied to humans and human health.

Introduction to Life Science

Applied science is using scientiﬁc discoveries, such as those from basic research, to solve practical problems. For
example, medicine, and all that is known about how to treat patients, is applied science based on basic research (
Figure 1.8). A doctor administering a drug to lower a person’s cholesterol is an example of applied science. Applied
science also creates new technologies based on basic science. For example, designing windmills to capture wind
energy is applied science ( Figure 1.9). This technology relies, however, on basic science. Studies of wind patterns
and bird migration routes help determine the best placement for the windmills.

lems.

1.6 Microscopes

• Describe how microscopes are used in the life sciences.
• Identify how cells were ﬁrst identiﬁed.

How can we see the details of bacteria?
With the naked eye, bacteria just look like a slimy smear on a petri dish. How can we study them in more detail?
The invention of the microscope has allowed us to see bacteria, cells, and other things too small to be seen with the
naked eye.

The Microscope

Microscopes, tools that you may get to use in your class, are some of the most important tools in biology ( Figure
1.10). A microscope is a tool used to make things that are too small to be seen by the human eye look bigger.
Microscopy is the study of small objects using microscopes. Look at your ﬁngertips. Before microscopes were
invented in 1595, the smallest things you could see on yourself were the tiny lines in your skin. But what else is
hidden in your skin?

Invention of the Microscope

Over four hundred years ago, two Dutch spectacle makers, Zaccharias Janssen and his son Hans, were experimenting
with several lenses in a tube. They discovered that nearby objects appeared greatly enlarged, or magniﬁed. This
was the forerunner of the compound microscope and of the telescope.
In 1665, Robert Hooke, an English natural scientist, used a microscope to zoom in on a piece of cork - the stuff that
makes up the stoppers in wine bottles, which is made from tree bark. Inside of cork, he discovered tiny structures,
which he called cells. It turns out that cells are the smallest structural unit of living organisms. This ﬁnding eventually

21

1.6. Microscopes

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 1.10
Basic light microscopes opened up a new
world to curious people.

led to the development of the theory that all living things are made of cells. Without microscopes, this discovery
would not have been possible, and the cell theory would not have been developed.
Hooke’s discovery of the cell set the stage for other scientists to discover other types of organisms. After Hooke,
the "father of microscopy," Dutch scientist Antoine van Leeuwenhoek ( Figure 1.11) taught himself to make one of
the ﬁrst microscopes. In one of his early experiments, van Leeuwenhoek took a sample of scum from his own teeth
and used his microscope to discover bacteria, the smallest living organism on the planet. Using microscopes, van
Leeuwenhoek also discovered one-celled protists and sperm cells.
Today, microscopes are used by all types of scientists, including cell biologists, microbiologists, virologists, forensic
scientists, entomologists, taxonomists, and many other types.

Types of Microscopes

Some modern microscopes use light, as Hooke’s and van Leeuwenhoek’s did. Others may use electron beams or
sound waves. Researchers now use these four types of microscopes:

1. Light microscopes allow biologists to see small details of a specimen. Most of the microscopes used in
schools and laboratories are light microscopes. Light microscopes use lenses, typically made of glass or
plastic, to focus light either into the eye, a camera, or some other light detector. The most powerful light
microscopes can make images up to 2,000 times larger.

2. Transmission electron microscopes (TEM) focus a beam of electrons through an object and can make an

image up to two million times bigger, with a very clear image.

3. Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) allow scientists to ﬁnd the shape and surface texture of extremely
small objects, including a paperclip, a bedbug, or even an atom. These microscopes slide a beam of electrons
across the surface of a specimen, producing detailed maps of the surface of objects. Magniﬁcation in a SEM
can be controlled over a range from about 10 to 500,000 times.

1.7 Safety in the Life Sciences

• Recognize the types of hazards that a scientist faces.
• Describe laboratory safety guidelines that minimize potential risks.

What does this sign mean?
If a substance is corrosive, it can eat through objects. Many scientists have to work with chemicals that are corrosive
or otherwise dangerous. That’s one reason that following safety precautions in the laboratory or ﬁeld is very
important.

Safety in the Life Sciences

There can be some very serious safety risks in scientiﬁc research. If researchers are not careful, they could poison
themselves or contract a deadly illness. The kinds of risks that scientists face depend on the kind of research they
perform. For example, a scientist working with bacteria in a laboratory faces different risks than a scientist studying
the behavior of lions in Africa, but both scientists must still follow safety guidelines. Safety practices must be
followed when working with the hazardous things such as parasites, radiation and radioactive materials, toxins, and
wild animals. Also, carcinogens, which are chemical that cause cancer, pathogens, which are disease-causing virus,
bacteria or fungi, and teratogens, which are chemical that cause deformities in developing embryos, are extremely

26

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Life Science

hazardous, and extreme care must be used when working with these items as well. For example, scientists studying
dangerous organisms such as Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, use special equipment that helps keep the
organism from escaping the lab.
A biohazard is any biological material that could make someone sick, including disease-causing organisms. There-
fore, a used needle is a biohazard because it could harbor blood contaminated with a disease-causing organism.
Bacteria grown in a laboratory are also biohazards if they could potentially cause disease.

FIGURE 1.13
Science laboratory safety and chemical
hazard signs.

Laboratory Safety

If you perform an experiment in your classroom, your teacher will explain how to be safe. Professional scientists
follow safety rules as well, especially for the study of dangerous organisms like the bacteria that cause bubonic
plague ( Figure 1.14).
Sharp objects, chemicals, heat, and electricity are all used at times in laboratories. Below is a list of safety guidelines
that you should follow when in the laboratory:

• Be sure to obey all safety guidelines given in lab instructions and by your teacher.
• Follow directions carefully.
• Tie back long hair.
• Wear closed toe shoes with ﬂat heels and shirts with no hanging sleeves, hoods, or drawstrings.
• Use gloves, goggles, or safety aprons when instructed to do so.
• Broken glass should only be cleaned up with a dust pan and broom. Never touch broken glass with your bare

hands.

• Never eat or drink anything in the science lab. Table tops and counters could have dangerous substances on

them.

27

1.7. Safety in the Life Sciences

www.ck12.org

• Be sure to completely clean materials like test tubes and beakers. Leftover substances could interact with other

substances in future experiments.

• If you are using ﬂames or heat plates, be careful when you reach. Be sure your arms and hair are kept far away

from heat.

• Alert your teacher immediately if anything out of the ordinary occurs. An accident report may be required if

someone is hurt. Also, the teacher must know if any materials are damaged or discarded.

FIGURE 1.14
Scientists studying dangerous organisms
such as Yersinia pestis,
the cause of
bubonic plague, use special equipment
that helps keep the organism from escap-
ing the lab.

Field Research Safety

A ﬁeld scientist studies an organism in a natural setting, which is not usually an indoor laboratory. Scientists who
work outdoors are also required to follow safety regulations. These safety regulations are designed to prevent harm
to themselves, other humans, animals, and the environment. If scientists work outside the country, they are required
to learn about and follow the laws and restrictions of the country in which they are doing research. For example,
entomologists following monarch butterﬂy ( Figure 1.15) migrations between the United States and Mexico must
follow regulations in both countries. Before biologists can study protected wildlife or plant species, they must apply
for permission to do so, usually from the government. This is important to protect these fragile species. For example,
if scientists collect rare butterﬂies, they must ﬁrst get a permit. They must also be careful to not disturb the habitat.

Summary

• There are serious risks in scientiﬁc research, including carcinogens, biohazards, and toxins.
• You need to carefully follow all safety rules while working in the laboratory.

• Know the ﬁve characteristics of living organisms.
• Describe the ﬁve characteristics shared by all living organisms.
• Identify the role of the ﬁve characteristics shared by all living organisms.
• Summarize in detail the role of each characteristic in life.

Is ﬁre alive?
Fire can grow. Fire needs fuel and oxygen. But ﬁre is not a form of life, although it shares a few traits with some
living things. How can you distinguish between non-living and living things?

The Characteristics of Life

How do you deﬁne a living thing? What do mushrooms, daisies, cats, and bacteria have in common? All of these
are living things, or organisms. It might seem hard to think of similarities among such different organisms, but they
actually have many properties in common. Living organisms are similar to each other because all organisms evolved
from the same common ancestor that lived billions of years ago.
All living organisms:

1. Need energy to carry out life processes.

31

1.8. Characteristics of Life

www.ck12.org

2. Are composed of one or more cells.
3. Respond to their environment.
4. Grow and reproduce.
5. Maintain a stable internal environment.

Living Things Need Resources and Energy

Why do you eat everyday? To get energy. Energy is the ability to do work. Without energy, you could not do any
"work." Though not doing any "work" may sound nice, the "work" fueled by energy includes everyday activities,
such as walking, writing, and thinking. But you are not the only one who needs energy. In order to grow and
reproduce and carry out the other process of life, all living organisms need energy. But where does this energy come
from?
The source of energy differs for each type of living thing. In your body, the source of energy is the food you eat.
Here is how animals, plants, and fungi obtain their energy:

• All animals must eat in order to obtain energy. Animals also eat to obtain building materials. Animals eat

• Plants don’t eat. Instead, they use energy from the sun to make their "food" through the process of photosyn-

plants and other animals.

thesis.

• Mushrooms and other fungi obtain energy from other organisms. That’s why you often see fungi growing on

a fallen tree; the rotting tree is their source of energy ( Figure 1.16).

Since plants harvest energy from the sun and other organisms get their energy from plants, nearly all the energy of
living things initially comes from the sun.

FIGURE 1.16
Orange bracket fungi on a rotting log in the Oak Openings Preserve in
Ohio. Fungi obtain energy from breaking down dead organisms, such as
this rotting log.

Living Things Are Made of Cells

If you zoom in very close on a leaf of a plant, or on the skin on your hand, or a drop of blood, you will ﬁnd cells, you
will ﬁnd cells ( Figure 1.17). Cells are the smallest structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Most cells
are so small that they are usually visible only through a microscope. Some organisms, like bacteria, plankton that
live in the ocean, or the Paramecium, shown in Figure 1.18, are unicellular, made of just one cell. Other organisms
have millions, billions, or trillions of cells.
All cells have at least some structures in common, such as ribosomes, which are the sites where proteins are made.
All cells also have DNA and proteins. The nucleus is clearly visible in the blood cells ( Figure 1.17). The nucleus
can be described as the "information center," containing the instructions (DNA) for making all the proteins in a cell,
as well as how much of each protein to make. The nucleus is also the main distinguishing feature between the two
general categories of cell, with cells known as prokaryotic lacking a nucleus.

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Life Science

Although the cells of different organisms are built differently, they all have certain general functions. Every cell
must get energy from food, be able to grow and divide, and respond to its environment. More about cell structure
and function will be discussed in additional concepts.

FIGURE 1.17

cleus. A few smaller cells are also visi-
ble. This image has been magniﬁed 1000
times its real size.

FIGURE 1.18
This Paramecium is a single-celled organ-
ism.

Living Organisms Respond to their Environment

All living organisms are able to react to something important or interesting in their external environment. For
example, living organisms constantly respond to their environment. They respond to changes in light, heat, sound,
and chemical and mechanical contact. Organisms have means for receiving information, such as eyes, ears, taste
buds, or other structures.

33

1.8. Characteristics of Life

Living Things Grow and Reproduce

www.ck12.org

All living things reproduce to make the next generation. Organisms that do not reproduce will go extinct. As a
result, there are no species that do not reproduce ( Figure 1.19). Some organisms reproduce asexually ( asexual
reproduction), especially single-celled organisms, and make identical copies (or clones) of themselves. Other
organisms reproduce sexually ( sexual reproduction), combining genetic information from two parents to make
genetically unique offspring.

Living Things Maintain Stable Internal Conditions

When you are cold, what does your body do to keep warm? You shiver to warm up your body. When you are too
warm, you sweat to release heat. When any living organism gets thrown off balance, its body or cells help it return
to normal. In other words, living organisms have the ability to keep a stable internal environment. Maintaining
a balance inside the body or cells of organisms is known as homeostasis. Like us, many animals have evolved
behaviors that control their internal temperature. A lizard may stretch out on a sunny rock to increase its internal
temperature, and a bird may ﬂuff its feathers to stay warm ( Figure 1.20).

Summary

• Living things are called organisms.
• All living organisms need energy to carry out life processes, are composed of one or more cells, respond to

their environment, grow, reproduce, and maintain a stable internal environment.

understanding how chemicals work is essential to understanding how living things work.

The Elements

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Life Science

If you pull a ﬂower petal from a plant and break it in half, and then take that piece and break it in half again, and
take the next piece and break it half, and so on, and so on, until you cannot even see the ﬂower anymore, what do
you think you will ﬁnd? We know that the ﬂower petal is made of cells, but what are cells made of? Scientists have
broken down matter, or anything that takes up space and has mass—like a cell—into the smallest pieces that cannot
be broken down anymore. Every physical object, including rocks, animals, ﬂowers, and your body, are all made up
of matter.
Matter is made up of a mixture of things called elements. Elements are substances that cannot be broken down into
simpler substances. There are more than 100 known elements, and 92 occur naturally around us. The others have
been made only in the laboratory.
Inside of elements, you will ﬁnd identical atoms. An atom is the simplest and smallest particle of matter that still
has chemical properties of the element. Atoms are the building block of all of the elements that make up the matter
in your body or any other living or non-living thing. Atoms are so small that only the most powerful microscopes
can see them.
Atoms themselves are composed of even smaller particles, including positively charged protons, uncharged neu-
trons, and negatively charged electrons. Protons and neutrons are located in the center of the atom, or the nucleus,
and the electrons move around the nucleus. How many protons an atom has determines what element it is. For
example, hydrogen (H) has just one proton, helium (He) always has two protons ( Figure 1.21), while sodium (Na)
always has 11.
All the atoms of a particular element have the exact same number of protons, and the number of protons is that
element’s atomic number. An atom usually has the same number of protons and electrons, but sometimes an atom
may gain or lose an electron, giving the atom a positive or negative charge. These atoms are known as ions and are
depicted with a "+" or "-" sign. Ions, such as H+, Na+, K+, or Cl− have signiﬁcant biological roles.

FIGURE 1.21
An atom of Helium (He) contains two positively charged protons (red), two
uncharged neutrons (blue), and two negatively charged electrons (yellow).

The Periodic Table

In 1869, a Russian scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev created the periodic table, which is a way of organizing
elements according to their unique characteristics, like atomic number, density, boiling point, and other values (
Figure 1.22). Each element is represented by a one or two letter symbol. For example, H stands for hydrogen, and
Au stands for gold. The vertical columns in the periodic table are known as groups, and elements in groups tend to
have very similar properties. The table is also divided into rows, known as periods.

37

1.9. Chemistry of Life

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 1.22
The periodic table groups the elements based on their properties. The table begins with Hydrogen, atomic number
1.

Chemical Reactions

A molecule is any combination of two or more atoms. The oxygen in the air we breathe is two oxygen atoms
connected by a chemical bond to form O2, or molecular oxygen. A carbon dioxide molecule is a combination of one
carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, CO2. Because carbon dioxide includes two different elements, it is a compound
as well as a molecule.
A compound is any combination of two or more different elements. A compound has different properties from the
elements that it contains. Elements and combinations of elements (compounds) make up all the many types of matter
in the Universe. A chemical reaction is a process that breaks or forms the bonds between atoms of molecules and
compounds. For example, two hydrogens and one oxygen bind together to form water, H2O. The molecules that
come together to start a chemical reaction are the reactants. So hydrogen and oxygen are the reactants. The product
is the end result of a reaction. In this example, water is the product.
Atoms also come together to form compounds much larger than water. It is some of these large compounds that
come together to form the basis of the cell. So essentially, your cells are made out of compounds, which are made
out of atoms.

What makes up a healthy diet?
A healthy diet includes protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Why? Because these compounds are three of the main
building blocks that make up your body. You obtain these building blocks from the food that you eat, and you use
these building blocks to make the organic compounds necessary for life.

Organic Compounds

The main chemical components of living organisms are known as organic compounds. Organic compounds are
molecules built around the element carbon (C). Living things are made up of very large molecules. These large
molecules are called macromolecules because “macro” means large; they are made by smaller molecules bonding
together. Our body gets these smaller molecules, the "building blocks" or monomers, of organic molecules from the
food we eat. Which organic molecules do you recognize from the list below?
The four main types of macromolecules found in living organisms, shown in Table 1.5, are:

1. Proteins.
2. Carbohydrates.
3. Lipids.
4. Nucleic Acids.

Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are sugars, or long chains of sugars. An important role of carbohydrates is to store energy. Glucose
( Figure 1.23) is an important simple sugar molecule with the chemical formula C6H12O6. Simple sugars are known
as monosaccharides. Carbohydrates also include long chains of connected sugar molecules. These long chains often
consist of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharides bonded together to form polysaccharides. Plants store sugar
in polysaccharides called starch. Animals store sugar in polysaccharides called glycogen. You get the carbohydrates
you need for energy from eating carbohydrate-rich foods, including fruits and vegetables, as well as grains, such as
bread, rice, or corn.

FIGURE 1.23
A molecule of glucose, a type of carbohy-
drate.

Proteins

Proteins are molecules that have many different functions in living things. All proteins are made of monomers
called amino acids ( Figure 1.24) that connect together like beads on a necklace ( Figure 1.25). There are only
20 common amino acids needed to build proteins. These amino acids form in thousands of different combinations,
making about 100,000 or more unique proteins in humans. Proteins can differ in both the number and order of
amino acids. It is the number and order of amino acids that determines the shape of the protein, and it is the shape
(structure) of the protein that determines the unique function of the protein. Small proteins have just a few hundred

41

1.10. Organic Compounds

www.ck12.org

amino acids. The largest proteins have more than 25,000 amino acids.

FIGURE 1.24
This model shows the general structure of all amino acids. Only the side
chain, R, varies from one amino acid to another. KEY: H = hydrogen, N =
nitrogen, C = carbon, O = oxygen, R = variable side chain.

FIGURE 1.25
Amino acids connect together like beads
on a necklace. MET, ASN, TRP, and GLN
refer to four different amino acids.

Many important molecules in your body are proteins. Examples include enzymes, antibodies, and muscle ﬁber.
Enzymes are a type of protein that speed up chemical reactions. They are known as "biological catalysts." For
example, your stomach would not be able to break down food if it did not have special enzymes to speed up the rate
of digestion. Antibodies that protect you against disease are proteins. Muscle ﬁber is mostly protein ( Figure 1.26).

FIGURE 1.26
Muscle ﬁbers are made mostly of protein.

It’s important for you and other animals to eat food with protein, because we cannot make certain amino acids on
our own. You can get proteins from plant sources, such as beans, and from animal sources, like milk or meat. When
you eat food with protein, your body breaks the proteins down into individual amino acids and uses them to build
new proteins. You really are what you eat!

Lipids

Have you ever tried to put oil in water? They don’t mix. Oil is a type of lipid. Lipids are molecules such as fats,
oils, and waxes. The most common lipids in your diet are probably fats and oils. Fats are solid at room temperature,
whereas oils are ﬂuid. Animals use fats for long-term energy storage and to keep warm. Plants use oils for long-
term energy storage. When preparing food, we often use animal fats, such as butter, or plant oils, such as olive

oil or canola oil. There are many more type of lipids that are important to life. One of the most important are the
phospholipids that make up the protective outer membrane of all cells ( Figure 1.27). These lipid membranes are
impermeable to most water soluble compounds.

FIGURE 1.27
Phospholipids in a membrane, shown as
two layers (a bilayer) of phospholipids fac-
ing each other.

Nucleic acids

Nucleic acids are long chains of nucleotides. Nucleotides are made of a sugar, a nitrogen-containing base, and
a phosphate group. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are the two main nucleic acids.
DNA is a double-stranded nucleic acid. DNA is the molecule that stores our genetic information ( Figure 1.28).
The single-stranded RNA is involved in making proteins. ATP (adenosine triphosphate), known as the "energy
currency" of the cell, is also a nucleic acid.

acid.

1.11 Organization of Living Things

• Explain the main contribution of Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus.
• Deﬁne binomial nomenclature.
• Summarize modern classiﬁcation of living organisms.
• Deﬁne a species.

How would you classify a horse?
It’s easy enough to classify the horse in the animal kingdom. That’s one level of classiﬁcation. But what other
groups does the horse belong to? Horses also belong to a class—the mammals. These animals all have fur and nurse
their young.

Classiﬁcation of Life

When you see an organism that you have never seen before, you probably put it into a group without even thinking.
If it is green and leafy, you probably call it a plant. If it is long and slithers, you probably call it as a snake. How do
you make these decisions? You look at the physical features of the organism and think about what it has in common
with other organisms.
Scientists do the same thing when they classify, or put into categories, living things. Scientists classify organisms
not only by their physical features, but also by how closely related they are. Lions and tigers look like each other
more than they look like bears, but are lions and tigers related? Evolutionarily speaking, yes. Evolution is the

45

1.11. Organization of Living Things

www.ck12.org

change in a species over time. Lions and tigers both evolved from a common ancestor. So it turns out that the two
cats are actually more closely related to each other than to bears. How an organism looks and how it is related to
other organisms determines how it is classiﬁed.

Linnaean System of Classiﬁcation

People have been concerned with classifying organisms for thousands of years. Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek
philosopher Aristotle developed a classiﬁcation system that divided living things into several groups that we still use
today, including mammals, insects, and reptiles.
Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus (1707-1778) ( Figure 1.29) built on Aristotle’s work to create his own classiﬁcation system.
He invented the way we name organisms today, with each organism having a two word name. Linnaeus is considered
the inventor of modern taxonomy, the science of naming and grouping organisms.

FIGURE 1.29
In the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus invented the two-name system of
naming organisms (genus and species) and introduced the most complete
classiﬁcation system then known.

Linnaeus developed binomial nomenclature, a way to give a scientiﬁc name to every organism. In this system, each
organism receives a two-part name in which the ﬁrst word is the genus (a group of species), and the second word
refers to one species in that genus. For example, a coyote’s species name is Canis latrans. Latrans is the species and
Canis is the genus, a larger group that includes dogs, wolves, and other dog-like animals. Here is another example:
the red maple, Acer rubra, and the sugar maple, Acer saccharum, are both in the same genus and they look similar
( Figure 1.30). Notice that the genus is capitalized and the species is not, and that the whole scientiﬁc name is
in italics. Tigers (Panthera tigris) and lions (Panthera leo) have the same genus name, but are obviously different
species. The names may seem strange, but the names are written in a language called Latin.

FIGURE 1.30
These leaves are from two different
species of trees in the Acer, or maple,
genus. The green leaf (far left) is from the
sugar maple, and the red leaf (center) are
from the red maple. One of the character-
istics of the maple genus is winged seeds
(far right).

Modern Classiﬁcation

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Life Science

Modern taxonomists have reordered many groups of organisms since Linnaeus. The main categories that biologists
use are listed here from the most speciﬁc to the least speciﬁc category ( Figure 1.31). All organisms can be classiﬁed
into one of three domains, the least speciﬁc grouping. The three domains are Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
The Kingdom is the next category after the Domain. All life is divided among six kingdoms: Kingdom Bacteria,
Kingdom Archaea, Kingdom Protista, Kingdom Plantae, Kingdom Fungi, and Kingdom Animalia.

FIGURE 1.31
This diagram illustrates the classiﬁcation
categories for organisms, with the broad-
est category (kingdom) at the bottom, and
the most speciﬁc category (species) at the
top. We are Homo sapiens. Homo is the
genus of great apes that includes modern
humans and closely related species, and
sapiens is the only living species of the
genus.

Deﬁning a Species

Even though naming species is straightforward, deciding if two organisms are the same species can sometimes be
difﬁcult. Linnaeus deﬁned each species by the distinctive physical characteristics shared by these organisms. But
two members of the same species may look quite different. For example, people from different parts of the world
sometimes look very different, but we are all the same species ( Figure 1.32).
So how is a species deﬁned? A species is deﬁned as a group of similar individuals that can interbreed with one
another and produce fertile offspring. A species does not produce fertile offspring with other species.

Summary

• Scientists have deﬁned several major categories for classifying organisms: domain, kingdom, phylum, class,

order, family, genus, and species.

• The scientiﬁc name of an organism consists of its genus and species.

1.12 Domains of Life

• Distinguish between the three domains of life.
• List the four Eukarya kingdoms.

What do you have in common with pond scum?
Humans are in the same domain as trees and algae, which makes up the "pond scum" you see here. What could they
possibly have in common? It is the location of their DNA inside their cells. Their cells all have a nucleus that is
home to their genetic material.

The Domains of Life

Let’s explore the domain, the least speciﬁc category of classiﬁcation.
All of life can be divided into three domains, based on the type of cell of the organism:

1. Bacteria: cells do not contain a nucleus.
2. Archaea: cells do not contain a nucleus; they have a different cell wall from bacteria.
3. Eukarya: cells do contain a nucleus.

Archaea and Bacteria

The Archaea and Bacteria domains ( Figure 1.33) are both entirely composed of small, single-celled organisms
and seem very similar, but they also have signiﬁcant differences. Both are composed of prokaryotic cells, which
are cells without a nucleus. In addition, both domains are composed of species that reproduce asexually ( asexual

50

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Life Science

reproduction) by dividing in two. Both domains also have species with cells surrounded by a cell wall, however,
the cell walls are made of different materials. Bacterial cell walls contain the polysaccharide peptidoglycan. Lastly,
Archaea often live in extreme environments including hot springs, geysers, and salt ﬂats. Bacteria do not live in
these environments.

FIGURE 1.33
The Group A Streptococcus organism
(left) is in the domain Bacteria, one of the
three domains of life. The Halobacterium
(right) is in the domain Archaea, another
one of the three domains.

Eukarya

All of the cells in the domain Eukarya keep their genetic material, or DNA, inside the nucleus. The domain Eukarya
is made up of four kingdoms:

1. Plantae: Plants, such as trees and grasses, survive by capturing energy from the sun, a process called photo-

synthesis.

2. Fungi: Fungi, such as mushrooms and molds, survive by "eating" other organisms or the remains of other

organisms. These organisms absorb their nutrients from other organisms.

3. Animalia: Animals also survive by eating other organisms or the remains of other organisms. Animals range
from tiny ants to the largest whales, and include arthropods, ﬁsh, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals ( Figure
1.34).

4. Protista: Protists are not all descended from a single common ancestor in the way that plants, animals, and
fungi are. Protists are all the eukaryotic organisms that do not ﬁt into one of the other three kingdoms. They
include many kinds of microscopic one-celled (unicellular) organisms, such as algae and plankton, but also
giant seaweeds that can grow to be 200 feet long.

Plants, animals, fungi, and protists might seem very different, but remember that if you look through a microscope,
you will ﬁnd similar cells with a membrane-bound nucleus in all of them. These are eukaryotic cells. These cells
also have membrane-bound organelles, which prokaryotic cells lack. The main characteristics of the three domains
of life are summarized in Table 1.6.

1.13 Viruses

• Explain why viruses are not considered living.
• Describe the features and list examples of viruses.

What causes the common cold?
That miserable cough and runny nose is caused by one villain: a virus. Viruses come in many different shapes,
including the prickly balls you see here. They are so tiny that they can only be seen with a very powerful microscope.

What is a Virus?

We have all heard of viruses. The ﬂu, the common cold, and many other diseases are caused by viruses. But what is
a virus? Do you think viruses are living? Which domain do they belong to? Bacteria? Archaea? Eukarya?

Are Viruses Alive?

The answer is actually “no.” A virus is essentially DNA or RNA surrounded by a coat of protein ( Figure 1.35). It is
not made of a cell, and cannot maintain a stable internal environment ( homeostasis). Recall that a cell is the basic
unit of living organisms. So if a virus is not made of at least one cell, can it be living? Viruses also cannot reproduce
on their own—they need to infect a host cell to reproduce. So a virus is very different from any of the organisms
that fall into the three domains of life.
Though viruses are not considered living, they share two important traits with living organisms. They have genetic
material like all cells do (though they are not made of cells), and they can evolve. The genetic material of a virus

54

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Life Science

can change (mutate), altering the traits of the virus. As the process of evolution has resulted in all life on the planet
today, the classiﬁcation of viruses has been controversial. It calls into question the very deﬁnition of life.

FIGURE 1.35
These little "alien" looking creatures are
viruses, and these speciﬁc viruses infect
Escherichia coli bacteria. Shown is a
representation of viruses infecting a cell.
The virus lands on the outside of the cell
and injects its genetic material
into the
cell.

Replication

Viruses infect a variety of organisms, including plants, animals, and bacteria, injecting its genetic material into a cell
of the host organism. Once inside the host cell, they use the cell’s own ATP (energy), ribosomes, enzymes, and
other cellular parts to make copies of themselves. The host cell makes a copy of the viral DNA and produces viral
proteins. These are then packaged into new viruses. So viruses cannot replicate or reproduce on their own; they
rely on a host cell to make additional viruses.

Viruses and Human Disease

Viruses cause many human diseases. In addition to the ﬂu and the common cold, viruses cause rabies, diarrheal
diseases, AIDS, cold sores, and many other diseases ( Figure 1.36). Viral diseases range from mild to fatal.

Summary

• A virus is composed of DNA or RNA surrounded by a coat of protein.
• Viruses are not considered living things because they cannot reproduce on their own, and they are not com-

prised of cells.

Introduction to Life Science

Summary

Biology is the study of life, so the Life Sciences are essentially, the study of biology. The scientiﬁc method is
the process by which biological information, like that of all other sciences, has been identiﬁed. This has resulted
in a number of important biological scientiﬁc theories, including the cell theory and the theory of evolution. All
life is built around the element carbon, and four categories of organic compounds: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins,
and nucleic acids. One particular type of protein, enzymes, are biological catalysts, allowing biochemical reactions
to proceed at the rate necessary to maintain life. All life can be classiﬁed into three domains. All members of
these domains share characteristics in common. Viruses do not share all of the characteristics of life, and so many
scientists do not consider viruses to be living.

Introduction

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

What is a cell?
It could easily be said that a cell is the fundamental unit of life, the smallest unit capable of life or the structural
and functional unit necessary for life. But whatever it is, a cell is necessary for life. And as shown above, a cell
may be ﬁlled with all sorts of structures, each with its own speciﬁc function. This concept will discuss some of the
fundamental properties of the cell, with lessons that include the cell structure, transport in and out of the cell, energy
metabolism, and cell division and reproduction.

2.1 Cell Biology

• Explain how cells are observed.
• Deﬁne cell. Describe the general role of a cell.
• State the three main parts of the cell theory.
• Summarize the structure-function relationship of a cell.
• Explain the levels of organization in an organism.

What are you made of?
Cells make up all living things, including your own body. This picture shows a typical group of cells. But not all
cells look alike. Cells can differ in shape and sizes. And the different shapes usually means different functions.

Introduction to Cells

A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism. Some organisms, like bacteria, consist of only
one cell. Big organisms, like humans, consist of trillions of cells. Compare a human to a banana. On the outside,
they look very different, but if you look close enough you’ll see that their cells are actually very similar.

Observing Cells

Most cells are so small that you cannot see them without the help of a microscope. It was not until 1665 that English
scientist Robert Hooke invented a basic light microscope and observed cells for the ﬁrst time, by looking at a piece
of cork. You may use light microscopes in the classroom. You can use a light microscope to see cells ( Figure 2.1).
But many structures in the cell are too small to see with a light microscope. So, what do you do if you want to see
the tiny structures inside of cells?
In the 1950s, scientists developed more powerful microscopes. A light microscope sends a beam of light through
a specimen, or the object you are studying. A more powerful microscope, called an electron microscope, passes a

beam of electrons through the specimen. Sending electrons through a cell allows us to see its smallest parts, even
the parts inside the cell ( Figure 2.2). Without electron microscopes, we would not know what the inside of a cell
looked like.

FIGURE 2.2
An electron microscope allows scientists to see much more detail than a
light microscope, as with this sample of pollen.

Cell Theory

In 1858, after using microscopes much better than Hooke’s ﬁrst microscope, Rudolf Virchow developed the hypoth-
esis that cells only come from other cells. For example, bacteria, which are single-celled organisms, divide in half
(after they grow some) to make new bacteria. In the same way, your body makes new cells by dividing the cells you
already have. In all cases, cells only come from cells that have existed before. This idea led to the development of
one of the most important theories in biology, the cell theory.
Cell theory states that:

1. All organisms are composed of cells.
2. Cells are alive and the basic living units of organization in all organisms.
3. All cells come from other cells.

As with other scientiﬁc theories, many hundreds, if not thousands, of experiments support the cell theory. Since
Virchow created the theory, no evidence has ever been identiﬁed to contradict it.

Specialized Cells

Although cells share many of the same features and structures, they also can be very different ( Figure 2.3). Each
cell in your body is designed for a speciﬁc task. In other words, the cell’s function is partly based on the cell’s
structure. For example:

63

2.1. Cell Biology

www.ck12.org

• Red blood cells are shaped with a pocket that traps oxygen and brings it to other body cells.
• Nerve cells are long and stringy in order to form a line of communication with other nerve cells, like a wire.
Because of this shape, they can quickly send signals, such as the feeling of touching a hot stove, to your brain.

• Skin cells are ﬂat and ﬁt tightly together to protect your body.

As you can see, cells are shaped in ways that help them do their jobs. Multicellular (many-celled) organisms have
many types of specialized cells in their bodies.

FIGURE 2.3
Red blood cells (left) are specialized to
carry oxygen in the blood. Neurons (cen-
ter) are shaped to conduct electrical im-
pulses to many other nerve cells. These
epidermal cells (right) make up the “skin”
of plants. Note how the cells ﬁt tightly
together.

Levels of Organization

While cells are the basic units of an organism, groups of cells can perform a job together. These cells are called
specialized because they have a special job. Specialized cells can be organized into tissues. For example, your liver
cells are organized into liver tissue. Your liver tissue is further organized into an organ, your liver. Organs are
formed from two or more specialized tissues working together to perform a job. All organs, from your heart to your
liver, are made up of an organized group of tissues.
These organs are part of a larger system, the organ systems. For example, your brain works together with your spinal
cord and other nerves to form the nervous system. This organ system must be organized with other organ systems,
such as the circulatory system and the digestive system, for your body to work. Organ systems work together to
form the entire organism. There are many levels of organization in living things ( Figure 2.4).

2.2 Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells

• Distinguish between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.
• Deﬁne an organelle.
• Describe the main role of the nucleus

Are bacteria cells like our cells?
Yes and no. Bacteria cells are similar to our cells in some ways. Like our cells, bacteria cells have DNA and a plasma
membrane. But bacteria are unique in other ways. They are called prokaryotic cells because of these differences.

Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic

There are two basic types of cells, prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. The main difference between eukaryotic
and prokaryotic cells is that eukaryotic cells have a nucleus. The nucleus is where cells store their DNA, which is the
genetic material. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane. Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus. Instead, their
DNA ﬂoats around inside the cell. Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes. All prokaryotes are
single-celled (unicellular) organisms. Bacteria and Archaea are the only prokaryotes. Organisms with eukaryotic
cells are called eukaryotes. Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes. All multicellular organisms are
eukaryotes. Eukaryotes may also be single-celled.
Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have structures in common. All cells have a plasma membrane, ribosomes,
cytoplasm, and DNA. The plasma membrane, or cell membrane, is the phospholipid layer that surrounds the cell
and protects it from the outside environment. Ribosomes are the non-membrane bound organelles where proteins
are made, a process called protein synthesis. The cytoplasm is all the contents of the cell inside the cell membrane,
not including the nucleus.

Eukaryotic Cells

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

Eukaryotic cells usually have multiple chromosomes, composed of DNA and protein. Some eukaryotic species have
just a few chromosomes, others have close to 100 or more. These chromosomes are protected within the nucleus. In
addition to a nucleus, eukaryotic cells include other membrane-bound structures called organelles. Organelles allow
eukaryotic cells to be more specialized than prokaryotic cells. Pictured below are the organelles of eukaryotic cells
( Figure 2.9), including the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. These will be discussed
in additional concepts.

Prokaryotic Cells

Prokaryotic cells ( Figure 2.6) are usually smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells. They do not have a nucleus
or other membrane-bound organelles. In prokaryotic cells, the DNA, or genetic material, forms a single large circle
that coils up on itself. The DNA is located in the main part of the cell.

2.3 Cell Membrane

• Describe the roles of the plasma membrane and cytosol.
• Explain the concept of semipermeability.
• Summarize how the plasma membrane separates the cytosol from the outside environment.

Who guards your cells?
Not everything can make it into your cells. Your cells have a plasma membrane that helps to guard your cells from
unwanted intruders.

The Plasma Membrane and Cytosol

If the outside environment of a cell is water-based, and the inside of the cell is also mostly water, something has
to make sure the cell stays intact in this environment. What would happen if a cell dissolved in water, like sugar
does? Obviously, the cell could not survive in such an environment. So something must protect the cell and allow
it to survive in its water-based environment. All cells have a barrier around them that separates them from the
environment and from other cells. This barrier is called the plasma membrane, or cell membrane.

The Plasma Membrane

The plasma membrane ( Figure 2.7) is made of a double layer of special lipids, known as phospholipids. The
phospholipid is a lipid molecule with a hydrophilic ("water-loving") head and two hydrophobic ("water-hating")
tails. Because of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the phospholipid, the molecule must be arranged in a

70

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

speciﬁc pattern as only certain parts of the molecule can physically be in contact with water. Remember that there is
water outside the cell, and the cytoplasm inside the cell is mostly water as well. So the phospholipids are arranged
in a double layer (a bilayer) to keep the cell separate from its environment. Lipids do not mix with water (recall that
oil is a lipid), so the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane acts as a barrier, keeping water out of the cell, and
keeping the cytoplasm inside the cell. The cell membrane allows the cell to stay structurally intact in its water-based
environment.
The function of the plasma membrane is to control what goes in and out of the cell. Some molecules can go through
the cell membrane to enter and leave the cell, but some cannot. The cell is therefore not completely permeable.
"Permeable" means that anything can cross a barrier. An open door is completely permeable to anything that wants
to enter or exit through the door. The plasma membrane is semipermeable, meaning that some things can enter the
cell, and some things cannot.

FIGURE 2.7
Plasma membranes are primarily made
up of phospholipids (orange). The hy-
drophilic ("water-loving") head and two
hydrophobic ("water-hating")
tails are
shown. The phospholipids form a bilayer
(two layers). The middle of the bilayer is
an area without water. There can be water
on either side of the bilayer. There are
many proteins throughout the membrane.

Cytosol

The inside of all cells also contain a jelly-like substance called cytosol. Cytosol is composed of water and other
molecules, including enzymes, which are proteins that speed up the cell’s chemical reactions. Everything in the cell
sits in the cytosol, like fruit in a jello mold. The term cytoplasm refers to the cytosol and all of the organelles, the
specialized compartments of the cell. The cytoplasm does not include the nucleus. As a prokaryotic cell does not
have a nucleus, the DNA is in the cytoplasm.

Summary

• The plasma membrane is formed by a phospholipid bilayer.
• The plasma membrane controls what moves inside and outside the cell.
• The cytosol is the jelly-like material in which the contents of the cell are suspended.

2.4 Cell Nucleus

• Describe the features and function of the cell’s nucleus.
• Deﬁne chromosome.
• Explain the role of the nucleolus.

Where is your DNA?
You may know that a criminal can easily leave DNA at a crime scene. How? DNA is found in every cell of your
body. In each cell there is a nucleus, which is home to your DNA. So if a criminal has a cut, and blood is left at the
crime scene, or a hair falls out and is left behind, then DNA will also be left at the scene.

The Nucleus

The nucleus is only found in eukaryotic cells. It contains most of the genetic material (the DNA) of the cell. The
genetic material of the nucleus is like a set of instructions. These instructions tell the cell how to build molecules
needed for the cell to function properly. That is, the DNA tells the cell how to build molecules needed for life. The
nucleus is surrounded by the nuclear envelope, a double membrane (two phospholipid bilayers) that controls what
goes in and out of the nucleus. The nucleus also has holes embedded in the nuclear envelope. These holes are known
as nuclear pores, and they allow things to ﬂow in and out of the nucleus.

Chromosomes

Inside of the nucleus, you will ﬁnd the chromosomes. Chromosomes are strands of DNA wrapped around proteins.
They contain genes, or small units of genetic material (DNA) that contains the code for the creation of a protein.
Human cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). There are hundreds to thousands of genes on each chromosome.

73

2.4. Cell Nucleus

Nucleolus

www.ck12.org

The nucleus of many cells also contains a central region called the nucleolus. The job of the nucleolus is to build
ribosomes. These ribosomes ﬂow out the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm. Ribosomes are organelles that make
proteins in the cytoplasm. See the composition of the nucleus pictured below ( Figure 2.8).

In eukaryotic cells,
the DNA is kept in
the nucleus. The nucleus is surrounded

• List the main organelles found in an eukaryotic cell.
• Deﬁne the role of a ribosome.
• Describe the functions of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus.
• Explain the function of a vesicle, a vacuole, and a lysosome.

Do brain cells have the same internal structures as your other cells?
Yes. Although brain cells look quite different from your other cells, they have the same internal structures as other
cells. They need the same structures because they need to perform the same tasks, such as making proteins and
obtaining energy.

Organelles

Eukaryotic cells have many speciﬁc functions, so it can be said that a cell is like a factory. A factory has many
machines and people, and each has a speciﬁc role. Just like a factory, the cell is made up of many different parts.
Each part has a special role. The different parts of the cell are called organelles, which means "small organs." All
organelles are found in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are "simpler" than eukaryotic cells. Though prokaryotic
cells still have many functions, they are not as specialized as eukaryotic cells, lacking membrane-bound organelles.
Thus, most organelles are not found in prokaryotic cells.
Below are the main organelles found in eukaryotic cells ( Figure 2.9):

1. The nucleus of a cell is like a safe containing the factory’s trade secrets. The nucleus contains the genetic

material (DNA), the information needed to build thousands of proteins.

75

2.5. Organelles

www.ck12.org

2. The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria are the organelles where cellular energy
is produced, providing the energy needed to power chemical reactions. This process, known as cellular
respiration, produces energy is in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Cells that use a lot of energy
may have thousands of mitochondria.

3. Vesicles are small membrane bound sacs that transport materials around the cell and to the cell membrane.
4. The vacuoles are like storage centers. Plant cells have larger vacuoles than animal cells. Plants store water

and nutrients in their large central vacuoles.

5. Lysosomes are like the recycling trucks that carry waste away from the factory. Lysosomes have digestive

enzymes that break down old molecules into parts that can be recycled.

6. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, ribosomes are the non-membrane bound organelles where proteins are
made. Ribosomes are like the machines in the factory that produce the factory’s main product. Proteins are
the main product of the cell.

7. Some ribosomes can be found on folded membranes called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), others ﬂoat
freely in the cytoplasm. If the ER is covered with ribosomes, it looks bumpy like sandpaper, and is called
the rough endoplasmic reticulum. If the ER does not contain ribosomes, it is smooth and called the smooth
endoplasmic reticulum. Many proteins are made on the ribosomes on the rough ER. These proteins immedi-
ately enter the ER, where they are modiﬁed, packaged into vesicles and sent to the Golgi apparatus. Lipids
are made in the smooth ER.

8. The Golgi apparatus works like a mail room. The Golgi apparatus receives proteins from the rough ER and
puts "shipping addresses" on them. The Golgi then packages the proteins into vesicles and sends them to the
right place in the cell or to the cell membrane. Some of these proteins are secreted from the cell (they exit the
cell); others are placed into the cell membrane.

FIGURE 2.9
Eukaryotic cells contain special compart-
ments surrounded by membranes, called
organelles. For example, notice in this
image the mitochondria, lysosomes, and
Golgi apparatus.

Also, the cytoskeleton gives the cell its shape, and the ﬂagella helps the cell to move. Prokaryotic cells may also
have ﬂagella.

2.6 Plant Cell Structures

• Distinguish plant cells from animal cells.
• Explain the roles of the chloroplast and central vacuole.
• Summarize the function of the cell wall.

Do plants have cells like yours?
Yes, your cells are actually very similar to a plant’s cells. For example, they are both eukaryotic cells, both contain
DNA in a nucleus, and both make proteins in ribosomes. However, plant cells also differ in some crucial ways from
your own cells.

Plant Cells

Even though plants and animals are both eukaryotes, plant cells differ in some ways from animal cells ( Figure
2.10). Plant cells have a large central vacuole, are surrounded by a cell wall, and have chloroplasts, which are the
organelles of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis converts the sun’s solar energy into chemical energy. This chemical
energy, which is the carbohydrate glucose, serves as "food" for the plant.

Vacuoles

First, plant cells have a large central vacuole that holds a mixture of water, nutrients, and wastes. A plant cell’s
vacuole can make up 90% of the cell’s volume. The large central vacuole essentially stores water. In animal cells,
vacuoles are much smaller.

FIGURE 2.10
A plant cell has several features that make
it different from an animal cell, including a
cell wall, huge vacuoles, and chloroplasts,
which photosynthesize.

Cell Wall

Second, plant cells have a cell wall, while animal cells do not ( Figure 2.11). The cell wall surrounds the plasma
membrane but does not keep substances from entering or leaving the cell. A cell wall gives the plant cell strength
and protection.

FIGURE 2.11
In this photo of plant cells taken with
a light microscope, you can see green
chloroplasts, as well as a cell wall around
each cell.

Plastids

A third difference between plant and animal cells is that plants have several kinds of organelles called plastids. And
there are several different kinds of plastids in plant cells. For example, Chloroplasts are needed for photosynthesis,
leucoplasts can store starch or oil, and brightly colored chromoplasts give some ﬂowers and fruits their yellow,
orange, or red color. It is the presence of chloroplasts and the ability to photosynthesize, that is one of the deﬁning
features of a plant. No animal or fungi can photosynthesize, and only some protists are able to. The photosynthetic
protists are the plant-like protists, represented mainly by the unicellular algae.

2.7 Cell Transport

• Describe the structure and properties of a phospholipid and a phospholipid bilayer.
• Distinguish between hydrophilic and hydrophobic.

How is a cell membrane like a castle wall?
The walls of a castle, like the cell membrane, are designed to keep out dangerous things. Whether you’re concerned
about an enemy army or a disease-causing bacteria, you don’t want to allow everything to enter! However, in order
to survive, there are some things that the cell (or the castle) does need to let in.

Introduction to Cell Transport

Cells are found in all different types of environments, and these environments are constantly changing. For example,
one-celled organisms, like bacteria, can be found on your skin, in the ground, or in all different types of water.
Therefore, cells need a way to protect themselves. This job is done by the cell membrane, which is also known as
the plasma membrane.

Controlling the Cell Contents

The cell membrane is semipermeable, or selectively permeable, which means that only some molecules can pass
through the membrane. If the cell membrane were completely permeable, the inside of the cell would be the same as
the outside of the cell. It would be impossible for the cell to maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis means maintaining

81

2.7. Cell Transport

www.ck12.org

a stable internal environment. For example, if your body cells have a temperature of 98.6◦F, and it is freezing outside,
your cells will maintain homeostasis if the temperature of the cells stays the same and does not drop with the outside
temperature.
How does the cell ensure it is semipermeable? How does the cell control what molecules enter and leave the cell?
The composition of the cell membrane helps to control what can pass through it.

Composition of the Cell Membrane

Molecules in the cell membrane allow it to be semipermeable. The membrane is made of a double layer of
phospholipids (a "bilayer") and proteins ( Figure below). Recall that phospholipids, being lipids, do not mix with
water. It is this quality that allows them to form the outside barrier of the cell.
A single phospholipid molecule has two parts:

1. A polar head that is hydrophilic, or water-loving.
2. A fatty acid tail that is hydrophobic, or water-fearing.

FIGURE 2.12
The cell membrane is made up of a phos-
pholipid bilayer,
two layers of phospho-
lipid molecules. Notice the polar head
group of the phospholipid is attached to
the phosphate, and the tails are two fatty
acid chains. The head group and tails are
attached by a glycerol backbone.

There is water found on both the inside and the outside of cells. Since hydrophilic means water-loving, and they
want to be near water, the heads face the inside and outside of the cell where water is found. The water-fearing,
hydrophobic tails face each other in the middle of the cell membrane, because water is not found in this space. The
phospholipid bilayer allows the cell to stay intact in a water-based environment.
An interesting quality of the plasma membrane is that it is very "ﬂuid" and constantly moving, like a soap bubble.
This ﬂuid nature of the membrane is important in maintaining homeostasis. It allows the proteins in the membrane
to ﬂoat to areas where they are needed.
Due to the composition of the cell membrane, small molecules such as oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass freely
through the membrane, but other molecules, especially large molecules, cannot easily pass through the plasma
membrane. These molecules need assistance to get across the membrane. That assistance will come in the form of

What happens if you put a few drops of food coloring in water?
Over time, the molecules of color spread out through the rest of the water. When the molecules are evenly spread
throughout the space, the water will become an even color. This process of molecules moving from an area where
there are lots of molecules to an area where there are fewer molecules is known as diffusion.

Diffusion

Small molecules can pass through the plasma membrane through a process called diffusion. Diffusion is the
movement of molecules from an area where there is a higher concentration (larger amount) of the substance to

84

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

an area where there is a lower concentration (lower amount) of the substance ( Figure 2.13). The amount of a
substance in relation to the total volume is the concentration. During diffusion, molecules are said to ﬂow down
their concentration gradient, ﬂowing from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Molecules
ﬂowing down a concentration gradient is a natural process and does not require energy.
Diffusion can occur across a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membrane, as long as a concentration
gradient exists. Molecules will continue to ﬂow in this manner until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium, there
is no longer an area of high concentration or low concentration, and molecules ﬂow equally in both directions across
the semipermeable membrane. At equilibrium, equal amounts of a molecule are entering and leaving a cell.

FIGURE 2.13
Diffusion is the movement of a substance
from an area of a higher amount toward
an area of lower amount. A concentra-
tion gradient initially exists across the cell
membrane. Equilibrium is reached when
there is an equal amount of the substance
on both sides of the membrane.

Osmosis

The diffusion of water across a membrane because of a difference in concentration is called osmosis. Let’s explore
three different situations and analyze the ﬂow of water.

1. A hypotonic solution means the environment outside of the cell has a lower concentration of dissolved
If a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water will move into the

cell. This causes the cell to swell, and it may even burst.

2. A hypertonic solution means the environment outside of the cell has more dissolved material than inside of
the cell. If a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water will leave the cell. This can cause a cell to shrink
and shrivel.

3. An isotonic solution is a solution in which the amount of dissolved material is equal both inside and outside

of the cell. Water still ﬂows in both directions, but an equal amount enters and leaves the cell.

Applications of Osmosis

How do marine animals keep their cells from shrinking? How do you keep your blood cells from bursting? Both
of these questions have to do with the cell membrane and osmosis. Marine animals live in salt water, which is a
hypertonic environment; there is more salt in the water than in their cells. To prevent losing too much water from
their bodies, these animals intake large quantities of salt water and then secrete the excess salt. Red blood cells can
be kept from bursting or shriveling if put in a solution that is isotonic to the blood cells. If the blood cells were put in
pure water, the solution would be hypotonic to the blood cells, so water would enter the blood cells, and they would
swell and burst ( Figure 2.14).

2.9 Passive Transport

• Deﬁne passive transport and facilitative diffusion.
• Explain the process of passive transport.
• Distinguish between a channel protein and a carrier protein.
• Summarize the functions of channel proteins and carrier proteins.

Can any molecule move freely through your cell membranes?
The cell regulates most molecules that pass through the cell membrane. If a molecule is charged or very big, it won’t
make it through the cell membrane on its own. However, small, non-charged molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide,
and water, can pass through the cell membrane freely.

Passive Transport

Recall that the cell membrane is semipermeable. It does not allow everything to pass through. Some molecules can
pass easily through your cell membranes, while others have more difﬁculty. Sometimes molecules need the help of
special transport proteins to move across the cell membrane. Some molecules even need an input of energy to help
get them across the cell membrane. The movement of molecules across a membrane without the input of energy is
known as passive transport. When energy (ATP) is needed, the movement is known as active transport. Active
transport moves molecules against their concentration gradient, from an area of low concentration to an area of high
concentration.

Simple Diffusion

One example of passive transport is diffusion, when molecules move from an area of high concentration (large
amount) to an area of low concentration (low amount). Molecules are said to naturally ﬂow down their concentration

87

2.9. Passive Transport

www.ck12.org

gradient. This type of diffusion proceeds without an input of energy. In simple diffusion, molecules that are small
and uncharged can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. They simply ﬂow through the cell membrane. Simple
diffusion does not require energy or need the assistance of a transport protein. Other larger or charged molecules
that diffuse across a membrane may need assistance from a protein.
Oxygen is a molecule that can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. For example, oxygen diffuses out of the air sacs
in your lungs into your bloodstream because oxygen is more concentrated in your lungs than in your blood. Oxygen
moves from the high concentration of oxygen in your lungs to the low concentration of oxygen in your bloodstream.
Carbon dioxide, which is exhaled, moves in the opposite direction - from a high concentration in your bloodstream
to a low concentration in your lungs.

Passive Transport using Membrane Proteins

Sometimes, molecules cannot move through the cell membrane on their own. These molecules need special transport
proteins to help them move across the membrane, a process known as facilitative diffusion. These special proteins
are called channel proteins or carrier proteins ( Figure 2.15), and they are attached to the cell membrane. In fact,
they go through the cell membrane, from the inside of the cell to the outside.
Channel proteins provide an open channel or passageway through the cell membrane for molecules to move across.
Many channel proteins allow the diffusion of ions. Ions are charged atoms. The charge makes it difﬁcult to cross
the cell membrane without assistance. Channel proteins are speciﬁc for the molecule they transport. For example a
sodium ion crosses the membrane through a channel protein speciﬁc for sodium ions.
Carrier proteins bind and carry the molecules across the cell membrane. These proteins bind a molecule on one side
of the membrane, change shape as they carry the molecule across the membrane, and deposit the molecule on the
other side of the membrane. Even though a protein is involved in both these methods of transport, neither method
requires energy. Therefore these are still types of passive transport.

FIGURE 2.15
Protein channels and carrier proteins are
involved in passive transport.

Summary

• Passive transport does not require energy input.
• An example of passive transport is diffusion, the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration

to an area of low concentration.

• Carrier proteins and channel proteins are involved in facilitated diffusion.

2.10 Active Transport

• Deﬁne active transport.
• Describe the process of active transport.
• Summarize the role of the sodium-potassium pump.

What does it take to roll a stone uphill?
This round stone tends to roll downhill due to the force of gravity. It takes an input of energy to push it uphill. Due
to diffusion, molecules tend to move from an area of a large amount to an area of a small amount. So guess what
it takes to move molecules the opposite way, from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration?
Energy, of course!

Active Transport

During active transport, molecules move from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. This is
the opposite of diffusion, and these molecules are said to ﬂow against their concentration gradient. Active transport
is called "active" because this type of transport requires energy to move molecules. ATP is the most common source
of energy for active transport.

90

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

As molecules are moving against their concentration gradients, active transport cannot occur without assistance.
A carrier protein is always required in this process. Like facilitated diffusion, a protein in the membrane carries
the molecules across the membrane, except this protein moves the molecules from a low concentration to a high
concentration. These proteins are often called "pumps" because they use energy to pump the molecules across
the membrane. There are many cells in your body that use pumps to move molecules. For example, your nerve
cells (neurons) would not send messages to your brain unless you had protein pumps moving molecules by active
transport.
The sodium-potassium pump ( Figure 2.16) is an example of an active transport pump. The sodium-potassium
pump uses ATP to move three sodium (Na+) ions and two potassium (K+) ions to where they are already highly
concentrated. Sodium ions move out of the cell, and potassium ions move into the cell. How do these ions then
return to their original positions? As the ions now can ﬂow down their concentration gradients, facilitated diffusion
returns the ions to their original positions either inside or outside the cell.

FIGURE 2.16
The sodium-potassium pump moves
sodium ions to the outside of
the cell
and potassium ions to the inside of
the cell, areas where these ions are
already highly concentrated.
ATP is
required for the protein to change shape.
ATP is converted into ADP (adenosine
diphosphate) during active transport.

Summary

• During active transport, a protein pump uses energy, in the form of ATP, to move molecules from an area of

low concentration to an area of high concentration.

• An example of active transport is the sodium-potassium pump, which moves sodium ions to the outside of the

cell and potassium ions to the inside of the cell.

2.11 Photosynthesis

• Deﬁne photosynthesis.
• Distinguish between autotrophs and heterotrophs.
• Explain the importance of photosynthesis.

What can a tiny plant do that you can’t do?
This tiny plant can use the energy of the sun to make its own food. You can’t make food by just sitting in the sun.
Plants are not the only organisms that can get energy from the sun, however. Some protists, such as algae, and some
bacteria can also use the energy of the sun to make their own food.

What is Photosynthesis?

If a plant gets hungry, it cannot walk to a local restaurant and buy a slice of pizza. So, how does a plant get the
food it needs to survive? Plants are producers, which means they are able to make, or produce, their own food.
They also produce the "food" for other organisms. Plants are also autotrophs. Autotrophs are the organisms that
collect the energy from the sun and turn it into organic compounds. Using the energy from the sun, they produce

93

2.11. Photosynthesis

www.ck12.org

complex organic compounds from simple inorganic molecules. So once again, how does a plant get the food it needs
to survive?
Through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make their own “food” from the sun’s energy,
carbon dioxide, and water. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water combine with solar energy to create
glucose, a carbohydrate (C6H12O6), and oxygen.
The process can be summarized as: in the presence of sunlight, carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen.
Glucose, the main product of photosynthesis, is a sugar that acts as the "food" source for plants. The glucose
is then converted into usable chemical energy, ATP, during cellular respiration. The oxygen formed during
photosynthesis, which is necessary for animal life, is essentially a waste product of the photosynthesis process.
Actually, almost all organisms obtain their energy from photosynthetic organisms. For example, if a bird eats a
caterpillar, then the bird gets the energy that the caterpillar gets from the plants it eats. So the bird indirectly gets
energy that began with the glucose formed through photosynthesis. Therefore, the process of photosynthesis is
central to sustaining life on Earth. In eukaryotic organisms, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts. Only cells with
chloroplasts—plant cells and algal (protist) cells—can perform photosynthesis. Animal cells and fungal cells do
not have chloroplasts and, therefore, cannot photosynthesize. That is why these organisms, as well as the non-
photosynthetic protists, rely on other organisms to obtain their energy. These organisms are heterotrophs.

2.12 Light Reactions of Photosynthesis

• Describe the structure of a chloroplast.
• Write the chemical reaction of photosynthesis.
• Name the reactants and products of photosynthesis.
• Summarize the process of photosynthesis.

Are plants the only organisms that perform photosynthesis?
Although we generally discuss plants when learning about photosynthesis, keep in mind that plants are not the only
organisms that can make their own food. Some bacteria and some protists, such as the algae pictured here, also
perform photosynthesis. This alga has chloroplasts and photosynthesizes just like a plant.

The Process of Photosynthesis

In the Presence of Sunlight, Carbon Dioxide

Photosynthesis takes place in the organelle of the plant cell known as the chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are one
of the main differences between plant and animal cells. Animal cells do not have chloroplasts, so they cannot
photosynthesize. Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. During the ﬁrst stage, the energy from sunlight is absorbed
by the chloroplast. Water is used, and oxygen is produced during this part of the process. During the second stage,
carbon dioxide is used, and glucose is produced.
Chloroplasts contain stacks of thylakoids, which are ﬂattened sacs of membrane. Energy from sunlight is absorbed
by the pigment chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane. There are two separate parts of a chloroplast: the space
inside the chloroplast itself, and the space inside the thylakoids ( Figure 2.17).

• The inner compartments inside the thylakoids are called the thylakoid space (or lumen). This is the site of the

ﬁrst part of photosynthesis.

96

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

• The interior space that surrounds the thylakoids is ﬁlled with a ﬂuid called stroma. This is where carbon

dioxide is used to produce glucose, the second part of photosynthesis.

FIGURE 2.17
The chloroplast is the photosynthesis fac-
tory of the plant.

The Reactants

What goes into the plant cell to start photosynthesis? The reactants of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water.
These are the molecules necessary to begin the process. But one more item is necessary, and that is sunlight. All
three components, carbon dioxide, water, and the sun’s energy are necessary for photosynthesis to occur. These three
components must meet in the chloroplast of the leaf cell for photosynthesis to occur. How do these three components
get to the cells in the leaf?

• Chlorophyll is the green pigment in leaves that captures energy from the sun. Chlorophyll molecules are

located in the thylakoid membranes inside chloroplasts.

• The veins in a plant carry water from the roots to the leaves.
• Carbon dioxide enters the leaf from the air through special openings called stomata ( Figure 2.18).

The Products

What is produced by the plant cell during photosynthesis? The products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen.
This means they are produced at the end of photosynthesis. Glucose, the food of plants, can be used to store energy
in the form of large carbohydrate molecules. Glucose is a simple sugar molecule which can be combined with other
glucose molecules to form large carbohydrates, such as starch. Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis. It is
released into the atmosphere through the stomata. As you know, animals need oxygen to live. Without photosynthetic
organisms like plants, there would not be enough oxygen in the atmosphere for animals to survive.

The Chemical Reaction

The overall chemical reaction for photosynthesis is 6 molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and 6 molecules of water
(H2O), with the addition of solar energy. This produces 1 molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) and 6 molecules of oxygen

(O2). Using chemical symbols, the equation is represented as follows: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6+ 6O2. Though
this equation may not seem that complicated, photosynthesis is a series of chemical reactions divided into two stages,
the light reactions and the Calvin cycle ( Figure 2.19).

The Light Reactions

Photosynthesis begins with the light reactions. It is during these reactions that the energy from sunlight is absorbed
by the pigment chlorophyll in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. The energy is then temporarily transferred
to two molecules, ATP and NADPH, which are used in the second stage of photosynthesis. ATP and NADPH are
generated by two electron transport chains. During the light reactions, water is used and oxygen is produced.
These reactions can only occur during daylight as the process needs sunlight to begin.

The Calvin Cycle

The second stage of photosynthesis is the production of glucose from carbon dioxide. This process occurs in a
continuous cycle, named after its discover, Melvin Calvin. The Calvin cycle uses CO2 and the energy temporarily
stored in ATP and NADPH to make the sugar glucose.

Photosynthesis is a two stage process.
As is depicted here, the energy from sun-
light is needed to start photosynthesis.
The initial stage is called the light reac-
tions as they occur only in the presence
of light. During these initial reactions,
water is used and oxygen is released.
The energy from sunlight
is converted
into a small amount of ATP and an en-
ergy carrier called NADPH. Together with
carbon dioxide, these are used to make
glucose (sugar) through a process called
the Calvin Cycle. NADP+ and ADP (and
Pi, inorganic phosphate) are regenerated
to complete the process.

2.13 Cellular Respiration

• Deﬁne cellular respiration.
• Summarize the signiﬁcance of ATP.

Why do you need food?
The main reason you need to eat is to get energy. Food is your body’s only supply of energy. However, this energy
must be converted from the apple (or any other food you eat) into an energy source that your body can use. The
process of getting energy from your food is called cellular respiration.

What is Cellular Respiration?

How does the food you eat provide energy? When you need a quick boost of energy, you might reach for an apple
or a candy bar. But cells do not "eat" apples or candy bars; these foods need to be broken down so that cells can use
them. Through the process of cellular respiration, the energy in food is changed into energy that can be used by the
body’s cells. Initially, the sugars in the food you eat are digested into the simple sugar glucose, a monosaccharide.
Recall that glucose is the sugar produced by the plant during photosynthesis. The glucose, or the polysaccharide
made from many glucose molecules, such as starch, is then passed to the organism that eats the plant. This organism
could be you, or it could be the organism that you eat. Either way, it is the glucose molecules that holds the energy.

ATP

Speciﬁcally, during cellular respiration, the energy stored in glucose is transferred to ATP ( Figure 2.20). ATP, or
adenosine triphosphate, is chemical energy the cell can use. It is the molecule that provides energy for your cells
to perform work, such as moving your muscles as you walk down the street. But cellular respiration is slightly
more complicated than just converting the energy from glucose into ATP. Cellular respiration can be described as the

reverse or opposite of photosynthesis. During cellular respiration, glucose, in the presence of oxygen, is converted
into carbon dioxide and water. Recall that carbon dioxide and water are the starting products of photosynthesis.
What are the products of photosynthesis?
The process can be summarized as: glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water. During this process, the energy
stored in glucose is transferred to ATP.

Energy is stored in the bonds between the phosphate groups (PO4
down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate, energy is released. When ADP and inorganic
phosphate are joined to form ATP, energy is stored. During cellular respiration, about 36 to 38 ATP molecules are
produced for every glucose molecule.

2.14 Process of Cellular Respiration

• Describe the structure of a mitochondrion.
• List the three steps of cellular respiration.
• Write the chemical reaction of cellular respiration.
• Explain the process of cellular respiration.

Why do you need to breathe?
Of course if you didn’t breathe, you couldn’t survive. Why do you need air to live? You need the gas oxygen to
perform cellular respiration to get energy from your food.

The Process of Cellular Respiration

Cellular respiration is the process of extracting energy in the form of ATP from the glucose in the food you eat.
How does cellular respiration happen inside of the cell? Cellular respiration is a three step process. Brieﬂy:

1. In stage one, glucose is broken down in the cytoplasm of the cell in a process called glycolysis.
2. In stage two, the pyruvate molecules are transported into the mitochondria. The mitochondria are the
organelles known as the energy "powerhouses" of the cells ( Figure 2.21). In the mitochondria, the pyruvate,
which have been converted into a 2-carbon molecule, enter the Krebs cycle. Notice that mitochondria have
an inner membrane with many folds, called cristae. These cristae greatly increase the membrane surface area
where many of the cellular respiration reactions take place.

3. In stage three, the energy in the energy carriers enters an electron transport chain. During this step, this

energy is used to produce ATP.

104

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

Oxygen is needed to help the process of turning glucose into ATP. The initial step releases just two molecules of
ATP for each glucose. The later steps release much more ATP.

FIGURE 2.21
Most of the reactions of cellular respira-
tion are carried out in the mitochondria.

The Reactants

What goes into the cell? Oxygen and glucose are both reactants of cellular respiration. Oxygen enters the body
when an organism breathes. Glucose enters the body when an organism eats.

The Products

What does the cell produce? The products of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide is
transported from your mitochondria out of your cell, to your red blood cells, and back to your lungs to be exhaled.
ATP is generated in the process. When one molecule of glucose is broken down, it can be converted to a net total of
36 or 38 molecules of ATP. This only occurs in the presence of oxygen.

The Chemical Reaction

The overall chemical reaction for cellular respiration is one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) and six molecules
of oxygen (O2) yields six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and six molecules of water (H2O). Using chemical
symbols the equation is represented as follows:
C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O
ATP is generated during the process. Though this equation may not seem that complicated, cellular respiration is a
series of chemical reactions divided into three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.

Glycolysis

Stage one of cellular respiration is glycolysis. Glycolysis is the splitting, or lysis of glucose. Glycolysis converts
the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, and
it occurs in the presence or absence of oxygen. During glycolysis a small amount of NADH is made as are four
ATP. Two ATP are used during this process, leaving a net gain of two ATP from glycolysis. The NADH temporarily
holds energy, which will be used in stage three.

105

2.14. Process of Cellular Respiration

www.ck12.org

The Krebs Cycle

In the presence of oxygen, under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the mitochondria to proceed into the Krebs
cycle. The second stage of cellular respiration is the transfer of the energy in pyruvate, which is the energy initially
in glucose, into two energy carriers, NADH and FADH2. A small amount of ATP is also made during this process.
This process occurs in a continuous cycle, named after its discover, Hans Krebs. The Krebs cycle uses a 2-carbon
molecule (acetyl-CoA) derived from pyruvate and produces carbon dioxide.

The Electron Transport Chain

Stage three of cellular respiration is the use of NADH and FADH2 to generate ATP. This occurs in two parts. First,
the NADH and FADH2 enter an electron transport chain, where their energy is used to pump, by active transport,
protons (H+) out of the thylakoid. This establishes a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. These protons
then ﬂow down their concentration gradient, moving back into the thylakoid by facilitated diffusion. During this
process, ATP is made by adding inorganic phosphate to ADP. Most of the ATP produced during cellular respiration
is made during this stage.
For each glucose that starts cellular respiration, in the presence of oxygen (aerobic conditions), 36-38 ATP are
generated. Without oxygen, under anaerobic conditions, much less (only two!) ATP are produced.

Summary

• Most of the steps of cellular respiration take place in the mitochondria.
• Oxygen and glucose are both reactants in the process of cellular respiration.
• The main product of cellular respiration is ATP; waste products include carbon dioxide and water.

2.15 Connecting Cellular Respiration and Pho-

tosynthesis

• Name the products and reactants of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
• Explain how cellular respiration and photosynthesis are connected.

How do trees help you breathe?
Recall that trees release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis. And you need oxygen to breathe. Do you know
why? So your cells can perform cellular respiration and make ATP.

Connecting Cellular Respiration and Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are connected through an important relationship. This relationship enables
life to survive as we know it. The products of one process are the reactants of the other. Notice that the equation
for cellular respiration is the direct opposite of photosynthesis:

108

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

• Cellular Respiration: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O
• Photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6+ 6O2

Photosynthesis makes the glucose that is used in cellular respiration to make ATP. The glucose is then turned
back into carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. While water is broken down to form oxygen during
photosynthesis, in cellular respiration oxygen is combined with hydrogen to form water. While photosynthesis
requires carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, cellular respiration requires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. It is
the released oxygen that is used by us and most other organisms for cellular respiration. We breathe in that oxygen,
which is carried through our blood to all our cells.
In our cells, oxygen allows cellular respiration to proceed.
Cellular respiration works best in the presence of oxygen. Without oxygen, much less ATP would be produced.
Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are important parts of the carbon cycle. The carbon cycle is the pathways
through which carbon is recycled in the biosphere. While cellular respiration releases carbon dioxide into the
environment, photosynthesis pulls carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The exchange of carbon dioxide and
oxygen during photosynthesis ( Figure 2.22) and cellular respiration worldwide helps to keep atmospheric oxygen
and carbon dioxide at stable levels.

FIGURE 2.22
Cellular respiration and photosynthesis
are direct opposite reactions. Energy
from the sun enters a plant and is con-
verted into glucose during photosynthe-
sis. Some of the energy is used to make
ATP in the mitochondria during cellular
respiration, and some is lost to the envi-
ronment as heat.

Summary

• The equation for cellular respiration is the direct opposite of photosynthesis.
• The exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen thorough photosynthesis or cellular respiration worldwide helps

to keep atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide at stable levels.

2.16 Fermentation

• Deﬁne fermentation.
• Differentiate between aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
• Explain the purpose of fermentation.
• Distinguish between alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation.

How is wine made?
You probably realize that grapes are needed to make wine. You might not realize, however, that yeast are also
central in the process of making wine. Yeast take the sugars from the grapes and convert them into alcohol through
the process of fermentation.

Fermentation

Sometimes cells need to obtain energy from sugar, but there is no oxygen present to complete cellular respiration. In
this situation, cellular respiration can be anaerobic, occurring in the absence of oxygen. In this process, called
fermentation, only the ﬁrst step of respiration, glycolysis, occurs, producing two ATP; no additional ATP is
produced. Therefore, the organism only obtains the two ATP molecules per glucose molecule from glycolysis.

111

2.16. Fermentation

www.ck12.org

Compared to the 36-38 ATP produced under aerobic conditions, anaerobic respiration is not a very efﬁcient
process. Fermentation allows the ﬁrst step of cellular respiration to continue and produce some ATP, even without
oxygen.
Yeast (single-celled eukaryotic organisms) perform alcoholic fermentation in the absence of oxygen. The products
of alcoholic fermentation are ethyl alcohol (drinking alcohol) and carbon dioxide gas. This process is used to make
common food and drinks. For example, alcoholic fermentation is used to bake bread. The carbon dioxide bubbles
allow the bread to rise and become ﬂuffy. Meanwhile, the alcohol evaporates. In wine making, the sugars of grapes
are fermented to produce wine. The sugars are the starting materials for glycolysis.
Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this
process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered
to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise.
Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to
thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.
Pictured below are some products of fermentation ( Figure 2.23).

Products of fermentation include cheese
(lactic acid fermentation) and wine (alco-
holic fermentation).

2.17. Cell Division

www.ck12.org

2.17 Cell Division

• Deﬁne cell division.
• Explain why cells must divide.

Do cells get worn out?
Yes, just like this car, cells cannot last forever. Cells do eventually wear out. At that point, they need to be replaced.
This is one reason that your cells divide. New cells that result after cells divide are also used for growth and to repair
cuts.

Why Cells Divide

Imagine the ﬁrst stages of life. In humans and other animals, a sperm fertilizes an egg, forming the ﬁrst cell. But
humans are made up of trillions of cells, so where do the new cells come from? Remember that according to the cell
theory, all cells come from existing cells. Once a sperm and egg cell unite and the ﬁrst cell, called a zygote, forms,
an entire baby will develop. And each cell in that baby will be genetically identical, meaning that each cell will have
exactly the same DNA.
How does a new life go from one cell to so many? The cell divides in half, creating two cells. Then those two cells
divide, for a total of four cells. The new cells continue to divide and divide. One cell becomes two, then four, then
eight, and so on ( Figure 2.24). This continual process of a cell dividing and creating two new cells is known as cell
division. Cell division is part of a cycle of cellular growth and division known as the cell cycle—cells must grow
before they divide. The cell cycle describes the "life" of a eukayrotic cell. In addition to cell division, the cell cycle
includes the division of the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
Most cell division produces genetically identical cells, meaning they have the same DNA. The process of mitosis,
which speciﬁcally is the division of the nucleus, ensures that each cell has the same DNA. During mitosis, the
chromosomes equally separate, thus making sure each nucleus in each resulting cell after cell division is genetically
identical.

114

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

A special form of cell division, called meiosis, produces cells with half as much DNA as the parent cell. These cells
are used for reproduction. In prokaryotic organisms, cell division is how those organisms reproduce.

FIGURE 2.24
Cells divide repeatedly to produce an em-
bryo. Previously the one-celled zygote
(the ﬁrst cell of a new organism) divided
to make two cells (a). Each of the two
cells divides to yield four cells (b), then
the four cells divide to make eight cells (c),
and so on. Through cell division, an entire
embryo forms from one initial cell.

Besides the development of a baby, there are many other reasons that cell division is necessary for life:

1. To grow and develop, you must form new cells. Imagine how often your cells must divide during a growth
spurt. Growing just an inch requires countless cell divisions. Your body must produce new bone cells, new
skin cells, new cells in your blood vessels and so on.

2. Cell division is also necessary to repair damaged cells. Imagine you cut your ﬁnger. After the scab forms, it
will eventually disappear and new skin cells will grow to repair the wound. Where do these cells come from?
Some of your existing skin cells divide and produce new cells.

3. Your cells can also simply wear out. Over time you must replace old and worn-out cells. Cell division is

essential to this process.

Summary

• Cells must divide repeatedly for an embryo to develop or for you to grow.
• Cells also divide in order to replace damaged or worn-out cells.

2.18 Cell Cycle

• Describe the cell cycle.
• Explain the phases of the cell cycle.

Do cells have a life cycle?
Yes, just like a butterﬂy passes through different phases, such as caterpillar, chrysalis, and adult butterﬂy, there are a
series of phases in a cell’s life as it gets ready to divide. The sequence of phases leading up to cell division and then
ending with cell division itself is called the cell cycle.

Cell Cycle

The process of cell division in eukaryotic cells is carefully controlled. The cell cycle ( Figure 2.25) is the life cycle
of an eukaryotic cell, with cell division at the end of the cycle. Like a human life cycle, which is made up of different
phases, like childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, the cell cycle also occurs in a series of phases. The ﬁrst cell
cycle begins with the formation of a zygote from the fusion of a male and female sex cell ( gamete).
The steps of the cell cycle can be divided into two main components: interphase and the mitotic phase. Interphase
is the stage when the cell mostly performs its “everyday” functions. For example, it is when a kidney cell does what

117

2.18. Cell Cycle

www.ck12.org

a kidney cell is supposed to do. The cell also gets ready to divide during this time. The cell divides during the mitotic
phase, which consists of mitosis and cytokinesis.
Most of the cell cycle consists of interphase, the time between cell divisions. Interphase can be divided into three
stages:

1. The ﬁrst growth phase (G1): During the G1 stage, the cell doubles in size and doubles the number of

organelles.

2. The synthesis phase (S): The DNA is replicated during this phase. In other words, an identical copy of all
the cell’s DNA is made. This ensures that each new cell has a set of genetic material identical to that of the
parental cell. This process is called DNA replication.

3. The second growth phase (G2): Proteins are synthesized that will help the cell divide. At the end of interphase,

the cell is ready to enter mitosis.

FIGURE 2.25
Shown is the cell cycle. Notice that
most of the cell cycle is spent in Inter-
phase (G1, S, and G2). Mitosis and cy-
tokinesis occur during the Mitotic phase.
Some cells may enter a resting phase dur-
ing which progression through the cycle
stops.

During mitosis, the nucleus divides as the chromosomes are equally separated. One nucleus becomes two nuclei,
each with an identical set of chromosomes. Mitosis is followed by cytokinesis, when the cytoplasm divides,

118

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

resulting in two cells. After cytokinesis, cell division is complete. The one parent cell (the dividing cell) forms
two genetically identical daughter cells (the cells that divide from the parent cell). The term "genetically identical"
means that each cell has an identical set of DNA, and this DNA is also identical to that of the parent cell. If the
cell cycle is not carefully controlled, it can cause a disease called cancer in which the cells divide out of control. A
tumor can result from this kind of growth.

Summary

• The cell cycle describes the "life" of a cell.
• Interphase, the stage of the cell cycle when the cell, preparing to divide, is divided into the G1, S, and G2

stages.

• The nucleus divides during mitosis, and the cytoplasm divides during cytokinesis.

• Explain the importance of mitosis.
• Explain chromosome structure.
• Deﬁne sister chromatids.
• List the phases of mitosis.
• Summarize the phases of mitosis.

How is your DNA organized?
Your DNA is organized into chromosomes, the pink structures pictured above. Your DNA doesn’t always look so
pretty, though. It only winds tightly into chromosomes when the cell is getting ready to divide. If your DNA wasn’t
organized into chromosomes, your DNA would look like a mass of strings and would be difﬁcult to divide up!

Mitosis and Chromosomes

The genetic information of the cell, or DNA, is stored in the nucleus. During mitosis, two nuclei (plural for nucleus)
must form, so that one nucleus can be in each of the new cells after the cell divides. In order to create two genetically
identical nuclei, DNA inside of the nucleus must be copied or replicated. This occurs during the S phase of the cell
cycle. During mitosis, the copied DNA is divided into two complete sets, so that after cytokinesis, each cell has a
complete set of genetic instructions.

Chromosomes

To begin mitosis, the DNA in the nucleus wraps around proteins to form chromosomes. Each organism has a unique
number of chromosomes. In human cells, our DNA is divided up into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Replicated DNA
forms a chromosome made from two identical sister chromatids, forming an "X" shaped molecule ( Figure 2.26).

120

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

The two chromatids are held together on the chromosome by the centromere. The centromere is also where spindle
ﬁber microtubules attach during mitosis. The spindles separate sister chromatids from each other.

FIGURE 2.26
The DNA double helix wraps around pro-
teins (2) and tightly coils a number of
times to form a chromosome (5). This
ﬁgure shows the complexity of the coiling
process. The red dot shows the location
of the centromere, which holds the sis-
ter chromatids together and is where the
spindle microtubules attach during mitosis
and meiosis. Notice that a chromosome
resembles an "X."

Four Phases of Mitosis

During mitosis, the two sister chromatids must be divided. This is a precise process that has four individual phases
to it. After the sister chromatids separate, each separate chromatid is now known as a chromosome. Each resulting
chromosome is made of DNA from just one chromatid. So, each chromosome after this separation is made of "1/2 of
the X." Through this process, each daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome. The four phases of mitosis
are prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase ( Figure 2.27).

1. Prophase: The chromatin, which is unwound DNA, condenses forming chromosomes. The DNA becomes
so tightly wound that you can see them under a microscope. The membrane around the nucleus, called the
nuclear envelope, disappears. Spindles also form and attach to chromosomes to help them move.

2. Metaphase: The chromosomes line up in the center, or the equator, of the cell. The chromosomes line up in

a row, one on top of the next.

3. Anaphase: The two sister chromatids of each chromosome separate as the spindles pull the chromatids apart,

resulting in two sets of identical chromosomes.

4. Telophase: The spindle dissolves and nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes in both cells.

After telophase, each new nucleus contains the exact same number and type of chromosomes as the original cell.
The cell is now ready for cytokinesis, which literally means "cell movement." During cytokinesis, the cytoplasm
divides and the parent cell separates, producing two genetically identical cells, each with its own nucleus. A new
cell membrane forms and in plant cells, a cell wall forms as well. Below is a representation of dividing plant cells (
Figure 2.28).

Summary

• The DNA in the nucleus wraps around proteins to form chromosomes.
• During mitosis, the newly duplicated chromosomes are divided into two daughter nuclei.
• Mitosis occurs in four phases, called prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.

2.20 Asexual vs. Sexual Reproduction

• Distinguish between sexual and asexual reproduction.
• Describe the types of asexual reproduction.
• Explain how plants and animals reproduce sexually.

Do animals always have two parents?
No, not all animals have two parents. When necessary, some animals can be produced from just one parent.
Some reptiles, such as this Komodo dragon, have only one parent. The process of creating offspring from just
one individual is called asexual reproduction.

Reproduction

Animals and other organisms cannot live forever. They must reproduce if their species is to survive. But what does it
mean to reproduce? Reproduction is the ability to make the next generation, and it is one of the basic characteristics
of life. Two methods of reproduction are:

1. Asexual reproduction, the process of forming a new individual from a single parent.

124

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

2. Sexual reproduction, the process of forming a new individual from two parents.

There are advantages and disadvantages to each method, but the result is always the same: a new life begins.

Asexual Reproduction

When humans reproduce, there are two parents involved. DNA must be passed from both the mother and father
to the child. Humans cannot reproduce with just one parent; humans can only reproduce sexually. But having just
one parent is possible in other eukaryotic organisms, including some insects, ﬁsh, and reptiles. These organisms
can reproduce asexually, meaning the offspring ("children") have a single parent and share the exact same genetic
material as the parent. This is very different from reproduction in humans. Bacteria, being a prokaryotic, single-
celled organism, must reproduce asexually.
The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and
female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from
both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact,
the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if
the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease.
Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents’
genes.
Types of organisms that reproduce asexually include:

1. Prokaryotic organisms, like bacteria. Bacteria reproduce through binary ﬁssion, where they grow and divide
in half ( Figure 2.29). First, their chromosome replicates and the cell enlarges. The cell then divides into two
cells as new membranes form to separate the two cells. After cell division, the two new cells each have one
identical chromosome. This simple process allows bacteria to reproduce very rapidly.

2. Flatworms, an invertebrate animal species. Flatworms divide in two, then each half regenerates into a new

ﬂatworm identical to the original, a process called fragmentation.

3. Different types of insects, ﬁsh, and lizards. These organisms can reproduce asexually through a process called
parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis happens when an unfertilized egg cell grows into a new organism. The
resulting organism has half the amount of genetic material of the parent. Parthenogenesis is common in
honeybees. In a hive, the sexually produced eggs become workers, while the asexually produced eggs become
drones.

Sexual Reproduction

During sexual reproduction, two parents are involved. Most animals are dioecious, meaning there is a separate male
and female sex, with the male producing sperm and the female producing eggs. When a sperm and egg meet during
fertilization, a zygote, the ﬁrst cell of a new organism, is formed ( Figure 2.30). This process combines the genetic
material from both parents. The resulting organism will be genetically unique. The zygote will divide by mitosis
and grow into the embryo.
Let’s explore how animals, plants, and fungi reproduce sexually:
Animals often have gonads, organs that produce eggs or sperm. The male gonads are the testes, and the female
gonads are the ovaries. Testes produce sperm; ovaries produce eggs. Sperm and egg, the two sex cells, are known
as gametes, and can combine two different ways, both of which combine the genetic material from the two parents.
Gametes have half the amount of the genetic material of a regular body cell; they are haploid cells. In humans,
gametes have one set of 23 chromosomes. Gametes are produced through a special type of cell division known as
meiosis. Normal human cells have 46 chromosomes. They are diploid cells, with two sets of 23 chromosomes (23
pairs).

Shown is one bacterium reproducing and

FIGURE 2.30
During sexual reproduction, a sperm fer-
tilizes an egg.

Fish and other aquatic animals release their gametes in the water, which is called external fertilization ( Figure
2.31). These gametes will combine by chance. Animals that live on land (reptiles, birds, and mammals) reproduce
by internal fertilization. Typically males have a penis that deposits sperm into the vagina of the female. Birds
do not have penises, but they do have a chamber called the cloaca that they place close to another bird’s cloaca to
deposit sperm. Amphibians must live close to water as they must lay their eggs in a moist or wet environment prior
to external fertilization.

• Plants can also reproduce sexually, but their reproductive organs are different from animals’ gonads. Plants
that have ﬂowers have their reproductive parts in the ﬂower. The sperm is contained in the pollen, while the
egg is contained in the ovary, deep within the ﬂower. The sperm can reach the egg two different ways:

1. In self-pollination, the egg is fertilized by the pollen of the same ﬂower.
2. In cross-pollination, sperm from the pollen of one ﬂower fertilizes the egg of another ﬂower. Like other types
of sexual reproduction, cross-pollination allows new combinations of traits. Cross-pollination occurs when
pollen is carried by the wind to another ﬂower. It can also occur when animal pollinators, like honeybees or
butterﬂies ( Figure 2.32), carry the pollen from ﬂower to ﬂower.

posit pollen into ﬂowers,

cross-pollination.

• Fungi can also reproduce sexually, but instead of female and male sexes, they have (+) and (-) strains. When
the ﬁlaments of a (+) and (-) fungi meet, the zygote is formed. Just like in plants and animals, each zygote
receives DNA from two parent strains.

Summary

• Types of asexual reproduction, when a new individual is formed from a single parent, include binary ﬁssion

in bacteria and parthenogenesis in some animals.

• During sexual reproduction in animals, fertilization can be internal or external.
• Cross-pollination allows sexual reproduction in plants.

Do you have ALL your parents’ chromosomes?
No, you only received half of your mother’s chromosomes and half of your father’s chromosomes. If you inherited
them all, you would have twice the number of chromosomes that you’re supposed to have. Humans typically have
23 pairs of chromosomes. If you received all your parents’ chromosomes, you would have 46 pairs!

Introduction to Meiosis

Sexual reproduction combines gametes from two parents. Gametes are reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg.
As gametes are produced, the number of chromosomes must be reduced by half. Why? The zygote must contain
genetic information from the mother and from the father, so the gametes must contain half of the chromosomes
found in normal body cells. When two gametes come together at fertilization, the normal amount of chromosomes
results. Gametes are produced by a special type of cell division known as meiosis. Meiosis contains two rounds of
cell division without DNA replication in between. This process reduces the number of chromosomes by half.
Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each chromosome within a pair is called a homologous chromo-
some. For each of the 23 chromosome pairs, you received one chromosome from your father and one chromosome
from your mother. Alleles are alternate forms of genes found on chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes have
the same genes, though they may have different alleles. So, though homologous chromosomes are very similar, they
are not identical. The homologous chromosomes are separated when gametes are formed. Therefore, gametes have
only 23 chromosomes, not 23 pairs.

129

Haploid vs. Diploid

www.ck12.org

A cell with two sets of chromosomes is diploid, referred to as 2n, where n is the number of sets of chromosomes.
Most of the cells in a human body are diploid. A cell with one set of chromosomes, such as a gamete, is haploid,
referred to as n. Sex cells are haploid. When a haploid sperm (n) and a haploid egg (n) combine, a diploid zygote
will be formed (2n). In short, when a diploid zygote is formed, half of the DNA comes from each parent.

Overview of Meiosis

Before meiosis begins, DNA replication occurs, so each chromosome contains two sister chromatids that are identical
to the original chromosome. Meiosis ( Figure 2.33) is divided into two divisions: Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Each
division can be divided into the same phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Cytokinesis follows
telophase each time. Between the two cell divisions, DNA replication does not occur. Through this process, one
diploid cell will divide into four haploid cells.

FIGURE 2.33
Overview of Meiosis. During meiosis, four
haploid cells are created from one diploid
parent cell.

Meiosis I

During meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes are separated from each other. This requires that they line
up in their homologous paris during metaphase I. The steps are outlined below:

1. Prophase I: The homologous chromosomes line up together. During this time, a process that only happens
in meiosis can occur. This process is called crossing-over ( Figure 2.34), which is the exchange of DNA
between homologous chromosomes. Crossing-over forms new combinations of alleles on the resulting chro-
mosome. Without crossing-over, the offspring would always inherit all of the alleles on one of the homologous
chromosomes. Also during prophase I, the spindle forms, the chromosomes condense as they coil up tightly,
and the nuclear envelope disappears.

2. Metaphase I: The homologous chromosomes line up in their pairs in the middle of the cell. Chromosomes
from the mother or from the father can each attach to either side of the spindle. Their attachment is random, so
all of the chromosomes from the mother or father do not end up in the same gamete. The gamete will contain
some chromosomes from the mother and some chromosomes from the father.

3. Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes are separated as the spindle shortens, and begin to move to

opposite sides (opposite poles) of the cell.

4. Telophase I: The spindle ﬁbers dissolves, but a new nuclear envelope does not need to form. This is because,
after cytokinesis, the nucleus will immediately begin to divide again. No DNA replication occurs between

130

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

meiosis I and meiosis II because the chromosomes are already duplicated. After cytokinesis, two haploid cells
result, each with chromosomes made of sister chromatids.

Since the separation of chromosomes into gametes is random during meiosis I, this process results in different
combinations of chromosomes (and alleles) in each gamete. With 23 pairs of chromosomes, there is a possibility of
over 8 million different combinations of chromosomes (223) in a human gamete.

FIGURE 2.34
During crossing-over, segments of DNA
are exchanged between non-sister chro-
matids of homologous chromosomes.
Notice how this can result in an allele (A)
on one chromatid being moved onto the
other non-sister chromatid.

Meiosis II

During meiosis II, the sister chromatids are separated and the gametes are generated. This cell division is similar to
that of mitosis, but results in four genetically unique haploid cells. The steps are outlined below:

1. Prophase II: The chromosomes condense.
2. Metaphase II: The chromosomes line up one on top of each other along the middle of the cell, similar to how

they line up in mitosis. The spindle is attached to the centromere of each chromosome.

3. Anaphase II: The sister chromatids separate as the spindle shortens and move to opposite ends of the cell.
4. Telophase II: A nuclear envelope forms around the chromosomes in all four cells. This is followed by

cytokinesis.

After cytokinesis, each cell has divided again. Therefore, meiosis results in four haploid genetically unique daughter
cells, each with half the DNA of the parent cell ( Figure 2.35). In human cells, the parent cell has 46 chromosomes
(23 pairs), so the cells produced by meiosis have 23 chromosomes. These cells will become gametes.

Summary

• Meiosis is a process of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half and produces sex cells, or

gametes.

• Meiosis is divided into two parts: Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Each part is similar to mitosis and can be divided

into the same phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.

• Crossing-over occurs only during prophase I.
• Four genetically unique haploid cells result from meiosis.

Mitosis or Meiosis?
This represents a tiny embryo just beginning to form. Once an egg is fertilized, the resulting single cell must divide
many, many times to develop a fetus. Both mitosis and meiosis involve cell division; is this type of cell division an
example of mitosis or meiosis? The answer is mitosis. With each division you are making a genetically exact copy
of the parent cell, which only happens through mitosis.

Both mitosis and meiosis result in eukaryotic cells dividing. So what is the difference between mitosis and meiosis?
The primary difference is the differing goals of each process. The goal of mitosis is to produce two daughter cells
that are genetically identical to the parent cell, meaning the new cells have exactly the same DNA as the parent cell.

134

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Cell Biology

Mitosis happens when you want to grow, for example. You want all your new cells to have the same DNA as the
previous cells. The goal of meiosis, however, is to produce sperm or eggs, also known as gametes. The resulting
gametes are not genetically identical to the parent cell. Gametes are haploid cells, with only half the DNA present
in the diploid parent cell. This is necessary so that when a sperm and an egg combine at fertilization, the resulting
zygote has the correct amount of DNA—not twice as much as the parents. The zygote then begins to divide through
mitosis.
Pictured below is a comparison between binary ﬁssion ( Figure 2.36), which is cell division of prokaryotic organ-
isms, mitosis, and meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are also compared in the table that follows ( Table 2.2).

Summary

The cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living organisms. But this smallest of units still performs
some very complex processes. In fact, for some organisms, just one cell must do everything necessary for life.
Cell Biology focuses on signiﬁcant aspects of the cell from its structure to its division. Some organisms contain just
one cell, and others contain trillions. Some have a nucleus with DNA, others do not. Some have many organelles,
others do not. But all cells are surrounded by a cell membrane. And it is this semipermeable membrane that
determines what can enter and leave the cell. All cells need energy, and for many organisms, this energy comes from

the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. All cells come from preexisting cells through the process
of cell division, which can produce a new prokaryotic organism. The cell cycle, which includes mitosis, deﬁnes the
life of the eukaryotic cell.

Introduction

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

Why is heredity so important?
Genetics is the study of inheritance. Inheritance is the passing of traits from parents to offspring. How are these
traits "passed"? Through DNA, which is the genetic material of all organisms. This concept will focus on genetics,
inheritance, and DNA.

• Deﬁne and describe a nucleotide.
• Describe the shape of DNA.
• Summarize the base-pairing rules.

Where’s the instructions?
How do your cells know what to do? Just like builders have blueprints to tell them how to build a house, your cells
also have instructions. Your cells’ instructions are molecules of DNA.

What is DNA?

DNA is the material that makes up our chromosomes and stores our genetic information. When you build a house,
you need a blueprint, a set of instructions that tells you how to build. The DNA is like the blueprint for living
organisms. The genetic information is a set of instructions that tell your cells what to do.
DNA is an abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid. As you may recall, nucleic acids are a type of macromolecule
that store information. The deoxyribo part of the name refers to the name of the sugar that is contained in DNA,
deoxyribose. DNA may provide the instructions to make up all living things, but it is actually a very simple molecule.

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

DNA is made of a very long chain of nucleotides. In fact, in you, the smallest DNA molecule has well over 20 million
nucleotides.

Nucleotides

Nucleotides are composed of three main parts:

1. a phosphate group.
2. a 5-carbon sugar (deoxyribose in DNA).
3. a nitrogen-containing base.

The only difference between each nucleotide is the identity of the base. There are only four possible bases that make
up each DNA nucleotide: adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C).

The Genetic Code

The various sequences of the four nucleotide bases make up the genetic code of your cells. It may seem strange that
there are only four letters in the “alphabet” of DNA. But since your chromosomes contain millions of nucleotides,
there are many, many different combinations possible with those four letters.
But how do all these pieces ﬁt together? James Watson and Francis Crick won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for piecing
together the structure of DNA. Together with the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, they determined
that DNA is made of two strands of nucleotides formed into a double helix, or a two-stranded spiral, with the sugar
and phosphate groups on the outside, and the paired bases connecting the two strands on the inside of the helix (
Figure 3.1).

FIGURE 3.1
DNA’s three-dimensional structure is a
double helix. The hydrogen bonds be-
tween the bases at the center of the helix
hold the helix together.

Base-Pairing

The bases in DNA do not pair randomly. When Erwin Chargaff looked closely at the bases in DNA, he noticed
that the percentage of adenine (A) in the DNA always equaled the percentage of thymine (T), and the percentage

143

3.1. DNA, the Genetic Material

www.ck12.org

of guanine (G) always equaled the percentage of cytosine (C). Watson and Crick’s model explained this result by
suggesting that A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C in the DNA helix. Therefore A and T, and G and
C, are "complementary bases," or bases that always pair together, known as a base-pair. The base-pairing rules
state that A will always bind to T, and G will always bind to C ( Figure 3.2). For example, if one DNA strand reads
ATGCCAGT, the other strand will be made up of the complementary bases: TACGGTCA.
Hydrogen bonds hold the complementary bases together, with two bonds forming between an A and a T, and three
bonds between a G and a C.

FIGURE 3.2
The chemical structure of DNA includes
a chain of nucleotides consisting of a 5-
carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and
a nitrogen base. Notice how the sugar
and phosphate group form the backbone
of DNA (strands highlighted in pink), with
the hydrogen bonds between the bases
joining the two strands.

Summary

• DNA stores the genetic information of the cell in the sequence of its 4 bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and

cytosine.

• DNA is made of a long chain of nucleotides consisting of a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and nitrogen-

containing base.

3.2 DNA Structure and Replication

• Explain why DNA must replicate itself.
• Describe the process of DNA replication.
• Explain the meaning of semiconservative replication.

Does DNA copy itself?
Yes, your DNA needs to copy itself every time a new cell is created. The new cell needs to have DNA exactly like
the rest of your cells. Otherwise, that cell might malfunction. That’s why it’s important that the process of copying
DNA, called DNA replication, is very accurate.

DNA Replication

DNA must replicate (copy) itself so that each resulting cell after mitosis and cell division has the same DNA as the
parent cell. All these cells, the parent cell and the two new daughter cells, are genetically identical.
DNA replication occurs during the S phase (the Synthesis phase) of the cell cycle, before mitosis and cell division.
The base pairing rules are crucial for the process of replication. DNA replication occurs when DNA is copied to
form an identical molecule of DNA.
The general steps involved in DNA replication are as follows:

1. The DNA helix unwinds like a zipper as the bonds between the base pairs are broken. The enzyme DNA

Helicase is involved in breaking these bonds.

2. The two single strands of DNA then each serve as a template for a new stand to be created. Using DNA as a
template means that on the new strand, the bases are placed in the correct order because of the base pairing
rules. Recall that A and T are complementary bases, as are G and C. As a template strand is read, the new
strand is created. If ATGCCA is on the "template strand," then TACGGT will be on the new DNA strand. The
enzyme DNA Polymerase reads the template and builds the new strand of DNA.

146

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

3. The new set of nucleotides then join together to form a new strand of DNA. The process results in two DNA

molecules, each with one old strand and one new strand of DNA.

This process is known as semiconservative replication because one strand is conserved (kept the same) in each new
DNA molecule ( Figure 3.3).

FIGURE 3.3
DNA replication occurs when the DNA strands “unzip,” and the original
strands of DNA serve as a template for new nucleotides to join and form a
new strand.

Summary

• During DNA replication, the DNA helix unwinds and the two single strands of DNA then each serve as a

template for a new stand to be created.

• DNA replication is semi-conservative: the new DNA molecule consists of half of the parent DNA molecule.

3.3 Protein Synthesis and Gene Expression

• Deﬁne gene.
• Describe the purpose of protein synthesis.
• Explain the meaning of gene expression.
• Summarize the relationship between DNA, amino acids, and proteins.

How do you build a protein?
Your body needs proteins to create muscles, regulate chemical reactions, transport oxygen, and perform other
important tasks in your body. But how are these proteins built? They are made up of units called amino acids.
Just like there are only a few types of blocks in a set, there are a limited number of amino acids. But there are many
different ways in which they can be combined.

Introduction to Protein Synthesis

A monomer is a molecule that can bind to other monomers to form a polymer. Amino acids are the monomers of a
protein. The DNA sequence contains the instructions to place amino acids into a speciﬁc order.
When the amino acid monomers are assembled in that speciﬁc order, proteins are made, a process called protein
synthesis. In short, DNA contains the instructions to create proteins. But DNA does not directly make the proteins.
Proteins are made on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, and DNA (in an eukaryotic cell) is in the nucleus. So the cell
uses an RNA intermediate to produce proteins.
Each strand of DNA has many separate sequences that code for a speciﬁc protein. Insulin is an example of a protein
made by your cells ( Figure 3.4). Units of DNA that contain code for the creation of a protein are called genes.

Cells Can Turn Genes On or Off

There are about 22,000 genes in every human cell. Does every human cell have the same genes? Yes. Does every
human cell make the same proteins? No. In a multicellular organism, such as us, cells have speciﬁc functions

149

FIGURE 3.4

sents a different amino acid. Just 20 dif-
ferent amino acids are arranged in many
different combinations to make thousands
of proteins.

because they have different proteins. They have different proteins because different genes are expressed in different
cell types (which is known as gene expression).
Imagine that all of your genes are "turned off." Each cell type only "turns on" (or expresses) the genes that have the
code for the proteins it needs to use. So different cell types "turn on" different genes, allowing different proteins to
be made. This gives different cell types different functions.
Once a gene is expressed, the protein product of that gene is usually made. For this reason, gene expression and
protein synthesis are often considered the same process.

Summary

• DNA contains the instructions to assemble amino acids in a speciﬁc order to make protein.
• Each cell type only "turns on" (or expresses) the genes that have the code for the proteins it needs to use.
• Gene expression and protein synthesis are usually considered the same molecular process.

3.4 RNA

• Distinguish between DNA and RNA.
• Name the three types of RNA.
• Explain the functions of each type of RNA.

How does your DNA send a message?
DNA is the blueprint that provides the directions on how to build all the proteins your body needs to function.
However, DNA is conﬁned to the nucleus and, therefore, isn’t involved directly in the process of actually making
the proteins. So how does DNA tell the rest of the cell what to do? It sends a message! The messengers consist of a
special type of RNA.

Three RNAs

DNA contains the instructions to create proteins, but it does not make proteins itself. DNA is located in the nucleus,
which it never leaves, while proteins are made on ribosomes in the cytoplasm. So DNA needs a messenger to
bring its instructions to a ribosome located outside of the nucleus. DNA sends out a message, in the form of RNA
(ribonucleic acid), describing how to make the protein.
There are three types of RNA directly involved in protein synthesis:

• Messenger RNA ( mRNA) carries the instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. mRNA is produced in

the nucleus, as are all RNAs.

• The other two forms of RNA, ribosomal RNA ( rRNA) and transfer RNA ( tRNA), are involved in the
process of ordering the amino acids to make the protein. rRNA becomes part of the ribosome, which is the

152

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

site of protein synthesis, and tRNA brings an amino acid to the ribosome so it can be added to a growing
chain during protein synthesis. There are numerous tRNAs, as each tRNA is speciﬁc for an amino acid. The
amino acid actually attaches to the tRNA during this process. More about RNAs will be discussed during the
Transcription and Translation Concepts.

All three RNAs are nucleic acids, made of nucleotides, similar to DNA ( Figure 3.5). The RNA nucleotide is
different from the DNA nucleotide in the following ways:

• RNA contains a different kind of sugar, called ribose.
• In RNA, the base uracil (U) replaces the thymine (T) found in DNA.
• RNA is a single strand molecule.

FIGURE 3.5
A comparison of DNA and RNA, with the
bases of each shown. Notice that in RNA,
uracil replaces thymine.

Summary

• Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
• The other two forms of RNA, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA), are involved in the process

of ordering the amino acids to make proteins.

• RNA is a nucleic acid, like DNA, but differs slightly in its structure.

3.5 Transcription of DNA to RNA

• Deﬁne transcription.
• Explain the relationship between a codon and the mRNA.
• Describe how mRNA is created from DNA.

How does DNA write its message?
The process of DNA sending a message to the cytoplasm is called transcription. Transcription means "a written
copy." However, DNA can’t get out a pen and write a message. It creates an mRNA molecule to carry the message.

Transcription

DNA is located in the nucleus. Proteins are made on ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Remember that information in a
gene is converted into mRNA, which carries the information to the ribosome. In the nucleus, mRNA is created by
using the DNA in a gene as a template. A template is a model provided for others to copy.
The process of constructing an mRNA molecule from DNA is known as transcription ( Figure 3.6 and Figure
3.7). Transcription is similar to DNA replication, except in transcription, single stranded RNA is produced instead

155

3.5. Transcription of DNA to RNA

www.ck12.org

of double stranded DNA. In transcription, only one strand of DNA is used as a template. First, the double helix of
DNA unwinds and an enzyme, RNA Polymerase, builds the mRNA using the DNA as a template. The nucleotides
follow basically the same base pairing rules as in DNA to form the correct sequence in the mRNA. This time,
however, uracil (U) pairs with each adenine (A) in the DNA.
For example, a DNA sequence ACGGGTAAGG will be transcribed into the mRNA sequence UGCCCAUUCC. In
this manner, the information of the DNA is passed on to the mRNA. The mRNA will carry this code to the ribosomes
to tell them how to make a protein.
As not all genes are used in every cell, a gene must be "turned on" or expressed when the gene product is needed by
the cell. Only the information in a gene that is being expressed is transcribed into an mRNA.

FIGURE 3.6
Transcription is when RNA is created from
a DNA template. Each gene (a) contains
triplets of bases (b) that are transcribed
into RNA (c). Every triplet in the DNA, or
codon in the mRNA, encodes for a unique
amino acid.

FIGURE 3.7
Base-pairing ensures the accuracy of
transcription. Notice how the helix must
unwind for transcription to take place. The
new mRNA is shown in green.

3.6 Translation of RNA to Protein

• Deﬁne translation.
• Explain the relationship between the tRNA, anticodon, codon, and mRNA.
• Describe the process of translation.
• Explain the role of the genetic code.

How does the cell translate a message?
The mRNA is the message sent from the nucleus to the ribosome, the organelle of protein synthesis. Like a foreign
language, the genetic code of the mRNA message must then be translated so that the ribosomes make the correct
protein. The process of reading the code of a mRNA to make a protein is called translation.

158

www.ck12.org

Translation

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

The mRNA, which is transcribed from the DNA in the nucleus, carries the directions for the protein-making process.
mRNA tells the ribosome ( Figure 3.8) how to create a speciﬁc protein.

FIGURE 3.8
Ribosomes translate RNA into a protein with a speciﬁc amino acid
sequence. The tRNA binds and brings to the ribosome the amino acid
encoded by the mRNA.

The process of reading the mRNA code in the ribosome to make a protein is called translation ( Figure 3.9): the
mRNA is translated from the language of nucleic acids (nucleotides) to the language of proteins (amino acids). Sets
of three bases, called codons, are read in the ribosome, the organelle responsible for making proteins.

FIGURE 3.9
This summary of how genes are ex-
pressed shows that DNA is transcribed
into RNA, which is translated, in turn, to
protein. The one letter code represents
amino acids.

The following are the steps involved in translation:

• mRNA travels to the ribosome from the nucleus.

The following steps occur in the ribosome:

• The base code in the mRNA determines the order of the amino acids in the protein. The genetic code in mRNA
is read in “words” of three letters (triplets), called codons. Each codon codes for an amino acid. There are 20
amino acids used to make proteins, and different codons code for different amino acids. For example, GGU
codes for the amino acid glycine, while GUC codes for valine.

• tRNA reads the mRNA code and brings a speciﬁc amino acid to attach to the growing chain of amino acids.
The anticodon on the tRNA binds to the codon on the mRNA. Each tRNA carries only one type of amino
acid and only recognizes one speciﬁc codon. For example, a GGC anticodon will bind to a CCG codon, and
a CGA anticodon will bind to a GCU codon.

• tRNA is released from the amino acid.
• Three codons, UGA, UAA, and UAG, indicate that the protein should stop adding amino acids. They are
called stop codons and do not code for an amino acid. Once tRNA comes to a stop codon, the protein is set
free from the ribosome.

The following chart ( Figure 3.10) is used to determine which amino acids correspond to which codons.

valine (Val) according to this chart. Start

three base codon, and work your way
out. Notice that more than one codon
may encode for a single amino acid. For
example, glycine (Gly) is encoded by a
GGG, GGA, GGC, and GGU. Notice there
are 64 codons. Of the 64 codons, three
are stop codons.

Summary

• Translation is the process of reading the mRNA code in the ribosome to make a protein.
• Sets of three bases on the mRNA, called codons, are read in order to select the correct amino acid for building

a protein.

• Distinguish between point mutations and chromosomal mutations.
• Explain the outcome from a frameshift mutation.
• Describe the types of chromosomal mutations.
• Explain how mutations occur.

Would a mutation make you a superhero?
In the comic books, a mutation can give a person superpowers. Do you think this really happens? In real life, a
mutation can be beneﬁcial, or it can harm an organism. For example, beneﬁcial mutations lead to evolution, and
harmful mutations can lead to diseases like cancer. A mutation, however, is not going to turn you into a superhero!

Mutations

The process of DNA replication is not always 100% accurate. Sometimes the wrong base is inserted in the new
strand of DNA. This wrong base could become permanent. A permanent change in the sequence of DNA is known

162

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

as a mutation. Small changes in the DNA sequence are usually point mutations, which is a change in a single
nucleotide. Once DNA has a mutation, that mutation will be copied each time the DNA replicates. After cell
division, each resulting cell will carry the mutation.
A mutation may have no effect. However, sometimes a mutation can cause a protein to be made incorrectly. A defect
in the protein can affect how well the protein works, or whether it works at all. Usually the loss of a protein function
is detrimental to the organism.
In rare circumstances, though, the mutation can be beneﬁcial. Mutations are a mechanism for how species evolve.
For example, suppose a mutation in an animal’s DNA causes the loss of an enzyme that makes a dark pigment in the
animal’s skin. If the population of animals has moved to a light colored environment, the animals with the mutant
gene would have a lighter skin color and be better camouﬂaged. So in this case, the mutation is beneﬁcial.

Point Mutations

If a single base is deleted (called a deletion, which is also a point mutation), there can be huge effects on the
organism, because this may cause a frameshift mutation. Remember that the bases in the mRNA are read in groups
of three by the tRNA. If the reading frame is off by even one base, the resulting sequence will consist of an entirely
different set of codons.
The reading of an mRNA is like reading three-letter words of a sentence. Imagine the sentence: “The big dog ate the
red cat.” If you take out the second letter from "big," the frame will be shifted so now it will read: “The bgd oga tet
her edc at.” One single deletion makes the whole “sentence” impossible to read. A point mutation that adds a base
(known as an insertion) would also result in a frameshift.

Chromosomal Mutations

Mutations may also occur in chromosomes ( Figure 3.11). These mutations are going to be fairly large mutations,
possible affecting many genes. Possible types of mutations in chromosomes include:

1. Deletion: When a segment of DNA is lost, so there is a missing segment in the chromosome. These usually

result in many genes missing from the chromosome.

2. Duplication: When a segment of DNA is repeated, creating a longer chromosome. These usually result in

multiple copies of genes in the chromosome.

3. Inversion: When a segment of DNA is ﬂipped and then reattached to the same chromosome.
4. Insertion: When a segment of DNA from one chromosome is added to another, unrelated chromosome.
5. Translocation: When two segments from different chromosomes change positions.

Causes of Mutations

Many mutations are not caused by errors in replication. Mutations can happen spontaneously, and they can be
caused by mutagens in the environment. Some chemicals, such as those found in tobacco smoke, can be mutagens.
Sometimes mutagens can also cause cancer. Tobacco smoke, for example, is often linked to lung cancer.

Summary

• A mutation is a permanent change in the sequence of bases in DNA.
• Mutations occur in the DNA through deletion, duplication, inversion, insertion, and translocation within the

chromosome.

• Mutations can occur due to errors during DNA replication or by mutagens in the environment.

3.8 Mendel’s Pea Plants

• Summarize the importance of Gregor Mendel to genetics.
• Distinguish between self-pollination and cross-pollination.
• Describe Mendel’s ﬁrst genetics experiments.

Why do you look like your family?
For a long time people understood that traits are passed down through families. The rules of how this worked
were unclear, however. The work of Gregor Mendel was crucial in explaining how traits are passed down to each
generation.

Mendel’s Experiments

What does the word "inherit" mean? You may have inherited something of value from a grandparent or another
family member. To inherit is to receive something from someone who came before you. You can inherit objects,
but you can also inherit traits. For example, you can inherit a parent’s eye color, hair color, or even the shape of your
nose and ears!
Genetics is the study of inheritance. The ﬁeld of genetics seeks to explain how traits are passed on from one
generation to the next.
In the late 1850s, an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel ( Figure 3.12) performed the ﬁrst genetics experiments.
To study genetics, Mendel chose to work with pea plants because they have easily identiﬁable traits ( Figure 3.13).
For example, pea plants are either tall or short, which is an easy trait to observe. Furthermore, pea plants grow
quickly, so he could complete many experiments in a short period of time.
Mendel also used pea plants because they can either self-pollinate or be cross-pollinated. Self-pollination means
that only one ﬂower is involved; the ﬂower’s own pollen lands on the female sex organs. Cross pollination is done

by hand by moving pollen from one ﬂower to the stigma of another (just like bees do naturally). As a result, one
plant’s sex cells combine with another plant’s sex cells. This is called a "cross." These crosses produce offspring
(or "children"), just like when male and female animals mate. Since Mendel could move pollen between plants, he
could carefully control and then observe the results of crosses between two different types of plants.
He studied the inheritance patterns for many different traits in peas, including round seeds versus wrinkled seeds,
white ﬂowers versus purple ﬂowers, and tall plants versus short plants. Because of his work, Mendel is considered
the "Father of Genetics."

Mendel’s First Experiment

In one of Mendel’s early experiments, he crossed a short plant and a tall plant. What do you predict the offspring of
these plants were? Medium-sized plants? Most people during Mendel’s time would have said medium-sized. But
an unexpected result occurred. Mendel observed that the offspring of this cross (called the F1 generation) were all
tall plants!
Next, Mendel let the F1 generation self-pollinate. That means the tall plant offspring were crossed with each other.
He found that 75% of their offspring (the F2 generation) were tall, while 25% were short. Shortness skipped a
generation. But why? In all, Mendel studied seven characteristics, with almost 20,000 F2 plants analyzed. All of his
results were similar to the ﬁrst experiment—about three out of every four plants had one trait, while just one out of
every four plants had the other.
For example, he crossed purple ﬂowered-plants and white ﬂowered-plants. Do you think the colors blended? No,

167

3.8. Mendel’s Pea Plants

they did not. Just like the previous experiment, all offspring in this cross (the F1 generation) were one color: purple.
In the F2 generation, 75% of plants had purple ﬂowers and 25% had white ﬂowers ( Figure 3.14). There was no
blending of traits in any of Mendel’s experiments.

FIGURE 3.14
The results of Mendel’s experiment with
purple ﬂowered and white ﬂowered-plants

experiments with other pea plant traits.

3.9 Mendel’s Laws and Genetics

• Distinguish between dominant and recessive traits.
• Explain the law of segregation.

What does it mean to be dominant?
The most powerful or inﬂuential individual in a group is sometimes called dominant. In genetics, a dominant trait
means nearly the same thing. A dominant trait is the most inﬂuential trait and masks the other trait.

Dominance

Do you remember what happened when Mendel crossed purple ﬂowered-plants and white ﬂowered-plants? All the
offspring had purple ﬂowers. There was no blending of traits in any of Mendel’s experiments. Mendel had to come
up with a theory of inheritance to explain his results. He developed a theory called the law of segregation.

The Law of Segregation

Mendel proposed that each pea plant had two hereditary factors for each trait. There were two possibilities for each
hereditary factor, such as a purple factor or white factor. One factor is dominant to the other. The other trait that is
masked is called the recessive factor, meaning that when both factors are present, only the effects of the dominant
factor are noticeable ( Figure 3.15). Although you have two hereditary factors for each trait, each parent can only
pass on one of these factors to the offspring. When the sex cells, or gametes (sperm or egg), form, the heredity
factors must separate, so there is only one factor per gamete. In other words, the factors are "segregated" in each
gamete. Mendel’s law of segregation states that the two hereditary factors separate when gametes are formed. When
fertilization occurs, the offspring receive one hereditary factor from each gamete, so the resulting offspring have two
factors.

170

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

The law of segregation predates our understanding or meiosis. Mendel developed his theories without an under-
standing of DNA, or even the knowledge that DNA existed. Quite a remarkable feat!

FIGURE 3.15
In peas, purple ﬂowers are dominant to white.
If one of these purple
ﬂowers is crossed with a white ﬂower, all the offspring will have purple
ﬂowers.

Example Cross

This law explains what Mendel had seen in the F1 generation when a tall plant was crossed with a short plant. The
two heredity factors in this case were the short and tall factors. Each individual in the F1 would have one of each
factor, and as the tall factor is dominant to the short factor (the recessive factor), all the plants appeared tall.
In describing genetic crosses, letters are used. The dominant factor is represented with a capital letter (T for tall)
while the recessive factor is represented by a lowercase letter (t). For the T and t factors, three combinations are
possible: TT, Tt, and tt. TT plants will be tall, while plants with tt will be short. Since T is dominant to t, plants that
are Tt will be tall because the dominant factor masks the recessive factor.
In this example, we are crossing a TT tall plant with a tt short plant. As each parent gives one factor to the F1
generation, all of the F1 generation will be Tt tall plants.
When the F1 generation (Tt) is allowed to self-pollinate, each parent will give one factor (T or t) to the F2 generation.
So the F2 offspring will have four possible combinations of factors: TT, Tt, tT, or tt. According to the laws of
probability, 25% of the offspring would be tt, so they would appear short. And 75% would have at least one T factor
and would be tall.

Summary

• One hereditary factor is dominant to the other. The dominant trait masks the recessive factor, so that when

both factors are present, only the effects of the dominant factor are noticeable.

• According to Mendel’s law of segregation, there are two hereditary factors for each trait that must segregate
during gamete (egg and sperm) production. As a result, offspring receive one factor from each parent, resulting
in two factors for each trait in the offspring.

3.10 Punnett Squares

• Explain the relationship between probability and genetics.
• Use a Punnett square to make predictions about the traits of the offspring of a genetic cross.

What’s the chance of the coin landing on heads?
There is always a 50-50 chance that a coin will land on heads. Half the time it will land on heads and half the time it
will land on tails. What is the chance of it landing heads twice in a row? Or three times? These rules of probability
also apply to genetics.
A parent only gives one factor for each trait to an offspring. If a parent has one dominant and one recessive factor
for a trait, then, on average, half the time the dominant factor will be passed on, and half the time the recessive factor
will be passed on.

Probability and Punnett Squares

A Punnett square is a special tool derived from the laws of probability. It is used to predict the possible offspring
from a cross, or mating between two parents.

173

3.10. Punnett Squares

www.ck12.org

An example of a Punnett square ( Figure 3.16) shows the results of a cross between two purple ﬂowers that each
have one dominant factor and one recessive factor (Bb).

FIGURE 3.16
The Punnett square of a cross between two purple ﬂowers (Bb). A Punnett
square can be used to calculate what percentage of offspring will have a
certain trait.

To create a Punnett square, perform the following steps:

1. Take the factors from the ﬁrst parent and place them at the top of the square (B and b).
2. Take the factors from the second parent and line them up on the left side of the square (B and b).
3. Pull the factors from the top into the boxes below.
4. Pull the factors from the side into the boxes next to them.

The possible offspring are represented by the letters in the boxes, with one factor coming from each parent.
Results:

• Top left box: BB, or purple ﬂowers
• Top right box: Bb, or purple ﬂowers
• Lower left box: Bb, or purple ﬂowers
• Lower right box: bb, or white ﬂowers

Only one of the plants out of the four, or 25% of the plants, has white ﬂowers (bb). The other 75% have purple
ﬂowers (BB, Bb), because the purple factor (B) is the dominant factor. This shows that the color purple is the
dominant trait in pea plants.
Now imagine you cross one of the white ﬂowers (bb) with a purple ﬂower that has both a dominant and recessive
factor (Bb). The only possible gamete in the white ﬂower is recessive (b), while the purple ﬂower can have gametes
with either dominant (B) or recessive (b).
Practice using a Punnett square with this cross (see Table 3.1).

• Deﬁne allele.
• Compare heterozygous to homozygous.
• Distinguish genotype from phenotype.
• Compare Mendel’s laws with the modern understanding of chromosomes.

Did Mendel know about DNA?
No, people did not understand that DNA is our hereditary material until long after Mendel’s time. Our modern
understanding of DNA and chromosomes helped to explain how Mendel’s rules worked.

Modern Genetics

Mendel laid the foundation for modern genetics, but there were still a lot of questions he left unanswered. What
exactly are the dominant and recessive factors that determine how all organisms look? And how do these factors
work?
Since Mendel’s time, scientists have discovered the answers to these questions. Genetic material is made out of
DNA. It is the DNA that makes up the hereditary factors that Mendel identiﬁed. By applying our modern knowledge
of DNA and chromosomes, we can explain Mendel’s ﬁndings and build on them. In this concept, we will explore
the connections between Mendel’s work and modern genetics.

Traits, Genes, and Alleles

Recall that our DNA is wound into chromosomes. Each of our chromosomes contains a long chain of DNA that
encodes hundreds, if not thousands, of genes. Each of these genes can have slightly different versions from individual
to individual. These variants of genes are called alleles. Each parent only donates one allele for each gene to an
offspring.
For example, remember that for the height gene in pea plants there are two possible factors. These factors are alleles.
There is a dominant allele for tallness (T) and a recessive allele for shortness (t).

Genotype and Phenotype

Genotype is a way to describe the combination of alleles that an individual has for a certain gene ( Table 3.2). For
each gene, an organism has two alleles, one on each chromosome of a homologous pair of chromosomes (think of it
as one allele from Mom, one allele from Dad). The genotype is represented by letter combinations, such as TT, Tt,
and tt.
When an organism has two of the same alleles for a speciﬁc gene, it is homozygous (homo means "same") for that
gene. An organism can be either homozygous dominant (TT) or homozygous recessive (tt). If an organism has two
different alleles (Tt) for a certain gene, it is known as heterozygous (hetero means different).

Phenotype is a way to describe the traits you can see. The genotype is like a recipe for a cake, while the phenotype
is like the cake made from the recipe. The genotype expresses the phenotype. For example, the phenotypes of
Mendel’s pea plants were either tall or short, or they were purple-ﬂowered or white-ﬂowered.
Can organisms with different genotypes have the same phenotypes? Let’s see.
What is the phenotype of a pea plant that is homozygous dominant (TT) for the tall trait? Tall. What is the phenotype
of a pea plant that is heterozygous (Tt)? It is also tall. The answer is yes, two different genotypes can result in the
same phenotype. Remember, the recessive phenotype will be expressed only when the dominant allele is absent, or
when an individual is homozygous recessive (tt) ( Figure 3.17).

Summary

• Mendel’s hereditary "factors" are variants of genes called alleles.
• Genotype describes the combination of alleles that an individual has for a certain gene, while phenotype

describes the traits that you can see.

3.12 Non-Mendelian Inheritance

• Distinguish incomplete dominance from codominance.
• Describe the genetics of ABO blood types in humans.

How would Mendel explain blood types?
The inheritance of traits is not always as simple as Mendel’s rules. Each characteristic Mendel investigated was
controlled by one gene that had only two possible alleles, one of which was completely dominant over the other. We
now know that inheritance is often more complicated than this. In blood types, for example, there are actually three
alleles instead of two. And some traits even have more than three alleles.

Exceptions to Mendel’s Rules

In all of Mendel’s experiments, he worked with traits where a single gene controlled the trait. Each also had one
allele that was always dominant over the recessive allele. But this is not always true.
There are exceptions to Mendel’s rules, and these exceptions usually have something to do with the dominant allele.
If you cross a homozygous red ﬂower with a homozygous white ﬂower, according to Mendel’s laws, what color
ﬂower should result from the cross? Either a completely red or completely white ﬂower, depending on which allele
is dominant. But since Mendel’s time, scientists have discovered this is not always the case.

179

3.12. Non-Mendelian Inheritance

Incomplete Dominance

www.ck12.org

One allele is NOT always completely dominant over another allele. Sometimes an individual has a phenotype
between the two parents because one allele is not dominant over another. This pattern of inheritance is called
incomplete dominance. For example, snapdragon ﬂowers show incomplete dominance. One of the genes for
ﬂower color in snapdragons has two alleles, one for red ﬂowers and one for white ﬂowers.
A plant that is homozygous for the red allele (RR) will have red ﬂowers, while a plant that is homozygous for the
white allele will have white ﬂowers (WW). But the heterozygote will have pink ﬂowers (RW) ( Figure 3.18) as both
alleles are expressed. Neither the red nor the white allele is dominant, so the phenotype of the offspring is a blend
of the two parents.

FIGURE 3.18
Pink snapdragons are an example of in-
complete dominance.

Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called
hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difﬁcult for
these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive (ss) for
the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous
dominant (SS) will have normal red blood cells.
What type of blood cells do you think a person who is heterozygous (Ss) for the trait will have? They will have some
misshapen cells and some normal cells ( Figure 3.19). Both the dominant and recessive alleles are expressed, so the
result is a phenotype that is a combination of the recessive and dominant traits.

FIGURE 3.19
Sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become misshapen and
curved unlike normal, rounded red blood cells.

180

www.ck12.org

Codominance

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

Another exception to Mendel’s laws is a phenomenon called codominance. For example, our blood type shows
codominance. Do you know what your blood type is? Are you A? O? AB? Those letters actually represent alleles.
Unlike other traits, your blood type has three alleles, instead of two!
The ABO blood types ( Figure 3.20) are named for the protein attached to the outside of the blood cell. In this
case, two alleles are dominant and completely expressed (IA and IB), while one allele is recessive (i). The IA allele
encodes for red blood cells with the A antigen, while the IB allele encodes for red blood cells with the B antigen.
The recessive allele (i) does not encode for any proteins. Therefore a person with two recessive alleles (ii) has type
O blood. As no dominant (IA and IB) allele is present, the person cannot have type A or type B blood. What are the
genotypes of a person with type A or type B blood?

FIGURE 3.20
An example of codominant inheritance is
ABO blood types.

There are two possible genotypes for type A blood, homozygous (IAIA) and heterozygous (IAi), and two possible
genotypes for type B blood, (IBIB and IBi). If a person is heterozygous for both the IA and IB alleles, they will
express both and have type AB blood with both proteins on each red blood cell.
This pattern of inheritance is signiﬁcantly different than Mendel’s rules for inheritance, because both alleles are
expressed completely, and one does not mask the other.

Summary

• Incomplete dominance, as seen in sickle cell anemia, is a form of inheritance in which one allele is only partly

dominant over the other allele, resulting in an intermediate phenotype.

• Codominance, as in human blood type, is a form of inheritance in which both alleles are expressed equally in

the phenotype of the heterozygote.

3.13 Polygenic Traits

• Explain the inheritance of polygenic traits.
• Describe the phenotypic distribution of polygenic traits.

Are all people either short or tall?
Unlike Mendel’s peas, people do not all fall into two categories: short or tall. Most people, in fact, are somewhere
in between. Obviously, Mendel’s rules are too simple to explain the inheritance of human height.

Polygenic Traits

Another exception to Mendel’s rules is polygenic inheritance, which occurs when a trait is controlled by more than
one gene. This means that each dominant allele "adds" to the expression of the next dominant allele.
Usually, traits are polygenic when there is wide variation in the trait. For example, humans can be many different
sizes. Height is a polygenic trait, controlled by at least three genes with six alleles. If you are dominant for all of
the alleles for height, then you will be very tall. There is also a wide range of skin color across people. Skin color is
also a polygenic trait, as are hair and eye color.

183

3.13. Polygenic Traits

www.ck12.org

Polygenic inheritance often results in a bell shaped curve when you analyze the population ( Figure 3.21). That
means that most people fall in the middle of the phenotypic range, such as average height, while very few people
are at the extremes, such as very tall or very short. At one end of the curve will be individuals who are recessive
for all the alleles (for example, aabbcc); at the other end will be individuals who are dominant for all the alleles (for
example, AABBCC). Through the middle of the curve will be individuals who have a combination of dominant and
recessive alleles (for example, AaBbCc or AaBBcc).

FIGURE 3.21
Polygenic traits tend to result in a distribu-
tion that resembles a bell-shaped curve,
the extremes and most
with few at
in
the middle.
There may be 4 or 6 or
more alleles involved in the phenotype.
At the left extreme, individuals are com-
pletely dominant for all alleles, and at the
right extreme, individuals are completely
recessive for all alleles.
Individuals in
the middle have various combinations of
recessive and dominant alleles.

Summary

• In polygenic inheritance, a trait is controlled by more than one gene.
• Examples of polygenic inheritance include height or skin color.

3.14 Sex-linked Inheritance

• Deﬁne sex-linked trait.
• Explain the genetics of sex determination in humans.
• Explain sex-linked inheritance.

Male or female?
One of the exciting things about expecting a child is wondering if the baby will be a boy or a girl. There are many
superstitions about how one might inﬂuence or predict the outcome. But what really determines if a baby is male or
female? We now know that the gender of a baby is determined by a special pair of chromosomes known as the sex
chromosomes.

Sex-linked Inheritance

What determines if a baby is a male or female? Recall that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes—and one of those
pairs is the sex chromosomes. Everyone has two sex chromosomes. Your sex chromosomes can be X or Y. Females
have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY).
If a baby inherits an X chromosome from the father and an X chromosome from the mother, what will be the child’s
sex? The baby will have two X chromosomes, so it will be female. If the father’s sperm carries the Y chromosome,
the child will be male. Notice that a mother can only pass on an X chromosome, so the sex of the baby is determined
by the father. The father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the Y or X chromosome, so there is a 50 percent
chance that a child will be male, and there is a 50 percent chance a child will be female. This 50:50 chance occurs
for each baby. A couple’s ﬁrst ﬁve children could all be boys. The sixth child still has a 50:50 chance of being a girl.
One special pattern of inheritance that doesn’t ﬁt Mendel’s rules is sex-linked inheritance, referring to the inher-
itance of traits that are located on genes on the sex chromosomes. Since males and females do not have the same
sex chromosomes, there will be differences between the sexes in how these sex-linked traits—traits linked to genes
located on the sex chromosomes—are expressed. Sex-linked traits usually refer to traits due to genes on the X
chromosome.

186

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

One example of a sex-linked trait is red-green colorblindness. People with this type of colorblindness cannot tell the
difference between red and green. They often see these colors as shades of brown ( Figure 3.22). Boys are much
more likely to be colorblind than girls ( Table 3.3). This is because colorblindness is a sex-linked, recessive trait.
Boys only have one X chromosome, so if that chromosome carries the gene for colorblindness, they will be
colorblind. As girls have two X chromosomes, a girl can have one X chromosome with the colorblind gene and
one X chromosome with a normal gene for color vision. Since colorblindness is recessive, the dominant normal
gene will mask the recessive colorblind gene. Females with one colorblindness allele and one normal allele are
referred to as carriers. They carry the allele but do not express it.
How would a female become colorblind? She would have to inherit two genes for colorblindness, which is very
unlikely. Many sex-linked traits are inherited in a recessive manner.

A person with red-green colorblindness

3.15 Genetic Disorders

• Describe the genetics of common human genetic disorders.

When is a cold not just a cold?
At some point in your life, you’re bound to catch a cold. And there are ways to prevent catching a cold. But what if
you couldn’t prevent an illness? What if you were born with a disease? What if having a disease was actually due to
your DNA? These are genetic diseases, and they can be very serious.

Human Genetic Disorders

Many genetic disorders are caused by mutations in one or a few genes. Others are caused by chromosomal
mutations. Some human genetic disorders are X-linked or Y-linked, which means the faulty gene is carried on
these sex chromosomes. Other genetic disorders are carried on one of the other 22 pairs of chromosomes; these
chromosomes are known as autosomes or autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes. Some genetic disorders are due to
new mutations, others can be inherited from your parents.

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

Autosomal Recessive Disorders

Some genetic disorders are caused by recessive alleles of a single gene on an autosome. An example of autosomal
recessive genetic disorders are Tay-Sachs disease and cystic ﬁbrosis. Children with cystic ﬁbrosis have excessively
thick mucus in their lungs, which makes it difﬁcult for them to breathe. The inheritance of this recessive allele is
the same as any other recessive allele, so a Punnett square can be used to predict the probability that two carriers
of the disease will have a child with cystic ﬁbrosis. Recall that carriers have the recessive allele for a trait but do not
express the trait. What are the possible genotypes of the offspring in the following table ( Table 3.4)? What are the
possible phenotypes?

According to this Punnett square, two parents that are carriers (Ff ) of the cystic ﬁbrosis gene have a 25% chance of
having a child with cystic ﬁbrosis (ff ). The affected child must inherit two recessive alleles. The carrier parents are
not affected.
Tay-Sachs disease is a severe genetic disorder in which affected children do not live to adulthood, so the gene is
not passed from an affected individual. Carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene are not affected. How does a child become
affected with Tay-Sachs?

Automsomal Dominant Disorders

Huntington’s disease is an example of an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that if the dominant allele is
present, then the person will express the disease. A child only has to inherit one dominant allele to have the disease.
The disease causes the brain’s cells to break down, leading to muscle spasms and personality changes. Unlike most
other genetic disorders, the symptoms usually do not become apparent until middle age. You can use a simple
Punnett square to predict the inheritance of a dominant autosomal disorder, like Huntington’s disease. If one parent
has Huntington’s disease, what is the chance of passing it on to the children? If you draw the Punnett square, you
will ﬁnd that there is a 50 percent chance of the disorder being passed on to the children.

Summary

• Autosomal recessive genetic disorders, such as cystic ﬁbrosis, are caused by recessive alleles of a single gene

on an autosome.

• Autosomal dominant genetic disorders, such as Huntington’s disease, are caused by dominant alleles of a

single gene on an autosome.

3.16 Pedigree Analysis

• Deﬁne pedigree.
• Interpret a pedigree to determine the mode of inheritance.

What’s a pedigree?
When you are talking about a pedigree dog, it means the dog is purebred. Through selective breeding, the dog has
all the traits of that particular breed. When talking about genetics, however, a pedigree is a chart that helps show
family relationships.

Pedigree Analysis

A pedigree is a chart that shows the inheritance of a trait over several generations. A pedigree is commonly created
for families, and it outlines the inheritance patterns of genetic disorders and traits. A pedigree can help predict the
probability that offspring will inherit a genetic disorder.
Pictured below is a pedigree displaying recessive inheritance of a disorder through three generations ( Figure 3.23).
From studying a pedigree, scientists can determine the following:

193

3.16. Pedigree Analysis

www.ck12.org

• If the trait is sex-linked (on the X or Y chromosome) or autosomal (on a chromosome that does not determine

sex).

• If the trait is inherited in a dominant or recessive fashion.

Sometimes pedigrees can also help determine whether individuals with the trait are heterozygous (two different
alleles) or homozygous (two of the same allele). Some points to keep in mind when analyzing a pedigree are:

1. With autosomal recessive inheritance, all affected individuals will be homozygous recessive.
2. With dominant inheritance, all affected individuals will have at least one dominant allele. They will be either

homozygous dominant or heterozygous.

3. With sex-linked inheritance, more males (XY) than females (XX) usually have the trait. Sex-linked inheritance

is usually recessive.

FIGURE 3.23
In a pedigree, squares symbolize males,
and circles represent females. A horizon-
tal line joining a male and female indicates
that the couple had offspring. Vertical
lines indicate offspring which are listed
left to right, in order of birth. Shading of
the circle or square indicates an individual
who has the trait being traced.
In this
pedigree, the inheritance of the recessive
trait is being traced. A is the dominant
allele, and a is the recessive allele.

3.17 Chromosomal Disorders

• Describe the genetics of Down syndrome.
• Explain how changes in chromosomes can cause disorders in humans.

Can you have too many chromosomes?
Yes, it’s not a good thing to have extra chromosomes. An extra chromosome can be fatal to an embryo, in fact. In
the case of a few chromosomes, however, a baby may be born with an extra chromosome. This child will have a
chromosomal disorder.

Chromosomal Disorders

Some children are born with genetic defects that are not carried by a single gene. Instead, an error in a larger part
of the chromosome or even in an entire chromosome causes the disorder. Usually the error happens when the egg or
sperm is forming. Having extra chromosomes or damaged chromosomes can cause disorders.

Extra Chromosomes

One common example of an extra-chromosome disorder is Down syndrome ( Figure 3.24). Children with Down
syndrome are mentally disabled and also have physical deformities. Down syndrome occurs when a baby receives
an extra chromosome 21 from one of his or her parents. Usually, a child will receive one chromosome 21 from the

196

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

mother and one chromosome 21 from the father. In an individual with Down syndrome, however, there are three
copies of chromosome 21 ( Figure 3.25). Therefore, Down syndrome is also known as Trisomy 21. These people
have 47 total chromosomes.

FIGURE 3.24
A child with Down syndrome.

FIGURE 3.25
Chromosomes of a person with Down
Syndrome. Notice the extra chromosome
21.

Another example of a chromosomal disorder is Klinefelter syndrome, in which a male inherits an extra “X”
chromosome. These individuals have an XXY genotype. They have underdeveloped sex organs and elongated
limbs. They also have difﬁculty learning new things.

197

3.17. Chromosomal Disorders

www.ck12.org

Outside of chromosome 21 and the sex chromosomes, most embryos with extra chromosomes do not usually survive.
Because chromosomes carry many, many genes, a disruption of a chromosome can cause severe problems with the
development of a fetus. Individuals with one (or more) fewer chromosome usually don’t survive either. Can you
explain why?

Damaged Chromosomes

Chromosomal disorders also occur when part of a chromosome becomes damaged. For example, if a tiny portion
of chromosome 5 is missing, the individual will have cri du chat (cat’s cry) syndrome. These individuals have
misshapen facial features, and the infant’s cry resembles a cat’s cry.

3.18 Recombinant DNA

• Deﬁne recombinant DNA.
• Summarize the steps of gene cloning.

Can we alter DNA?
You might think that DNA is stable and unchangeable. For the most part you are right. However, there are new
technologies that allow us to alter the DNA of humans and other organisms.

Recombinant DNA

Recombinant DNA is the combination of DNA from two different sources. For example, it is possible to place
a human gene into bacterial DNA. Recombinant DNA technology is useful in gene cloning and in identifying the
function of a gene.
Recombinant DNA technology can also be used to produce useful proteins, such as insulin. To treat diabetes, many
people need insulin. Previously, insulin had been taken from animals. Through recombinant DNA technology,
bacteria were created that carry the human gene which codes for the production of insulin. These bacteria become
tiny factories that produce this protein. Recombinant DNA technology helps create insulin so it can be used by
humans.
Recombinant DNA technology is used in gene cloning. A clone is an exact genetic copy. Genes are cloned for many
reasons, including use in medicine and in agriculture.
Below are the steps used to copy, or clone, a gene:

1. A gene or piece of DNA is put in a vector, or carrier molecule, producing a recombinant DNA molecule.
2. The vector is placed into a host cell, such as a bacterium.

200

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Molecular Biology and Genetics

3. The gene is copied (or cloned) inside of the bacterium. As the bacterial DNA is copied, so is the vector DNA.
As the bacteria divide, the recombinant DNA molecules are divided between the new cells. Over a 12- to
24-hour period, millions of copies of the cloned DNA are made.

4. The cloned DNA can produce a protein (like insulin) that can be used in medicine or in research.

Plasmids

Bacteria have small rings of DNA in the cytoplasm, called plasmids ( Figure 3.26). A plasmid is not part of the
bacterial chromosome, but an additional pieced of DNA. When putting foreign DNA into a bacterium, the plasmids
are often used as a vector. Viruses can also be used as vectors. The manipulation of the plasmid DNA, and then the
insertion of the recombinant plasmid into a bacterium, is an invaluable tool in scientiﬁc research.

FIGURE 3.26
This image shows a drawing of a plasmid.
The plasmid has two large segments and
one small segment depicted. The two
large segments (green and blue) indicate
antibiotic resistances usually used in a
screening procedure. The antibiotic resis-
tance segments ensure only bacteria with
the plasmid will grow. The small segment
(red) indicates an origin of replication.
The origin of replication is where DNA
replication starts, copying the plasmid.

• Recombinant DNA is the combination of DNA from two different sources.

3.19 Cloning

• Describe the process of animal cloning.
• Summarize the signiﬁcance of Dolly.

Would you like to clone yourself?
Although it’s illegal to clone humans in the United States, it is possible to clone many types of animals. What might
be the consequences if we allowed human cloning?

Cloning

Cloning is the process of creating an exact genetic replica of an organism. The clone’s DNA is exactly the same
as the parent’s DNA. Bacteria and other single-celled organisms have long been able to clone themselves through
asexual reproduction. Plants can also reproduce asexually. In animals, however, cloning does not happen naturally.
In 1997, that all changed when a sheep named Dolly was the ﬁrst large mammal ever to be successfully cloned.
Other animals can now also be cloned in a laboratory.
The process of producing an animal like Dolly starts with a single cell from the animal that is going to be cloned.
Below are the steps involved in the process of cloning:

203

3.19. Cloning

www.ck12.org

1. In the case of Dolly, cells from the mammary glands were taken from the adult that was to be cloned. But

other somatic cells can be used. Somatic cells come from the body and are not gametes like sperm or egg.

2. The nucleus is removed from this cell.
3. The nucleus is placed in a donor egg that has had its nucleus removed. The nucleus must be removed from the

donor egg to maintain the appropriate chromosome number.

4. The new cell is stimulated with an electric shock and embryo development begins, as if it were a normal

zygote. The zygote is the ﬁrst cell of a new organism.

5. The resulting embryo is implanted into a mother sheep, where it continue its development ( Figure 3.27).

FIGURE 3.27
To clone an animal, a nucleus from the
animal’s cells are fused with an egg cell
(from which the nucleus has been re-
moved) from a donor, creating a new zy-
gote.

Is Cloning Easy?

Cloning is not always successful. Most of the time, this cloning process does not result in a healthy adult animal.
The process has to be repeated many times until it works. In fact, 277 tries were needed to produce Dolly. This high
failure rate is one reason that human cloning is banned in the United States. In order to produce a cloned human,
many attempts would result in the surrogate mothers experiencing miscarriages, stillbirths, or deformities in the
infant. There are also many additional ethical considerations related to human cloning. Can you think of reasons
why people are for or against cloning?

3.20 Human Genome Project

• Explain the signiﬁcance of the Human Genome Project.

What is your genetic code?
The sequence of letters above represents bases in someone’s DNA. It is now possible to ﬁnd out a person’s entire
genetic code by determining all the bases in his or her DNA. What might be the beneﬁts?

Human Genome Project

A person’s genome is all of his or her genetic information. In other words, the human genome is all the information
that makes us human. And unless you have an identical twin, your genome is unique. No one else has a genome just
like yours, though all our genomes are similar.
The Human Genome Project ( Figure 3.28) was an international effort to sequence all 3 billion bases that make up
our DNA and to identify within this code more than 20,000 human genes. Scientists also completed a chromosome
map, identifying where the genes are located on each of the chromosomes. The Human Genome Project was
completed in 2003. Though the Human Genome Project is ﬁnished, analysis of the data will continue for many
years. To say the Human Genome Project has been beneﬁcial to mankind would be an understatement.
Exciting applications of the Human Genome Project include the following:

• The genetic basis for many diseases can be more easily determined. Now there are tests for over 1,000 genetic

disorders.

• The technologies developed during this effort, and since the completion of this project, will reduce the cost of
sequencing a person’s genome. This may eventually allow many people to sequence their individual genome.

• Analysis of your own genome could determine if you are at risk for speciﬁc diseases.

3.21 Gene Therapy

• Deﬁne gene therapy.
• Describe gene therapy.
• Distinguish in vivo gene therapy from ex vivo gene therapy.

Can doctors ﬁx your DNA?
There are many genetic disorders that are due to a single gene. What if we could ﬁx this faulty gene? With the
development of gene therapy, that may eventually be possible for many types of genetic disorders.

Gene Therapy

Gene therapy is the insertion of genes into a person’s cells to cure a genetic disorder. Could gene therapy be the cure
for AIDS? No, AIDS is caused by a virus. Gene therapy only works to ﬁx disorders caused by a faulty gene. The
patient would have had this disorder from birth. Though gene therapy is still in experimental stages, the common
use of this therapy may occur during your lifetime.
There are two main types of gene therapy:

1. One done inside the body ( in vivo).
2. One done outside the body ( ex vivo).

Both types of gene therapy use a vector, or carrier molecule for the gene. The vector helps incorporate the desired
gene into the patient’s DNA. Usually this vector is modiﬁed viral DNA in which the viral genes have been removed.
Don’t worry, the virus used in gene therapy has been deactivated.

209

3.21. Gene Therapy

In Vivo Gene Therapy

www.ck12.org

During in vivo gene therapy, done inside the body, the vector with the gene of interest is introduced directly into the
patient and taken up by the patient’s cells ( Figure 3.29). For example, cystic ﬁbrosis gene therapy is targeted at
the respiratory system, so a solution with the vector can be sprayed into the patient’s nose. Recently, in vivo gene
therapy was also used to partially restore the vision of three young adults with a rare type of eye disease.

FIGURE 3.29
During gene therapy, adenovirus is a pos-
sible vector to carry the desired gene and
insert it into the patient’s DNA. A deacti-
vated virus makes a useful vector for this
purpose.

In ex vivo gene therapy, done outside the body, cells are removed from the patient and the proper gene is inserted
using a virus as a vector. The modiﬁed cells are placed back into the patient.
One of the ﬁrst uses of this type of gene therapy was in the treatment of a young girl with a rare genetic disease,
adenosine deaminase deﬁciency, or ADA deﬁciency. People with this disorder are missing the ADA enzyme, which
breaks down a toxin called deoxyadenosine. If the toxin is not broken down, it accumulates and destroys immune
cells. As a result, individuals with ADA deﬁciency do not have a healthy immune system to ﬁght off infections. In
the gene therapy treatment for this disorder, bone marrow stem cells were taken from the girl’s body, and the missing
gene was inserted into these cells outside the body. Then the modiﬁed cells were put back into her bloodstream.
This treatment successfully restored the function of her immune system, but only with repeated treatments.

Summary

• Gene therapy, the insertion of genes into a person’s cells to cure a genetic disorder, can be ex vivo (outside the

body) or in vivo (inside the body).

• Gene therapy is still in the experimental stages, but some trials have been successful.

Biotechnology in Agriculture

Biotechnology is changing the genetic makeup of living things to make a useful product. Biotechnology has
led scientists to develop useful applications in agriculture and food science. These include the development of
transgenic crops.
In transgenic crops, genes are placed into plants to give the crop a beneﬁcial trait. Beneﬁts
include:

• Improved yield from crops.
• Increased resistance of crops to environmental stresses.
• Increased nutritional qualities of food crops.
• Improved taste, texture or appearance of food.
• Reduced dependence on fertilizers, insecticides, and other chemicals.

Crops are obviously dependent on environmental conditions. Drought can destroy crop yields, as can too much rain
and ﬂoods. But what if crops could be developed to withstand these harsh conditions?
Biotechnology will allow the development of crops containing genes that will help them to withstand harsh condi-
tions. For example, drought and salty soil are two signiﬁcant factors affecting how well crops grow. But there are
crops that can withstand these harsh conditions. Why? Probably because of that plant’s genetics. So scientists are
studying plants that can cope with these extreme conditions. They hope to identify and isolate the genes that control
these beneﬁcial traits. The genes could then be transferred into more desirable crops, with the hope of producing the
same traits in those crops.
Thale cress ( Figure 3.30), a species of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), is a tiny weed that has been extensively
studied. It is often used for plant research because it is very easy to grow, and its DNA has been mapped. Scientists
have identiﬁed a gene from this plant, At-DBF2, that gives the plant resistance to some environmental stresses.
When this gene is inserted into tomato and tobacco cells, the cells were able to withstand environmental stresses
like salt, drought, cold, and heat far better than ordinary cells. If these results prove successful in larger trials, then
At-DBF2 genes could help in engineering crops that can better withstand harsh environments.

Summary

Molecular Biology and Genetics focuses on DNA and how proteins are made, and how genetic information is passed
from one generation to the next. DNA is the genetic material, which is the material passed from parents to offspring.
It also contains the information used to make RNA. RNA leaves the nucleus and, together with a ribosome, makes
proteins. Beginning with Mendel’s pea plants, genetics has become one of the most important ﬁelds of biology.
Human genetics affects many, if not every, ﬁeld of medicine. Technologies associated with genetics are involved in
developing products to make our lives better but have raised a number of ethical, legal, and social issues.

Introduction

Do dinosaurs prove evolution?
For millions of years dinosaurs roamed and dominated the planet. Then 65 million years ago, they went extinct.
It’s hard to argue that dinosaurs did not exist. Where did they come from? Where are they now? Evolution is the
"change in species over time."

4.1 Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection

• Deﬁne evolution.
• Describe the signiﬁcance of the voyage of the HMS Beagle.
• Summarize Darwin’s ﬁnding on the Galápagos Islands.

Where in the world is this?
This picture was taken in the Galápagos Islands, which is off the west coast of South America. The Galápagos
Islands are home to many unique organisms, such as these tree-like cacti. Darwin’s observations on these islands led
to his development of the theory of evolution.

Darwin’s Theory of Evolution

Do you ever wonder why some birds are big like ostriches and some birds are small like robins? Or why a lion has
a mane while a leopard has spots? In the 19th century, an English natural scientist named Charles Darwin ( Figure
4.1) was also fascinated by the diversity of life on Earth.
He set out to answer the following questions:

• Why are organisms different?
• Why are organisms similar?
• Why are there so many different types of organisms?

To answer his questions, he developed what we now call "the theory of evolution by natural selection." This theory
is one of the most important theories in the ﬁeld of life science. In everyday English, "evolution" simply means
"change." In biology, evolution states that all living organisms came from earlier forms of life. The theory of
evolution by natural selection explains why evolution occurs. Darwin spent over 20 years traveling around the world
and making observations before he fully developed his theory.

today.

Voyage of the

In 1859, Charles Darwin published his book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (often known
as The Origin of Species). His book describes the observations and evidence that he collected more than 20 years of
research, beginning with a ﬁve-year voyage around the world on a British research ship, the HMS Beagle. During
the voyage ( Figure 4.2), Darwin made observations about plants and animals around the world. He also collected
specimens to study for when he returned to England.
Each time the HMS Beagle stopped at a port, Darwin went on land to explore and look at the local plants, animals,
and fossils. One of the most important things Darwin did was keep a diary. He took detailed notes and made
drawings of his observations.

FIGURE 4.2
Charles Darwin’s famous ﬁve year voyage
was aboard the HMS Beagle from 1831-
1836.

The Galápagos Islands

While the crew of the HMS Beagle mapped the coastline of South America, they traveled to a group of islands called
the Galápagos. The Galápagos are a group of 16 volcanic islands near the equator, about 600 miles from the west
coast of South America. Darwin spent months on foot exploring the islands. The specimens he collected from the

Chapter 4. Evolution

Galápagos and sent back to England greatly inﬂuenced his ideas of evolution ( Figure 4.3).

FIGURE 4.3
The Galápagos Islands are a group of 16
volcanic islands 600 miles off the west
coast of South America.
The islands
are famous for their many species found
nowhere else.
It was on these islands
where Darwin began to develop his theory
of evolution.

On the Galápagos, Darwin observed that the same kind of animal differed from one island to another. For example,
the iguanas (large lizards) differed between islands ( Figure 4.4). The members of one iguana species spent most of
their time in the ocean, swimming and diving underwater for seaweed, while those of another iguana species lived
on land and ate cactus. Darwin wondered why there were two species of iguanas on the same set of islands that were
so different from one another. What do you think?

FIGURE 4.4
The Galápagos iguanas are among the
signature animals of the Galápagos Is-
lands. Here both a land iguana and a
marine iguana are shown.

Giant Tortoises

Darwin also observed giant tortoises on the Galápagos ( Figure 4.5). These tortoises were so large that two people
could ride on them. Darwin noticed that different tortoise species lived on islands with different environments. He
realized that the tortoises had traits that allowed them to live in their particular environments. For example, tortoises
that ate plants near the ground had rounded shells and shorter necks. Tortoises on islands with tall shrubs had longer
necks and shells that bent upward, allowing them to stretch their necks ( Figure 4.5). Darwin began to hypothesize
that organisms developed traits over time because of differences in their environments. Darwin began to think that
organisms evolved adaptations that allowed them to live in their environment. These adaptations were beneﬁcial
traits for their environment.

The name “Galápagos” means “giant tor-
toise.” When Darwin arrived on the Galá-
pagos Islands, he was amazed by the
size and variety of shapes of these ani-
mals. The giant tortoise (left) is a unique
animal found only in the Galápagos Is-
lands. There are only about 200 tortoises
remaining on these islands. This Pinta
Island tortoise (right) is able to reach
leaves high in shrubs with its long neck
and curved shell.

Darwin’s Finches

The most studied animals on the Galápagos are ﬁnches, a type of bird ( Figure 4.6). When Darwin ﬁrst observed
ﬁnches on the islands, he did not even realize they were all ﬁnches. But when he studied them further, he realized
they were related to each other. Each island had its own distinct species of ﬁnch. The birds on different islands had
many similarities, but their beaks differed in size and shape.

FIGURE 4.6
Four of Darwin’s ﬁnch species from the
Galápagos Islands. The birds came from
the same ﬁnch ancestor. They evolved as
they adapted to different food resources
on different islands. The ﬁrst bird uses
its large beak to crack open and eat large
seeds. Bird #3 is able to pull small seeds
out of small spaces.

In his diary, Darwin pointed out how each animal is well-suited for its particular environment. The shapes of the
ﬁnch beaks on each island were well-matched with the seeds available on that island, but not the seeds on other
islands. For example, a larger and stronger beak was needed to break open large seeds on one island, and a small
beak was needed to eat the small seeds on a different island.

www.ck12.org

4.2 Inﬂuences on Darwin

• Explain how Lamarck, Lyell, and Wallace inﬂuenced Darwin’s work.

How old is Earth?
Earth is now believed to be over 4.5 billion years old. But during Darwin’s time, most people believed that the Earth
was only about 6,000 years old. If Darwin hadn’t learned about the work of geologists that suggested that the Earth
was much older, he might have never have developed his theory of evolution.

Darwin’s Inﬂuences

When Darwin returned to England ﬁve years later, in 1836, at the end of his voyage, he did not rush to announce
his discoveries. Unlike other naturalists before him, Darwin did not want to present any ideas unless he had
strong evidence supporting them. Instead, once Darwin returned to England, he spent over twenty years examining
specimens, talking with other scientists and collecting more information before he presented his theories.
Some of Darwin’s ideas conﬂicted with widely held beliefs, including those from religious leaders. At that time,
many people believed that organisms never change and never go extinct, and that the world was only about 6,000
years old, always existing in the same way, never changing. These beliefs delayed Darwin in presenting his ﬁndings.
How did Darwin come up with his theories? Charles Darwin was inﬂuenced by the ideas of several people.

1. Before the voyage of the Beagle, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed the idea that species change over time.

222

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Evolution

However, Darwin differed with Lamarck on several key points. Lamarck proposed that traits acquired during
one’s lifetime could be passed to the next generation. Darwin did not agree with this.

2. The ﬁndings of Charles Lyell, a well-known geologist, also inﬂuenced Darwin. Lyell’s writings taught
Darwin about geology, paleontology, and the changing Earth. Lyell’s ﬁndings suggested the Earth must be
much older than 6,000 years. And the evolution of life, as Darwin was developing his ideas, would deﬁnitely
take much longer than just 6,000 years. During the Voyage of the Beagle, Darwin observed fossils of sea life
high up in the mountains. What must happen to the Earth for this to occur? Darwin, using the readings of
Lyell, took this as evidence of a constantly changing Earth.

3. After the Voyage of the Beagle, another naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace ( Figure 4.7), developed a similar
theory of evolution by natural selection. Wallace toured South America and made similar observations to
Darwin’s. Darwin and Wallace presented their theories and evidence in public together. Due to the large
number of observations and conclusions he made, Darwin is mostly credited and associated with this theory.

FIGURE 4.7
Alfred Wallace developed a similar theory of evolution by natural selection.

Imagine developing a theory that conﬂicted with widely held beliefs of the time, as Darwin did. Imagine pulling
together material from all these different people, adding his own ﬁndings, and turning it all into his theory. Imag-
ine the torment Darwin must have endured during this time, knowing the skepticism that would follow the release
of his ﬁndings. But, upon his death, Darwin was given one of the highest honors in England. Darwin is buried in
Westminster Abbey, the ﬁnal resting place of many of England’s kings and queens. Why was he buried in such an
important spot?

Summary

• Deﬁne natural selection.
• Explain the relationship between adaptations and natural selection.
• Describe when natural selection occurs.
• Explain the relationship between evolution and natural selection.

How is this deer mouse well adapted for life in the forest?
Notice how its dark coloring would allow the deer mouse to easily hide from predators on the darkened forest ﬂoor.
On the other hand, deer mice that live in the nearby Sand Hills are a lighter, sand-like color. What caused the deer
mice to be so well adapted to their unique environments? Natural selection.

Natural Selection

The theory of evolution by natural selection means that the inherited traits of a population change over time.
Inherited traits are features that are passed from one generation to the next. For example, your eye color is an
inherited trait. You inherited your eye color from your parents. Inherited traits are different from acquired traits, or
traits that organisms develop over a lifetime, such as strong muscles from working out ( Figure 4.8).
Natural selection explains how organisms in a population develop traits that allow them to survive and reproduce.
Natural selection means that traits that offer an advantage will most likely be passed on to offspring; individuals with
those traits have a better chance of surviving. Evolution occurs by natural selection.
Take the giant tortoises on the Galápagos Islands as an example. If a short-necked tortoise lives on an island with
fruit located at a high level, will the short-necked tortoise survive? No, it will not, because it will not be able to
reach the food it needs to survive. If all of the short necked tortoises die, and the long-necked tortoises survive, then,

4.3. Natural Selection

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 4.8
Human earlobes may be attached or free.
You inherited the particular shape of your
earlobes from your parents.
Inherited
traits are inﬂuenced by genes, which are
passed on to offspring and future genera-
tions. Things not inﬂuenced by genes are
not passed on to your offspring. Natural
selection only operates on traits like ear-
lobe shape that have a genetic basis, not
on traits that are acquired, like a summer
tan.

over time, only the long-necked trait will be passed down to offspring. All of the tortoises with long-necks will be
"naturally selected" to survive. Organisms that are not well-adapted, for whatever reason, to their environment, will
naturally have less of a chance of surviving and reproducing.
Every plant and animal depends on its traits to survive. Survival may include getting food, building homes, and
attracting mates. Traits that allow a plant, animal, or other organism to survive and reproduce in its environment are
called adaptations.
Natural selection occurs when:

1. There is some variation in the inherited traits of organisms within a species. Without this variation, natural

selection would not be possible.

2. Some of these traits will give individuals an advantage over others in surviving and reproducing.
3. These individuals will be likely to have more offspring.

Imagine how in the Arctic, dark fur makes a rabbit easy for foxes to spot and catch in the snow. Therefore, white fur
is a beneﬁcial trait that improves the chance that a rabbit will survive, reproduce, and pass the trait of white fur on to
its offspring ( Figure 4.9). Through this process of natural selection, dark fur rabbits will become uncommon over
time. Rabbits will adapt to have white fur. In essence, the selection of rabbits with white fur - the beneﬁcial trait - is
a natural process.

Why So Many Species?

Scientists estimate that there are between 5 million and 30 million species on the planet. But why are there so many?
Different species are well-adapted to live and survive in many different types of environments. As environments
change over time, organisms must constantly adapt to those environments. Diversity of species increases the chance
that at least some organisms adapt and survive any major changes in the environment. For example, if a natural
disaster kills all of the large organisms on the planet, then the small organisms will continue to survive.

Summary

• Evolution occurs by natural selection, the process by which organisms with traits that better enable them
to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Evolution is due to
differences in the survival and reproduction of individuals within a population.

4.4 Fossils

• Deﬁne fossil.
• Explain radiometric dating.
• Discuss the signiﬁcance of the fossil record as evidence for evolution.

What’s on this rock?
This rock contains a portion of a fossilized tree fern. Scientists study fossils of plants, animals, and other organisms
in order to better understand what life was like on Earth many years ago and how it has changed over time. Fossils
are important evidence for the theory of evolution.

The Fossil Record

Fossils are the preserved remains of animals, plants, and other organisms from the distant past. Examples of fossils
include bones, teeth, and impressions. By studying fossils, evidence for evolution is revealed. Paleontologists are
scientists who study fossils to learn about life in the past. Fossils allow these scientists to determine the features
of extinct species. Paleontologists compare the features of species from different periods in history. With this
information, they try to understand how species have evolved over millions of years ( Figure below).
Until recently, fossils were the main source of evidence for evolution ( Figure below). Through studying fossils, we
now know that today’s organisms look much different in many cases than those that were alive in the past. Scientists
have also shown that organisms were spread out differently across the planet. Earthquakes, volcanoes, shifting seas,
and other movements of the continents have all affected where organisms live and how they adapted to their changing
environments.

the transformation of the leg bones from

horse.

Rock Layers and the Age of Fossils

There are many layers of rock in the Earth’s surface. Newer layers form on top of the older layers; the deepest rock
layers are the oldest. Therefore, you can tell how old a fossil is by observing in which layer of rock it was found.
The fossils and the order in which fossils appear is called the fossil record. The fossil record provides evidence
for when organisms lived on Earth, how species evolved, and how some species have gone extinct. Geologists
use a method called radiometric dating to determine the exact age of rocks and fossils in each layer of rock.

About 25 to 40 million years ago these insects were trapped in a gooey
substance, called resin, that comes from trees. The fossils in the movie
Jurassic Park were trapped in resin.

This technique, which is possible because radioactive materials decay at a known rate, measures how much of the
radioactive materials in each rock layer have broken down ( Figure 4.12).

FIGURE 4.12
This device, called a spectrophotometer,
can be used to measure the level of
radioactive decay of certain elements in
rocks and fossils to determine their age.

Radiometric dating has been used to determine that the oldest known rocks on Earth are between 4 and 5 billion
years old. The oldest fossils are between 3 and 4 billion years old. Remember that during Darwin’s time, people
believed the Earth was just about 6,000 years old. The fossil record proves that Earth is much older than people once
thought.

Summary

• Fossils, or preserved parts of organisms from the distant past, have shown that species change over time.
• Radiometric dating can be used to determine the age of fossils by measuring the how much of the radioactive

materials in each rock layer have broken down.

4.5 Structural Evidence for Evolution

• Explain the evolutionary meaning of having a common ancestor.
• Discuss how vestigial structures and embryology support evolution theory.

Why do you have a tail bone?
If you look closely at a skeleton, you might notice a triangular bone at the end of the spinal column. This is your
tailbone. Why would you have a tailbone when you don’t have a tail? You have a tailbone because your ancient
ancestors did have a tail. These sorts of "left-over" structures support the theory of evolution.

232

www.ck12.org

Structural Evidence

Chapter 4. Evolution

Even though two different species may not look similar, they may have similar internal structures that suggest they
have a common ancestor. That means both evolved from the same ancestor organism a long time ago. Common
ancestry can also be determined by looking at the structure of the organism as it ﬁrst develops.

Vestigial Structures

Some of the most interesting kinds of evidence for evolution are body parts that have lost their use through evolution
( Figure 4.13). For example, most birds need their wings to ﬂy. But the wings of an ostrich have lost their original
use. Structures that have lost their use through evolution are called vestigial structures. They provide evidence for
evolution because they suggest that an organism changed from using the structure to not using the structure, or using
it for a different purpose.
Penguins do not use their wings, known as ﬂippers, to ﬂy in the air. However, they do use them to move in the water.
The theory of evolution suggests that penguins evolved to use their wings for a different purpose. A whale’s pelvic
bones, which were once attached to legs, are also vestigial structures. Whales are descended from land-dwelling
ancestors that had legs.
Homologous structures are structures that have a common function and suggest common ancestry. For example,
homologous structures include the limbs of mammals, such as bats, lions, whales, and humans, which all have a
common ancestor. Different mammals may use their limbs for walking, running, swimming or ﬂying. The method
the mammal uses to move is considered a common function.

FIGURE 4.13
Moles live underground where they do
not need eyes to ﬁnd their way around.
This mole’s eyes are covered by skin.
Body parts that do not serve their original
function are vestigial structures.

Similar Embryos

Some of the oldest evidence of evolution comes from embryology, the study of how organisms develop. An embryo
is an animal or plant in its earliest stages of development. This means looking at a plant or animal before it is born
or hatched. Centuries ago, people recognized that the embryos of many different species have similar appearances.
The embryos of some species are even difﬁcult to tell apart. Many of these animals do not differ much in appearance
until they develop further.
Some unexpected traits can appear in animal embryos. For example, human embryos have gill slits just like ﬁsh! In
ﬁsh they develop into gills, but in humans they disappear before birth. The presence of the gill slits suggests that a
long time ago humans and ﬁsh shared a common ancestor.

233

4.5. Structural Evidence for Evolution

www.ck12.org

The similarities between embryos suggests that these animals are related and have common ancestors. For example,
humans did not evolve from chimpanzees. But the similarities between the embryos of both species suggest that we
have an ancestor in common with chimpanzees. As our common ancestor evolved, humans and chimpanzees went
down different evolutionary paths and developed different traits.

Summary

• Vestigial structures, or structures that have lost their use through evolution, are important evidence of evolu-

tion.

• Studying the embryos of organisms also provides evidence that two very different animals could have de-

scended from a common ancestor.

4.6 Molecular Evidence for Evolution

• Describe molecular clocks.
• Explain the molecular evidence for evolution.

How similar are you to a chimpanzee?
Chimpanzees and humans turn out to be very similar—if you look at their DNA. When scientists determined the
entire genetic code of both humans and chimpanzees, they found that we have over 98% identical DNA.

Molecular Evidence

Arguably, some of the best evidence of evolution comes from examining the molecules and DNA found in all living
things.
Beginning in the 1940s, scientists studying molecules and DNA have conﬁrmed conclusions about evolution drawn
from other forms of evidence. Molecular clocks are used to determine how closely two species are related by
calculating the number of differences between the species’ DNA sequences or amino acid sequences. These clocks
are sometimes called gene clocks or evolutionary clocks. The fewer the differences, the less time since the species
split from each other and began to evolve into different species ( Figure 4.14).

235

4.6. Molecular Evidence for Evolution

www.ck12.org

A chicken and a gorilla will have more differences between their DNA and amino acid sequences than a gorilla and
an orangutan. That means the chicken and gorilla had a common ancestor a very long time ago, while the gorilla and
orangutan shared a more recent common ancestor. This provides additional evidence that the gorilla and orangutan
are more closely related than the gorilla and the chicken. Which pair of organisms would have more molecular
differences, a mammal and a bird, a mammal and a frog, or a mammal and a ﬁsh?
On the other hand, animals may look similar but can have very different DNA sequences and evolutionary ancestry.
Which would have more DNA sequences in common, a whale and a horse, or a whale and a shark?

FIGURE 4.14
Almost all organisms are made from DNA
with the same building blocks.
The
genomes (all of the genes in an organism)
of all mammals are almost identical.

The genomes, or all the DNA sequences of all the genes of an organism, have been determined for many different
organisms. The comparison of genomes provides new information about the relationships among species and how
evolution occurs ( Figure 4.15).
Molecular evidence for evolution also includes:

1. The same biochemical building blocks, such as amino acids and nucleotides, are found in all organisms, from
bacteria to plants and animals. Recall that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and nucleotides are
the building blocks of DNA and RNA.

2. DNA and RNA determine the development of all organisms.
3. The similarities and differences between the genomes conﬁrm patterns of evolution.

Summary

• Molecular clocks are used to determine how closely two species are related by calculating the number of

differences between the species’ DNA sequences or amino acid sequences.

• Molecular evidence for evolution includes that all living things share the same biochemical building blocks.

4.7 Microevolution and Macroevolution

• Deﬁne microevolution and macroevolution.
• Distinguish between microevolution and macroevolution.

Why do pesticides sometimes stop working?
Pesticides were designed to kill bothersome insects. However, sometimes these pesticides will stop working. A
pesticide that has worked in the past may no longer kill a particular type of insect. This is due to the development of
resistance in the population of insects. The development of resistance to pesticides is one example of microevolution,
a small change in a population.

Microevolution and Macroevolution

Does evolution only happen gradually through small changes? Or is it possible that drastic environmental changes
can cause new species to evolve? Or can both small and large changes occur?
Evolutionary changes can be both big and small. Some evolutionary changes do not create new species, but result in
changes at the population level. A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area

239

4.7. Microevolution and Macroevolution

www.ck12.org

( Figure 4.16). But what exactly is the deﬁnition of a species? A species is a group of organisms that have similar
characteristics (they are genetically similar) and can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring.

FIGURE 4.16
This school of ﬁsh are considered mem-
bers of the same species because they
are able to mate with one another. They
are also considered a population because
they live in the same part of the ocean.

Microevolution

You already know that evolution is the change in species over time. Most evolutionary changes are small and do
not lead to the creation of a new species. When populations change in small ways over time, the process is called
microevolution. Microevolution results in changes within a species.
An example of microevolution is the evolution of mosquitoes that cannot be killed by pesticides, called pesticide-
resistant mosquitoes. Imagine that you have a pesticide that kills most of the mosquitoes in your state. Through a
random mutation, some of the mosquitoes have resistance to the pesticide. As a result of the widespread use of this
pesticide, most of the remaining mosquitoes are the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes. When these mosquitoes repro-
duce the next year, they produce more mosquitoes with the pesticide-resistant trait. Soon, most of the mosquitoes in
your state are resistant to the pesticide.
This is an example of microevolution because the number of mosquitoes with this trait changed. However, this
evolutionary change did not create a new species of mosquito because the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes can still
reproduce with other non-pesticide-resistant mosquitoes.

Macroevolution

Macroevolution refers to much bigger evolutionary changes that result in new species. Macroevolution may happen:

1. When microevolution occurs repeatedly over a long period of time and leads to the creation of a new species.
2. As a result of a major environmental change, such as a volcanic eruption, earthquake, or an asteroid hitting
Earth, which changes the environment so much that natural selection leads to large changes in the traits of a
species.

After thousands of years of isolation from each other, Darwin’s ﬁnch populations have experienced both microevo-
lution and macroevolution. These ﬁnch populations cannot breed with other ﬁnch populations when they are brought
together. Since they do not breed together, they are classiﬁed as separate species.

4.8 Evolution Acts on the Phenotype

• Deﬁne carrier.
• Explain how an unfavorable allele is kept in the gene pool.

Would albinism be an advantage?
This rabbit is albino, meaning it lacks pigment in its skin, fur, and eyes. The same thing happens in other species,
including humans. To most animals albinism would be a disadvantage since they need to blend into their environment
to avoid predators or catch prey. How, then, does the gene that causes albinism stay in the gene pool?

Evolution Acts on the Phenotype

Natural selection acts on the phenotype (the traits or characteristics) of an individual. On the other hand, natural
selection does not act on the underlying genotype (the genetic makeup) of an individual. For many traits, the
homozygous genotype, AA, for example, has the same phenotype as the heterozygous Aa genotype. If both an AA
and Aa individual have the same phenotype, the environment cannot distinguish between them. So natural selection
cannot select for a homozygous individual over a heterozygous individual. Even if the "aa" phenotype is lethal,
the recessive a allele, will be maintained in the population through heterozygous Aa individuals. Furthermore,
the mating of two heterozygous individuals can produce homozygous recessive (aa) individuals. However, natural
selection can and does differentiate between dominant and recessive phenotypes.

Carriers

Since natural selection acts on the phenotype, if an allele causes death in a homozygous individual, aa, for example,
it will not cause death in a heterozygous Aa individual. These heterozygous Aa individuals will then act as carriers

Chapter 4. Evolution

of the a allele, meaning that the a allele could be passed down to offspring. People who are carriers do not express
the recessive phenotype, as they have a dominant allele. This allele is said to be kept in the population’s gene pool.
The gene pool is the complete set of genes and alleles within a population.
For example, Tay-Sachs disease is a recessive human genetic disorder. That means only individuals with the
homozygous recessive genotype, rr will be affected. Affected individuals usually die from complications of the
disease in early childhood, at an age too young to reproduce. The two parents are each heterozygous (Rr) for the
Tay-Sachs gene; they will not die in childhood and will be carriers of the disease gene. This deadly allele is kept in
the gene pool even though it does not help humans adapt to their environment. This happens because evolution acts
on the phenotype, not the genotype ( Figure 4.17).

FIGURE 4.17
Tay-Sachs disease is inherited in the au-
tosomal recessive pattern. Each parent is
an unaffected carrier of the lethal allele.

Summary

• Natural selection acts on the phenotype (the traits or characteristics) of an individual, not on the underlying

genotype.

• Carriers of a trait can show no symptoms of a recessive disease and, yet, still pass it on to their offspring.

4.9 Hardy-Weinberg Theorem

• Deﬁne genetic equilibrium.
• List the ﬁve conditions necessary for genetic equilibrium.
• Explain the Hardy-Weinberg model.

Can these stones keep balance indeﬁnitely?
If balance, or equilibrium, is to be maintained, there must be no outside inﬂuences on the stones. Equilibrium can
also be maintained within a population’s genes; that means, no evolution can occur. But outside inﬂuences usually
prevent equilibrium from staying established.

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

Sometimes understanding how common a gene is within a population is necessary. Or, more speciﬁcally, you may
want to know how common a certain form of that gene is within the population, such as a recessive form. This can
be done using the Hardy-Weinberg model, but it can only be done if the frequencies of the genes are not changing.
The Hardy-Weinberg model describes how a population can remain at genetic equilibrium, referred to as the
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic equilibrium occurs when there is no evolution within the population. In other
words, the frequency of alleles (variants of a gene) will be the same from one generation to another. At genetic
equilibrium, the gene or allele frequencies are stable—they do not change. For example, let’s assume that red hair
is determined by the inheritance of a gene with two alleles—R and r. The dominant allele, R, encodes for non-red
hair, while the recessive allele, r, encodes for red hair. If a population’s gene pool contains 90% R and 10% r alleles,
then the next generation would also have 90% R and 10% r alleles. However, this only works under a strict set of
conditions.

245

4.9. Hardy-Weinberg Theorem

www.ck12.org

The ﬁve conditions that must be met for genetic equilibrium to occur include:

1. No mutation (change) in the DNA sequence.
2. No migration (moving into or out of a population).
3. A very large population size.
4. Random mating.
5. No natural selection.

These ﬁve conditions rarely occur in nature. When one or more of the conditions does not exist, then evolution can
occur. As a result, allele frequencies are constantly changing, and populations are constantly evolving. As mutations
and natural selection occur frequently in nature, it is difﬁcult for a population to be at genetic equilibrium.
The Hardy-Weinberg model also serves a mathematical formula used to predict allele frequencies in a population at
genetic equilibrium. If you know the allele frequencies of one generation, you can use this formula to predict the
next generation. Again, this only works if all ﬁve conditions are being met in a population.

Summary

• If a population stays at genetic equilibrium, then no evolution takes place.
• The Hardy-Weinberg model states that a population will remain at genetic equilibrium as long as ﬁve condi-
tions are met: (1) No change in the DNA sequence, (2) No migration, (3) A very large population size, (4)
Random mating, and (5) No natural selection.

4.10 Origin of Species

• Deﬁne speciation.
• Describe artiﬁcial selection.
• Summarize outcomes of reproductive isolation.
• Distinguish allopatric speciation from sympatric speciation.

Where did this diversity of life come from?
If you have ever been to the beach, then you realize there is not just one species of marine life. The wide variety of
shells that wash up on the beach indicate that there are many forms of life in the ocean. This wide diversity of life
requires that many new species have appeared over time. But how does a new species come into being?

The Origin of Species

The creation of a new species is called speciation. Most new species develop naturally. But humans have also
artiﬁcially created new breeds and species for thousands of years.
New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection. Due to natural selection, organisms with
traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers.
Natural selection causes beneﬁcial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable
traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneﬁcial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves
high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneﬁcial trait to become more common than short necks.
As new changes in the DNA sequence are constantly being generated in a population’s gene pool (changing the
population’s allele frequencies), some of these changes will be beneﬁcial and result in traits that allow adaptation
and survival. Natural selection causes evolution of a species as these beneﬁcial traits become more common within a

247

4.10. Origin of Species

www.ck12.org

population. Evolution can occur within a species without completely resulting in a new species. Therefore, evolution
and speciation are not the same.

Artiﬁcial Selection

Artiﬁcial selection occurs when humans select which plants or animals to breed in order to pass on speciﬁc traits
to the next generation. For example, a farmer may choose to breed only cows that produce the best milk. Farmers
would also avoid breeding cows that produce less milk. In this way, selective breeding of the cows would increase
milk quality and quantity.
Humans have also artiﬁcially bred dogs to create new breeds ( Figure 4.18).

FIGURE 4.18
Artiﬁcial Selection: Humans used artiﬁcial
selection to create these different breeds.
Both dog breeds are descended from the
same wolves, and their genes are almost
identical.

Reproductive Isolation

There are two main ways that speciation happens naturally. Both processes create new species by reproductively
isolating populations of the same species from each other. Organisms can be geographically isolated or isolated by
a behavior. Either way, they will no longer be able to mate. Over a long period of time, usually thousands of years,
each of the isolated populations evolves in a different direction, forming distinct species.
How do you think scientists test whether two populations are separate species? They bring species from two
populations back together again. If the two populations do not mate and produce fertile offspring, they are separate
species.

Geographic Isolation

Allopatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species are geographically isolated for long periods.
Imagine all the ways that plants or animals could be isolated from each other:

• Emergence of a mountain range.
• Formation of a canyon.
• New rivers or streams.

Here are two examples of allopatric speciation:

248

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Evolution

• Darwin observed thirteen distinct ﬁnch species on the Galápagos Islands that had evolved from the same
ancestor. Different ﬁnch populations lived on separate islands with different environments. They evolved to
best adapt to those particular environments. Later, scientists were able to determine which ﬁnches had evolved
into distinct species by bringing members of each population together. The birds that could not mate were a
separate species.

• When the Grand Canyon in Arizona formed, two populations of one squirrel species were separated by the
giant canyon. After thousands of years of isolation from each other, the squirrel populations on the northern
wall of the canyon looked and behaved differently from those on the southern wall ( Figure 4.19). North rim
squirrels have white tails and black bellies. Squirrels on the south rim have white bellies and dark tails. They
cannot mate with each other, so they are different species.

FIGURE 4.19
Abert squirrel (left) on the southern rim
of the Grand Canyon. Kaibab squirrel
(right) found on northern rim of the Grand
Canyon.

Isolation without Physical Separation

Sympatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species stop mating because of something other than
physical or geographic separation. The behavior of two groups that live in the same region is an example of such
separation. The separation may be caused by different mating seasons, for example. Sympatric speciation is more
difﬁcult to identify.
Here are two examples of sympatric speciation:

• Some scientists suspect that two groups of orcas (killer whales) live in the same part of the Paciﬁc Ocean part
of the year but do not mate. The two groups hunt different prey species, eat different foods, sing different
songs, and have different social interactions ( Figure 4.20).

• Two groups of Galápagos Island ﬁnch species lived in the same space, but each had his or her own distinct
mating signals. Members of each group selected mates according to different beak structures and bird calls.
The behavioral differences kept the groups separated until they formed different species.

Summary

• Speciation, the creation of a new species, can happen through natural selection or artiﬁcial selection.
• Reproductive isolation is necessary for speciation to occur, and this can happen through a geographic barrier

(allopatric speciation) or without a geographic barrier (sympatric speciation).

• Different behaviors can result in sympatric speciation.

4.11 Tracing Evolution

• Explain the rate of evolution.
• Describe an evolutionary tree.

Can you watch evolution happening?
Usually evolutionary changes occur at a very slow pace. Human evolution took millions of years. However,
sometimes evolution can also happen quite quickly.

Tracing Evolution

How fast is evolution? Can you actually see evolution happening within your lifetime? Usually evolution takes a
long time. So how can we visualize how it has happened?

Rates of Evolution

How long did it take for the giraffe to develop a long neck? How long did it take for the Galápagos ﬁnches to
evolve? How long did it take for whales to evolve from land mammals? These, and other questions about the rate of
evolution, are difﬁcult to answer.
The rate of evolution depends on how many of an organism’s genes have changed over a period of time. Evolution
is usually so gradual that we do not see the change for many, many generations. The rate of evolution also depends
on the generation time of a particular species.
Not all organisms evolve at the same rate. Humans took millions of years to evolve from a mammal that is now
extinct. It is very difﬁcult to observe evolution in humans. However, there are organisms that are evolving so fast
that you can observe evolution! A human takes about 22 years to go through one generation. But some bacteria go
through over a thousand generations in less than two months. Some bacteria go through many generations in a few
days. And sometimes a bacterial generation is as fast as 20 minutes! We can actually trace their evolution as it is
happening.

Evolutionary Trees

If evolution can take a very long time, how can we visualize how it happens? Charles Darwin came up with the
idea of an evolutionary tree to represent the relationships between different species and their common ancestors (

251

4.11. Tracing Evolution

www.ck12.org

Figure 4.21). The base of the tree represents the ancient ancestors of all life. The separation into large branches
shows where these original species evolved into new species.
The branches keep splitting into smaller and smaller branches as species continue to evolve into more and more
species. Some species are represented by short twigs spurting out of the tree, then stopping. These are species that
went extinct before evolving into new species. Other “Trees of Life” have been created by other scientists ( Figure
4.21). If the evolutionary tree went back far enough to begin with the ﬁrst living organism, what type of organism
would that be? Animal, plant, fungi protist, or none of those?

FIGURE 4.21
Darwin drew this version of the “Tree of
Life” on the left to represent how species
evolve and diverge into separate direc-
tions. Each point on the tree where one
branch splits off from another represents
the common ancestor of the species on
the separate branches. Scientists have
drawn many different versions of the “Tree
of Life” to show different features of evo-
lution. The Tree of Life on the right was
made by Ernst Haeckel in 1879.

Summary

• Evolution is usually so gradual that we do not see the change for many, many generations.
• An evolutionary tree can be drawn to visualize the relationships between different species and their common

ancestors.

4.12 Origins of Life

• Describe the conditions of the early atmosphere.
• Explain how the ﬁrst organic molecules and cells arose.

What did the ﬁrst life forms look like?
The ﬁrst forms of life on Earth were probably smaller and simpler than even these bacteria. The ﬁrst forms of life
had to be simple single-celled organisms. But how did life begin on Earth?

Origin of Life

There is good evidence that life has probably existed on Earth for most of Earth’s history. Fossils of blue-green algae
found in Australia are the oldest fossils of life forms on Earth. They are at least 3.5 billion years old ( Figure 4.22).

Life from Random Reactions

How did life begin? In order to answer this question, scientists need to know what kinds of materials were available
at that time. We know that the ingredients for life were present at the beginning of Earth’s history. Scientists believe
early Earth did not contain oxygen gas (photosynthesis had yet to evolve), but did contain other gases, including:

• nitrogen gas,
• carbon dioxide,
• carbon monoxide,

253

4.12. Origins of Life

FIGURE 4.22
Some of the oldest fossils on Earth were
found along the coast of Australia, similar
to the area shown here.

• water vapor,
• hydrogen sulﬁde.

Where did these ingredients come from? Some chemicals were in water and volcanic gases ( Figure 4.23). Other
chemicals would have come from meteorites in space. Energy to drive chemical reactions was provided by volcanic
eruptions and lightning. Today, we have evidence that life on Earth came from random reactions between chem-
ical compounds, which formed molecules, or groups of atoms bonded together. Small molecules, such as those
present in the early atmosphere, can provide the components (including the elements C, H, N, O and S) to make
larger molecules. These early molecules further reacted and eventually formed even larger molecules and organic
compounds, such as amino acids (which combine to form proteins), and nucleotides (which form nucleic acids -
RNA or DNA). These organic molecules eventually came together in the right combinations to form basic cells. The
components that were necessary for the formation of the ﬁrst cells are still being studied.
How long did it take to develop the ﬁrst life forms? As much as 1 billion years. Many scientists still study the origin
of the ﬁrst life forms because there are many questions left unanswered, such as, "Did proteins or nucleic acids
develop ﬁrst?" or "What exactly were early Earth’s atmospheric conditions like?" There is a lot of work still left to
answer these and similar questions.

Timeline of Evolution

For life to evolve from simple single-celled organisms to many millions of species of prokaryotic species to simple
eukaryotic species to all the protists, fungi, plants, and animals, took some time. Well over 3 billion years.

The Age of Earth

How old is Earth? How was it formed? How did life begin on Earth? These questions have fascinated scientists for
centuries. During the 1800s, geologists, paleontologists, and naturalists found several forms of physical evidence

256

www.ck12.org

that conﬁrmed that Earth is very old.
The evidence includes:

Chapter 4. Evolution

• Fossils of ancient sea life on dry land far from oceans. This supported the idea that the Earth changed over

time and that some dry land today was once covered by oceans.

• The many layers of rock. When people realized that rock layers represent the order in which rocks and fossils

appeared, they were able to trace the history of Earth and life on Earth.

• Indications that volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and erosion that happened long ago shaped much of the

Earth’s surface. This supported the idea of an older Earth.

The Earth is at least as old as its oldest rocks. The oldest rock minerals found on Earth so far are crystals that are at
least 4.404 billion years old. These tiny crystals were found in Australia. Likewise, Earth cannot be older than the
solar system. The oldest possible age of Earth is 4.57 billion years old, the age of the solar system. Therefore, the
age of Earth is between 4.4 and 4.57 billion years.

Geologic Time Scale

Geologists and other Earth scientists use geologic time scales to describe when events happened in the history of
Earth. The time scales can be used to show when both geologic events and events affecting plant and animal life
occurred. The geologic time scale pictured below ( Figure 4.24) illustrates the timing of events like:

• Earthquakes.
• Volcanic eruptions.
• Major erosion.
• Meteorites hitting Earth.
• The ﬁrst signs of life forms.
• Mass extinctions.

FIGURE 4.24
The geologic time scale is used to de-
scribe events that occurred millions and
billions of years ago. The geologic time
scale of Earth’s past
is organized ac-
cording to events that took place during
different periods on the time scale. Ge-
ologic time is the same as the age of
the Earth: between 4.404 and 4.57 billion
years. Look closely for such events as the
extinction of dinosaurs and many marine
animals.

257

4.13. Timeline of Evolution

Evolution of Major Life Forms

www.ck12.org

Life on Earth began about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. The ﬁrst life forms were single-celled organisms similar to
bacteria. These ﬁrst life forms were, of course, very basic, and this then allowed for the evolution of more complex
life forms. The ﬁrst multicellular organisms did not appear until about 610 million years ago. Many different types
of organisms evolved during the next ten million years, in an event called the Cambrian Explosion. This sudden
burst of evolution may have been caused by some environmental changes that made the Earth’s environment more
suitable for a wider variety of life forms.
Plants and fungi did not appear until roughly 500 million years ago. They were soon followed by arthropods (insects
and spiders). Next came the amphibians about 300 million years ago, followed by mammals around 200 million
years ago and birds around 100 million years ago.
Even though large life forms have been very successful on Earth, most of the life forms on Earth today are still
prokaryotes—small, relatively simple single-celled organisms. As it is difﬁcult to identify, observe and study such
small forms of life, most of these organisms remain unknown to scientists. Advancing technologies, however, do
allow for the identiﬁcation and study of such organisms.
Fossils indicate that many organisms that lived long ago are extinct. Extinction of species is common; in fact, it is
estimated that 99% of the species that have ever lived on Earth no longer exist.
The basic timeline of a 4.6 billion-year-old Earth includes the following:

• About 3.5 - 3.8 billion years of simple cells (prokaryotes).
• 3 billion years of photosynthesis.
• 2 billion years of complex cells (eukaryotes).
• 1 billion years of multicellular life.
• 600 million years of simple animals.
• 570 million years of arthropods (ancestors of insects, arachnids and crustaceans).
• 550 million years of complex animals.
• 500 million years of ﬁsh and proto-amphibians.
• 475 million years of land plants.
• 400 million years of insects and seeds.
• 360 million years of amphibians.
• 300 million years of reptiles.
• 200 million years of mammals.
• 150 million years of birds.
• 130 million years of ﬂowers.
• 65 million years since the non-avian dinosaurs died out.
• 2.5 million years since the appearance of Homo.
• 200,000 years since the appearance of modern humans.
• 25,000 years since Neanderthals died out.

Summary

• The age of Earth is between 4.4 and 4.57 billion years.
• Life on Earth began about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and the ﬁrst life forms were single-celled organisms

similar to bacteria.

4.14 Mass Extinctions

• Deﬁne mass extinction.

• Describe the importance of the mass extinction dated at 65.5 million years ago.

What happened to the dinosaurs?
Most of the dinosaurs disappeared from Earth about 65 million years ago. This is probably the most famous example
of a mass extinction. So how do you deﬁne a mass extinction?

Mass Extinctions

An organism goes extinct when all of the members of a species die out and no more members remain. Extinctions
are part of natural selection. Species often go extinct when their environment changes, and they do not have the
traits they need to survive. Only those individuals with the traits needed to live in a changed environment survive
(Survival of the Fittest) ( Figure 4.25).
Mass extinctions, such as the extinction of dinosaurs and many marine mammals, happened after major catastrophes
such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes ( Figure 4.26).
Since life began on Earth, there have been several major mass extinctions. If you look closely at the geological time
scale, you will ﬁnd that at least ﬁve major mass extinctions have occurred in the past 540 million years. In each mass
extinction, over 50% of animal species died. Though species go extinct frequently, a mass extinction in which such
a high percentage of species go extinct is rare. The total number of mass extinctions could be as high as 20. It is
probable that we are currently in the midst of another mass extinction.
Two of the largest extinctions are described below:

Chapter 4. Evolution

FIGURE 4.25
Humans have caused many extinctions by
introducing species to new places. For
example, many of New Zealand’s birds
have adapted to nesting on the ground.
This was possible because there were no
land mammals in New Zealand. Then Eu-
ropeans arrived and brought cats, foxes,
and other predators with them. Several of
New Zealand’s ground nesting birds, such
as this ﬂightless kiwi, are now extinct or
threatened because of these predators.

dinosaurs that went extinct during one of
the mass extinctions.

• At the end of the Permian Period, it is estimated that about 99.5% of individual organisms went extinct! Up
to 95% of marine species perished, compared to “only” 70% of land species. Some scientists theorize that the
extinction was caused by the formation of Pangaea, or one large continent made out of many smaller ones.
One large continent has a smaller shoreline than many small ones, so reducing the shoreline space may have

4.14. Mass Extinctions

caused much of the marine life to go extinct ( Figure 4.27).

FIGURE 4.27
The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of today’s continents in a
single land mass. This conﬁguration limited shallow coastal areas which
harbor marine species. This may have contributed to the dramatic event
which ended the Permian—the most massive extinction ever recorded.

• At the end of the Cretaceous Period, or 65 million years ago, all dinosaurs (except those which led to birds)
went extinct. Some scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth and a comet or asteroid.
The collision could have caused tidal waves, changed the climate, increased atmospheric dust and clouds, and
reduced sunlight by 10-20%. A decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food, leading to
the extinction of the dinosaurs.

Evidence for the extinction of dinosaurs by asteroid includes an iridium-rich layer in the Earth, dated at 65.5 million
years ago. Iridium is rare in the Earth’s crust but common in comets and asteroids. Maybe the asteroid that hit the
Earth left the iridium behind.
After each mass extinction, new species evolve to ﬁll the habitats where old species lived. This is well documented
in the fossil record.

Summary

• Extinctions, when a species entirely dies out, can happen when the environment changes, and the organisms

do not have the traits they need to survive.

• Since life began on Earth, there have been at least ﬁve major massive extinctions.

Summary

Evolution focuses on past life forms and how they turned into present life forms. The history of life on Earth
demonstrates how the ﬁrst cells formed, turned into simple life forms, and then became more complex plants and
animals. The studies of Charles Darwin have reshaped and inﬂuenced all aspects of biology. The vast amounts
of evidence of evolution demonstrates the importance of the theory of evolution by natural selection. But has this
process stopped? Of course not. Evolution does continue today.

Introduction

What are the most numerous organisms on the planet?
The single-celled prokaryotic organism otherwise known as bacteria. And all it takes is one to quickly grow, under
just the right conditions, into millions and billions. Luckily, we know how to control bacteria when necessary. But
bacteria do serve many important purposes. In fact, we could not survive without them.

265

5.1. Bacteria Characteristics

www.ck12.org

5.1 Bacteria Characteristics

• Describe common bacterial shapes.
• Summarize the similarities between bacterial cells and eukaryotic cells.
• Summarize the differences between bacterial cells and eukaryotic cells.
• Explain the roles of the cell wall and the ﬂagella in bacteria.

Are bacteria living things?
Bacteria are individual living cells. Bacteria cells are similar to your cells in many ways; yet, they also have distinct
differences. Bacteria have many unique adaptations allowing them to live in many different environments.

Characteristics of Bacteria

Bacteria are the most successful organisms on the planet. They lived on this planet for two billion years before the
ﬁrst eukaryotes and, during that time, evolved into millions of different species.

Size and Shape

Bacteria are so small that they can only be seen with a microscope. When viewed under the microscope, they have
three distinct shapes ( Figure 5.1). Bacteria can be identiﬁed and classiﬁed by their shape:

1. Bacilli are rod-shaped.

266

www.ck12.org

2. Cocci are sphere-shaped.
3. Spirilli are spiral-shaped.

Chapter 5. Prokaryotes

FIGURE 5.1
Bacteria come in many different shapes.
Some of the most common shapes are
bacilli (rods), cocci (spheres), and spirilli
(spirals). Bacteria can be identiﬁed and
classiﬁed by their shape.

Similarities to Eukaryotes

Like eukaryotic cells, bacterial cells have:

1. Cytoplasm, the ﬂuid inside the cell.
2. A plasma or cell membrane, which acts as a barrier around the cell.
3. Ribosomes, in which proteins are put together.
4. DNA. By contrast though, bacterial DNA is contained in a large, circular strand. This single chromosome is
located in a region of the cell called the nucleoid. The nucleoid is not an organelle, but a region within the
cytoplasm. Many bacteria also have additional small rings of DNA known as plasmids.

See bacterial cell pictured below ( Figure 5.2).

FIGURE 5.2
The structure of a bacterial cell
is dis-
tinctive from a eukaryotic cell because of
features such as an outer cell wall, the
circular DNA of the nucleoid, and the lack
of membrane-bound organelles.

267

5.1. Bacteria Characteristics

Unique Features

www.ck12.org

Bacteria lack many of the structures that eukaryotic cells contain. For example, they don’t have a nucleus. They
also lack membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. The DNA of a bacterial cell is also
different from a eukaryotic cell. Bacterial DNA is contained in one circular chromosome, located in the cytoplasm.
Eukaryotes have several linear chromosomes. Bacteria also have two additional unique features: a cell wall and
ﬂagella. Some bacteria also have a capsule outside the cell wall.

The Cell Wall

Bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall consisting of peptidoglycan. This complex molecule consists of sugars and
amino acids. The cell wall is important for protecting bacteria. The cell wall is so important that some antibiotics,
such as penicillin, kill bacteria by preventing the cell wall from forming.
Some bacteria depend on a host organism for energy and nutrients. These bacteria are known as parasites. If the
host starts attacking the parasitic bacteria, the bacteria release a layer of slime that surrounds the cell wall. This
slime offers an extra layer of protection.

Flagella

Some bacteria also have tail-like structures called ﬂagella ( Figure 5.3). Flagella help bacteria move. As the ﬂagella
rotate, they spin the bacteria and propel them forward. It is often said the ﬂagella looks like a tiny whip, propelling
the bacteria forward. Though some eukaryotic cells do have a ﬂagella, a ﬂagella in eukaryotes is rare.

FIGURE 5.3
The ﬂagella facilitate movement in bacte-
ria. Bacteria may have one, two, or many
ﬂagella—or none at all.

5.2. Bacteria Nutrition

www.ck12.org

5.2 Bacteria Nutrition

• Identify how bacteria aquire energy.
• Explain the importance of chemosynthetic bacteria.

Can bacteria make their own food from sunlight?
Plants aren’t the only organisms that use the energy of the sun to make food. Some bacteria can also perform
photosynthesis. In fact, the ﬁrst photosynthetic organisms on Earth were bacteria. Photosynthesis is just one of
many ways that bacteria can obtain energy.

Bacteria Nutrition

Like all organisms, bacteria need energy, and they can acquire this energy through a number of different ways.

Photosynthesis

Photosynthetic bacteria use the energy of the sun to make their own food.
In the presence of sunlight, carbon
dioxide and water are turned into glucose and oxygen. The glucose is then turned into usable energy. Glucose is like
the "food" for the bacteria. An example of photosynthetic bacteria is cyanobacteria, as seen in the opening image.
These bacteria are sometimes called blue-green algae, although they are not algae, due to their numerous chlorophyll
molecules.

Decomposers

Bacteria known as decomposers break down wastes and dead organisms into smaller molecules. These bacteria use
the organic substrates they break down to get their energy, carbon, and nutrients they need for survival.

270

www.ck12.org

Chemotrophs

Chapter 5. Prokaryotes

Bacteria can also be chemotrophs. Chemosynthetic bacteria, or chemotrophs, obtain energy by breaking down
chemical compounds in their environment. An example of one of these chemicals broken down by bacteria is
nitrogen-containing ammonia. These bacteria are important because they help cycle nitrogen through the environ-
ment for other living things to use. Nitrogen cannot be made by living organisms, so it must be continually recycled.
Organisms need nitrogen to make organic compounds, such as DNA.

Mutualism

Some bacteria depend on other organisms for survival. For example, some bacteria live in the roots of legumes, such
as pea plants ( Figure 7.5). The bacteria turn nitrogen-containing molecules into nitrogen that the plant can use.
Meanwhile, the root provides nutrients to the bacteria. In this relationship, both the bacteria and the plant beneﬁt, so
it is known as a mutualism.
Other mutualistic bacteria include gut microbes. These are bacteria that live in the intestines of animals. They are
usually beneﬁcial bacteria, needed by the host organism. These microbes obviously don’t kill their host, as that
would kill the bacteria as well.

FIGURE 5.4
These mutualistic
bacteria-containing
nodules on a soybean root help provide
the plant with nitrogen.

Parasitism

Other bacteria are parasitic and can cause illness. In parasitism, the bacteria beneﬁt, and the other organism is
harmed. Harmful bacteria will be discussed in another concept.

Summary

• Bacteria can obtain energy and nutrients by performing photosynthesis, decomposing dead organisms and

wastes, or breaking down chemical compounds.

• Bacteria can obtain energy and nutrients by establishing close relationships with other organisms, including

mutualistic and parasitic relationships.

5.3 Bacteria Reproduction

• Deﬁne asexual reproduction.
• Describe the process of binary ﬁssion.
• Compare conjugation, transformation, and transduction.

How can bacteria reproduce so rapidly?
Bacteria can divide very rapidly. This image is of a growing colony of E. coli bacteria. In the right environment, a
single E. coli can divide to form a colony of hundreds of bacteria in just a few hours.

Bacteria Reproduction

Bacteria, being single-celled prokaryotic organisms, do not have a male or female version. Bacteria reproduce
asexually. In asexual reproduction, the "parent" produces a genetically identical copy of itself.

Binary Fission

Bacteria reproduce through a process called binary ﬁssion. During binary ﬁssion, the chromosome copies itself,
forming two genetically identical copies. Then, the cell enlarges and divides into two new daughter cells. The two
daughter cells are identical to the parent cell. Binary ﬁssion can happen very rapidly. Some species of bacteria can
double their population in less than ten minutes! This process makes it possible for a tremendous bacterial colony to
start from a single cell.

273

5.3. Bacteria Reproduction

Exchanging DNA

www.ck12.org

Are there male and female bacteria? Of course the answer is no. So, sexual reproduction does not occur in bacteria.
But not all new bacteria are clones. This is because bacteria can acquire new DNA. This process occurs in three
different ways:

1. Conjugation: In conjugation, DNA passes through an extension on the surface of one bacterium and travels

to another bacterium ( Figure 5.5). Bacteria essential exchange DNA via conjugation.

2. Transformation: In transformation, bacteria pick up pieces of DNA from their environment.
3. Transduction: In transduction, viruses that infect bacteria carry DNA from one bacterium to another.

FIGURE 5.5
Bacteria can exchange small segments
of DNA through conjugation. Notice two
bacterial cells are attached by a short ex-
tension. DNA can be exchanged through
this extension.

Summary

• Bacteria reproduce by binary ﬁssion, resulting in two daughter cells identical to the parent cell.
• Bacteria can exchange DNA through the processes of conjugation, transformation, or transduction.

5.4 Helpful Bacteria

• Identify how bacteria are beneﬁcial to humans.
• Explain how bacteria are used in food production and medicine.
• Summarize the role of bacteria in digestion and as decomposers.

Where does cheese come from?
Bacteria are often used to make cheese from milk. But making foods is not the only beneﬁcial role of bacteria. For
example, they also play an essential role in your gut!

Helpful Bacteria

Can we survive without bacteria? Could bacteria survive without us? No and yes. No, we could not survive without
bacteria. And yes, bacteria could survive without us.

Foods

Bacteria can be used to make cheese from milk. The bacteria turn the milk sugars into lactic acid. The acid is what
causes the milk to curdle to form cheese. Bacteria are also involved in producing other foods. Yogurt is made by
using bacteria to ferment milk ( Figure 5.6). Fermenting cabbage with bacteria produces sauerkraut.

276

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Prokaryotes

FIGURE 5.6
Yogurt is made from milk fermented with
bacteria. The bacteria ingest natural milk
sugars and release lactic acid as a waste
product, which causes proteins in the milk
to form into a solid mass, which becomes
the yogurt.

Medicines

In the laboratory, bacteria can be changed to provide us with a variety of useful materials. Bacteria can be used as
tiny factories to produce desired chemicals and medicines. For example, insulin, which is necessary to treat people
with diabetes, can be produced using bacteria.
Through the process of transformation, the human gene for insulin is placed into bacteria. The bacteria then use
that gene to make a protein. The protein can be separated from the bacteria and then used to treat patients. The
mass production of insulin by bacteria made this medicine much more affordable. During transformation, bacteria
can take up any DNA from the environment. Therefore, transformation allows scientists to insert any DNA into a
bacteria, potentially producing many different proteins. This makes the bacteria greatly useful to people.

Digestion

Bacteria also help you digest your food. Several species of bacteria, such as E. coli, are found in your digestive tract.
In fact, in your gut, bacteria cells greatly outnumber your own cells!

Decomposers

Bacteria are important in practically all ecosystems because many bacteria are decomposers. They break down dead
materials and waste products and recycle nutrients back into the environment. The recycling of nutrients, such as
nitrogen, by bacteria, is essential for living organisms. Organisms cannot produce nutrients, so they must come from
other sources.
We get nutrients from the food we eat; plants get them from the soil. How do these nutrients get into the soil? One
way is from the actions of decomposers. Without decomposers, we would eventually run out of the materials we
need to survive. We also depend on bacteria to decompose our wastes in sewage treatment plants.

• Bacteria can be used to make foods and medicines.

5.5 Harmful Bacteria

• Describe how some bacteria are harmful.
• Name human diseases caused by bacteria.
• Describe bacterial contamination of foods.
• Explain the use of bacteria as a weapon.

Could this organism make you sick?
This bacterium, called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causes the disease Tuberculosis (TB). These bacteria usually
attack the lungs. If left untreated, the infection can be fatal. Many other illnesses, mild and severe, are also caused
by certain types of bacteria.

Harmful Bacteria

With so many species of bacteria, some are bound to be harmful. Harmful bacteria can make you sick. They can
also ruin food and be used to hurt people.

Diseases

There are also ways that bacteria can be harmful to humans and other animals. Bacteria are responsible for many
types of human illness ( Figure 5.7), including:

• Strep throat

280

www.ck12.org

• Tuberculosis
• Pneumonia
• Leprosy
• Lyme disease

Chapter 5. Prokaryotes

Luckily most of these can be treated with antibiotics, which kill the bacteria. It is important that when a medical
doctor prescribes antibiotics for you, you take the medicine exactly as the doctor tells you. You need to make sure
the bacteria is killed.

FIGURE 5.7
The Black Death, which killed at least one
third of Europe’s population in the 1300s,
is believed to have been caused by the
bacterium Yersinia pestis.

Food Contamination

Bacterial contamination of foods can lead to digestive problems, an illness known as food poisoning. Raw eggs and
undercooked meats commonly carry the bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Food poisoning can be prevented
by cooking meat thoroughly, which kills most microbes, and washing surfaces that have been in contact with raw
meat. Washing your hands before and after handling food also helps prevent contamination.

Weapons

Some bacteria also have the potential to be used as biological weapons by terrorists. An example is anthrax, a disease
caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Inhaling the spores of this bacterium can lead to a deadly infection, and,
therefore, it is a dangerous weapon. In 2001, an act of terrorism in the United States involved B. anthracis spores
sent in letters through the mail.

Summary

• Bacteria are responsible for many types of diseases in humans.
• Some bacteria can contaminate food and cause food poisoning.
• Some bacteria have been used as biological weapons by terrorists.

5.6 Archaea

• Distinguish between bacteria and archaea.
• Describe how archaea obtain energy.

What organisms can grow in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park?
In the 1970s, a new group of organisms was identiﬁed. Unlike other organisms, these organisms could thrive in
temperatures near 100ºC, the boiling point of water! This new group of organisms was named archaea.

What are Archaea?

For many years, archaea were classiﬁed as bacteria. Like the bacteria, archaea lacked a nucleus and membrane-
bound organelles and, therefore, were prokaryotic cells. However, when scientists compared the DNA of the two
prokaryotes, they found that there were distinct differences. They concluded that there must be two distinct types of
prokaryotes, which they named archaea and bacteria.
Even though the two groups might seem similar, archaea have many features that distinguish them from bacteria:

1. The cell walls of archaea are distinct from those of bacteria. While bacteria have cell walls made up of the

polymer peptidoglycan, most archaea do not have peptidoglycan in their cell walls.

2. The plasma membranes of the archaea are also made up of lipids that are distinct from those in bacteria.
3. The ribosomal proteins of the archaea are similar to those in eukaryotic cells, not those in bacteria.

Although archaea and bacteria share some fundamental differences, they are still similar in many ways:

1. They both are single-celled, microscopic organisms that can come in a variety of shapes ( Figure 5.8).
2. Both archaea and bacteria have a single circular chromosome of DNA and lack membrane-bound organelles.
3. Like bacteria, archaea can have ﬂagella to assist with movement.

FIGURE 5.8
Archaea shapes can vary widely, but some are bacilli (rod-shaped).

Obtaining Food and Energy

Most archaea are chemotrophs and derive their energy and nutrients from breaking down molecules in their envi-
ronment. A few species of archaea are photosynthetic and capture the energy of sunlight. Unlike bacteria, which
can be parasites and are known to cause a variety of diseases, there are no known archaea that act as parasites. Some
archaea do live within other organisms. But these archea form mutualistic relationships with their host, where both
the archaea and the host beneﬁt. In other words, they assist the host in some way, for example by helping to digest
food.

Reproduction

Like bacteria, reproduction in archaea is asexual. Archaea can reproduce through binary ﬁssion, where a parent
cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. Archaea can also reproduce asexually through budding and
fragmentation, where pieces of the cell break off and form a new cell, also producing genetically identical organisms.

Summary

• Archaea are prokaryotes, but they differ from bacteria in their DNA and biochemistry.
• Most archaea are chemotrophs, but some are photosynthetic or form mutualistic relationships.
• Archaea reproduce asexually through binary ﬁssion, fragmentation, or budding.

5.7 Types of Archaea

• Distinguish between halophiles, thermophiles, and methanogens.

How can termites digest wood?
Unlike us, termites can get nutrition from wood. Mutualistic archaea found in the gut of termites help them digest
the wood. This is just one example of the many extreme environments in which archaea can thrive.

Types of Archaea

The ﬁrst archaea described could survive in extremely harsh environments in which no other organisms could
survive. As a result, archaea are often distinguished by the environment in which they live.

Halophiles

The halophiles, which means "salt-loving," live in environments with high levels of salt ( Figure 5.9). They have
been identiﬁed in the Great Salt Lake in Utah and in the Dead Sea between Israel and Jordan, which have salt

285

5.7. Types of Archaea

concentrations several times that of the oceans.

FIGURE 5.9
Halophiles, like the Halobacterium shown here, require high salt concen-
trations.

Thermophiles

The thermophiles live in extremely hot environments. For example, they can grow in hot springs, geysers, and near
volcanoes. Unlike other organisms, they can thrive in temperatures near 100°C, the boiling point of water!

Methanogens

Methanogens can also live in some strange places, such as swamps and inside the guts of cows and termites. They
help these animals break down cellulose, a tough carbohydrate made by plants ( Figure 5.10). This is an example of
a mutualistic relationship. Methanogens are named for their waste product, a gas called methane.

FIGURE 5.10
Cows are able to digest grass with the
help of the methanogens in their gut.

Common Environments

Although archaea are known for living in unusual environments, such as the Dead Sea, inside hot springs, and in
the guts of cows, they also live in more common environments. For example, new research shows that archaea are
abundant in the soil. They also live among the plankton in the ocean ( Figure 5.11). Therefore, scientists are just
beginning to discover some of the important roles that archaea have in the environment.

• Archaea that live in salty environments are known as halophiles.
• Archaea that live in extremely hot environments are called thermophiles.
• Archaea that produce methane are called methanogens.
• Archaea are known for living in extreme environments, but they also can be found in common environments,

Introduction

Would you eat this mushroom?
Now that’s an interesting mushroom! In fact, fungi can be some of the most colorful species. And protists can be
some of the most interesting. These two kingdoms are the ﬁrst two eukaryotic kingdoms we discuss, and they have
some of the most diverse members.

290

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Protists and Fungi

But this mushroom? Probably not a good idea to eat. This is a poisonous and psychoactive fungus. With its large,
white-gilled, white-spotted, usually deep red appearance, it is one of the most recognizable and widely encountered
mushrooms in popular culture. However, you shouldn’t eat it!

6.1. Protist Characteristics

www.ck12.org

6.1 Protist Characteristics

• Describe the main features of the protists.
• Explain protist classiﬁcation.

Animal? Bacteria? Plant? Fungi? What do these ﬁgures represent?
None of the above! These organisms may be single-celled like bacteria, and they may look like a fungus. They also
may hunt for food like an animal or photosynthesize like a plant. And, yet, they do not ﬁt into any of these groups.
These organisms are protists!

What are Protists?

Protists are eukaryotes, which means their cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Most, but
not all, protists are single-celled. Other than these features, they have very little in common. You can think about
protists as all eukaryotic organisms that are neither animals, nor plants, nor fungi.
Although Ernst Haeckel set up the Kingdom Protista in 1866, this kingdom was not accepted by the scientiﬁc world
until the 1960s. These unique organisms can be so different from each other that sometimes Protista is called the
“junk drawer" kingdom. Just like a junk drawer, which contains items that don’t ﬁt into any other category, this
kingdom contains the eukaryotes that cannot be put into any other kingdom. Therefore, protists can seem very
different from one another.

292

Unicellular or Multicellular?

Chapter 6. Protists and Fungi

Most protists are so small that they can be seen only with a microscope. Protists are mostly unicellular (one-celled)
eukaryotes. A few protists are multicellular (many-celled) and surprisingly large. For example, kelp is a multicellular
protist that can grow to be over 100-meters long ( Figure 6.1). Multicellular protists, however, do not show cellular
specialization or differentiation into tissues. That means their cells all look the same and, for the most part, function
the same. On the other hand, your cells often are much different from each other and have special jobs.

FIGURE 6.1
Kelp is an example of a muticellular pro-
tist.

Characteristics of Protists

A few characteristics are common between protists.

1. They are eukaryotic, which means they have a nucleus.
2. Most have mitochondria.
3. They can be parasites.
4. They all prefer aquatic or moist environments.

Classiﬁcation of Protists

For classiﬁcation, the protists are divided into three groups:

1. Animal-like protists, which are heterotrophs and have the ability to move.
2. Plant-like protists, which are autotrophs that photosynthesize.
3. Fungi-like protists, which are heterotrophs, and they have cells with cell walls and reproduce by forming

spores.

But remember, protists are not animals, nor plants, nor fungi ( Figure 6.2).

Summary

• Protists are a diverse kingdom, including all eukaryotic organisms that are neither animals, nor plants, nor

fungi.

6.2 Protists Nutrition

• Describe how protists obtain food.
• Explain endocytosis in protists.

What can photosynthesize AND hunt for food?
No, there are no man-eating plants or leaf-growing animals. The idea of an organism both photosynthesizing and
hunting for food might seem strange, but this isn’t science ﬁction. These organisms, examples of Euglena, are
protists that can feed like an animal or use the energy of the sun to make food like a plant.

Protists Nutrition

The cells of protists need to perform all of the functions that other cells do, such as grow and reproduce, maintain
homeostasis, and obtain energy. They also need to obtain "food" to provide the energy to perform these functions.
Recall that protists can be plant-like, fungi-like, or animal-like. That means that protists can obtain food like plants,
fungi, or animals do. There are many plant-like protists, such as algae, that get their energy from sunlight through
photosynthesis. Some of the fungus-like protists, such as the slime molds ( Figure 6.3), decompose decaying matter.
The animal-like protists must "eat" or ingest food.
Some animal-like protists use their "tails" to eat. These protists are called ﬁlter-feeders. They acquire nutrients by
constantly whipping their tails, called ﬂagellum, back and forth. The whipping of the ﬂagellum creates a current
that brings food into the protist.
Other animal-like protists must "swallow" their food through a process called endocytosis. Endocytosis happens
when a cell takes in substances through its membrane. The process is described below:

1. The protist wraps around its prey, which is usually bacteria.

296

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Protists and Fungi

2. It creates a food vacuole, a sort of "food storage compartment," around the bacteria.
3. The protist produces toxins which paralyze its prey.
4. Once digested, the food material moves through the vacuole and into the cytoplasm of the protist.

Also, some of the animal-like and fungi-like protists are parasitic, harming their hosts as they obtain nutrients.
Fungi-like protists absorb nutrients meant for their host, harming the host in the process.

Slime molds live on decaying plant life and
in the soil.

Summary

• Some protists are plant-like and photosynthesize.
• Some protists absorb nutrients from decaying matter like a fungus.
• Some protists hunt their food or act as parasites.

• Deﬁne protozoa.
• Describe the types of animal-like protists.
• Distinguish ﬂagellates from ciliates.

What can hunt prey and move, but is not an animal?
Some protists, like these Paramecium, act much like animals. Notice the tiny hair-like cilia that help them move.
The food vacuoles, where they digest their prey, are colored in orange.

Animal-like Protists

Animal-like protists are called protozoa. Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotes that share some traits with animals.
Like animals, they can move, and they are heterotrophs. That means they eat things outside of themselves instead
of producing their own food. Animal-like protists are very small, measuring only about 0.01–0.5mm. Animal-like
protists include the ﬂagellates, ciliates, and the sporozoans.

299

6.3. Animal-like Protists

www.ck12.org

Different Kinds of Animal-like Protists

There are many different types of animal-like protists. They are different because they move in different ways.

• Flagellates have long ﬂagella, or tails. Flagella rotate in a propeller-like fashion, pushing the protist through
its environment ( Figure 6.4). An example of a ﬂagellate is Trypanosoma, which causes African sleeping
sickness.

• Other protists have what are called transient pseudopodia, which are like temporary feet. The cell surface
extends out to form feet-like structures that propel the cell forward. An example of a protist with pseudopodia
is the amoeba.

• The ciliates are protists that move by using cilia. Cilia are thin, very small tail-like projections that extend
outward from the cell body. Cilia beat back and forth, moving the protist along. Paramecium has cilia that
propel it.

• The sporozoans are protists that produce spores, such as the toxoplasma. These protists do not move at all.

The spores develop into new protists.

FIGURE 6.4
These ﬂagellates all cause diseases in
humans.

• Deﬁne algae.
• Distinguish algae from plants.
• Give examples of multicellular plant-like protists.

What is pond scum?
Polluted water can form a frothy green scum on the surface. This "pond scum" is actually a living organism, algae.
The algae are plant-like protists. Usually the algae are too small to notice, but sometimes algae grow in excess
because of the excess nutrients in polluted water.

Plant-like Protists

Plant-like protists are known as algae ( Figure 6.5). They are a large and diverse group. Plant-like protists are
autotrophs. This means that they produce their own food. They perform photosynthesis to produce sugar by using
carbon dioxide and water, and the energy from sunlight, just like plants. Unlike plants, however, plant-like protists
do not have true stems, roots, or leaves.
Most plant-like protists live in oceans, ponds, or lakes. Protists can be unicellular (single-celled) or multicellular
(many-celled). Seaweed and kelp are examples of multicellular, plant-like protists. Kelp can be as large as trees and
form a "forest" in the ocean ( Figure 6.6).
Plant-like protists are essential to the ecosystem. They are the base of the marine food chain, and they produce
oxygen through photosynthesis for animals to breathe. They are classiﬁed into a number of basic groups ( Table
6.1).

• Describe features of the fungus-like protists.
• Distinguish slime molds from water molds.

What’s shrouding this dead insect?
The thin ﬁlaments growing out of this dead insect look a little like a fungus. Also this mystery organism, like a
fungus, is feeding on decaying matter. However, this is not a fungus. This organism is a type of fungus-like protist,
known as water mold.

Fungus-like Protists

Fungus-like protists share many features with fungi. Like fungi, they are heterotrophs, meaning they must obtain
food outside themselves. They also have cell walls and reproduce by forming spores, just like fungi. Fungus-like
protists usually do not move, but a few develop movement at some point in their lives. Two major types of fungus-
like protists are slime molds and water molds.

Slime Molds

Slime molds usually measure about one or two centimeters, but a few slime molds are as big as several meters. They
often have bright colors, such as a vibrant yellow ( Figure 6.7). Others are brown or white.
Stemonitis is a kind of slime mold which forms small brown bunches on the outside of rotting logs. Physarum
polycephalum lives inside rotting logs and is a gooey mesh of yellow "threads" that are several centimeters long.
Fuligo, sometimes called “vomit mold,” is a yellow slime mold found in decaying wood.

FIGURE 6.7
An example of a slime mold.

Water Molds

Water molds mostly live in water or moist soil. They can be parasites of plants and animals, getting their nutrients
from these organisms and also from decaying organisms. They are a common problem for farmers since they cause
a variety of plant diseases. One of the most famous of these diseases was the fungus that caused the Irish potato
famine in the 1800s. At this time, potatoes were the main source of food for many of the Irish people. The failure of
the potato crop meant that many people in Ireland died of starvation or migrated to other countries.

Summary

• Slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on decaying matter. They are commonly found

on items such as rotting logs.

• Water molds are fungus-like protists present in moist soil and surface water; they live as parasites or on

decaying organisms.

6.6 Importance of Protists

• Describe ways protists are important to humans.

Would you eat seaweed?
Seaweed is commonly eaten in many parts of the world. It’s good for you, too; it’s high in nutrients and low in
calories. You have probably eaten processed seaweed and not even known it, since it’s used as a thickener in foods
like ice cream. Seaweed and other protists are also food for many, many animals in the ecosystem.

Importance of Protists

Humans could not live on Earth if it were not for protists. Why? Plant-like protists produce almost one-half of the
oxygen on the planet through photosynthesis. Other protists decompose and recycle nutrients that humans need to
live. All protists make up a huge part of the food chain.
Humans use protists for many other reasons:

• Many protists are also commonly used in medical research. For example, medicines made from protists are

used in treatment of high blood pressure, digestion problems, ulcers, and arthritis.

• Other protists are used in scientiﬁc studies. For example, slime molds (including D. discoideum, a soil-living

protist) are used to analyze the chemical signals in cells.

• Protists are also valuable in industry. Look on the back of a milk carton. You will most likely see carrageenan,
which is extracted from red algae. This is used to make puddings and ice cream solid ( Figure 6.8). Chemicals
from other kinds of algae are used to produce many kinds of plastics.

• Give examples of fungi.
• Describe the characteristics of fungi.
• Explain why fungi can grow quickly.

What does this fungus have in common with mold?
This colorful bracket fungus doesn’t look much like mold. But they have a lot in common. They both break down
organic matter to obtain nutrients. They both reproduce by spores. They are both eukaryotic, but they are not plants,
and they are deﬁnitely not animals. They are both fungi.

What are Fungi?

Ever notice blue-green mold growing on a loaf of bread? Do you like your pizza with mushrooms? Has a physician
ever prescribed an antibiotic for you?
If so, then you have encountered fungi. Fungi are organisms that belong to the Kingdom Fungi ( Figure 6.9).

310

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Protists and Fungi

Our environment needs fungi. Fungi help decompose matter to release nutrients and make nutritious food for other
organisms. Fungi are all around us and are useful in many ways.

FIGURE 6.9
These many different kinds of organisms
demonstrate the huge diversity within the
Kingdom Fungi.

Classiﬁcation of the Fungi

If you had to guess, would you say a fungus is a plant or an animal? Scientists used to debate about which kingdom
to place fungi in. Finally they decided that fungi were plants. But they were wrong. Now, scientists know that fungi
are not plants at all. Fungi are very different from plants.
The main difference between plants and fungi is how they obtain energy. Plants are autotrophs, meaning that they
make their own "food" using the energy from sunlight. Fungi are heterotrophs, which means that they obtain their
"food" from outside of themselves. In other words, they must "eat" their food like animals do. But they don’t really
eat. Instead, they absorb their nutrients.
Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms are all different kinds of fungi. There may be as many as 1.5 million species of fungi
( Figure 6.10). You can easily see bread mold and mushrooms without a microscope, but most fungi you cannot see.
Fungi are either too small to be seen without a microscope, or they live where you cannot see them easily—deep in
the soil, under decaying logs, or inside plants or animals. Some fungi even live in, or on top of, other fungi.

Fungi are Good Eaters

Fungi can grow fast because they are such good eaters. Fungi have lots of surface area, and this large surface area
“eats” or absorbs. Surface area is how much exposed area an organism has, compared to their overall volume. Most
of a mushroom’s surface area is actually underground. If you see a mushroom in your yard, that is just a small part
of a larger fungus growing underground.
These are the steps involved in fungi "eating":

1. Fungi squirt special enzymes into their environment.

311

6.7. Fungi

FIGURE 6.10
The blue in this blue cheese is actually
mold, which is a fungus.

2. The enzymes help digest large organic molecules, similar to cutting up your food before you eat.
3. Cells of the fungi then absorb the broken-down nutrients.

Summary

• Fungi are heterotrophs, meaning they obtain food from outside themselves.
• Common fungi include yeasts, molds, and mushrooms.

6.8 Symbiotic Relationships of Fungi

• Deﬁne mycorrhizae and lichen.
• Describe symbiotic relationships that fungi have with other organisms.

What killed this tree?
Dutch elm trees used to be common, beautiful trees in the United States. Now most of them, like this tree, have been
killed by Dutch elm disease. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus. This is just one example of how fungi can
interact with other species.

Symbiotic Relationships with Fungi

Fungi don’t live in isolation. They often interact with other species. In fact, fungi can be dependent on another or-
ganism for survival. When two species live close together and form a relationship, it is called symbiosis. Symbiosis
can be beneﬁcial to one or both organisms, or sometimes one organism hurts the other. Some of the partners in these
relationships include plants, algae, insects and other animals, and even humans.

314

www.ck12.org

Fungi and Plants

Chapter 6. Protists and Fungi

If it were not for fungi, many plants would go hungry. In the soil, fungi grow closely around the roots of plants, and
they begin to help each other. The plant roots together with the special root-dwelling fungi are called mycorrhizae
( Figure 6.11).
As plants and fungi form a close relationship, the plant and the fungus “feed” one another. The plant provides sugars
to the fungus that the plant makes through photosynthesis, which the fungus cannot do. The fungus then provides
minerals and water to the roots of the plant. Since the plant and the fungus are helping each other out, this is a
mutualistic relationship, a type of symbiosis known as mutualism. In a mutualistic relationship, both organisms
beneﬁt.

FIGURE 6.11
These roots (brown) and the mycorrhizae
(white) help to feed one another.

Lichens

Have you ever seen an organism called a lichen? Lichens are crusty, hard growths that you might ﬁnd on trees,
logs, walls, and rocks ( Figure 6.12). Although lichens may not be the prettiest organisms in nature, they are
unique. A lichen is really two organisms, sometimes referred to as a composite organism, that live very closely
together: a fungus and a bacterium or an alga. The cells from the alga or bacterium live inside the fungus. Besides
providing a home, the fungus also provides nutrients. In turn, the bacterium or the alga provides energy to the
fungus by performing photosynthesis, obtaining energy directly from the sun. A lichen is also an example of a
mutualistic relationship. Because lichens can grow on rocks, these organisms are some of the earliest life forms in
new ecosystems.

Fungi and Insects

Many insects have a symbiotic relationship with certain types of fungi:

• Ants and termites grow fungi in underground “fungus gardens” that they create. When the ants or termites
have eaten a big meal of wood or leaves, they also eat some fungi from their gardens. The fungi help them
digest the wood or leaves. The fungi secrete certain enzymes that the ants or termites cannot produce on their
own.

315

FIGURE 6.12
This tree is covered in lichen, a symbiotic
relationship between a fungus and a bac-
terium or an alga.

• Ambrosia beetles live in the bark of trees. Like ants and termites, they grow fungi inside the bark of trees and

use it to help digest their food.

Fungi as Parasites

Although lots of symbiotic relationships help both organisms, sometimes one of the organisms is harmed. When
that happens, the organism that beneﬁts, and is not harmed, is called a parasite. This type of relationship is known
as parasitism.
Examples of parasitic fungi include the following:

• Beginning in 1950, Dutch Elm trees in the United States began to die. Since then, most of these trees have
been eliminated. The disease was caused by a fungus that acted as a parasite. The fungus that killed the trees
was carried by beetles to the trees.

• Some parasitic fungi cause human diseases such as athlete’s foot and ringworm. These fungi feed on the outer
layer of warm, moist skin. Though its name may suggest otherwise, ringworm is not caused by a worm, but
by a fungus.

Summary

• Fungi can form a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic organisms, including plants, bacteria, and algae.
• Fungi can also be parasites of trees and people.

6.9 Fungi Structure

• List the most important body parts of fungi.
• Distinguish a hyphae from a mycelium and from a fruiting body.

What, exactly, is a mushroom?
Mushrooms aren’t around just so you can put them on your pizza. The mushroom is part of a large fungus that lives
underground. The mushroom develops above the ground when the fungus is ready to reproduce.

Body Parts of Fungi

The most important body parts of fungi include:

1. Cell wall: A layer around the cell membrane of fungi cells made largely of chitin and other polysaccharides.

It is similar to that found in plant cells, though the plant cell wall contains the polysaccharide cellulose.

2. Hyphae: These are thread-like strands which interconnect and bunch up into a mycelium ( Figure 6.13).
Ever see mold on a damp wall or on old bread? The things that you are seeing are really mycelia. The hyphae
and mycelia help the fungi absorb nutrients from other organisms. Most of the mycelium is hidden from view
deep within the fungal food source, such as rotting matter in the soil, leaf litter, rotting wood, or dead animals.
Fungi produce enzymes to digest cellulose and various other materials found in rotting matter, helping with
the decaying process.

3. Specialized structures for reproduction: One example is a fruiting body. Just like a fruit is involved in the
reproduction of a fruiting plant, a fruiting body is involved in the reproduction of a fungus. A mushroom is a
fruiting body, which is the part of the fungus that produces spores ( Figure 6.14). The spores are the basic
reproductive units of fungi. The mycelium remains hidden until it develops one or more fruiting bodies.

318

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Protists and Fungi

The fruiting bodies are usually produced at the surface of the food source, rather than hidden within it. This allows
the reproductive spores to be easily shed and carried away by the wind, water, or animals. The fruiting bodies are
usually the only indication that a fungus is present. Like icebergs, the fruiting bodies represent only a tiny fraction
of the whole fungus, with most of the fungus hidden from view.

FIGURE 6.13

which spores are produced.

Summary

• Fungi have a cell wall.
• The fungal body consists of thread-like structures called hyphae, which can bunch up into a mycelium.

6.10 Fungi Reproduction

• Describe asexual reproduction in fungi.
• Summarize sexual reproduction in fungi.

What’s this brown powder coming out of the fungus?
This is a "puffball" fungus. At maturity, clouds of a brown dust-like power escape when they are touched. This
powdery substance is made up of spores, the reproductive structure of the fungus.

Reproduction in Fungi

Different fungi reproduce in different ways. Many fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually. However, some
reproduce only sexually and some only asexually. Asexual reproduction involves just one parent and sexual repro-
duction involves two parents.

Asexual Reproduction

Through asexual reproduction, new organisms are produced that are genetically identical to the parent. That is,
they have exactly the same DNA. Fungi reproduce asexually through three methods:

1. Spores: Spores are formed by the fungi and released to create new fungi. This is the powdery substance
released by puffballs. Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some bacteria, plants, algae, fungi, and
protozoa. Theoretically, spores can reproduce asexually to produce countless offspring. Obviously this does
not happen. If it did, the world would be covered by genetically identical fungi.

2. Budding: The fungus grows a new part of its body, which eventually breaks off. The broken-off piece becomes

a “new” organism ( Figure 6.15).

321

6.10. Fungi Reproduction

www.ck12.org

3. Fragmentation: In this method, a piece of the mycelium, the body of the fungus, splits off. The resulting

fragment can eventually produce a new colony of fungi.

FIGURE 6.15
Yeast reproduce asexually by budding.

Asexual reproduction is faster and produces more fungi than sexual reproduction. This form of reproduction is
controlled by many different factors. Outside conditions, such as the availability of food, determine when a fungus
undergoes asexual reproduction.

Sexual Reproduction

Almost all fungi can reproduce sexually. But why reproduce sexually when asexual reproduction is much quicker?
Sexual reproduction brings together traits from the two parents. This increases the genetic diversity of the species.
In plants and animals, sexual reproduction occurs when sperm and egg from two parents join to make a new
individual. In fungi, however, two haploid hyphae meet together and their nuclei fuse. Instead of calling a hyphae
male or female, they have different mating types, such as (+) and (-) ( Figure 6.16).

FIGURE 6.16
The common mushroom, a fruiting body,
results after sexual reproduction when
two hyphae, one (+) and one (-), mate,
forming a mycelium with sporangia. No-
tice, when the sporangia burst, the spores
are released from the fruiting body.

6.11 Fungi Classiﬁcation

• Summarize characteristics that distinguish fungi from plants.
• List the three common types of fungi.

What’s growing on these oranges?
Mold, of course! Did you know that mold is a type of fungus? There are many different types of fungi besides molds,
however, including mushrooms. Mold and mushrooms are obviously different. So how are these fungi classiﬁed?

Fungi Classiﬁcation

Scientists used to think that fungi were members of the plant kingdom. They thought this because fungi had several
similarities to plants. For example:

• Fungi and plants have similar structures.
• Plants and fungi live in the same kinds of habitats, such as growing in soil.
• Plants and fungi cells both have a cell wall, which animals do not have.

How Fungi and Plants Differ

However, there are a number of characteristics that make fungi different from plants:

1. Fungi cannot make their own food like plants can, since they do not have chloroplasts and cannot carry out
photosynthesis. Fungi are more like animals because they are heterotrophs, as opposed to autotrophs, like
plants, that make their own food. Fungi have to obtain their food, nutrients and glucose, from outside sources.

324

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Protists and Fungi

2. The cell walls in many species of fungi contain chitin. Chitin is tough carbohydrate found in the shells of

animals such as beetles and lobsters. The cell wall of a plant is made of cellulose, not chitin.

3. Unlike many plants, most fungi do not have structures, such as xylem and phloem, that transfer water and

nutrients.

The Types of Fungi

The Kingdom Fungi can be broken down into several phyla. Each phyla has some unique traits. And even within
the same phyla there are many differences among the fungi. Various types of fungi are pictured below ( Table 6.2).
Notice how different each of these organisms are from one another.

6.12 Human Uses of Fungi

• Describe how fungi are important to humans.

What would happen if there were no fungi?
We’d be living in a huge trash pile! All the fallen leaves, grass clippings, dead trees, and other organic waste would
just build up. Fungi are important decomposers in the environment. Not only do they get rid of wastes, they make
the nutrients in the wastes available to other organisms. This is just one way that fungi are important to us.

Fungi Roles

Fungi are extremely important to the ecosystem because they are one of the major decomposers of organic material.
Decomposing organic material is how fungi acquire energy. But fungi have other roles in addition to being decom-
posers. How do fungi help people? They are used to help prepare food and beverages, and they have many other
uses.

Importance of Fungi for Human Use

• Yeasts are crucial for the fermentation process that makes beer, wine, and bread. Fermentation occurs in the

absence of oxygen and allows the ﬁrst step of cellular respiration, glycolysis, to continue.

• Some fungi are used in the production of soy sauce and tempeh, a source of protein used in Southeast Asia.
• Fungi can produce antibiotics, such as penicillin. Antibiotics are important medicines that kill bacteria, and
penicillin was the ﬁrst identiﬁed cure against many deadly bacterial species. Antibiotics only treat bacterial
diseases; they can not be used to treat viral or fungal diseases.

• Mushrooms are fungi that are eaten by people all over the globe.

Edible and Poisonous Fungi

Some of the best known types of fungi are mushrooms, which can be edible or poisonous ( Figure 6.18). Many
species are grown commercially, but others are harvested from the wild. When you order a pizza with mushrooms or
add them to your salad, you are most likely eating Agaricus bisporus, known as white or button mushrooms, the most
commonly eaten species. Other mushroom species are gathered from the wild for people to eat or for commercial
sale. Many mushroom species are poisonous to humans. Some mushrooms will simply give you a stomachache,

Have you ever eaten blue cheese? Do you know what makes it blue? You guessed it. A fungus. For certain types
of cheeses, producers add fungal spores to milk curds to promote the growth of mold, which makes the cheese blue.
Molds used in cheese production are safe for humans to eat.

Summary

Protists and Fungi are two types of eukaryotic organisms. What do they have in common? Protists are the earliest
eukaryotes, and this kingdom contains some of the simplest eukaryotes. Many are single-celled organisms. Protists
consist of animal-like, plant-like, and fungus-like species. Protists evolved into the other three types of eukaryotes,
including fungi. Other than that, these two types of eukaryotes are very different. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms
that cannot make their own food and do not "eat." They must absorb their nutrients, usually from decaying organisms.

Introduction

What exactly is a plant?
Does a plant have to be green? Do they all photosynthesize? They are eukaryotic organisms that are not animals,
fungi, or protists. And yes, they have to photosynthesize.

7.1. Plant Characteristics

7.1 Plant Characteristics

• Describe the three major characteristics of all plants.
• Explain the primary role of plants in ecosystems.

What is this?
You may be surprised that this is a picture of plants. They look a little like stones. In fact, these plants are often
called "living stones." Organisms don’t need to have big green leaves to be considered plants. What do you think
distinguishes plants from other organisms?

What are Plants?

Plants have adapted to a variety of environments, from the desert to the tropical rain forest to lakes and oceans. In
each environment, plants have become crucial to supporting animal life. Plants are the food that animals eat. Plants
also provide places for animals, such as insects and birds, to live; many birds build nests in plants. From tiny mosses
to gorgeous rose bushes to extremely large redwood trees ( Figure 7.1), the organisms in this kingdom, Kingdom
Plantae, have three main features. They are all:

1. Eukaryotic.
2. Photosynthetic.
3. Multicellular.

Recall that eukaryotic organisms also include animals, protists, and fungi. Eukaryotes have cells with nuclei that
contain DNA, and membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria. Photosynthesis is the process by which
plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air (and water) to make their own food, the

carbohydrate glucose. Plants have chloroplasts, the organelle of photosynthesis, and are known as producers and
autotrophs. Other organisms are heterotrophic consumers, meaning they must obtain their nutrients from another
organism, as these organisms lack chloroplasts. Lastly, plants must be multicellular, composed of more than one
cell. There are no single-celled plants. Recall that some protists, such as algae, are eukaryotic and photosynthetic
but are not considered plants. Unlike plants, algae is mostly unicellular.

dom, from tiny mosses to huge trees.

Summary

• Plants are multicellular and eukaryotic, meaning their cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
• Plants perform photosynthesis, the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon

dioxide from the air to make their own food.

7.2 Plants’ Adaptations for Life on Land

• Deﬁne cuticle, stomata, and vascular tissue as related to plants.
• Distinguish xylem from phloem.
• Describe plants’ major adaptations for life on land.

Where did plants come from?
Plants have not always been around on land. For a long time, life was conﬁned to water. The ﬁrst plants evolved
from green algae that looked somewhat like the Chara pictured above.

Plants’ Adaptations for Life on Land

The ﬁrst photosynthetic organisms were bacteria that lived in the water. So, where did plants come from? Evidence
shows that plants evolved from freshwater green algae, a protist ( Figure 7.2). The similarities between green algae
and plants is one piece of evidence. They both have cellulose in their cell walls, and they share many of the same
chemicals that give them color. So what separates green algae from green plants?
There are four main ways that plants adapted to life on land and, as a result, became different from algae:

1. In plants, the embryo develops inside of the female plant after fertilization. Algae do not keep the embryo

335

the beach.

inside of themselves but release it into water. This was the ﬁrst feature to evolve that separated plants from
green algae. This is also the only adaptation shared by all plants.

2. Over time, plants had to evolve from living in water to living on land. In early plants, a waxy layer called a
cuticle evolved to help seal water in the plant and prevent water loss. However, the cuticle also prevents gases
from entering and leaving the plant easily. Recall that the exchange of gasses—taking in carbon dioxide and
releasing oxygen—occurs during photosynthesis.

3. To allow the plant to retain water and exchange gases, small pores (holes) in the leaves called stomata also
evolved ( Figure 7.3). The stomata can open and close depending on weather conditions. When it’s hot and
dry, the stomata close to keep water inside of the plant. When the weather cools down, the stomata can open
again to let carbon dioxide in and oxygen out.

4. A later adaption for life on land was the evolution of vascular tissue. Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that
transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. In algae, vascular tissue is not necessary since the entire body
is in contact with the water, and the water simply enters the algae. But on land, water may only be found deep
in the ground. Vascular tissues take water and nutrients from the ground up into the plant, while also taking
food down from the leaves into the rest of the plant. The two vascular tissues are xylem and phloem. Xylem
is responsible for the transport of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant. Phloem carries
the sugars made in the leaves to the parts of the plant where they are needed.

Summary

• Plants evolved from freshwater green algae.
• Plants have evolved several adaptations to life on land, including embryo retention, a cuticle, stomata, and

vascular tissue.

7.3 Plant Reproduction and Life Cycle

• Deﬁne alternation of generations.
• Outline plants’ reproductive cycle.
• Distinguish a sporophyte from a gametophyte.

Do all plants have ﬂowers?
No, plants do not all have ﬂowers. For example, the mosses and ferns pictured here are both types of plants. However,
they never produce ﬂowers. They don’t produce seeds, either. They do, however, make tiny spores to reproduce.

Plant Reproduction and Life Cycle

The life cycle of a plant is very different from the life cycle of an animal. Humans are made entirely of diploid cells
(cells with two sets of chromosomes, referred to as ”2n”). Our only cells that are haploid cells (cells with one set
of chromosomes, ”n”) are sperm and egg cells. Plants, however, can live when they are are at the stage of having
haploid cells or diploid cells. If a plant has a haploid chromosome number of 20, what is the diploid chromosome
number? If the diploid chromosome number is 20, what is the haploid number?
Plants alternate between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell plants. This is called alternation of generations,
because the plant type alternates from generation to generation. In alternation of generations, the plant alternates
between a sporophyte that has diploid cells and a gametophyte that has haploid cells.
Alternation of generations can be summarized in the following four steps: follow along in the Figure 7.15 as you
read through the steps.

339

7.3. Plant Reproduction and Life Cycle

www.ck12.org

1. The haploid gametophyte produces the gametes, or sperm and egg, by mitosis. Remember, gametes are

haploid, having one set of chromosomes.

2. Then, the sperm fertilizes the egg, producing a diploid zygote that develops into the sporophyte, which of

course, is diploid.

3. The diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis.
4. The haploid spores go through mitosis, developing into the haploid gametophyte.

As we will see in additional Plants concepts, the generation in which the plant spends most of its life cycle is
different between various plants. In the plants that ﬁrst evolved, the gametophyte takes up the majority of the life
cycle of the plant. During the course of evolution, the sporophyte became the major stage of the life cycle of the
plant.

FIGURE 7.4
In ferns, the sporophyte is dominant and
produces spores that germinate into a
heart-shaped gametophyte.

Summary

• Plants undergo alternation of generations, meaning they alternate between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell

plants.

• During the course of evolution, the sporophyte (diploid) became the major stage of the life cycle of the plant.

7.4 Plant Classiﬁcation

• Explain how plants are classiﬁed.
• Distinguish vascular plants from nonvascular plants.
• Distinguish gymnosperms from angiosperms.

Do all plants grow from seeds?
No, there are actually a few plants that do not make seeds. Whether or not a plant makes seeds is one criteria used
to classify plants. How else could you distinguish between plants?

Plant Classiﬁcation

Plants are formally divided into 12 phyla (plural for phylum), and these phyla are gathered into four groups ( Figure
7.5). These four groups are based on the evolutionary history of signiﬁcant features in plants:

1. Nonvascular plants evolved ﬁrst. They are distinct from the algae because they keep the embryo inside of
the reproductive structure after fertilization. These plants do not have vascular tissue, xylem or phloem, to
transport nutrients, water, and food. Examples include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. Without vascular
tissue, these plants do not grow very tall.

2. Seedless vascular plants evolved to have vascular tissue after the nonvascular plants but do not have seeds.
Examples include the ferns, whisk ferns, club mosses, and horsetails. Vascular tissue allowed these plants to
grow taller.

3. Gymnosperms evolved to have seeds but do not have ﬂowers. Examples of gymnosperms include the
Redwood, Fir, and Cypress trees. Gymnos means "naked" in Greek; the seeds of gymnosperms are naked,
not protected by ﬂowers.

4. Flowering plants, or angiosperms, evolved to have vascular tissue, seeds, and ﬂowers. Examples of an-

giosperms include magnolia trees, roses, tulips, and tomatoes.

Nonvascular Seedless Plants

Chapter 7. Plants

Nonvascular seedless plants, as their name implies, lack vascular tissue. Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that
transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. As they lack vascular tissue, they also do not have true roots, stems,
or leaves. Nonvascular plants do often have a “leafy” appearance, though, and they can have stem-like and root-like
structures. These plants are very short because they cannot move nutrients and water up a stem.
Nonvascular seedless plants, also known as bryophytes, are classiﬁed into three phyla:

1. Mosses
2. Hornworts
3. Liverworts

Mosses

Mosses are most often recognized as the green “fuzz” on damp rocks and trees in a forest. If you look closely, you
will see that most mosses have tiny stem-like and leaf-like structures. This is the gametophyte stage. Remember that
a gametophyte is haploid, having only one set of chromosomes. The gametophyte produces the gametes that, after
fertilization, develop into the diploid sporophyte with two sets of chromosomes. The sporophyte forms a capsule,
called the sporangium, which releases spores ( Figure 7.6).

FIGURE 7.6
Sporophytes sprout up on stalks from this bed of moss gametophytes.
Notice that both the sporophytes and gametophytes exist at the same
time.

Hornworts

Hornworts are named for their appearance. The "horn" part of the name comes from their hornlike sporophytes,
and “wort” comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for herb. The hornlike sporophytes grow from a base of ﬂattened
lobes, which are the gametophytes ( Figure 7.7). They usually grow in moist and humid areas.

Liverworts

Liverworts have two distinct appearances: they can either be leafy like mosses or ﬂattened and ribbon-like. Liver-
worts get their name from the type with the ﬂattened bodies, which can resemble a liver ( Figure 7.8). Liverworts
can often be found along stream beds.

7.6 Vascular Seedless Plants

• Give properties of vascular seedless plants.
• Describe examples of vascular seedless plants.

How do these trees and mosses differ?
The trees tower in the sky, while the mosses carpet the forest ﬂoor. Mosses, like the ﬁrst plants, are restricted
to life near the ground because they lack vascular system. Only with a vascular system can these trees transport
sugars, nutrients, and water up and down their tall trunks. The evolution of the vascular system was a big step in the
evolutionary history of plants.

Vascular Seedless Plants

For these plants, the name says it all. Vascular seedless plants have vascular tissue but do not have seeds. Remember
that vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water and nutrients throughout the plant. The development
of vascular tissue allowed these plants to grow much taller than nonvascular plants, forming ancient swamp forests.
Most of these large vascular seedless plants are now extinct, but their smaller relatives still remain. Vascular tissue
includes xylem, which transports water from the roots to the rest of the plant; and phloem, which transports sugars
and nutrients from the leaves throughout the plant.
Seedless vascular plants include:

1. Clubmosses.
2. Ferns.
3. Horsetails.
4. Whisk ferns.

350

www.ck12.org

Clubmosses

Chapter 7. Plants

Clubmosses are so named because they can look similar to mosses ( Figure 7.9). Clubmosses are not true mosses,
though, because they have vascular tissue. The “club” part of the name comes from club-like clusters of sporangia
found on the plants. One type of clubmoss is called the "resurrection plant" because it shrivels and turns brown when
it dries out but then quickly turns green when watered again.

FIGURE 7.9
Clubmosses can resemble mosses; how-
ever, clubmosses have vascular tissue,
while mosses do not.

Ferns

Ferns are the most common seedless vascular plants ( Figure 7.10). They usually have large divided leaves called
fronds. In most ferns, fronds develop from a curled-up formation called a ﬁddlehead ( Figure 7.11). The ﬁddlehead
looks like the curled decoration on the end of a stringed instrument, such as a ﬁddle. Leaves unroll as the ﬁddleheads
grow and expand. Ferns grow in a variety of habitats, ranging in size from tiny aquatic species to giant tropical plants.

Horsetails

Horsetails have hollow, ribbed stems and are often found in marshes ( Figure 7.12). Whorls of tiny leaves around
the stem make the plant look like a horse’s tail, but these soon fall off and leave a hollow stem that can perform
photosynthesis. This is unusual since photosynthesis most often occurs in leaves. The stems are rigid and rough to
the touch because they are coated with a scratchy mineral. Because of their scratchy texture, these plants were once
used as scouring pads for cleaning dishes.

Whisk Ferns

Whisk ferns have green branching stems with no leaves, so they resemble a whisk broom ( Figure 7.13). Another
striking feature of the whisk ferns is its spherical yellow sporangia.

the plant.

7.7 Reproduction in Seedless Plants

• Describe reproductive beneﬁts of spores.
• Distinguish between a sporophyte and gametophyte.
• Outline the alternation of generations life cycle.

Have you ever noticed these little capsules on moss?
These tiny capsules produce spores. This is one stage in the process of reproduction in the mosses. Remember
mosses and other seedless plants do not have ﬂowers, so their life cycle is quite different from other plants.

Reproduction in Seedless Plants

Seedless plants can reproduce asexually or sexually. Some seedless plants, like hornworts and liverworts, can
reproduce asexually through fragmentation. When a small fragment of the plant is broken off, it can form a new
plant.

Reproduction in Nonvascular Seedless Plants

Like all plants, nonvascular plants have an alternation of generations life cycle. That means they alternate between
diploid cell stages (having two sets of chromosomes) and haploid cell stages (having one set of chromosomes)
during their life cycle. Recall the haploid stage is called the gametophyte, and the diploid stage is called the
sporophyte.
In the life cycle of the nonvascular seedless plants, the gametophyte stage is the longest part of the cycle. The
gametophyte is the green photosynthetic carpet that you would recognize as a moss.

355

7.7. Reproduction in Seedless Plants

www.ck12.org

The life cycle of nonvascular seedless plants can be described as follows:

1. The male gametophyte produces ﬂagellated sperm that must swim to the egg formed by the female game-
tophyte. For this reason, sexual reproduction must happen in the presence of water. Therefore, nonvascular
plants tend to live in moist environments. Though the life of a nonvascular seedless plant is a cycle, this can
be considered the initial step in the life cycle.

2. Following fertilization, the sporophyte forms. The sporophyte is connected to, and dependent on, the gameto-

phyte.

3. The sporophyte produces spores that will develop into gametophytes and start the cycle over again.

Reproduction in Seedless Vascular Plants

For the seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte stage is the longest part of the cycle, but the cycle is similar to
nonvascular plants. For example, in ferns, the gametophyte is a tiny heart-shaped structure, while the leafy plant we
recognize as a fern is the sporophyte.
The fern’s sporangia, where spores are produced, are often on the underside of the fronds ( Figure 7.14). Like
nonvascular plants, ferns also have ﬂagellated sperm that must swim to the egg. Unlike nonvascular plants, once
fertilization takes place, the gametophyte will die, and the sporophyte will live independently.

FIGURE 7.14
This fern is producing spores underneath
its fronds.

Summary

• In nonvascular seedless plants, the gametophyte (haploid) stage is the longest part of the cycle.
• In seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte (diploid) stage is the longest part of the cycle.

7.8 Importance of Seedless Plants

• Describe ways seedless plants impact humankind.

Where does electricity come from?
You probably have noticed these huge power lines delivering electricity across the country. But how is this electricity
generated? Although there are some alternate sources like wind power and nuclear power, the majority of electricity
in the United States is generated by burning coal. Seedless plants were central in forming the coal deposits that we
depend on.

Importance of Seedless Plants

Seedless plants have been tremendously useful to humans. Without these plants evolving millions of years ago, life
as we know it would be very different.

Seedless Plants Became Coal

The greatest inﬂuence seedless plants have had on human society is in the formation of coal millions of years ago.
When the seedless plants died, became buried deep in the Earth, and were exposed to heat and pressure, coal formed.
Coal is essentially made of the fossilized carbon from these plants. Now coal is burned to provide energy, such as
electricity.

358

Current Uses

Chapter 7. Plants

But some seedless plants still have uses in society today. Peat moss is commonly used by gardeners to improve
soils, since it is really good at absorbing and holding water ( Figure 7.16).
Depending on the location, ferns have several different uses worldwide. Ferns are found in many gardens as
ornaments, and are used as indoor plants. In tropical regions, the fern is used as a food source by many locals.
The fronds can also be used to weave hats and baskets. The ﬁddleheads of certain species of ferns are used in
gourmet food. Some species of ferns, such as the maidenhair fern, are used as medicines. In Southeast Asia, the fern
is used in rice ﬁelds as a biological fertilizer. Much of the world’s fossil fuels consist of remains of ferns and their
relatives.
The horsetail’s reedy exterior and silica content made it popular as a metal polisher and abrasive cleanser. Herbalists
still use horsetail to treat a variety of kidney/bladder problems, including inﬂammation, infection, and kidney stones,
and it is used as a remedy for brittle nails. Club moss is also used to treat kidney ailments and digestive problems.
Club moss spores can be dusted onto the skin and provide relief from itching and irritation, and provide the skin
with protection. Extinct forests of club moss have fossilized and developed into huge beds of coal.

Summary

• Seedless plants were responsible for the formation of coal millions of years ago.
• Two ways that gardeners utilize seedless plants are peat moss as a soil amendment and ferns as ornamental

plants.

7.9 Seeds and Seed Dispersal

• Describe the importance of the seed.
• Explain how seeds are dispersed.

Why are seeds important?
Many important crops, such as corn, are planted and harvested as seeds. These seeds are important sources of food.
For example, corn is ground into feed for chickens and cows. And corn syrup is used to sweeten beverages and
candy. But most importantly, seeds are the starting point for a new plant.

Seeds and Seed Dispersal

Plants seem to grow wherever they can. How? Plants can’t move on their own. So how does a plant start growing in
a new area?

What is a Seed?

If you’ve ever seen a plant grow from a tiny seed, then you might realize that seeds are amazing structures. A seed
is a plant ovule containing an embryo. The seed allows a plant embryo to survive droughts, harsh winters, and other
conditions that would kill an adult plant. The tiny plant embryo can simply stay dormant, in a resting state, and
wait for the perfect environment to begin to grow. In fact, some seeds can stay dormant for hundreds of years!
Another impressive feature of the seed is that it stores food for the young plant after it sprouts. This greatly increases
the chances that the tiny plant will survive. So being able to produce a seed is a beneﬁcial adaptation, and, as a
result, seed plants have been very successful. Although the seedless plants were here on Earth ﬁrst, today there are
many more seed plants than seedless plants.

7.9. Seeds and Seed Dispersal

How are Seed Plants Successful?

www.ck12.org

For a seed plant species to be successful, the seeds must be dispersed, or scattered around in various directions. If
the seeds are spread out in many different areas, there is a better chance that some of the seeds will ﬁnd the right
conditions to grow. But how do seeds travel to places they have never been before? To aid with seed dispersal, some
plants have evolved special features that help their seeds travel over long distances.
One such strategy is to allow the wind to carry the seeds. With special adaptations in the seeds, the seeds can be
carried long distances by the wind. For example, you might have noticed how the "ﬂuff" of a dandelion moves in
the wind. Each piece of ﬂuff carries a seed to a new location. If you look under the scales of pine cone, you will
see tiny seeds with "wings" that allow these seeds to be carried away by the wind. Maple trees also have specialized
fruits with wing-like parts that help seed dispersal ( Figure 7.17).

FIGURE 7.17
Maple trees have fruits with “wings” that help the wind disperse the seeds.

Some ﬂowering plants grow ﬂeshy fruit that helps disperse their seeds. When animals eat the fruit, the seeds pass
through an animal’s digestive tract unharmed. The seeds germinate after they are passed out with the animal’s feces.
Berries, citrus fruits, cherries, apples, and a variety of other types of fruits are all adapted to be attractive to animals,
so the animals will eat them and disperse the seed ( Figure 7.18). Some non-ﬂeshy fruits are specially adapted for
animals to carry them on their fur. You might have returned from a walk in the woods to ﬁnd burrs stuck to your
socks. These burrs are actually specialized fruits designed to carry seeds to a new location.

Summary

• The seed contains a dormant embryo and stored food.
• Fruits are adapted to disperse seeds with the help of animals or the wind.

7.10. Gymnosperms

www.ck12.org

7.10 Gymnosperms

• Deﬁne gymnosperm.
• List the four phyla of gymnosperms.
• Give examples of gymnosperms.

What does "gymnasium" mean?
Today a gymnasium means a place for playing indoor sports. In ancient Greece, sports were done in the nude, so the
word "gymnasium" is based on the Greek word for naked (gymnos). The root word is the same for "gymnosperm,"
which means "naked seed." Gymnosperms are those plants that do not have a fruit encasing the seed.

Gymnosperms

Gymnosperms have seeds, but they do not produce fruit. Instead, the seeds of gymnosperms are usually found in
cones.
There are four phyla of gymnosperms:

364

www.ck12.org

1. Conifers
2. Cycads
3. Ginkgoes
4. Gnetophytes

Conifers

Chapter 7. Plants

Conifers, members of the phylum Coniferophyta, are probably the gymnosperms that are most familiar to you.
Conifers include trees such as pines, ﬁrs, spruces, cedars, and the coastal redwood trees in California, which are the
tallest living vascular plants.
Conifers have their reproductive structures in cones, but they are not the only plants to have that trait ( Figure 7.19).
Conifer pollen cones are usually very small, while the seed cones are larger. Pollen contains gametophytes that
produce the male gamete of seed plants. The pollen, which is a powder-like substance, is carried by the wind to
fertilize the seed cones that contain the female gamete ( Figure 7.20).

FIGURE 7.19
A red pine, which bears seeds in cones,
is an example of a conifer.

Conifers have many uses. They are important sources of lumber and are also used to make paper. Resins, the sticky
substance you might see oozing out of a wound on a pine tree, are collected from conifers to make a variety of
products, such as the solvent turpentine and the rosin used by musicians and baseball players. The sticky rosin
improves the pitcher’s hold on the ball or increases the friction between the bow and the strings to help create music
from a violin or other stringed instrument.

Cycads

Cycads, in the phylum Cycadophyta, are also gymnosperms. They have large, ﬁnely-divided leaves and grow as
short shrubs and trees in tropical regions. Like conifers, they produce cones, but the seed cones and pollen cones are
always on separate plants ( Figure 7.21). One type of cycad, the Sago Palm, is a popular landscape plant. During
the Age of the Dinosaurs (about 65 to 200 million years ago), cycads were the dominant plants. So you can imagine
dinosaurs grazing on cycad seeds and roaming through cycad forests.

FIGURE 7.20
The end of a pine tree branch bears the
male cones that produce the pollen.

FIGURE 7.21
Cycads bear their pollen and seeds in
cones on separate plants.

Ginkgoes

Ginkgoes, in the phylum Ginkgophyta, are unique because they are the only species left in the phylum. Many other
species in the fossil record have gone extinct ( Figure 7.22). The ginkgo tree is sometimes called a "living fossil"
because it is the last species from its phylum.
One reason the ginkgo tree may have survived is because it was often grown around Buddhist temples, especially in
China. The ginkgo tree is also a popular landscape tree today in American cities because it can live in polluted areas
better than most plants.

366

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Plants

Ginkgoes, like cycads, has separate female and male plants. The male trees are usually preferred for landscaping
because the seeds produced by the female plants smell terrible when they ripen.

FIGURE 7.22
Ginkgo trees are gymnosperms with
broad leaves.

Gnetophytes

Gnetophytes, in the phylum Gnetophyta, are a very small and unusual group of plants. Ephedra is an important
member of this group, since this desert shrub produces the ephedrine used to treat asthma and other conditions.
Welwitschia produces extremely long leaves and is found in the deserts of southwestern Africa ( Figure 7.23).
Overall, there are about 70 different species in this diverse phylum.

7.11 Angiosperms

• Deﬁne angiosperm.
• List and deﬁne the major parts of the ﬂower.
• Distinguish self-pollination from cross-fertilization.

Why do plants make fruit?
When this bird eats a berry, it also consumes the seeds contained inside. The bird may ﬂy for many miles before
digestion is complete and the seeds are excreted. This allows the plant to spread its seeds to a new location. For this
reason, plants that make fruits have been very successful.

Angiosperms

Angiosperms, in the phylum Anthophyta, are the most successful phylum of plants. This category also contains the
largest number of individual plants ( Figure 7.24). Angiosperms evolved the structure of the ﬂower, so they are also
called the ﬂowering plants. Angiosperms live in a variety of different environments. A water lily, an oak tree, and a
barrel cactus, although different, are all angiosperms.

The Parts of a Flower

Even though ﬂowers may look very different from each other, they do have some structures in common. The
structures are explained in the picture below ( Figure 7.25).

• The green outside of a ﬂower that often looks like a leaf is called the sepal ( Figure 7.26). All of the sepals

together are called the calyx, which is usually green and protects the ﬂower before it opens.

FIGURE 7.24
Angiosperms are the ﬂowering plants.

FIGURE 7.25
A complete ﬂower has sepals, petals, sta-
mens, and one or more carpels.

• All of the petals ( Figure 7.26) together are called the corolla. They are bright and colorful to attract a
particular pollinator, an animal that carries pollen from one ﬂower to another. Examples of pollinators include
birds and insects.

• The next structure is the stamen, consisting of the stalk-like ﬁlament that holds up the anther, or pollen sac.

The pollen, which is found at the top of the stamen, is the male gametophyte.

• At the very center is the carpel, which is divided into three different parts: (1) the sticky stigma, where the

pollen lands, (2) the tube of the style, and (3) the large, bottom part, known as the ovary.

The ovary holds the ovules, the female gametophytes. When the ovules are fertilized, the ovule becomes the seed
and the ovary becomes the fruit.
The following table summarizes the parts of the ﬂower ( Table 7.1).

FIGURE 7.26
This image shows the difference between
a petal and a sepal.

How Do Angiosperms Reproduce?

Flowering plants can reproduce two different ways:

1. Self-pollination: Pollen falls on the stigma of the same ﬂower. This way, a seed will be produced that can turn

into a genetically identical plant.

2. Cross-fertilization: Pollen from one ﬂower travels to a stigma of a ﬂower on another plant. Pollen travels from
ﬂower to ﬂower by wind or by animals. Flowers that are pollinated by animals such as birds, butterﬂies, or
bees are often colorful and provide nectar, a sugary reward, for their animal pollinators.

Why Are Angiosperms Important to Humans?

Angiosperms are important to humans in many ways, but the most signiﬁcant role of angiosperms is as food. Wheat,
rye, corn, and other grains are all harvested from ﬂowering plants. Starchy foods, such as potatoes, and legumes,
such as beans, are also angiosperms. And, as mentioned previously, fruits are a product of angiosperms that increase
seed dispersal and are nutritious.
There are also many non-food uses of angiosperms that are important to society. For example, cotton and other
plants are used to make cloth, and hardwood trees are used for lumber.

Summary

• Angiosperms are plants that produce ﬂowers and fruit.
• Angiosperms can be self-pollinated, meaning pollen falls on the stigma of the same ﬂower, or cross-fertilized,

during which pollen from one ﬂower travels to a stigma of a ﬂower on another plant.

7.12 Plant Hormones

• Deﬁne hormone.
• Deﬁne abscission and apical dominance.
• List the major types of plant hormones.
• Describe the main functions of plant hormones.

How do fruits know when to fall?
Fruits, such as these peaches, do not leave their trees until it’s the right time. The seeds are mature, and the fruit
is ripe. But what tells the fruits it’s time to drop? The signal that is sent through the tree is a type of hormone.
Hormones also send signals through your body.

Plant Hormones

Plants may not move, but that does not mean they don’t respond to their environment. Plants can sense gravity, light,
touch, and seasonal changes. For example, you might have noticed how a house plant bends toward a bright window.
Plants can sense and then grow toward the source of light. Scientists say that plants are able to respond to "stimuli,"
or something—usually in the environment—that results in a response. For instance, light is the stimulus, and the
plant moving toward the light is the "response."
Hormones are special chemical messengers molecules that help organisms, including plants, respond to stimuli
in their environment. In order for plants to respond to the environment, their cells must be able to communicate
with other cells. Hormones send messages between the cells. Animals, like humans, also have hormones, such as
testosterone or estrogen, to carry messages from cell to cell. In both plants and animals, hormones travel from cell
to cell in response to a stimulus; they also activate a speciﬁc response.

374

www.ck12.org

Types of Plant Hormones

Chapter 7. Plants

Five different types of plant hormones are involved in the main responses of plants, and they each have different
functions ( Table 7.2).

TABLE 7.2: Plant Hormones

Hormone
Ethylene
Gibberellins
Cytokinins
Abscisic Acid
Auxins

Ethylene

Function
Fruit ripening and abscission
Break the dormancy of seeds and buds; promote growth
Promote cell division; prevent senescence
Close the stomata; maintain dormancy
Involved in tropisms and apical dominance

The hormone ethylene has two functions. It (1) helps ripen fruit and (2) is involved in the process of abscission,
the dropping of leaves, fruits, and ﬂowers. When a ﬂower is done blooming or a fruit is ripe and ready to be eaten,
ethylene causes the petals or fruit to fall from a plant ( Figure 7.27 and Figure 7.28).
Ethylene is an unusual plant hormone because it is a gas. That means it can move through the air, and a ripening
apple can cause another apple to ripen, or even over-ripen. That’s why one rotten apple spoils the whole barrel!
Some farmers spray their green peppers with ethylene gas to cause them to ripen faster and become red peppers.
You can try to see how ethylene works by putting a ripe apple or banana with another unripe fruit in a closed
container or paper bag. What do you think will happen to the unripe fruit?

petals to fall

known as abscission.

Gibberellins

Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the
stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants.
Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure 7.29). Another function of
gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to
germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open.

FIGURE 7.29
Dwarf plants like this bonsai tree often
have unusually low concentrations of gib-
berellins.

Cytokinins

Cytokinins are hormones that cause plant cells to divide. Cytokinins were discovered from attempts to grow plant
tissue in artiﬁcial environments ( Figure 7.30). Cytokinins prevent the process of aging (senescence). So ﬂorists
sometimes apply cytokinins to cut ﬂowers, so they do not get old and die.

FIGURE 7.30
Cytokinins promote cell division and are
necessary for growing plants in tissue cul-
ture. A small piece of a plant is placed
in sterile conditions to regenerate a new
plant.

Abscisic Acid

Abscisic acid is misnamed because it was once believed to play a role in abscission (the dropping of leaves, fruits,
and ﬂowers), but we now know abscission is caused by ethylene. The actual role of abscisic acid is to close the
stomata, the tiny openings in leaves that allow substances to enter and leave, and to maintain dormancy. When a
plant is stressed due to lack of water, abscisic acid tells the stomata to close. This prevents water loss through the
stomata.
When the environment is not good for a seed to germinate, abscisic acid signals for the dormancy period of the seed
to continue. Abscisic acid also tells the buds of plants to stay in the dormancy stage. When conditions improve, the
levels of abscisic acid drop and the levels of gibberellins increase, signaling that is time to break dormancy ( Figure
7.31).

Auxins

Auxins are hormones that play a role in plant growth. Auxins produced at the tip of the plant are involved in apical
dominance, when the main central stem grows more strongly than other stems and branches. When the tip of the
plant is removed, the auxins are no longer present, and the side branches begin to grow. This is why pruning a
plant by cutting off the main branches helps produce a fuller plant with more branches. You actually need to cut
branches off of a plant for it to grow more branches! Auxins are also involved in tropisms, responses to stimuli in
the environment

7.13 Tropisms

• Deﬁne tropism.
• Distinguish phototropism from gravitropism and from thigmotropism.

Why are these plants turning sideways?
Plants respond to their environment in how they grow. In this picture, the light source is probably off to the left side.
As a result, the plants grow in this direction to get more light.

Tropisms

Plants may not be able to move to another location, but they are able to change how they grow in response to their
environment. Growth toward or away from a stimulus is known as a tropism ( Table 7.3). Auxins, a class of plant
hormones, allow plants to curve in speciﬁc directions as they grow. The auxin moves to one side of the stem, where
it starts a chain of events that cause rapid cell growth on just that one side of the stem. With one side of the stem
growing faster than the other, the plant begins to bend.

Phototropism

www.ck12.org

You might have noticed that plants bend toward the light. This is an example of a tropism where light is the stimulus,
known as phototropism ( Figure 7.32). To obtain more light for photosynthesis, leaves and stems grow toward the
light. On the other hand, roots grow away from light. This is beneﬁcial for the roots, because they need to obtain
water and nutrients from deep within the ground.

FIGURE 7.32
These seedlings bending toward the sun
are displaying phototropism.

Gravitropism

So, how do the roots of seeds underground know to grow downward? How do the roots deep in the soil know which
way is up? Gravitropism is a growth toward or away from the pull of gravity ( Figure 7.33). Shoots, the new
growth of a plant, also show a gravitropism, but in the opposite direction. If you place a plant on its side, the stem
and new leaves will curve upward.

FIGURE 7.33
This shoot is exhibiting gravitropism: it is
growing against the pull of gravity.

www.ck12.org

Thigmotropism

Chapter 7. Plants

Plants also have a touch response called thigmotropism. If you have ever seen a morning glory or the tendrils of a
pea plant twist around a pole, then you know that plants must be able to sense the pole. Thigmotropism works much
like the other tropisms. The plant grows straight until it comes in contact with the pole. Then, the side of the stem
that is in contact with the pole grows slower than the opposite side of the stem. This causes the stem to bend around
the pole.

Summary

• Tropisms are growth toward or away from a stimulus.
• Types of tropisms include gravitropism (gravity), phototropism (light), and thigmotropism (touch).

7.14 Seasonal Changes in Plants

• Describe how plants sense changes of season.
• Explain photoperiodism.

How does this plant know it’s Christmas?
This plant is known as a Christmas cactus because it only blooms once a year, during the Christmas season. But
plants can’t read a calendar. How can a houseplant know the time of the year?

Seasonal Changes

Have you seen the leaves of plants change colors? During what time of year does this happen? What causes it to
happen? Plants can sense changes in the seasons. Leaves change color and drop each autumn in some climates (
Figure 7.34).
Certain ﬂowers, like poinsettias, only bloom during the winter. And, in the spring, the winter buds on the trees break
open, and the leaves start to grow. How do plants detect time of year?
Although you might detect seasonal changes by the change in temperature, this is not the way in which plants know
the seasons are changing. Plants determine the time of year by the length of daylight, known as the photoperiod.
Because of the tilt of the Earth, during winter days, there are less hours of light than during summer days. That’s
why, in the winter, it starts getting dark very early in the evening, and then stays dark while you’re getting ready for
school the next morning. But in the summer it will be bright early in the morning, and the sun will not set until late
that night. With a light-sensitive chemical, plants can sense the differences in day length.

382

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Plants

FIGURE 7.34
Leaves changing color is a response to
the shortened length of the day in autumn.

For example, in the fall, when the days start to get shorter, the trees sense that there is less sunlight. The plant is
stimulated, and it sends messages telling the leaves to change colors and fall. This is an example of photoperiodism,
the reaction of organisms, such as plants, to the length of day or night. Photoperiodism is also the reaction of plants
to the length of light and dark periods. Many ﬂowering plants sense the length of night, a dark period, as a signal
to ﬂower. Each plant has a different photoperiod, or night length. When the plant senses the appropriate length
of darkness, resulting in an appropriate length of daylight, it ﬂowers. Flowering plants are classiﬁed as long-day
plants or short-day plants. Long-day plants ﬂower when the length of daylight exceeds the necessary photoperiod,
and short-day plants ﬂower when the day length is shorter than the necessary photoperiod. Long-day plants include
carnations, clover, lettuce, wheat, and turnips. Short-day plants include cotton, rice, and sugar cane.

Summary

• Plants can respond to the change of season by losing their leaves, ﬂowering, or breaking dormancy.
• Plants go through seasonal changes after detecting differences in day length.

Summary

The Kingdom Plantae ranges from small nonvascular plants to towering redwood trees. It is probable that without
plants, most life, including us, would not exist. Why? Photosynthesis. This process brings energy into our
ecosystems and produces the oxygen that all of our cells need. This concept discusses the types of plants, the
structures of plants, reproduction of plants, and the adaptations and responses of plants.

Introduction

Fighting or playing?
You might think that these young tigers are ﬁghting, but they’re really just playing. Like most other young mammals,
tigers like to play. Why do mammals play? Is playing just for fun, or does it serve some other purpose as well?
Playing is actually an important way of learning. By playing, these tigers are learning moves that will help them
become successful predators as adults. Playing is just one of many ways that mammals and other animals learn how
to behave.

Barking, purring, and playing are just some of the ways in which dogs and cats behave. These are examples of

about the behaviors. Think about why the animal is behaving that way.

FIGURE 8.1
These pictures show examples of animal
behaviors. Why do the animals behave
these ways?

Importance of Animal Behavior

Why do animals behave the way they do? The answer to this question depends on what the behavior is. A cat chases
a mouse to catch it. A mother dog nurses her puppies to feed them. All of these behaviors have the same purpose:
getting or providing food. All animals need food for energy. They need energy to move around. In fact, they need
energy just to stay alive. Energy allows all the processes inside cells to occur. Baby animals also need energy to
grow and develop.
Birds and wasps build nests to have a safe place to store their eggs and raise their young. Many other animals build
nests for the same reason. Animals protect their young in other ways, as well. For example, a mother dog not only
nurses her puppies. She also washes them with her tongue and protects them from strange people or other animals.
All of these behaviors help the young survive and grow up to be adults.
Rabbits run away from foxes and other predators to stay alive. Their speed is their best defense. Lizards sun
themselves on rocks to get warm because they cannot produce their own body heat. When they are warmer, they can
move faster and be more alert. This helps them escape from predators and also ﬁnd food.
All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young
survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the
animals’ ﬁtness. Animals with higher ﬁtness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation.
If genes control behaviors that increase ﬁtness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs
through the process of evolution by natural selection.

Summary

• Animal behavior is any way that animals act, either alone or with other animals.
• Animal behavior may be aimed at getting food for energy, making sure their young survive, or ensuring that

they, themselves, survive.

8.2 Learned Behavior of Animals

• Distinguish between learned behavior and innate behavior.
• Describe habituation.
• Explain observational learning
• Give examples of conditioning.
• Summarize learning by playing.
• Deﬁne insight learning.

Do you play a sport?
If you play a sport like soccer, then you realize it takes a lot of work. Remember how you didn’t know at all what you
were doing when you ﬁrst started? You had rules to ﬁgure out and skills to practice. Playing a sport is an example
of a learned behavior.

Learned Behavior

Just about all human behaviors are learned. Learned behavior is behavior that occurs only after experience or
practice. Learned behavior has an advantage over innate behavior: it is more ﬂexible. Learned behavior can be
changed if conditions change. For example, you probably know the route from your house to your school. Assume

391

8.2. Learned Behavior of Animals

www.ck12.org

that you moved to a new house in a different place, so you had to take a different route to school. What if following
the old route was an innate behavior? You would not be able to adapt. Fortunately, it is a learned behavior. You can
learn the new route just as you learned the old one.
Although most animals can learn, animals with greater intelligence are better at learning and have more learned
behaviors. Humans are the most intelligent animals. They depend on learned behaviors more than any other species.
Other highly intelligent species include apes, our closest relatives in the animal kingdom. They include chimpanzees
and gorillas. Both are also very good at learning behaviors.
You may have heard of a gorilla named Koko. The psychologist, Dr. Francine Patterson, raised Koko. Dr. Patterson
wanted to ﬁnd out if gorillas could learn human language. Starting when Koko was just one year old, Dr. Patterson
taught her to use sign language. Koko learned to use and understand more than 1,000 signs. Koko showed how much
gorillas can learn. See A Conversation with Koko at http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/koko .
Think about some of the behaviors you have learned. They might include riding a bicycle, using a computer, and
playing a musical instrument or sport. You probably did not learn all of these behaviors in the same way. Perhaps
you learned some behaviors on your own, just by practicing. Other behaviors you may have learned from other
people. Humans and other animals can learn behaviors in several different ways.
The following methods of learning will be explored below:

1. Habituation (forming a habit)
2. Observational learning
3. Conditioning
4. Play
5. Insight learning

Habituation

Habituation is learning to get used to something after being exposed to it for a while. Habituation usually involves
getting used to something that is annoying or frightening, but not dangerous. Habituation is one of the simplest ways
of learning. It occurs in just about every species of animal.
You have probably learned through habituation many times. For example, maybe you were reading a book when
someone turned on a television in the same room. At ﬁrst, the sound of the television may have been annoying. After
a while, you may no longer have noticed it. If so, you had become habituated to the sound.
Another example of habituation is shown below ( Figure 8.2). Crows and most other birds are usually afraid of
people. They avoid coming close to people, or they ﬂy away when people come near them. The crows landing on
this scarecrow have become used to a “human” in this place. They have learned that the scarecrow poses no danger.
They are no longer afraid to come close. They have become habituated to the scarecrow.
Can you see why habituation is useful? It lets animals ignore things that will not harm them. Without habituation,
animals might waste time and energy trying to escape from things that are not really dangerous.

Observational Learning

Observational learning is learning by watching and copying the behavior of someone else. Human children learn
many behaviors this way. When you were a young child, you may have learned how to tie your shoes by watching
your dad tie his shoes. More recently, you may have learned how to dance by watching a pop star dancing on TV.
Most likely, you have learned how to do math problems by watching your teachers do problems on the board at
school. Can you think of other behaviors you have learned by watching and copying other people?
Other animals also learn through observational learning. For example, young wolves learn to be better hunters
by watching and copying the skills of older wolves in their pack. Another example of observational learning is

Chapter 8. Animals

FIGURE 8.2
This scarecrow is no longer scary to this crow. The crow has become
used to its being in this spot and learned that it is not dangerous. This is
an example of habituation.

how some monkeys have learned to wash their food. They learned by watching and copying the behavior of other
monkeys.

Conditioning

Conditioning is a way of learning that involves a reward or punishment. Did you ever train a dog to fetch a ball
or stick by rewarding it with treats? If you did, you were using conditioning. Another example of conditioning is
shown in the video below; the rats have been taught to “play basketball” by being rewarded with food pellets. What
do you think would happen if the rats were no longer rewarded for this behavior?

MEDIA

URL: http://www.ck12.org/ﬂx/render/embeddedobject/75743

Conditioning also occurs in wild animals. For example, bees learn to ﬁnd nectar in certain types of ﬂowers because
they have found nectar in those ﬂowers before.
Humans learn behaviors through conditioning, as well. A young child might learn to put away his toys by being
rewarded with a bedtime story. An older child might learn to study for tests in school by being rewarded with better
grades. Can you think of behaviors you have learned by being rewarded for them?
Conditioning does not always involve a reward. It can involve a punishment, instead. A toddler might be punished
with a time-out each time he grabs a toy from his baby brother. After several time-outs, he may learn to stop taking
his brother’s toys.
A dog might be scolded each time she jumps up on the sofa. After repeated scolding, she may learn to stay off the
sofa. A bird might become ill after eating a poisonous insect. The bird may learn from this “punishment” to avoid
eating the same kind of insect in the future.

Learning by Playing

Most young mammals, including humans, like to play. Play is one ways they learn the skills that they will need as
adults. Think about how kittens play. They pounce on toys and chase each other. This helps them learn how to be

393

8.2. Learned Behavior of Animals

www.ck12.org

better predators when they are older. Big cats also play. The lion cubs pictured below are playing and practicing
their hunting skills at the same time ( Figure 8.3). The dogs are playing tug-of-war with a toy ( Figure 8.3). What
do you think they are learning by playing together this way?
Other young animals play in different ways. For example, young deer play by running and kicking up their hooves.
This helps them learn how to escape from predators.

They are not only having fun, but they are

play ﬁghting can help them learn how to

Human children learn by playing as well. For example, playing games and sports can help them learn to follow rules
and work with others. The toddlers pictured below are playing in the sand ( Figure 8.4). They are learning about
the world through play. What do you think they might be learning?

FIGURE 8.4
Playing in a sandbox is fun for young
children. It can also help them learn about
the world.

Insight Learning

Insight learning is learning from past experiences and reasoning. It usually involves coming up with new ways
to solve problems. Insight learning generally happens quickly. An animal has a sudden ﬂash of insight. Insight
learning requires relatively great intelligence. Human beings use insight learning more than any other species. They
have used their intelligence to solve problems ranging from inventing the wheel to ﬂying rockets into space.
Think about problems you have solved. Maybe you ﬁgured out how to solve a new type of math problem or how to
get to the next level of a video game. If you relied on your past experiences and reasoning to do it, then you were
using insight learning.

Chapter 8. Animals

One type of insight learning is making tools to solve problems. Scientists used to think that humans were the only
animals intelligent enough to make tools.
In fact, tool-making was believed to set humans apart from all other
animals.
In 1960, primate expert Jane Goodall discovered that chimpanzees also make tools. She saw a chimpanzee strip
leaves from a twig. Then he poked the twig into a hole in a termite mound. After termites climbed onto the twig,
he pulled the twig out of the hole and ate the insects clinging to it. The chimpanzee had made a tool to “ﬁsh” for
termites. He had used insight to solve a problem. Since then, chimpanzees have been seen making several different
types of tools. For example, they sharpen sticks and use them as spears for hunting. They use stones as hammers to
crack open nuts.
Scientists have also observed other species of animals making tools to solve problems. A crow was seen bending a
piece of wire into a hook. Then the crow used the hook to pull food out of a tube.
An example of a gorilla using a walking stick is shown below ( Figure 8.5). Behaviors such as these show that other
species of animals can use their experience and reasoning to solve problems. They can learn through insight.

FIGURE 8.5
This gorilla is using a branch as a tool. She is leaning on it to keep her
balance while she reaches down into swampy water to catch a ﬁsh.

8.3 Innate Behavior of Animals

• Explain and give examples of innate behavior.
• Describe reﬂex behaviors in humans.

How do kittens know how to "hunt"?
This kitten was probably adopted and separated from its mother at a young age. It never got a lesson in how to stalk
and pounce on prey. So how does this kitten know how to attack the ball of yarn? Some behaviors do not need to be
learned.

Innate Behavior

Many animal behaviors are ways that animals act, naturally. They don’t have to learn how to behave in these ways.
Cats are natural-born hunters. They don’t need to learn how to hunt. Spiders spin their complex webs without
learning how to do it from other spiders. Birds and wasps know how to build nests without being taught. These
behaviors are called innate.
An innate behavior is any behavior that occurs naturally in all animals of a given species. An innate behavior is also
called an instinct. The ﬁrst time an animal performs an innate behavior, the animal does it well. The animal does
not have to practice the behavior in order to get it right or become better at it. Innate behaviors are also predictable.
All members of a species perform an innate behavior in the same way. From the examples described above, you can
probably tell that innate behaviors usually involve important actions, like eating and caring for the young.
There are many other examples of innate behaviors. For example, did you know that honeybees dance? The
honeybee pictured below has found a source of food ( Figure 8.6). When the bee returns to its hive, it will do
a dance. This dance is called the waggle dance. The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive
where to ﬁnd the food. Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees, so it is an innate
behavior.
Besides building nests, birds have other innate behaviors. One example occurs in gulls, which are pictured below (
Figure 8.7); one of the chicks is pecking at a red spot on the mother’s beak. This innate behavior causes the mother

FIGURE 8.6
When this honeybee goes back to its hive,
it will do a dance to tell the other bees in
the hive where it found food.

to feed the chick. In many other species of birds, the chicks open their mouths wide whenever the mother returns to
the nest ( Figure 8.7). This innate behavior, called gaping, causes the mother to feed them.

FIGURE 8.7
Left: This mother gull will feed her chick
after it pecks at a red spot on her beak.
Both pecking and feeding behaviors are
innate. Right: When these baby birds
open their mouths wide, their mother in-
stinctively feeds them. This innate behav-
ior is called gaping.

Another example of innate behavior in birds is egg rolling. It happens in some species of water birds, like the graylag
goose ( Figure 8.8). Graylag geese make nests on the ground. If an egg rolls out of the nest, a mother goose uses
her bill to push it back into the nest. Returning the egg to the nest helps ensure that the egg will hatch.

Innate Behavior in Human Beings

All animals have innate behaviors, even human beings. Can you think of human behaviors that do not have to be
learned? Chances are, you will have a hard time thinking of any. The only truly innate behaviors in humans are
called reﬂex behaviors. They occur mainly in babies. Like innate behaviors in other animals, reﬂex behaviors in
human babies may help them survive.
An example of a reﬂex behavior in babies is the sucking reﬂex. Newborns instinctively suck on a nipple that is
placed in their mouth. It is easy to see how this behavior evolved. It increases the chances of a baby feeding and
surviving. Another example of a reﬂex behavior in babies is the grasp reﬂex ( Figure 8.9). Babies instinctively grasp
an object placed in the palm of their hand. Their grip may be surprisingly strong. How do you think this behavior
might increase a baby’s chances of surviving?

This female graylag goose is a ground-
nesting water bird. Before her chicks
hatch, the mother protects the eggs. She

nest if they roll out. This is an example
of an innate behavior. How could this
behavior increase the goose’s ﬁtness?

8.4 Animal Communication

• Deﬁne communication.
• List and describe methods of animal communication.
• Explain human communication.

How do monkeys communicate?
You won’t ﬁnd a monkey texting a friend. They make noises. They make faces. They even use scents to pass along
a message. Just because monkeys don’t talk like you and me doesn’t mean that they don’t communicate!

Communication

What does the word "communication" make you think of? Talking on a cell phone? Texting? Writing? Those are just
a few of the ways in which human beings communicate. Most other animals also communicate. Communication is
any way in which animals share information, and they do this in many different ways.
Do all animals talk to each other? Probably not, but many do communicate. Like human beings, many other animals
live together in groups. Some insects, including ants and bees, are well known for living in groups. In order for
animals to live together in groups, they must be able to communicate with each other.
Animal communication, like most other animal behaviors, increases the ability to survive and have offspring. This is
known as ﬁtness. Communication increases ﬁtness by helping animals ﬁnd food, defend themselves from predators,
mate, and care for offspring.

Communication with Sound

Some animals communicate with sound. Most birds communicate this way. Birds use different calls to warn other
birds of danger, or to tell them to ﬂock together. Many other animals also use sound to communicate. For example,

401

8.4. Animal Communication

www.ck12.org

monkeys use warning cries to tell other monkeys in their troop that a predator is near. Frogs croak to attract female
frogs as mates. Gibbons use calls to tell other gibbons to stay away from their area.

Communication with Sight

Another way some animals communicate is with sight. By moving in certain ways or by “making faces,” they
show other animals what they mean. Most primates communicate in this way. For example, a male chimpanzee
may raise his arms and stare at another male chimpanzee. This warns the other chimpanzee to keep his distance.
The chimpanzee pictured below may look like he is smiling, but he is really showing fear ( Figure 8.10). He is
communicating to other chimpanzees that he will not challenge them.

FIGURE 8.10
This chimpanzee is communicating with
his face. His expression is called a “fear
grin.” It tells other chimpanzees that he is
not a threat.

Look at the peacock pictured below ( Figure 8.11). Why is he raising his beautiful tail feathers? He is also
communicating. He is showing females of his species that he would be a good mate.

Communication with Scent

Some animals communicate with scent. They release chemicals that other animals of their species can smell or detect
in some other way. Ants release many different chemicals. Other ants detect the chemicals with their antennae. This
explains how ants are able to work together. The different chemicals that ants produce have different meanings.
Some of the chemicals signal to all of the ants in a group to come together. Other chemicals warn of danger. Still
other chemicals mark trails to food sources. When an ant ﬁnds food, it marks the trail back to the nest by leaving
behind a chemical on the ground. Other ants follow the chemical trail to the food.
Many other animals also use chemicals to communicate. You have probably seen male dogs raise their leg to urinate
on a ﬁre hydrant or other object. Did you know that the dogs were communicating? They mark their area with a
chemical in their urine. Other dogs can smell the chemical. The scent of the chemical tells other dogs to stay away.

Chapter 8. Animals

FIGURE 8.11
This peacock is using his tail feathers to
communicate. What is he "saying"?

Human Communication

Like other animals, humans communicate with one another. They mainly use sound and sight to share information.
The most important way in which humans communicate is with language. Language is the use of symbols to
communicate. In human languages, the symbols are words. They stand for many different things. Words stand for
things, people, actions, feelings, or ideas. Think of several common words. What does each word stand for? Another
important way in which humans communicate is with facial expressions. Look at the face of the young child pictured
below ( Figure 8.12). Can you tell from her face how she is feeling? Humans also use gestures to communicate.
What are people communicating when they shrug their shoulders? When they shake their head? These are just a few
examples of the ways in which humans share information without using words.

FIGURE 8.12
What does this girl’s face say about how she is feeling?

Summary

• Animals communicate, or share information, through sound, sight, and scent.
• Humans primarily communicate through use of language, facial expressions, and gestures.

8.5 Social Behavior of Animals

• Deﬁne social animals.
• Describe social behavior in animals.
• Explain and give examples of cooperation.

How are you social?
When you think about being social, do you think about hanging out and chatting with friends? Sending a text or
posting to Facebook? Humans socialize in many ways. Social behavior is not limited to humans, however. Many
animals are social.

Social Behavior

Why is animal communication important? Without it, animals would not be able to live together in groups. Animals
that live in groups with other members of their species are called social animals. Social animals include many
species of insects, birds, and mammals. Speciﬁc examples of social animals are ants, bees, crows, wolves, lions, and
humans. To live together with one another, these animals must be able to share information.

Highly Social Animals

Some species of animals are very social. In these species, members of the group depend completely on one another.
Different animals within the group have different jobs. Therefore, group members must work together for the good
of all. Most species of ants and bees are highly social animals.
Ants live together in large groups called colonies ( Figure 8.13). A colony may have millions of ants, making
communication among the ants very important. All of the ants in the colony work together as a single unit. Each ant
has a speciﬁc job, and most of the ants are workers. Their job is to build and repair the colony’s nest. Worker ants

405

8.5. Social Behavior of Animals

www.ck12.org

also leave the nest to ﬁnd food for themselves and other colony members. The workers care for the young as well.
Other ants in the colony are soldiers. They defend the colony against predators. Each colony also has a queen. Her
only job is to lay eggs. She may lay millions of eggs each month. A few ants in the colony are called drones. They
are the only male ants in the colony. Their job is to mate with the queen.

FIGURE 8.13
The ants in this picture belong to the
same colony. They have left the colony’s
nest to search for food.

Honeybees and bumblebees also live in colonies ( Figure 8.14). Each bee in the colony has a particular job. Most
of the bees are workers. Young worker bees clean the colony’s hive and feed the young. Older worker bees build
the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive. The oldest workers leave the hive to ﬁnd food. Each colony usually has one
queen that lays eggs. The colony also has a small number of male drones. They mate with the queen.

FIGURE 8.14
All
the honeybees in this colony work
together. Each bee has a certain job to
perform. Notice the queen to the left. She
is the largest bee in the colony.

Cooperation

Ants, bees, and other social animals must cooperate. Cooperation means working together with others. Members
of the group may cooperate by sharing food. They may also cooperate by defending each other. Look at the ants
pictured below ( Figure 8.15). They show very clearly why cooperation is important. A single ant would not be able
to carry this large bee back to the nest to feed the other ants. With cooperation, the job is easy.
Animals in many other species cooperate. For example, lions live in groups called prides ( Figure 8.16). All the

406

www.ck12.org

Chapter 8. Animals

FIGURE 8.15
These ants are cooperating. By working
together, they are able to move this much
larger insect prey back to their nest. At
the nest, they will share the bee with other
ants that do not leave the nest.

lions in the pride cooperate, though there is still serious competition among the males. Male lions work together to
defend the other lions in the pride. Female lions work together to hunt. Then, they share the meat with other pride
members.
Another example of cooperation is seen with meerkats. Meerkats are small mammals that live in Africa. They also
live in groups and cooperate with one another. For example, young female meerkats act as babysitters. They take
care of the baby meerkats while their parents are away looking for food.

FIGURE 8.16
Members of this lion pride work together.
Males cooperate by defending the pride.
Females cooperate by hunting and shar-
ing the food.

Summary

• Social animals, or animals that live in groups with other members of their species, include ants, bees, crows,

wolves, and humans.

• Social animals must cooperate (work together) with others.

8.6 Reproductive Behavior of Animals

• Deﬁne courtship behavior.
• Explain the purpose of mating behavior.
• Describe how animals care for their young and defend their territory.

Why do these birds pair up?
These birds are pairing up so that they can produce offspring. Many birds are monogamous, keeping the same mate
for an entire season. In some species, they even stay paired for their entire life.

Mating Behavior and Defending Territory

Some of the most important animal behaviors involve mating. Mating is the pairing of an adult male and female
to produce young. Adults that are most successful at attracting a mate are most likely to have offspring. Traits that
help animals attract a mate and have offspring increase their ﬁtness. As the genes that encode these traits are passed
to the next generation, the traits will become more common in the population.

Courtship Behaviors

In many species, females choose the male they will mate with. For their part, males try to be chosen as mates. They
show females that they would be a better mate than the other males. To be chosen as a mate, males may perform
courtship behaviors. These are special behaviors that help attract a mate. Male courtship behaviors get the attention
of females and show off a male’s traits. These behaviors are often observed as direct competition between males.
Different species have different courtship behaviors. One example is a peacock raising his tail feathers. The colorful
peacock is trying to impress females of his species with his beautiful feathers. Another example of courtship behavior
in birds is the blue-footed booby. He is doing a dance to attract a female for mating. During the dance, he spreads

409

8.6. Reproductive Behavior of Animals

www.ck12.org

out his wings and stamps his feet on the ground. You can watch the following video of a blue-footed booby doing
his courtship dance at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYmzdvMoUUA .

MEDIA
Click image to the left or use the URL below.
URL: http://www.ck12.org/ﬂx/render/embeddedobject/94451

Courtship behaviors occur in many other species. For example, males in some species of whales have special mating
songs to attract females as mates. Frogs croak for the same reason. Male deer clash antlers to court females. Male
jumping spiders jump from side to side to attract mates.
Courtship behaviors are one type of display behavior. A display behavior is a ﬁxed set of actions that carries a
speciﬁc message. Although many display behaviors are used to attract mates, some display behaviors have other
purposes. For example, display behaviors may be used to warn other animals to stay away, as you will read below.

Caring for the Young

In most species of birds and mammals, one or both parents care for their offspring. Caring for the young may include
making a nest or other shelter. It may also include feeding the young and protecting them from predators. Caring
for offspring increases their chances of surviving. Birds called killdeers have an interesting way of protecting their
chicks. When a predator gets too close to her nest, a mother killdeer pretends to have a broken wing. The mother
walks away from the nest holding her wing as though it were injured ( Figure 8.17). The predator thinks she is
injured and will be easy prey. The mother leads the predator away from the nest and then ﬂies away.

FIGURE 8.17
This mother killdeer is pretending she has
a broken wing. She is trying to attract a
predator’s attention in order to protect her
chicks. This behavior puts her at risk of
harm. How can it increase her ﬁtness?

In most species of mammals, parents also teach their offspring important skills. For example, meerkat parents teach
their pups how to eat scorpions without being stung. A scorpion sting can be deadly, so this is a very important skill.
Teaching the young important skills makes it more likely that they will survive. Notice that, compared to other types
of animals, birds and mammals have relatively few offspring.

Defending Territory

Chapter 8. Animals

Some species of animals are territorial. This means that they defend their area. The area they defend usually
contains their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring. A species is more likely to be territorial if
there is not very much food in their area. Having a larger territory could mean more prey or food.
Animals generally do not defend their territory by ﬁghting. Instead, they are more likely to use display behavior. The
behavior tells other animals to stay away. It gets the message across without the need for ﬁghting. Display behavior
is generally safer and uses less energy than ﬁghting. Male gorillas use display behavior to defend their territory.
They pound on their chests and thump the ground with their hands to warn other male gorillas to keep away from
their area. The robin displays his red breast to warn other robins to stay away ( Figure 8.18).

FIGURE 8.18
The red breast of this male robin is easy
to see. The robin displays his bright red
chest to defend his territory. It warns other
robins to keep out of his area.

Some animals deposit chemicals to mark the boundary of their territory. This is why dogs urinate on ﬁre hydrants
and other objects. Cats may also mark their territory by depositing chemicals. They have scent glands in their face.
They deposit chemicals by rubbing their face against objects.

8.7 Cyclic Behavior of Animals

• Identify animal behaviors that occur in cycles.
• Explain hibernation and migration.
• Deﬁne circadian rhythms and biological clock.

What are these butterﬂies doing?
Monarch butterﬂies gather in large groups as they migrate 2,500 miles south each fall. They return to the north in
the spring. This migration is a cycle that repeats every year.

Cycles of Behavior

Many animal behaviors change in a regular way. They go through cycles. Some cycles of behavior repeat each year.
Other cycles of behavior repeat every day.

Yearly Cycles

An example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is hibernation. Hibernation is a state in which an animal’s body
processes are slower than usual, and its body temperature falls. An animal uses less energy than usual during
hibernation. This helps the animal survive during a time of year when food is scarce. Hibernation may last for
weeks or months. Animals that hibernate include species of bats, squirrels, and snakes.

413

Most people think that bears hibernate. In fact, bears do not go into true hibernation. In the winter, they go into a
deep sleep. However, their body processes do not slow down very much. Their body temperature also remains about
the same as usual. Bears can be awakened easily from their winter sleep.
Another example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is migration. Migration is the movement of animals from one
place to another. Migration is an innate behavior that is triggered by changes in the environment. For example,
animals may migrate when the days get shorter in the fall. Migration is most common in birds, ﬁsh, and insects.
In the Northern Hemisphere, many species of birds, including robins and geese, travel south for the winter. They
migrate to areas where it is warmer and where there is more food. They return north in the spring. A ﬂock of
migrating geese is pictured below ( Figure 8.19).

FIGURE 8.19
These geese are ﬂying south for the win-
ter. Flocks of geese migrate in V-shaped
formations.

Some animals migrate very long distances. The map shown below shows the migration route of a species of hawk
called Swainson’s hawk ( Figure 8.20). About how many miles do the hawks travel from start to ﬁnish? Are you
surprised that birds migrate that far? Some species of birds migrate even farther. Whales also are known to migrate
thousands of miles each year to take advantage of warmer waters in the winter months. The great migration of
millions of zebra, wildebeest and other antelope in East Africa also occurs yearly. Each year around 1.5 million
wildebeest and 300,000 zebra (along with other antelope) go in search of food and water, traveling a distance of
around 1800 miles.
Birds and other migrating animals follow the same routes each year. How do they know where to go? It depends on
the species. Some animals follow landmarks, such as rivers or coastlines. Other animals are guided by the position
of the sun, the usual direction of the wind, or other clues in the environment.

Daily Cycles

Many animal behaviors change at certain times of day, day after day. For example, most animals go to sleep when the
sun sets and wake up when the sun rises. Animals that are active during the daytime are called diurnal. Some animals
do the opposite. They sleep all day and are active during the night. These animals are called nocturnal. Examples of
nocturnal animals include bats, foxes, possums, skunks and coyotes. Many mammals (including humans), insects,
reptiles and birds are diurnal.
Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people
start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. Daily cycles of behavior are
called circadian rhythms.
In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock.
This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The

gration route by attaching tiny tracking
devices to the birds.
The birds were
then tracked by satellite. On the migra-
tion south, the hawks travel almost 5,000
miles from start to ﬁnish.

signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control
the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours.

• Yearly cycles of behavior include hibernation and migration.

Introduction

Why does not having a backbone make things so complex?
Invertebrates could be described as simple animals. And though some are very simple, the vastness of the invertebrate
species makes this group of animals anything but simple.

• Distinguish between invertebrates and vertebrates.
• List invertebrate phyla, and give examples of each.

How are these jellyﬁsh like an insect?
Jellyﬁsh and insects don’t seem to have much in common. They look much different. They live in very different
environments. But both of these animals are classiﬁed as invertebrates.

What Are Invertebrates?

Animals are often identiﬁed as being either invertebrates or vertebrates. These are terms based on the skeletons of
the animals. Vertebrates have a backbone made of bone or cartilage ( cartilage is a ﬂexible supportive tissue. You
have cartilage in your ear lobes.). Invertebrates, on the other hand, have no backbone ( Figure 9.1). Invertebrates
live just about anywhere. There are so many invertebrates on this planet that it is impossible to count them all. There
are probably billions of billions of invertebrates. They come in many shapes and sizes, live practically anywhere and
provide many services that are vital for the survival of other organisms, including us. They have been observed in

the upper reaches of the atmosphere, in the driest of the deserts and in the canopies of the wettest rainforests. They
can even be found in the frozen Antarctic or on the deepest parts of the ocean ﬂoor.

Snails are an example of invertebrates,
animals without a backbone.

All vertebrate organisms are in the phylum Chordata. Invertebrates, which make up about 95% (or more) of the
animal kingdom, are divided into over 30 different phyla, some of which are listed below ( Table 9.1). Numerous
invertebrate phyla have just a few species; some have only one described species, yet these are classiﬁed into separate
phyla because of their unique characteristics. For example, sponges, with pores throughout their body, are from the
phylum Porifera. Crabs and lobsters, with jointed appendages, are from the phylum Arthropoda.

9.2 Sponges

• Describe the key features of sponges.
• Summarize feeding in sponges.

Do animals wash your dishes?
Natural sponges, like the one in the picture above, are actually animals taken from the sea! The sponges in your
home, however, were most likely never living things. Most sponges used in kitchens today are made from unnatural
materials.

Sponges

Sponges ( Figure 9.2) are classiﬁed in the phylum Porifera, from the Latin words meaning "having pores." These
pores allow the movement of water into the sponges’ sac-like bodies. Sponges must pump water through their bodies
in order to eat. Because sponges are sessile, meaning they cannot move, they ﬁlter water to obtain their food. They
are, therefore, known as ﬁlter feeders. Filter feeders must ﬁlter the water to separate out the organisms and nutrients
they want to eat from those they do not.
You might think that sponges don’t look like animals at all. They don’t have a head or legs. Internally, they do not
have brains, stomachs, or other organs. This is because sponges evolved much earlier than other animals. In fact,
sponges do not even have true tissues. Instead, their bodies are made up of specialized cells (cell-level organization)
that do speciﬁc jobs. Other animals, including humans, have tissue-level organization because they have tissues with
speciﬁc functions.
Sponge cells perform a variety of bodily functions and appear to be more independent of each other than are the
cells of other animals. For example, some cells control the ﬂow of water, in and out of the sponge, by increasing or

The sponges often have tube-like bodies
with many tiny pores. There are roughly
5,000 sponge species.

decreasing the size of the pores.
Sponges are characterized by a feeding system unique among animals. As sponges don’t have mouths, they must
feed by some other method. Sponges have tiny pores in their outer walls through which water is drawn. Cells in
the sponge walls ﬁlter food from the water as the water is pumped through the body and out other larger openings.
The ﬂow of water through the sponge is unidirectional, driven by the beating of ﬂagella, which line the surface of
chambers connected by a series of canals.
Sponges reproduce by both asexual and sexual means. Sponges that reproduce asexually produce buds or, more
often, structures called gemmules, which are packets of several cells of various types inside a protective covering.
Freshwater sponges often produce gemmules prior to winter, which then develop into adult sponges beginning the
following spring. Most sponges that reproduce sexually are hermaphroditic and produce eggs and sperm at different
times. Sperm are frequently released into the water, where they are captured by sponges of the same species. The
sperm are then transported to eggs, fertilization occurs and the zygotes develop into larvae. Some sponges release
their larvae, where others retain them for some time. Once the larvae are in the water, they settle and develop into
juvenile sponges.

• Sponges are sessile ﬁlter feeders.

• Describe the key features of the cnidarians.
• Deﬁne nematocyst.
• Distinguish between a polyp and a medusa body plan.
• Describe cnidarian colonies.

Are corals animal, plant, or mineral?
Some corals may look like rocks. But they are alive! And some corals may look like plants, but they are actually
animals. Just like all other animals, they eat food to get energy.

Cnidarians

Cnidarians, in the phylum Cnidaria, include organisms such as the jellyﬁsh, corals, and sea anemones. These
animals are found in shallow ocean water. You might know that these animals can give you a painful sting if you
step on them. That’s because cnidarians have stinging cells known as nematocysts. Cnidarians use nematocysts
to catch their food. When touched, the nematocysts release a thread of poison that can be used to paralyze prey.
Cnidarians are among the simplest of the so-called "higher" organisms, but are also among the most beautiful.

Body plan

The body plan of cnidarians is unique because these organisms show radial symmetry, making these animals very
different from those that evolved before them. Radial symmetry means that they have a circular body plan, and any
cut through the center of the animal leaves two equal halves.

427

9.3. Cnidarians

www.ck12.org

The cnidarians have two basic body forms:

1. Polyp: The polyp is a cup-shaped body with the mouth facing upward, such as a sea anemone and coral.
2. Medusa: The medusa is a bell-shaped body with the mouth and tentacles facing downward, such as a jellyﬁsh.

Unlike the sponges which evolved prior to cnidarians, the cnidarians are made up of true tissues. The inside of
a cnidarian is called the gastrovascular cavity, a large space that helps the organism digest and move nutrients
around the body. The cnidarians also have nerve tissue organized into a net-like structure, known as a nerve-net,
with connected nerve cells dispersed throughout the body. Cnidarians do not have true organs, however.
Reproduction is by asexual budding (polyps) or sexual formation of gametes (medusae, some polyps). The result of
sexual reproduction is a larva, which can swim on its own.

Cnidarian Colonies

Some types of cnidarians are also known to form colonies. Two examples are described below.

1. The Portuguese Man o’ War ( Figure 9.3) looks like a single organism but is actually a colony of polyps. One
polyp is ﬁlled with air to help the colony ﬂoat, while several feeding polyps hang below with tentacles. The
tentacles are full of nematocysts. The Portuguese Man o’ War is known to cause extremely painful stings to
swimmers and surfers who accidentally brush up against it in the water.

FIGURE 9.3
The Portuguese Man o’ War can deliver nasty stings with its tentacles.

2. Coral reefs ( Figure below) look like big rocks, but they are actually alive. They are built from cnidarians
called corals. The corals are sessile (non-moving) polyps that can use their tentacles to feed on ocean creatures
that pass by. Their skeletons are made up of calcium carbonate, which is also known as limestone. Over long
periods of time, their skeletons build on each other to produce large structures known as coral reefs. Coral
reefs are important habitats for many different types of ocean life.

Corals are colonial cnidarians.

Summary

• Cnidarians have radial symmetry and true tissues.
• Some cnidarians form colonies, such as corals.

9.4 Flatworms

• Describe the major features of ﬂatworms.
• Describe parasitic ﬂatworms.

Do worms have eyes?
You might think that worms can’t see. But some worms, such as the above Dugesia ﬂatworm, do have eyespots.
These are not exactly like your eyes, however. Eyespots can only detect light in their environment.

Flatworms

The word "worm" is not very scientiﬁc. But it is a word that informally describes animals (usually invertebrates)
that have long bodies with no arms or legs. (Snakes are vertebrates, so they are not usually described as worms.)
Worms are the ﬁrst signiﬁcant group of animals with bilateral symmetry, meaning that the right side of their bodies
is a mirror of the left.
One type of worm is the ﬂatworm. Worms in the phylum Platyhelminthes are called ﬂatworms because they have
ﬂattened bodies. There are more than 18,500 known species of ﬂatworms.

Features of Flatworms

The main characteristics of ﬂatworms ( Figure 9.4) include:

430

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9.

Invertebrates

1. Flatworms have no true body cavity, but they do have bilateral symmetry. Due to the lack of a body cav-

ity,ﬂatworms are known as acoelomates.

2. Flatworms have an incomplete digestive system. This means that the digestive tract has only one opening.

Digestion takes place in the gastrovascular cavity.

3. Flatworms do not have a respiratory system. Instead, they have pores that allow oxygen to enter through their

body. Oxygen enters the pores by diffusion.

4. There are no blood vessels in the ﬂatworms. Their gastrovascular cavity helps distribute nutrients throughout

the body.

5. Flatworms have a ladder-like nervous system; two interconnected parallel nerve cords run the length of the

body.

6. Most ﬂatworms have a distinct head region that includes nerve cells and sensory organs, such as eyespots. The
development of a head region, called cephalization, evolved at the same time as bilateral symmetry in animals.
This process does not occur in cnidarians, which evolved prior to ﬂatworms and have radial symmetry.

FIGURE 9.4
Marine ﬂatworms can be brightly colored,
such as this one from the class Turbel-
laria. These worms are mostly carnivores
or scavengers.

Flatworms in the Environment

Flatworms live in a variety of environments. Some species of ﬂatworms are free-living organisms that feed on small
organisms and rotting matter. These types of ﬂatworms include marine ﬂatworms and freshwater ﬂatworms, such as
Dugesia.
Other types of ﬂatworms are parasitic. That means they live inside another organism, called a host, in order to get
the food and energy they need. For example, tapeworms have a head-like area with tiny hooks and suckers (known
as the scolex) that help the worm attach to the intestines of an animal host ( Figure 9.5). There are over 11,000
species of parasitic ﬂatworms.

Summary

• Flatworms have no true body cavity and no blood vessels.
• Flatworms can be free-living or parasitic. Tapeworms are parasitic ﬂatworms.

• Describe parasitic roundworms.

What is heartworm?
You may have heard that you need to protect your pets from heartworm. Heartworms are a type of roundworm. They
can be parasites in cats and dogs. That means, once they infect your pet, they can cause harm. However, there are
preventative treatments available.

Roundworms

The word "worm" is not very scientiﬁc. This informal term describes animals (usually invertebrates) that have long
bodies with no arms or legs. Worms with round, non-segmented bodies are known as nematodes or roundworms (
Figure 9.6). They are classiﬁed in the phylum Nematoda, which has over 28,000 known species. Some scientists
believe there could be over a million species of Nematodes.
Nematodes are slender bilaterally symmetrical worms, typically less than 2.5 mm long. The smallest nematodes are
microscopic, while free-living species can reach as much as 5 cm, and some parasitic species are larger still, reaching
over a meter in length. The worm body is often covered with ridges, rings, bristles, or other distinctive structures.
The radially symmetrical head of a nematode also has distinct features. The head is covered with sensory bristles
and, in many cases, solid "head-shields" around the mouth region. The mouth has either three or six lips arranged
around the mouth opening, which often have a series of teeth on their inner edges.

FIGURE 9.6
Nematodes can be parasites of plants and animals.

Features of Roundworms

1. Unlike the ﬂatworms, the roundworms have a body cavity with internal organs.
2. A roundworm has a complete digestive system, which includes both a mouth and an anus. This is a signiﬁcant
difference from the incomplete digestive system of ﬂatworms. The roundworm digestive system also include
a large digestive organ known as the gut. Digestive enzymes that start to break down food are produced here.
There is no stomach, but there is an intestine which produces enzymes that help absorb nutrients. The last
portion of the intestine forms a rectum, which expels waste through the anus.

3. Roundworms also have a simple nervous system with a primitive brain. There are four nerves that run the
length of the body and are connected from the top to the bottom of the body. At the anterior end of the animal
(the head region), the nerves branch from a circular ring which serves as the brain. The head of a nematode has
a few tiny sense organs, including chemoreceptors, which sense chemicals. Though still a relatively simple
structure, the nervous system of roundworms is very different from that of the cnidarian nerve net.

Roundworms in the Environment

Roundworms can be free-living organisms, but they are probably best known for their role as signiﬁcant plant and
animal parasites. Most Nematodes are parasitic, with over 16,000 parasitic species described. Heartworms, which
cause serious disease in dogs while living in the heart and blood vessels, are a type of roundworm. Roundworms can
also cause disease in humans. Elephantiasis, a disease characterized by the extreme swelling of the limbs ( Figure
9.7), is caused by infection with a type of roundworm.
Most parasitic roundworm eggs or larvae are found in the soil and enter the human body when a person picks them
up on the hands and then transfers them to the mouth. The eggs or larvae also can enter the human body directly
through the skin. The best solution to these diseases is to try to prevent these diseases rather than treat or cure them.
Diseases caused by roundworms are more common in developing countries. Many parasitic diseases caused by
roundworms result from poor personal hygiene. Contributing factors may include

• lack of a clean water supply,
• inadequate sanitation measures,
• crowded living conditions, combined with a lack of access to health care and low levels of education.

Summary

• Roundworms have a body cavity with internal organs and a simple nervous system.
• Roundworms can be free-living or parasitic.

9.6 Segmented Worms

• Describe the major features of the segmented worms.
• Compare ﬂatworms, roundworms, and segmented worms.

Does an earthworm have a brain?
Just like you, earthworms do have a brain. Their brains are much simpler than yours, however. Earthworms’ brains
allow them to sense and respond to light and touch.

Segmented Worms

When you think of worms, you probably picture earthworms. There are actually many types of worms, including
ﬂatworms, roundworms, and segmented worms. Earthworms are segmented worms.
Segmented worms are in the phylum Annelida, which has over 22,000 known species. These worms are known as
the segmented worms because their bodies are segmented, or separated into repeating units. Besides the earthworm,
the segmented worms also include leeches and some marine worms. Most segmented worms like the earthworm,
feed on dead organic matter. Leeches ( Figure 9.8), however, can live in fresh water and suck blood from their
animal host. You may have noticed many earthworms in soil. Earthworms support terrestrial ecosystems both as
prey and by aerating and enriching soil.

Features of Segmented Worms

Segmented worms have a number of characteristic features.

1. The basic form consists of multiple segments, each of which has the same sets of organs and, in most, a pair

of parapodia that many species use for locomotion.

437

9.6. Segmented Worms

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 9.8
Leeches are parasitic worms. Notice the
presence of segments.

2. Segmented worms have a well-developed body cavity ﬁlled with ﬂuid. This ﬂuid-ﬁlled cavity serves as a
hydroskeleton, a supportive structure that helps move the worm’s muscles. Only the most primitive worms
(the ﬂatworms) lack a body cavity.

3. Segmented worms also tend to have organ systems that are more developed than the roundworms’ or ﬂat-
worms’. Earthworms, for example, have a complete digestive tract with two openings, as well as an esophagus
and intestines. The circulatory system consists of paired hearts and blood vessels. Actually there are ﬁve pairs
of hearts that pump blood along the two main vessels. And the nervous system consists of the brain and a
ventral nerve cord.

• Deﬁne mollusk.
• Discuss characteristics of mollusks.
• Describe the mantle and radula.

What does this snail have in common with a clam?
You might notice that both have a shell. That is one feature of the group they both belong to, the mollusks. Mollusks
are a very diverse group. They include animals that live on land and in the ocean. With well over 100,000 species,
there can be a lot of shells.

What are Mollusks?

When you take a walk along a beach, what do you ﬁnd there? Sand, the ocean, lots of sunlight. You may also ﬁnd
shells. The shells you ﬁnd are most likely left by organisms in the phylum Mollusca. On the beach, you can ﬁnd the
shells of many different mollusks ( Figure 9.9), including clams, mussels, scallops, oysters, and snails. Mollusks
are invertebrates that usually have a hard shell, a mantle, and a radula. Their glossy pearls, mother of pearl, and
abalone shells are like pieces of jewelry. Some mollusks, such as squid and octopus, do not have shells.

FIGURE 9.9
On the beach, you can ﬁnd a wide variety
of mollusk shells.

Features of the Mollusk

The Mollusk’s body is often divided into different parts ( Figure 9.10):

1. A head with eyes or tentacles.
2. In most species, a muscular foot, which helps the mollusk move. Some mollusks use the foot for burrowing

into the sand, and others use it for jet-propulsion.

3. A mantle, or fold of the outer skin lining the shell. The mantle often releases calcium carbonate, which creates
an external shell, just like the ones you ﬁnd on the beach. The shell is made of chitin, a tough, semitransparent
substance.

4. A mass housing the organs.
5. A complete digestive tract that begins at the mouth and runs to the anus.
6. Most ocean mollusks have a gill or gills to absorb oxygen from the water.
7. Many species have a feeding structure, the radula, found only in mollusks. The radula can be thought of as a
"tongue-like" structure. The radula is made mostly of chitin. Types of radulae range from structures used to
scrape algae off of rocks to the beaks of squid and octopuses.

FIGURE 9.10
This is the basic body plan of a mollusk.
Note the mantle, gills, and radula. Keep in
mind the basic body plan can differ slightly
among the mollusks.

Evolution of Mollusks

www.ck12.org

Mollusks are probably most closely related to organisms in the phylum Annelida, also known as segmented worms.
This phylum includes the earthworm and leech. Scientists believe these two groups are related because, when they
are in the early stage of development, they look very similar. Mollusks also share features of their organ systems
with segmented worms. Unlike segmented worms, however, mollusks do not have body segmentation. The basic
mollusk body shape is usually quite different as well.

Summary

• The mollusk body often has a head with tentacles, a muscular foot, a feeding organ called the radula, and a

complete digestive tract.

• Mollusks have a mantle, which often secretes an external shell.
• Mollusks are most closely related to segmented worms.

9.8 Types of Mollusks

• Describe the different types of mollusks.
• Distinguish gastropods from bivalves and from cephalopods.

What’s the world’s largest mollusk?
The colossal squid, one of the largest invertebrates, measures 14 feet in length here. Some of these squids are even
larger and can grow up to almost 50 feet long! The smallest mollusks are snails that are microscopic in size.

Types of Mollusks

There are approximately 160,000 living species and probably 70,000 extinct species of mollusks. They are typically
divided into ten classes, of which two are extinct. The major classes of living mollusks include gastropods, bivalves,
and cephalopods ( Figure 9.11).

Gastropods

Gastropods include snails and slugs. They use their foot to crawl. They have a well-developed head. There are
many thousands of species of sea snails and sea slugs, as well as freshwater snails, freshwater limpets, land snails
and land slugs. Gastropods live in many diverse habitats, from gardens to deserts and mountains. They also live in
rivers, lakes and the ocean. Most shelled gastropods have a one-piece shell that is typically coiled or spiraled, but
not all gastropods have shells. Gastropods have no sense of hearing, but they can see and have a keen sense of smell.
In land-based gastropods, the olfactory organs (for smell) are the most important. These are located on the tentacles.

443

9.8. Types of Mollusks

Bivalves

www.ck12.org

Bivalves include clams, scallops, oysters, and mussels. As their name implies, they have two parts of their shell,
which can open and close. Bivalves live in both marine and freshwater habitats. Most bivalves have a pair of large
gills that enable them to extract oxygen from the water (to breathe) and to capture food. Water is drawn into the
bivalve and washes over the gills. Mucus on the gills helps capture food and cilia transfer the food particles to the
mouth. Once in the mouth, food passes into the stomach to be digested. Bivalves have a mouth, heart, intestine,
gills, and stomach, but no head. Bivalves have a muscular foot, which in many species such as clams, is used to
anchor their body to a surface or dig down into the sand.

Cephalopods

Cephalopods include the octopus and squid. They have a prominent head and a well-developed brain. Typically the
foot has been modiﬁed into a set of arms or tentacles. Members of this class can change color. They can also change
texture and body shape, and, and if those camouﬂage techniques don’t work, they can still "disappear" in a cloud of
ink. Cephalopods have three hearts that pump blue blood, they’re jet powered by their muscular foot, and they’re
found in all oceans of the world. Cephalopods are thought to be the most intelligent of invertebrates. They have eyes
and other senses that rival those of humans. Many cephalopods are active and efﬁcient predators. What features do
you think allows for this?

• Explain why mollusks are important to humans.
• Describe the use of mollusks as food.
• Deﬁne pearl.
• Discuss the use of mollusks for scientiﬁc studies.

Where do pearls come from?
Pearls are highly valued as gemstones. Most gemstones come from the Earth, but pearls come from living things.
They are created by mollusks, such as oysters.

Importance of Mollusks

Mollusks are important in a variety of ways; they are used as food, for decoration, in jewelry, and in scientiﬁc studies.
They are even used as roadbed material and in vitamin supplements.

Mollusks as Food

Edible species of mollusks include numerous species of clams, mussels, oysters, scallops, marine and land snails,
squid, and octopuses. Many species of mollusks, such as oysters, are farmed in order to produce more than could
be found in the wild ( Figure 9.12).
Today, ﬁsheries in Europe, Japan, and the US alone produce over 1 billion pounds of oyster meat each year. Abalone
(a marine gastropod mollusk), a great delicacy, can fetch up to three hundred dollars per pound. Eating mollusks
is associated with a risk of food poisoning from toxins that accumulate in molluscs under certain conditions, and
many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. At certain times of the year, (usually the warmer months) many
species of saltwater mollusks become very poisonous due to an algal bloom known as "red tide." The mollusks ﬁlter

feed on the tiny creatures (called dinoﬂagellates in the bloom) that produce the toxins. Eating shellﬁsh during a red
tide can cause serious illness and even death to humans.
Tastes in molluscan food vary tremendously from one person to the next and from culture to culture; however, when
it comes to a question of survival, most mollusks are edible. Some are considered delicacies such as oysters and
escargot (a snail that lives in trees), while others such as the clams and mussels of freshwater ponds and streams
are less likely to be consumed due to taste, but none-the-less are very edible. Land-based mollusks are also eaten.
France alone consumes 5 million pounds of escargot every year. Of course, some people are allergic to mollusks and
need to be careful about consuming any kind of shelled animals.

Mollusks in Decoration and Jewelry

Two natural products of mollusks used for decorations and jewelry are pearls and nacre. A pearl is the hard, round
object produced within the mantle of a living shelled mollusk. Pearls are produced by many bivalves when a tiny
particle of sand or grit is trapped between the mantle and the shell. It’s as if the mollusk has a splinter. The mollusk
forms a protective covering around the irritant. Most pearls used as jewelry are made by pearl oysters and freshwater
mussels; most of the ones sold are cultured and not wild. Natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and
objects of beauty for many centuries.
The most desirable pearls are produced by oysters and river mussels. The substance used to form the pearl covering
is made from the mother of pearl material that lines the interior of the shell.
Mother of pearl is also known as nacre. Nacre is the iridescent inner shell layer. It can be found in buttons, watch
faces, knives, guns, and jewelry. It is also used to decorate various musical instruments.

Mollusks in Scientiﬁc Studies

Several mollusks are ideal subjects for scientiﬁc investigation of the nervous system. The giant squid has a sophis-
ticated nervous system and a complex brain for study. The California sea slug, also called the California sea hare,
is used in studies of learning and memory because it has a simple nervous system, consisting of just a few thousand
large, easily identiﬁed neurons. These neurons are responsible for a variety of learning tasks. Some slug brain
studies have even allowed scientists to better understand human brains. Some octopuses and squid are incredibly
smart. They are capable of learning to solve problems and do mazes.

• Describe the water vascular system.
• Summarize eating in echinoderms.

What is a sea cucumber?
A sea cucumber is not a vegetable! It is an invertebrate animal found in the ocean. Note the spines on this sea
cucumber. The spines are a key feature of echinoderms.

What are Echinoderms?

You’re probably familiar with starﬁsh and sand dollars ( Figure 9.13). They are both echinoderms. Sea urchins
and sea cucumbers are also echinoderms. What’s similar between these three organisms? They all have radial
symmetry. This means that the body is arranged around a central point.
Echinoderms belong to the phylum Echinodermata. This phylum includes 7,000 living species. It is the largest
animal phylum without freshwater or land-living members.

Characteristics of Echinoderms

As mentioned earlier, echinoderms show radial symmetry. Other key echinoderm features include an internal
skeleton and spines, as well as a few organs and organ systems. Although echinoderms look like they have a
hard exterior, they do not have an external skeleton. Instead, a thin outer skin covers an internal skeleton made of

Another echinoderm, a sea urchin (Echi-
nus esculentus), showing its spines.

tiny plates and spines. This provides rigid support. Some groups of echinoderms, such as sea urchins ( Figure 9.14),
have spines that protect the organism. Sea cucumbers use these spines to help them move.
Echinoderms have a unique water vascular system. This network of ﬂuid-ﬁlled tubes helps them to breathe, eat,
and move. Therefore, they can function without gill slits. Echinoderms also have a very simple digestive system,
circulatory system, and nervous system. The digestive system often leads directly from the mouth to the anus. The
echinoderms have an open circulatory system, meaning that ﬂuid moves freely in the body cavity. But echinoderms
have no heart. This may be due to their simple radial symmetry - a heart is not needed to pump the freely moving
ﬂuid. The echinoderm nervous system is a nerve net, or interconnected neurons with no central brain.
Many echinoderms have amazing powers of regeneration. For example, some sea stars (starﬁsh) are capable of
regenerating lost arms. In some cases, lost arms have been observed to regenerate a second complete sea star! Sea
cucumbers often release parts of their internal organs if they perceive danger. The released organs and tissues are
then quickly regenerated.

How do Echinoderms Eat?

Feeding strategies vary greatly among the different groups of echinoderms. There’s no one food or technique that’s
shared by all echinoderms. Different eating-methods include:

1. Passive ﬁlter-feeders, which are organisms that absorb suspended nutrients from passing water. Some echino-

450

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9.

Invertebrates

derms use their long arms to capture food particles ﬂoating past in the currents.

2. Grazers, such as sea urchins, are organisms that feed on available plants. Sea urchins are omnivorous, eating
both plant and animals. The sea urchin mainly feeds on algae on the coral and rocks, along with decomposing
matter such as dead ﬁsh, mussels, sponges, and barnacles.

3. Deposit feeders, which are organisms that feed on small pieces of organic matter, usually in the top layer of
soil. Sea cucumbers are deposit feeders, living on the ocean ﬂoor. They eat the tiny scrap particles that are
usually abundant in the environments that they inhabit.

4. Active hunters, which are organisms that actively hunt their prey. Many sea stars are predators, feeding on
mollusks like clams by prying apart their shells and actually placing their stomach inside the mollusk shell to

How do Echinoderms Reproduce?

Echinoderms reproduce sexually. In most echinoderms, eggs and sperm cells are released into open water, and
fertilization takes place when the eggs and sperm meet. This is called external fertilization, and is typical of many
marine animals. The release of sperm and eggs often occurs when organisms are in the same place at the same time.
Internal fertilization takes place in only a few species. Some species even take care of their offspring, like parents!

Summary

• Echinoderms show radial symmetry and have an endoskeleton and a unique water vascular system. Some have

spines.

• Echinoderms generally reproduce by external fertilization; regeneration is fairly common among echinoderms.

9.11 Types of Echinoderms

• List several types of echinoderms.
• Describe echinoderm movement.

How can you ﬁnd feathers in the ocean?
Birds aren’t the only creatures that have feathers. One type of echinoderm, the feather star, has feathery arms. These
animals don’t ﬂy or even move much at all. They usually cling to rocks, using a root-like structure.

Types of Echinoderms

The echinoderms can be divided into two major groups:

1. Eleutherozoa are the echinoderms that can move. This group includes the starﬁsh and most other echinoderms.
2. Pelmatozoa are the immobile echinoderms. This group includes crinoids, such as the feather stars.

Listed below are the four main classes of echinoderms present in the Eleutherozoa Group ( Table 9.3).

Habitat

Echinoderms are spread all over the world at almost all depths, latitudes, and environments in the ocean. Most
feather stars (crinoids) live in shallow water. In the deep ocean, sea cucumbers are common, sometimes making up
90% of the organisms. Most echinoderms, however, are found in reefs just lying beneath the surface of the water.
No echinoderms are found in freshwater habitats or on land. This makes Echinodermata the largest animal phylum
to only have ocean-based species.

Do Echinoderms Move?

While almost all echinoderms live on the sea ﬂoor, some sea-lilies can swim at great speeds for brief periods of time,
and a few sea cucumbers are fully ﬂoating. Some echinoderms ﬁnd other ways of moving. For example, crinoids
attach themselves to ﬂoating logs, and some sea cucumbers move by attaching to the sides of ﬁsh.
On the underside side of a sea star, there are hundreds of tiny feet usually arranged into several rows on each ray of
the star. These are called tube feet, or podia, and are ﬁlled with seawater in most echinoderms. The water vascular
system within the body of the animal is also ﬁlled with seawater. By expanding and contracting chambers within the
water vascular system, the echinoderm can force water into certain tube feet to extend them. The animal has muscles
in the tube feet, which are used to retract them. By expanding and retracting the right tube feet in the proper order,
the animal can walk.

Summary

• Echinoderms include the star ﬁsh, sea urchins, sand dollars, and feather stars.
• Echinoderms are found in many different ocean environments, but most are found in reefs.

9.12 Importance of Echinoderms

• Describe the role of echinoderms in their ecosystems.
• Explain how echinoderms are important to humans.

What do sea otters eat?
Sea otters are known for being playful and frisky. They are serious eaters, however! A major part of a sea otter’s diet
are echinoderms, such as sea urchins. They manage to eat the soft part of the sea urchins while avoiding the huge
sea urchin spines.

Importance of Echinoderms

Echinoderms are important for the ecosystem. They are also a source of food and medicine for humans.

Ecological Role

Echinoderms play numerous ecological roles. Sand dollars and sea cucumbers burrow into the sand, providing more
oxygen at greater depths of the sea ﬂoor. This allows more organisms to live there. In addition, starﬁsh prevent the
growth of algae on coral reefs. This allows the coral to ﬁlter-feed more easily. And many sea cucumbers provide a
habitat for parasites such as crabs, worms, and snails.
Echinoderms are also an important step in the ocean food chain. Echinoderms are the staple diet of many animals,
including the sea otter. On the other hand, echinoderms eat seaweed and keep its growth in check. Recall that the
sea urchin is a grazer, mainly feeding on algae on the coral and rocks. Recently, some marine ecosystems have
been overrun by seaweed. Excess seaweed can destroy entire reefs. Scientists believe that the extinction of large
quantities of echinoderms has caused this destruction ( Figure 9.16).

antillarum,

some areas but not others.

Echinoderms as Food

In some countries, echinoderms are considered delicacies. Around 50,000 tons of sea urchins are captured each year
for food. They are consumed mostly in Japan, Peru, Spain and France. Both male and female gonads of sea urchins
are also consumed. The taste is described as soft and melting, like a mixture of seafood and fruit. Sea cucumbers are
considered a delicacy in some southeastern Asian countries. In China they are used as a basis for gelatinous soups
and stews.

Echinoderms as Medicine

Echinoderms are also used as medicine and in scientiﬁc research. For example, some sea cucumber toxins slow
down the growth rate of tumor cells, so there is an interest in using these in cancer research.
Sea urchins are also model organisms used in developmental biology research. Sea urchins have been used to study
the mechanisms of fertilization and egg activation, physiological processes that occur during early development,
and the regulation of differentiation in the early embryo. In addition, the molecular basis of early development was
studied in sea urchins. Gametes can be obtained easily, sterility is not required, and the eggs and early embryos of
many commonly used species are beautifully transparent. In addition, the early development of sea urchin embryos
is a highly conserved process. When a batch of eggs is fertilized, all of the resulting embryos typically develop at
the same time. This makes biochemical and molecular studies of early embryos possible in the sea urchin, and has
led to a number of major discoveries.

Echinoderms in Farming

The hard skeleton of echinoderms is used as a source of lime by farmers in some areas where limestone is unavailable.
Lime is added to the soil to allow plants to take up more nutrients. About 4,000 tons of the animals are used each
year for this purpose.

9.13 Arthropods

• Give examples of arthropods.
• Describe the characteristics of the arthropods.
• Describe adaptations of land-living arthropods.

What does this lobster have in common with a wasp?
You might notice that their bodies have segments. And they both have a hard outer layer. Because they share these
and other features, they are both classiﬁed as arthropods.

What are Arthropods?

How often do you think you see an arthropod? Well, have you ever looked up close at an ant? A spider? A ﬂy? A
moth? With over a million described species (and many more yet to be described) in the phylum containing arthro-
pods, chances are, you encounter one of these organisms every day, without even leaving your house. Arthropods
are a very diverse group of animals. In fact, they are the biggest group of animals on the planet, with upwards of 5
million distinct species.

Types of Arthropods

Arthropods belong to the phylum Arthropoda, which means “jointed feet,” and includes four living subphyla.

• Chelicerata, which includes spiders ( Figure 9.17), mites, and scorpions. In these animals, the ﬁrst pair of
appendages are often modiﬁed as fangs or pincers, and are used to manipulate food. Spiders have eight legs.
• Myriapoda, which includes centipedes and millipedes. All of these animals live on land, and can have

anywhere from ten to nearly 200 pairs of appendages.

• Hexapoda, which includes the insects. These animals dominate the land. All hexapods have three pairs (six

appendages) of walking appendages.

460

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9.

Invertebrates

• Crustacea, which includes lobsters, crabs, barnacles, crayﬁsh, and shrimp. These animals dominate the ocean,
and usually have a set of anterior appendages that are modiﬁed as mandibles, which function in grasping,
biting, and chewing food.

FIGURE 9.17
Spiders are one type of arthropod.

Characteristics of Arthropods

Characteristics of arthropods include:

1. A segmented body ( Figure 9.18) with a head, a thorax, and abdomen segments.
2. Appendages on at least one segment. They can be used for feeding, sensory reception, defense, and locomo-

tion. In addition to legs, antennas and mouth parts are considered modiﬁed appendages.

3. A nervous system.
4. A hard exoskeleton made of chitin, which gives them physical protection and resistance to drying out. In order

to grow, arthropods shed this outer covering in a process called molting.

5. An open circulatory system with hemolymph, a blood-like ﬂuid. A series of hearts move the hemolymph
into the body cavity where it comes in direct contact with the tissues. Hemolymph is involved with oxygen
distribution.

6. A complete digestive system with a mouth and an anus.
7. Aquatic arthropods use gills to exchange gases. These gills have a large surface area in contact with the water,

so they can absorb more oxygen.

8. Land-living arthropods have internal surfaces that help exchange gasses. Insects and most other terrestrial
species have a tracheal system, where air sacs lead into the body from pores in the exoskeleton. These pores
cover a large part of their external body surface. Others use book lungs, gills modiﬁed for breathing air, as
seen in species like the coconut crab. Some areas of the legs of soldier crabs are covered with an oxygen
absorbing skin. Land crabs sometimes have two different structures: one used for breathing underwater, and
another used to absorb oxygen from the air.

• Give examples of crustaceans.
• Describe the features of crustaceans.

What are shrimp?
Shrimp are an example of crustaceans, one group within the arthropods. Shrimp live on the ocean ﬂoor in many
parts of the world. Shrimp are not only food for humans; they are also an important food source for larger marine
animals.

Crustaceans

Crustaceans are a large group of arthropods, consisting of almost 52,000 species. The majority of crustaceans are
aquatic. Some live in the ocean, while others live in fresh water. A few groups have adapted to living on land, such
as land crabs, hermit crabs, and woodlice ( Figure 9.19). Crustaceans are among the most successful animals, and
can be considered the dominant aquatic animals. Though small, crustaceans are numerous enough to be the main
source of energy for large ocean mammals. They are found as much in the oceans as insects are on land.

Classes of Crustaceans

Six classes of crustaceans are generally recognized ( Table 9.4).

Can Crustaceans Move?

Remember that crustaceans are an arthropod subphylum, and that arthropod means "jointed feet." As expected, the
majority of crustaceans can move. A few groups are parasitic and live attached to their hosts. Adult barnacles (
Figure 9.20) cannot move, so they attach themselves headﬁrst to a rock or log.

FIGURE 9.20
Barnacles are non-moving crustaceans.
Many barnacles attach themselves to
man-made structures.

Characteristics of Crustaceans

Characteristics of crustaceans include:

1. An exoskeleton that may be bound together, such as in the carapace, the thick back shield seen in many

crustaceans that often forms a protective space for the gills.

2. A main body cavity with an expanded circulatory system. Blood is pumped by a heart located near the back.

466

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9.

Invertebrates

3. A digestive system consisting of a straight tube that has a gastric mill for grinding food and a pair of digestive

glands that absorb food.

4. Structures that function like kidneys to remove wastes. These are located near the antennae.
5. A brain that exists in the form of ganglia, or connections between nerve cells.
6. Crustaceans periodically shed the outer skeleton, grow rapidly for a short time, and then form another hard
skeleton. They cannot grow underneath their outer exoskeleton. They are very vulnerable during this time, as
they lack their hard shell.

Crustaceans Reproduction

Most crustaceans have separate sexes, so they reproduce sexually using eggs and sperm. Many land crustaceans,
such as the Christmas Island red crab, mate every season and return to the sea to release the eggs. Others, such as
woodlice, lay their eggs on land when the environment is damp. In some crustaceans, the females keep the eggs until
they hatch into free-swimming larvae.

www.ck12.org

9.15 Centipedes and Millipedes

• Distinguish centipedes from millipedes.
• Describe the habitat of Myriapoda.

How many legs does a centipede have?
You might think that centipedes have a hundred legs. But many species of centipedes don’t have quite that many
legs! The common house centipide has only 15 pairs of legs.

Centipededs and Millipedes

Centipedes and millipedes belong to the subphylum Myriapoda, which contains 13,000 species. They all live on
land, which makes sense as all those legs are more adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle, as opposed to an aquatic lifestyle.
The Myriapoda are divided among four classes: (1) Chilopoda (centipedes), (2) Diplopoda (millipedes), (3) Sym-
phyla (symphylans), and (4) Pauropoda (pauropods). They range from having over 750 legs to having fewer than
ten legs. They have a single pair of antennae and simple eyes.

468

www.ck12.org

Habitat

Chapter 9.

Invertebrates

Myriapoda are mostly found in moist forests, where they help to break down decaying plant material. A few live
in grasslands, semi-arid habitats, or even deserts. Most myriapods are decomposers, with the majority herbivores
breaking down decaying plant material, but centipedes are nighttime predators. Centipedes roam around looking
for small animals to bite and eat; their prey includes insects, spiders, and other small invertebrates. If the centipede
is large enough, it will even attack small vertebrates, like lizards. Although not generally considered dangerous to
humans, many from this group can cause temporary blistering and discoloration of the skin.

Centipedes

Centipedes ("hundred feet") ( Figure 9.21) are fast, predatory carnivores, and venomous. There are around 3,300
described species, ranging from one tiny species (less than half an inch in length) to one giant species (the Peruvian
giant yellow-leg centipede or Amazonian giant centipede), which may grow larger than 12 inches. This giant
centipede has been known to attack, kill and eat much larger animals, including tarantulas. Centipedes have one
pair of legs per body segment, with the ﬁrst pair of legs behind the head modiﬁed into a pair of fangs containing a
poison gland. Many centipedes also guard their eggs and young by curling around them.

FIGURE 9.21
Centipede.

Millipedes

Most millipedes are slower than centipedes and feed on leaf litter and loose organic material. They can be distin-
guished from centipedes by looking at the number of legs per body segment. Millipedes have two pairs of legs per
body segment, while centipedes have a single pair of legs per body segment. Millipedes protect their eggs from
predators by using a nest of hard soil. Millipedes are not poisonous. They lack the pair of fangs containing a poison
gland that centipedes have.

Symphyla

The third class, Symphyla, contains 200 species. Symphylans resemble centipedes but are smaller and translucent.
These arthropods have an elongated body, with three pairs of thoracic legs and about nine pairs of abdominal legs,
giving this class 12 pairs total. Many spend their lives in soil feeding on plant roots, but some do live in trees.

469

9.15. Centipedes and Millipedes

Pauropods

www.ck12.org

The pauropods are typically 0.5-2.0 mm long and live on all continents except Antarctica. They are usually found in
soil, leaf litter, or other moist places. They feed on fungi and decaying organic matter, and are essentially harmless.
Adult pauropods have 11 or 12 body segments and 9-11 pairs of legs. They also possess unique forked antennae
and a distinctive pattern of movement characterized by rapid burst of movement and frequent abrupt changes in
direction. Over 700 species have been described, and they are believed to be closely related to millipedes.

Summary

• Myriapoda are usually found in moist forests, where they break down decaying plant material.
• Millipedes have two pairs of legs per body segment, while centipedes have a single pair of legs per body

segment.

Arachnids are a class of joint-legged invertebrates in the subphylum Chelicerata. They live mainly on land but are
also found in fresh water and in all marine environments, except for the open ocean. There are over 100,000 named
species, including many species of spiders, scorpions, daddy-long-legs, ticks, and mites ( Figure 9.22). There may
be up to 600,000 species in total, including unknown ones.

Characteristics of Arachnids

Arachnids have the following characteristics:

1. Four pairs of legs (eight total). You can tell the difference between an arachnid and an insect because insects

have three pairs of legs (six total).

Various diseases are caused by bacteria
that are spread to humans by arachnids,
like the tick shown here.

2. Arachnids also have two additional pairs of appendages. The ﬁrst pair, the chelicerae, serve in feeding and

defense. The next pair, the pedipalps, help the organisms feed, move, and reproduce.

3. Arachnids do not have antennae or wings.
4. The arachnid body is organized into the cephalothorax, a fusion of the head and thorax, and the abdomen.
5. To adapt to living on land, arachnids have internal breathing systems, like a trachea or a book lung.
6. Arachnids are mostly carnivorous, feeding on the pre-digested bodies of insects and other small animals.
7. Several groups are venomous. They release the venom from specialized glands to kill prey or enemies.
8. Several mites are parasitic, and some of those are carriers of disease.
9. Arachnids usually lay eggs, which hatch into immature arachnids that are similar to adults. Scorpions,

however, give birth to live young.

Arachnid Subgroups

The arachnids are divided into eleven subgroups. Below are the four most familiar subgroups, with a description of
each ( Table 9.5).

9.17 Importance of Arthropods

• Give examples of arthropods as food.
• Discuss the roles of arthropods in their ecosystem.
• Describe the importance of arthropods to humans.

Are arthropods just creepy and scary?
Many arthropods, such as scorpions, insects, and spiders, have a reputation of being a nuisance or even harmful. But
even if they are a little scary to you, that doesn’t mean that the world would be ﬁne without them.

Importance of Arthropods

Have you ever been startled by a bee landing on a ﬂower? Or surprised by a swarm of pill bugs when you overturned
a rock? These arthropods might seem a little scary to you, but they are actually performing important roles in the
environment. Arthropods are important to the ecosystem and to humans in many ways.

Arthropods as Food

Many species of crustaceans, especially crabs, lobsters ( Figure 9.23), shrimp, prawns, and crayﬁsh, are consumed
by humans, and are now farmed on a large commercial scale. Nearly 10,000,000 tons of arthropods as food were
produced in 2005. Over 70% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns. Over
80% is produced in Asia, with China producing nearly half the world’s total.
Insects and their grubs are at least as nutritious as meat, and are eaten both raw and cooked in many cultures. Beetles,
locusts, butterﬂies, ants, and stinkbugs (which have an apple ﬂavor) are insects that are regularly eaten by people in
dozens of countries. In fact, there are more than 1,900 edible insect species on Earth, hundreds of which are already

479

9.17. Importance of Arthropods

www.ck12.org

part of the diet of about two billion people worldwide. This is just under one of every three people worldwide, and
this number should continue to grow in the future.
The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now
emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods
to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s ﬂowering plants and about 35% of the world’s
food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native
bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of
animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterﬂies and moths, and beetles and other
insects.

FIGURE 9.23
Lobsters are one kind of arthropod food
source.

Arthropods in Pest Control

Humans use mites to prey on unwanted arthropods on farms or in homes. Other arthropods are used to control
weed growth. Populations of whip scorpions added to an environment can limit the populations of cockroaches
and crickets. Millipedes also control the harmful growth of destructive fungi and bacteria. When the numbers of
millipedes is low, the imbalance between predator and prey can cause harmful microorganisms to ﬂourish, and it can
became difﬁcult to manage plagues and diseases through natural processes.
Cockroaches, spiders, mites, ticks and all other insects considered as carnivorous, prey on smaller species to maintain
ecological balance. Thus, communities that have a good balance of these arthropods tend to have better pest control.

Ecological Roles

Many arthropods have extremely important roles in ecosystems. Arthropods are of ecological importance because
of their sheer numbers and extreme diversity. As mentioned above, bees, wasps, ants, butterﬂies, moths, ﬂies and
beetles are invaluable agents of pollination. Pollens and grains became accidentally attached to their chests and legs
and are transferred to other agricultural crops as these animals move about, either by walking or ﬂying. Most plants
actually produce scents to send signals to insects that food (in the form of nectar) is available.
Mites, ticks, centipedes, and millipedes are decomposers, meaning they break down dead plants and animals and
turn them into soil nutrients. This is an important role because it supplies the plants with the minerals and nutrients

480

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9.

Invertebrates

necessary for life. It also keeps dead material from accumulating in the environment. Plants then pass along those
minerals and nutrients to the animals that eat the plants.

Human Uses

Arthropods are also invaluable to humans, as they are used in many different human-made products. Examples are:

• Bees produce honey and their honeycombs contain beeswax, widely used for making candles, furniture wax

and polishes, waxed papers, antiseptics, and ﬁllings for surgical uses.

• The pollens stored in honeycombs were discovered to have a rich mixture of vitamins, enzymes, and amino
acids that could provide medical beneﬁts. They were used as ingredients for supplements and medications
that could provide relief for colds, asthma, and hay fever.

• Silk produced by arthropods, like those produced by caterpillars to protect their cocoons, is strong enough to

use and be woven into fabrics, a discovery ﬁrst used in ancient China’s silk industry.

• The spiders’ web was discovered as an additional material that could provide strength, and has became
essential raw materials for Kevlar vests, ﬁshing nets, surgical sutures, and adhesives, as they contained natural
antiseptics.

Summary

• Many crustaceans, especially crabs, lobsters, shrimp, prawns, and crayﬁsh, are food sources for humans.
• Mites, ticks, centipedes, and millipedes are decomposers, meaning they break down dead plants and animals

and turn them into soil nutrients.

• Summarize the insect head, thorax, and abdomen.
• Describe insect movement and communication.
• Explain the meaning of insects as a social animal.
• Give examples of winged insects.

What animals were the ﬁrst to evolve wings?
When someone says the word "wing," you probably think of soaring birds. Or maybe chicken wings smothered in
hot sauce. But insects were actually the ﬁrst animals to evolve wings.

What are Insects

Insects, with over a million described species, are the most diverse group of animals on Earth. They may be found
in nearly all environments on the planet. No matter where you travel, you will see organisms from this group. Adult
insects range in size from a minuscule fairy ﬂy to a 21.9-inch-long stick insect ( Figure 9.24).

Characteristics of Insects

Characteristics of Insects include:

• Segmented bodies with an exoskeleton. The outer layer of the exoskeleton is called the cuticle. It is made
up of two layers. The outer layer, or exocuticle, is thin, waxy, and water-resistant. The inner layer is much
thicker. The exocuticle is extremely thin in many soft-bodied insects, such as caterpillars.

Six segmented legs and two or four wings.
Contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory,
and reproductive structures.

• A nervous system that is divided into a brain and a ventral nerve cord.
• Respiration that occurs without lungs. Insects have a system of internal tubes and sacs that oxygen travels

through to reach body tissues. Air is taken in through the spiracles, openings on the sides of the abdomen.

• A closed digestive system, with one long enclosed coiled tube which runs lengthwise through the body, from

the mouth to the anus.

• A circulatory system that is simple and consists of only a single tube with openings. The tube pulses and

circulates blood-like ﬂuids inside the body cavity.

• Various types of movement. Insect movement can include ﬂight, walking, and swimming. Insects were the
only invertebrates to develop the ability to ﬂy, and this has played an important role in their success. Many
adult insects use six legs for walking, and they walk in alternate triangles touching the ground. This allows
the insect to walk quickly while staying stable. A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water,
like water striders ( Figure 9.26). A large number of other insects also live parts of their lives underwater.
Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted to paddle in the water. Young dragonﬂies use jet propulsion,
sending water out of their back end to move.

sion to stand on the water.

Insects are Social

Social insects, such as termites, ants, and many bees and wasps ( Figure 9.28), are the most familiar social species.
They live together in large, well-organized colonies. Only those insects which live in nests or colonies can home.

Homing means that an insect can return to a single hole among many other apparently identical holes, even after a
long trip or after a long time.
A few insects migrate in groups. For example, the monarch butterﬂy ﬂies between Mexico and North America each
spring and fall ( Figure 9.28).

Two Major Groups of Insects

Insects are divided into two major groups:

1. Wingless: Consists of two orders, the bristle tails and the silverﬁsh.
2. Winged insects: All other orders of insects. They are named below.

Mayﬂies; dragonﬂies and damselﬂies; stoneﬂies; webspinners; angel insects; earwigs; grasshoppers, crickets, and
katydids; stick insects; ice-crawlers and gladiators; cockroaches and termites; mantids; lice; thrips; true bugs,
aphids, and cicadas; wasps, bees, and ants; beetles; twisted-winged parasites; snakeﬂies; alderﬂies and dobsonﬂies;
lacewings and antlions; hangingﬂies (including ﬂeas); true ﬂies; caddisﬂies; and butterﬂies, moths, and skippers.

Summary

• Characteristics of insects include segmented bodies, a system of internal tubes and sacs through which oxygen

travels, and a simple circulatory system.

• Insects use many types of communication, including bioluminescence, sounds, and phermones.
• Some insects are social and live in groups.

9.19 Insect Food

• Distinguish methods of insect eating.
• Deﬁne proboscis.
• Explain sponging.

How do butterﬂies eat?
You might have seen butterﬂies searching for food on a ﬂower before. They have long, tube-like mouthparts that
can reach deep within a ﬂower. The butterﬂy uses this mouth-tube to siphon nectar from the ﬂower, as if sucking
through a straw.

Insect Food

What do insets eat? Practically anything they want. There are so many different insects, that among all of them, no
potential food is safe. Lots of insects eat plants, some insects eat other insects, and some even drink blood. Many
insects eat nectar from plants. And some insects will eat whatever scraps of food you leave lying around.
A few insects, such as mayﬂies and some moths, never eat. That’s because their lives are over in just a few hours
or days. Once these insects become adults, they lay eggs, and then die. On the other hand, some insects are very
healthy eaters. A silkworm eats enough leaves to increase its weight more than 4,000 times in just 56 days, as the
silkworm increases in size about 10,000 times since birth. A locust eats its own weight in plants every day. Just
imagine eating your own weight in food every day. You probably couldn’t. You would most likely get very sick even
if you tried.

489

9.19. Insect Food

How do Insects Eat?

www.ck12.org

Insects eat in many different ways and they eat a huge range of foods. Around half are plant-eaters, feeding on
leaves, roots, seeds, nectar, or wood. Aphids and leafhoppers suck up the sap from plants. Praying mantises are
predators, hunting other small creatures, including insects like moths, caterpillars, ﬂies, beetles, and spiders. Insects
like mosquitoes and aphids have special mouthparts that help them pierce and suck. Others, like assassin bugs (
Figure 9.29) and certain species of female mosquitoes, eat other insects. Fleas and lice are parasites, eating the ﬂesh
or blood of larger animals without killing them.
Insects have different types of appendages (arms and legs) adapted for capturing and feeding on prey. They also have
special senses that help them detect prey. Furthermore, insects have a wide range of mouthparts used for feeding.

FIGURE 9.29
An assassin bug feasts on a beetle.

Examples of chewing insects include dragonﬂies, grasshoppers, and beetles. These insects use one pair of jaws to
bite off bits of food and grind them down. Another pair of jaws helps to push the food down the throat. Some larvae
also have chewing mouthparts, as in the caterpillar stages of moths and butterﬂies ( Figure 9.30).

FIGURE 9.30
Caterpillar feeding on a host plant.

Some insects use siphoning, as if sucking through a straw, like moths and butterﬂies. This long mouth-tube that they
use to suck up the nectar of the ﬂower is called a proboscis. Some moths, however, have no mouthparts at all. Some
insects obtain food by sponging, like the houseﬂy. Sponging means that the mouthpart can absorb liquid food and

490

Invertebrates

send it to the esophagus. The houseﬂy is able to eat solid food by releasing saliva and dabbing it over the food. As
the saliva dissolves the food, the sponging mouthpart absorbs the liquid food.

• Distinguish complete from incomplete metamorphosis.
• Deﬁne nymph and pupa.

What is this?
These butterﬂy eggs look like tiny pearls on a leaf. The adult butterﬂy often lays her eggs on a speciﬁc type of plant.
This ensures that the future caterpillars will have plenty of food to eat.

Insect Reproduction and Life Cycle

Most insects can reproduce very quickly within a short period of time. With a short generation time, they evolve
faster and can quickly adjust to environmental changes. Most insects reproduce by sexual reproduction. The
female produces eggs, which are fertilized by the male, and then the eggs are usually placed near the required food.
In some insects, there is asexual reproduction during which the offspring come from a single parent. In this type
of reproduction, the offspring are almost identical to the mother. This is most often seen in aphids and scale insects.
With a few exceptions, all insect life begins as an egg. After leaving the egg, insects must grow and transform until
reaching adulthood. Only the adult insect can mate and reproduce. The physical transformation of an insect from
one stage of its life cycle to another is known as metamorphosis.

Three Types of Metamorphosis

An insect can have one of three types of metamorphosis and life cycles ( Table 9.9). Metamorphosis describes how
insects transform from an immature or young insect into an adult insect in at least two stages. Insects may undergo

gradual metamorphosis (incomplete), where transformation is subtle, or complete metamorphosis, where each stage
of the life cycle appears quite different from the others. In some insects, there may be no true metamorphosis at all.

9.21 Importance of Insects

• Explain the role of insects in their ecosystems.
• Discuss the importance of insects to people.
• Describe the use of insects as food.

Would you like to try a grasshopper taco?
It might seem disgusting to you, but insects are an important food source in many places across the globe. Crickets,
ants, grasshoppers, and other insects are traditional foods in parts of Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

Importance of Insects

Many insects are considered to be pests by humans. However, insects are also very important for numerous reasons.

Ecological Importance

Insects can be found in every environment on Earth. While a select few insects, such as the Arctic Wooly Bear Moth,
live in the harsh Arctic climate, the majority of insects are found in the warm and moist tropics. Insects have adapted
to a broad range of habitats, successfully ﬁnding their own niche, because they will eat almost any substance that
has nutritional value.
Insects are crucial components of many ecosystems, where they perform many important functions. They aerate the
soil, pollinate blossoms, and control insect and plant pests. Many insects, especially beetles, are scavengers, feeding
on dead animals and fallen trees, thereby recycling nutrients back into the soil. As decomposers, insects help create
top soil, the nutrient-rich layer of soil that helps plants grow. Burrowing bugs, such as ants and beetles, dig tunnels
that provide channels for water, beneﬁting plants. Bees, wasps, butterﬂies, and ants pollinate ﬂowering plants (
Figure 9.32). Gardeners love the big-eyed bug and praying mantis because they control the size of certain insect

497

9.21. Importance of Insects

www.ck12.org

populations, such as aphids and caterpillars, which feed on new plant growth. Finally, all insects fertilize the soil
with the nutrients from their droppings.

FIGURE 9.32
Bees are important pollinators of ﬂower-
ing plants.

Economic Importance

Insects have tremendous economic importance. Some insects produce useful substances, such as honey, wax,
lacquer, and silk. Honeybees have been raised by humans for thousands of years for honey. The silkworm greatly
affected human history. When the Chinese used worms to develop silk, the silk trade connected China to the rest of
the world. Adult insects, such as crickets, as well as insect larvae, are also commonly used as ﬁshing bait.

Insects as Food

Insects, of course, are not just eaten by people. Insects are the sole food source for many amphibians, reptiles, birds,
and mammals, making their roles in food chains and food webs extremely important. It is possible that food webs
could collapse if insect populations decline.
In some parts of the world, insects are used for food by humans. Insects are a rich source of protein, vitamins, and
minerals, and are prized as delicacies in many third-world countries. In fact, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd an insect that is not
eaten in one form or another by people. Among the most popular are cicadas, locusts, mantises, grubs, caterpillars,
crickets, ants, and wasps. Many people support this idea to provide a source of protein in human nutrition. From
South America to Japan, people eat roasted insects, like grasshoppers or beetles.

Insects in Medicine

Insects have also been used in medicine. In the past, ﬂy larvae ( maggots) were used to treat wounds to prevent or
stop gangrene. Gangrene is caused by infection of dead ﬂesh. Maggots only eat dead ﬂesh, so when they are placed
on the dead ﬂesh of humans, they actually clean the wound and can prevent infection. Some hospitals still use this
type of treatment.

9.22. Control of Insects

www.ck12.org

9.22 Control of Insects

• Summarize common insect pests.
• Explain methods to control insects.
• Distinguish biological control from chemical control of insects.

Are ladybugs dangerous?
Ladybugs won’t hurt you. But they are dangerous to some other insects! This ladybug is eating plant-harming bugs
known as aphids. Since they have an appetite for aphids, ladybugs are a farmer’s friend.

Control of Insects

Though insects can be very important, some are also considered pests. Common insect pests include:

1. Parasitic insects, such as mosquitoes, lice, and bed bugs.
2. Insects that transmit diseases, including mosquitoes and ﬂies.
3. Insects that damage structures, such as termites ( Figure 9.33).
4. Insects that destroy crops, including locusts and weevils.

Many scientists who study insects are involved in various forms of pest control. Most utilize insect-killing chemicals,
but more and more rely on other methods. Ways to control insect pests are described below.

Biological Control

Biological control of pests in farming is a method of controlling pests by using other insects (or other natural
predators of the pests). Biological control of insects relies on predation and parasitism. Insect predators, such as

500

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9.

Invertebrates

FIGURE 9.33
Termites can destroy wooden structures.

ladybugs and lacewings, consume a large number of other insects during their lifetime. If you add ladybugs to
your farm or garden, they will help keep insect pests, such as aphids, under control. Aphids are among the most
destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions, so any control of these pests is beneﬁcial.
Ladybugs also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The larvae of many hoverﬂy species also feed
upon aphids, with one larva consuming up to ﬁfty aphids a day, which is about 1,000 in its lifetime. They also eat
fruit tree spider mites and small caterpillars. Dragonﬂies are important predators of mosquitoes, and can be used to
control this pest. Parasitic insects include insects such as wasps and ﬂies that lay their eggs on or in the body of an
insect host, which is then used as a food for developing larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Caterpillars also tend
to be one likely target of parasitic wasps.

Chemical Control

Chemical control of pests involves the use of insecticides. Insecticides, which are also known as pesticides, are
most often used to kill insects. Insecticides are chemicals that kill insects. The U.S. spends $9 billion each year on
pesticides. Disadvantages to using pesticides include human, ﬁsh, and honeybee poisonings, and the contamination
of meat and dairy products.
When choosing to use an insecticide, there are numerous points to consider. Negative effects of the pesticide should
try to be minimized. Important questions to consider include the following.

• What is the chemical’s success against the target pest? Will the insecticide provide the desired level of control

of the pest? If the answer is no, other methods of control should be considered.

• Does the chemical have an impact on natural enemies of the pest? In large scale efforts to rid areas of
mosquitoes, the insecticide used also killed the dragonﬂy. This effort removed a natural predator of the
mosquito. This may be an unacceptable negative effect of using the insecticide.

• How susceptible is the crop to insect damage? If the crop is not heavily damaged, only minor pest control

may be needed. This may affect the amount or type of insecticide used.

• How toxic is the chemical to the environment and humans? Some older insecticides are extremely poisonous.
Keep in mind that users of these poisons have a community responsibility to minimize the contamination of
the surrounding environment, as well as keeping animals, surrounding crops and humans safe.

501

9.22. Control of Insects

www.ck12.org

• Does using the pesticide result in the development of resistance? If so, this can make additional use of the
pesticide less effective. As the resistance will be passed to future generations of the insect (which is natural
selection in action), this could be considered a negative side-effect of pesticide use.

Summary

• Harmful insects include those that can destroy buildings and crops or transmit disease.
• Insecticides are commonly used to control insect pests, but they can have harmful effects on the environment.

Invertebrates describes eight invertebrate phyla with the greatest number of species. From the simple sponge to the
echinodermata, this diverse group of organisms is anything but simple. Essentially, the only common characteristic

502

among all the groups is the lack of a backbone. Many people may not even recognize the sponge as an animal. But
it is. And how many people think a worm is an insect? But it is not. Add to this group all the different species of
insects, and the diverseness of this group is easily apparent.

• Deﬁne chordate.
• Explain the importance of the notochord.
• Describe the features of the chordates.
• Outline the classiﬁcation of chordates.

What do these two animals have in common with you?
Notice the orange ﬁsh. Around him is another type of animal, a tunicate, in blue. Tunicates, ﬁsh, and humans seem
very different from one another, but they do have some things in common. They are all chordates.

Chordates

Did you know that ﬁsh, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals are all related? They are all chordates. Chordates
are a group of animals that includes vertebrates, as well as several closely related invertebrates. Chordates (phylum
Chordata) are named after a feature they all share, a notochord. A notochord is a hollow nerve cord along the back.

Characteristics of the Chordates

Chordates are deﬁned by a set of four characteristics that are shared by these animals at some point during their
development.
In some chordates, all four traits are present in the adult animal and serve important functions.
However, in many chordates, including humans, some traits are present only during the embryonic stage. After
that, these traits may disappear.
All chordates have four main traits ( Figure 10.1):

508

www.ck12.org

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

1. Post-anal tail: The tail is opposite the head and extends past the anus.
2. Dorsal hollow nerve cord: "Dorsal" means that the nerve cord runs along the top of the animal. In some

animals, the nerve cord develops into the brain and spinal cord.

3. Notochord: The notochord lies below the nerve cord. It is a rigid structure where muscles attach.
4. Pharyngeal slits: Pharyngeal slits are used to ﬁlter out food from water by some simple chordates. In most

chordates, however, they are only present during the embryonic stages and serve no apparent purpose.

FIGURE 10.1
Body Plan of a Typical Chordate. The
body plan of a chordate includes a post-
anal tail, notochord, dorsal hollow nerve
cord, and pharyngeal slits.

Classiﬁcation of the Chordates

The chordates are divided into nine classes. Five of the classes are the ﬁsh, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
There are actually ﬁve classes of marine chordates (for example, sharks are cartilaginous ﬁsh which are distinct from
bony ﬁsh), and these will be discussed in additional concepts.
The chordate phylum is broken down into three subphyla:

1. Urochordata: The tunicates, pictured in the introduction, make up this group. The urochordates are sessile
(non-moving) marine animals with sack-like bodies and tubes for water movement. Urochordates have a
notochord and nerve cord only during the larval stage.

2. Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates include the lancelets ( Figure 10.2), ﬁsh-like marine animals often found

half-buried in the sand. Cephalochordates have a notochord and nerve cord but no backbone.

3. Vertebrata: Humans and other mammals, along with ﬁsh, amphibians, reptiles, and birds, fall in this category.

In vertebrates, the notochord is typically smaller and surrounded by a backbone.

FIGURE 10.2
The lancelet, an example of a chordate, is
found in shallow ocean waters.

Summary

• Chordates are animals that have a notochord, post-anal tail, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits.
• Chordates include all vertebrates and some invertebrates.

(Note: this resource refers to human embryos as having gill slits. This is a commonly held misconception which
seems to have originated in a now defunct theory by Ernst Haeckel. In the embryonic development of chordates,
there is a stage where an invagination, called "gill pouches" or "pharyngeal pouches," appear in vertebrate embryos.
This invagination does develop into gills in some species, but in other species the invagination develops into other
structures. So, while parallels in the development of chordates are accurate, it is misleading to say human embryos
have gill slits. You can ﬁnd out more here http://www.angelﬁre.com/journal/Philsviews/Science/embryo.html .)

What animals have a backbone?
You have a backbone, or vertebrate (or vertebral) column. Can you guess what other animals also have a backbone?
Frogs, snakes, birds, and many other animals all have backbones. Animals that have backbones are known as
vertebrates.

Introduction to Vertebrates

Vertebrates are animals with backbones. These include ﬁsh, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

10.2. Vertebrate Characteristics

Characteristics of Vertebrates

www.ck12.org

The primary feature shared by all vertebrates is the vertebral column, or backbone. The vertebral column protects
the spinal cord.
Other typical vertebrate traits include:

• The cranium (skull) to protect the brain. The brain is attached to the spinal cord.
• An internal skeleton. The internal skeleton supports the animal, protects internal organs, and allows for

movement.

• A deﬁned head region with a brain. The head region has an accumulation of sense organs.

Living vertebrates range in size from a carp species, as little as 0.3 inches, to the blue whale, which can be as large
as 110 feet ( Figure 10.3).

Classiﬁcation of Vertebrates

Vertebrates, or subphylum Vertebrata, are all members of the phylum Chordata. Although there is some disagreement
on how to classify animals, the traditional system divides the vertebrates into seven classes ( Table 10.1).

10.3 Fish

• List the general traits of ﬁsh.
• Deﬁne ectothermic.
• Describe how ﬁsh breathe and reproduce.
• Explain how ﬁsh are important to people.

Is this animal a ﬁsh?
This mudskipper might not seem like a ﬁsh. It’s not swimming in a lake or an ocean, and it appears to be using its
ﬁns like legs. Mudskippers can breathe through their skin and burrow in the mud, essentially living on land for a
brief amount of time. These features are not typical of ﬁsh, and, yet, mudskippers are still classiﬁed as ﬁsh. So what
features deﬁne a ﬁsh?

Characteristics of Fish

What exactly is a ﬁsh? You probably think the answer is obvious. You may say that a ﬁsh is an animal that swims in
the ocean or a lake, using ﬁns. But as we saw with the mudskipper, not all ﬁsh spend all their time in water. So how
do scientists deﬁne ﬁsh?
Some characteristics of ﬁsh include:

1. They are ectothermic, meaning their temperature depends on the temperature of their environment. Ectother-
mic animals are cold-blooded in that they cannot raise their body temperature on their own. This is unlike
humans, whose temperature is controlled from inside the body.

2. They are covered with scales.
3. They have two sets of paired ﬁns and several unpaired ﬁns.
4. They also have a streamlined body that allows them to swim rapidly.

515

10.3. Fish

www.ck12.org

Fish are aquatic vertebrates, meaning they have backbones. They became a dominant form of sea life and eventually
evolved into land vertebrates. There are three classes of ﬁsh: Class Agnatha (the jawless ﬁsh), Class Chondrichthyes
(the cartilaginous ﬁsh), and Class Osteichthyes (the bony ﬁsh). All have the characteristics of ﬁsh in common,
though there are differences unique to each class.

FIGURE 10.4
The humphead or Napoleon wrasse
shows some of the general traits of ﬁsh,
including scales, ﬁns, and a streamlined
body.

How do Fish Breathe?

In order to absorb oxygen from the water, ﬁsh use gills ( Figure 10.5). Gills take dissolved oxygen from water as
the water ﬂows over the surface of the gill.

FIGURE 10.5
Gills help a ﬁsh breathe.

How Do Fish Reproduce?

Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most ﬁsh, the
eggs develop outside of the mother’s body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside
the mother’s body. The male and female ﬁsh release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization
occurs. Female ﬁsh release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.

516

www.ck12.org

How Big Are Fish?

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

Fish range in size from the 65-foot, 75,000 pound whale shark ( Figure 10.6) to the stout infantﬁsh, which is about
0.33 inches (8.4 mm), and the Paedocypris progenetica carp species of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, which is
about 0.31 inches (7.9 mm) long, making it also the smallest known vertebrate animal. The second-largest ﬁsh is
the basking shark, which grows to about 40 feet and 8,000 pounds. Both of the large sharks may look ferocious, and
would probably scare anyone who comes across one in the water, but both species are ﬁlter-feeders, and feed on tiny
ﬁsh and plankton. The tiny carp species is unique in that it has the appearance of larvae, with a reduced skeleton
lacking a cranium, which leaves the brain unprotected by bone. The ﬁsh lives in dark acidic waters, having a pH of
3. Keep in mind that whales are not ﬁsh, they are mammals.

FIGURE 10.6
Whale sharks are the largest cartilagi-
nous ﬁsh.

Exceptions to Common Fish Traits

There are exceptions to many of these ﬁsh traits. For example, tuna, swordﬁsh, and some species of shark show
some warm-blooded adaptations and are able to raise their body temperature signiﬁcantly above that of the water
around them.
Some species of ﬁsh have a slower, more maneuverable swimming style, like eels and rays ( Figure 10.7). Body
shape and the arrangement of ﬁns are highly variable, and the surface of the skin may be naked, as in moray eels, or
covered with scales. Scales can be of a variety of different types.

Why Fish are Important

How are ﬁsh important? Of course, they are used as food ( Figure 10.8). In fact, people all over the world either catch
ﬁsh in the wild or farm them in much the same way as cattle or chickens. Farming ﬁsh is known as aquaculture.
Fish are also caught for recreation to display in the home or in a public aquarium.

Summary

• Fish are ectothermic, have a streamlined body covered with scales, and have two sets of paired ﬁns and several

unpaired ﬁns.

• To obtain ﬁsh for food, people catch ﬁsh in the wild or farm them.

www.ck12.org

10.4 Jawless Fish

• Describe the characteristics of jawless ﬁsh.
• Name the two living groups of jawless ﬁsh.

What is this organism?
With this huge sucker lined with teeth, this organism might look like something out of science ﬁction. But this is a
real ﬁsh found in the ocean, known as a lamprey. They use their teeth and sucker to bore into other ﬁsh and suck
their blood. The lamprey is an example of a jawless ﬁsh.

Jawless Fish

What deﬁnes a jawless ﬁsh? You can probably guess. A jawless ﬁsh is a ﬁsh without a jaw. But there are other
features that are shared by this class of organisms. Why would such an organism evolve? These ﬁsh were the ﬁrst
vertebrates to evolve. Logically, this makes sense, in that the vertebral column would evolve ﬁrst, with the more
complex jaw bones evolving later. The early jawless ﬁsh are thought to have relied on ﬁlter feeding to capture their
food, and most likely would have sucked water and debris from the seaﬂoor into their mouth, releasing water and
waste out of their gills. As other sea life evolved, these jawless ﬁsh began to feed on other ﬁsh species, and are now
considered a pest in their habitat. Lampreys have no natural predators.

Features of Jawless Fish

Jawless ﬁsh are missing the following parts:

1. Jaws.
2. Paired ﬁns.
3. A stomach.

520

www.ck12.org

Characteristics they do have include:

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

1. A notochord, both in larvae and adults. Recall a notochord is a support rod that runs along the back of the

ﬁsh.

2. Seven or more paired gill pouches. These organs take dissolved oxygen from water.
3. The branchial arches, a series of arches that support the gills of aquatic amphibians and ﬁshes. They lie close

to the body’s surface.

4. A light sensitive pineal eye, an eye-like structure that can detect light.
5. A cartilaginous skeleton, a skeleton made of a ﬂexible rubber-like supportive material called cartilage. This

is similar to the skeleton of cartilaginous ﬁsh, which includes sharks and rays.

6. A heart with two chambers.
7. Reproduction using external fertilization.
8. They are ectothermic. This means that their internal temperature depends on the temperature of their envi-

ronment.

Classiﬁcation of Jawless Fish

Most scientists agree that the jawless ﬁsh are part of the the superclass Agnatha. They belong to the phylum
Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata. There are two living groups of jawless ﬁsh, with about 100 species in total:
lampreys and hagﬁsh ( Figure 10.9). Although hagﬁsh belong to the subphylum Vertebrata, they do not technically
have vertebrae (though they do have a skull), whereas lampreys do have vertebrae. For this reason, scientists still
disagree on the classiﬁcation of jawless ﬁsh.

FIGURE 10.9
A hagﬁsh.

Summary

• The jawless ﬁsh include the lampreys and the hagﬁsh.
• Jaws, ﬁns, and stomachs are absent in the jawless ﬁsh.
• Features of the jawless ﬁsh include a notochord, paired gill pouches, a pineal eye, and a two-chambered heart.

10.5 Cartilaginous Fish

• Give examples of cartilaginous ﬁsh.
• Describe the features of the cartilaginous ﬁsh.
• Explain the importance of Leydig’s organ and placoid scales.
• Discuss how sharks are distinguished.

How are these organisms different?
The two rays and the other ﬁsh pictured here do have a lot in common. They have streamlined bodies well suited for
movement in the ocean. One difference, however, is their skeletons. The lone ﬁsh has a skeleton of bone. The rays
have a skeleton of cartilage, and so they are known as cartilaginous ﬁsh.

Cartilaginous Fish

The 1,000 or so species of cartilaginous ﬁsh are subdivided into two subclasses: the ﬁrst includes sharks, rays,
and skates; the second includes chimaera, sometimes called ghost sharks. Fish from this group range in size from
the dwarf lanternshark, at 6.3 inches, to the over 50-foot whale shark. Sharks obviously have jaws, as do the other
cartilaginous ﬁsh. These ﬁsh evolved from the jawless ﬁsh. So why did ﬁsh eventually evolve to have jaws? Such
an adaptation would allow ﬁsh to eat a much wider variety of food, including plants and other organisms.
Other characteristics of cartilaginous ﬁsh include:

• Paired ﬁns.
• Paired nostrils.
• Scales.
• Two-chambered hearts.
• Skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone. Cartilage is supportive tissue that does not have as much

calcium as bones, which makes bones rigid. Cartilage is softer and more ﬂexible than bone.

523

10.5. Cartilaginous Fish

Blood, Skin, and Teeth

www.ck12.org

Since they do not have bone marrow (as they have no bones), red blood cells are produced in the spleen, in special
tissue around the reproductive organs, and in an organ called Leydig’s organ, only found in cartilaginous ﬁshes.
The tough skin of this group of ﬁsh is covered with placoid scales, which are hard scales formed from modiﬁed
teeth. The scales are covered with a hard enamel. The hard covering and the way the scales are arranged, gives the
ﬁsh skin rough, sandpaper-like feel. The function of these scales is for protection against predators.
The shape of sharks’ teeth differ according to their diet. Species that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense
ﬂattened teeth for crushing, those that feed on ﬁsh have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger
prey, such as mammals, have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for
cutting. Sharks continually shed and replace their teeth, with some shedding as much as 35,000 teeth in a lifetime.

Superorders

The sharks, rays, and skates (which are similar to stingrays) are further broken into two superorders:

1. Rays and skates.
2. Sharks.

Sharks are some of the most frequently studied cartilaginous ﬁsh. Sharks are distinguished by such features as:

• The number of gill slits.
• The number and type of ﬁns.
• The type of teeth.
• The size of their jaws.
• Body shape.
• Their activity at night.
• An elongated, toothed snout used for slashing the ﬁsh that they eat, as seen in sawsharks.
• Teeth used for grasping and crushing shellﬁsh, a characteristic of bullhead sharks.
• A whisker-like organ named barbels that help sharks ﬁnd food, a characteristic of carpet sharks.
• A long snout (or nose-like area), characteristic of groundsharks.
• Ovoviviparous reproduction, where the eggs develop inside the mother’s body after internal fertilization,
and the young are born alive. This trait is characteristic of mackerel sharks. All sharks mate by internal
fertilization. Some sharks then lay their eggs, others allow internal development.

Summary

• The cartilaginous ﬁsh are jawed ﬁsh with paired ﬁns, paired nostrils, scales, two-chambered hearts, and

skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone.

• Examples of the cartilaginous ﬁsh include sharks, rays, and skates.

10.6 Bony Fish

• Describe the characteristics of the bony ﬁsh.
• Discuss the importance of the swim bladder and operculum.
• Distinguish ray-ﬁnned ﬁsh from lobe-ﬁnned ﬁsh.

Can ﬁsh have bones?
Of course. Many ﬁsh have bones. They serve the same function as our bones: protection and support. Notice how
the skeleton protects the ﬁsh’s brain. Also, notice the bones along the body of the ﬁsh would allow muscles to attach
to aid in movement.

Bony Fish

There are about 27,000 species of bony ﬁsh ( Figure 10.11), which are divided into two classes: ray-ﬁnned ﬁsh
and lobe-ﬁnned ﬁsh. Most bony ﬁsh are ray-ﬁnned. These thin ﬁns consist of webs of skin over ﬂexible spines.
Lobe-ﬁnned ﬁsh, on the other hand, have ﬁns that resemble stump-like appendages.

FIGURE 10.11
Fins of bony ﬁsh: ray ﬁn (left) and lobe ﬁn
(right).

Characteristics of Bony Fish

Most ﬁsh are bony ﬁsh, making them the largest group of vertebrates in existence today. They are characterized by:

527

10.6. Bony Fish

www.ck12.org

1. A head and pectoral girdles (arches supporting the forelimbs) that are covered with bones derived from the

skin.

2. A lung or swim bladder, which helps the body create a balance between sinking and ﬂoating by either ﬁlling
up with or emitting gases such as oxygen. Controlling the volume of this organ helps ﬁsh control their depth.

3. Jointed, segmented rods supporting the ﬁns.
4. A cover over the gill called the operculum, which helps them breathe without having to swim.
5. The ability to see in color, unlike most other ﬁsh.

Ray-ﬁnned Fish

Most vertebrates are ray-ﬁnned ﬁsh, with close to 27,000 known species. By comparison, there are "only" about
10,000 species of birds. The ray-ﬁnned ﬁsh have ﬁn rays, with ﬁns supported by bony spines known as rays. The
ray-ﬁnned ﬁsh are the dominant class of vertebrates, with nearly 99% of ﬁsh falling into this category. They live
in all aquatic environments, from freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain
streams.

Lobe-ﬁnned ﬁsh

The lobe-ﬁnned ﬁsh are characterized by ﬂeshy lobed ﬁns, as opposed to the bony ﬁns of the ray-ﬁnned ﬁsh. There
are two types of living lobe-ﬁnned ﬁsh: the coelacanths and the lungﬁsh. The pectoral and pelvic ﬁns have joints
resembling those of tetrapod (four-limbed land vertebrates) limbs. These ﬁns evolved into legs of amphibians, the
ﬁrst tetrapod land vertebrates. They also possess two dorsal ﬁns with separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal
ﬁn of ray-ﬁnned ﬁsh. All lobe-ﬁnned ﬁshes possess teeth covered with true enamel. The lungﬁsh also possess both
gills and lungs, solidifying this class as the ancestors of amphibians.

How Big Are Bony Fish?

The ocean sunﬁsh is the most massive bony ﬁsh in the world, up to 11 feet long and weighing up to 5,070 pounds (
Figure 10.12). Other very large bony ﬁsh include the Atlantic blue marlin, the black marlin, some sturgeon species,
the giant grouper, and the goliath grouper. The long-bodied oarﬁsh can easily be over 30 feet long, but is not nearly
as massive as the ocean sunﬁsh. In contrast, the dwarf pygmy goby measures only 0.6 inches. Fish can also be quite
valuable. In January 2013, at an auction in Tokyo’s Tsukiji ﬁsh market, a 222-kilogram (489-pound) tuna caught off
northeastern Japan sold for 155.4 million yen, which is $1,760,000.

Summary

• The bony ﬁsh are divided into two classes: ray-ﬁnned ﬁsh and lobe-ﬁnned ﬁsh.
• The bony ﬁsh are characterized by a lung or swim bladder, a cover over the gills, and bones covering the head

and pectoral girdles.

10.7 Amphibians

• Give examples of amphibians.
• Describe the characteristics of the amphibians.
• Describe amphibian adaptations for life on land.
• Summarize amphibian habitats.

What were the ﬁrst land vertebrates?
Amphibians! In order for water-dwelling animals to adapt to life on land, many new adaptations had to take place.
First, they needed to be able to breathe air instead of obtaining oxygen from water. And ﬁns don’t work well as legs!
They needed to be able to move around well on land.

Characteristics of Amphibians

What group of animals begins its life in the water, but then spends most of its life on land? Amphibians! Amphibians
are a group of vertebrates that has adapted to live in both water and on land. Amphibian larvae are born and live in
water, and they breathe using gills. The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin
and with their lungs as their lungs are not sufﬁcient to provide the necessary amount of oxygen.
There are approximately 6,000 species of amphibians. They have many different body types, physiologies, and
habitats, ranging from tropical to subarctic regions. Frogs, toads, salamanders ( Figure 10.13), newts, and caecilians
are all types of amphibians.

FIGURE 10.13
One of the many species of amphibian is
this dusky salamander.

How did Amphibians Adapt to Living on Land?

Transition to life on land meant signiﬁcant changes to both external and internal features. In order to live on land,
amphibians replaced gills with another respiratory organ, the lungs. Other adaptations include:

• Skin that prevents loss of water.
• Eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision outside of the water.
• An eardrum developed to separate the external ear from the middle ear.
• A tail that disappears in adulthood (in frogs and toads).

Like ﬁsh, amphibians are ectothermic vertebrates. They belong to the class Amphibia. There are three orders:

1. Urodela, containing salamanders and newts.
2. Anura, containing frogs and toads.
3. Apoda, containing caecilians.

Where do Amphibians Live?

Most amphibians live in fresh water, not salt water. Their habitats can include areas close to springs, streams, rivers,
lakes, swamps and ponds. They can be found in moist areas in forests, meadows and marshes. Amphibians can
be found almost anywhere there is a source of fresh water. Although there are no true saltwater amphibians, a few
can live in brackish (slightly salty) water. Some species do not need any water at all, and several species have also
adapted to live in drier environments. Most amphibians still need water to lay their eggs.

How do Amphibians Reproduce?

Amphibians reproduce sexually. The life cycle of amphibians happens in the following stages:

532

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

1. Egg Stage: Amphibian eggs are fertilized in a number of ways. External fertilization, employed by most
frogs and toads, involves a male gripping a female across her back, almost as if he is squeezing the eggs out of
her. The male releases sperm over the female’s eggs as they are laid. Another method is used by salamanders,
whereby the male deposits a packet of sperm onto the ground. The female then pulls it into her cloaca, a single
opening for her internal organ systems. Therefore, fertilization occurs internally. By contrast, caecilians and
tailed frogs use internal fertilization, just like reptiles, birds, and mammals. The male deposits sperm directly
into the female’s cloaca.

2. Larval stage: When the egg hatches, the organism is legless, lives in water, and breathes with gills, resembling

their evolutionary ancestors (ﬁsh).

3. During the larval stage, the amphibian slowly transforms into an adult by losing its gills and growing four

legs. Once development is complete, it can live on land.

Summary

• Amphibians live in both water and on land; amphibian larvae are born and live in water, and they breathe using

gills. The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs.

• Adaptations for land in amphibians include protective skin and eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision

outside of the water.

10.8 Salamanders

• Describe the features of salamanders.
• Explain the classiﬁcation of salamanders.

What has the head of a frog and the body of a lizard?
A salamander! You might have mistaken it for a lizard, but lizards are very different from salamanders. Salamanders
have moist skin, while lizards have dry scales on their skin. Furthermore, lizards live their entire lives on land.
Salamanders must reproduce in water.

Salamanders

Salamanders are characterized by slender bodies, short legs, and long tails. They are most closely related to the
caecilians, little-known legless amphibians ( Figure 10.14). Most of the animals in the salamander order look like a
cross between a lizard and a frog. They have moist, smooth skin like frogs and long tails like lizards.
Salamanders are found in most moist or arid habitats in the Northern Hemisphere, but can also be found south of the
equator. They live on all continents except Antarctica and Australia. Salamanders live in or near water or on moist
ground, often in a swamp. Some species live in water most of their life, some live their entire adult life on land, and
some live in both habitats. Some salamanders live in caves. These salamanders have pale skin and reduced eyes as
they have adapted to living in complete darkness in underground pools of water. The reduced eyes are similar to
other organisms that live in caves or underground.
Salamanders are carnivorous, eating only other animals, not plants. They will eat almost any smaller animal, such
as worms, centipedes, crickets, spiders, and slugs. Some will even eat small invertebrates. Finally, salamanders have
the ability to grow back lost limbs, as well as other body parts. This process is known as regeneration.

535

10.8. Salamanders

www.ck12.org

Salamanders have developed ways not to be eaten. Most salamanders have brightly colored, poisonous skin. The
bold color tells predators not to eat the salamander. Many salamanders have glands on the back of the neck or on the
tail that give off a poisonous or bad-tasting liquid. Some species can even shed their tail during an attack and grow
a new one later. Some salamanders stand high on its legs and waves its tail to scare away danger. One particular
salamander, the ribbed newt, has needle-like rib tips. It can squeeze its muscles to make the rib tips pierce through
its skin and into its enemy, telling the predator to stay away, a feature unique among the animal kingdom.

FIGURE 10.14
The marbled salamander (left) shows the
typical salamander body plan: slender
body, short legs, long tail, and moist skin.
Caecilian (right) are a type of legless am-
phibian most closely related to salaman-
ders.

How Do Salamanders Breathe?

Different salamanders breathe in different ways. In those that have gills, breathing occurs through the gills as water
passes over the gill slits. Sirens keep their gills all their lives, which allows them to breathe underwater.
Species that live on land lose their gills as they grow older. These salamanders develop lungs that are used in
breathing, much like breathing in mammals. Other land-living salamanders do not have lungs or gills. These are
called lungless salamanders. Instead, they "breathe," or exchange gases, through their skin. This requires blood
vessels that exchange gases to be spread throughout the skin.

How Big Are Salamanders?

Salamanders are generally small. However, some can reach a foot or more, as in the mudpuppy of North America.
In Japan and China, the giant salamander reaches 6 feet and weighs up to 66 pounds ( Figure 10.15).

Classiﬁcation of Salamanders

Salamanders belong to a group of approximately 500 species of amphibians. The order Urodela, containing sala-
manders and newts, is divided into three suborders:

1. Giant salamanders, including the hellbender and Asiatic salamanders.
2. Advanced salamanders, including lungless salamanders, mudpuppies, and newts. Newts are salamanders that

spend most of each year living on land.

3. Sirens. Sirens are salamanders that have lungs as well as gills and never develop beyond the larval stage.

Sirens have only two legs, but the other salamander species develop four legs as adults, with ﬂeshy toes at the end
of each foot. The legs on four-legged salamanders are so short that the salamander belly drags on the ground as the
animal walks. Sirens have long, strong tails that are ﬂat to help sirens swim like a ﬁsh, with the tail swinging from
side to side.

10.9 Frogs and Toads

• Distinguish frogs from toads.
• Describe the characteristics of frogs and toads.
• Explain frog reproduction and development.
• Describe the diet of frogs.

Frog or toad?
Although there is actually little difference between toads and frogs, this animal would most often be called a toad.
Frogs have moist skin, while toads have dry, bumpy skin.

Frogs and Toads

Frogs and toads are amphibians in the order Anura. In terms of classiﬁcation, there is actually not a big difference
between frogs and toads. Frogs often have long legs that are good for hopping, skin that is smooth and moist, and
special pads on their toes that help them climb. Toads are more heavyset with shorter legs, and usually have drier
skin, often with warty-looking bumps. Frogs are more likely to live in or near water than toads.
Frogs are found in many areas of the world, from the tropics to subarctic regions, but most species are found in
tropical rainforests. Consisting of more than 5,000 species (about 88% of amphibian species are frogs), they are
among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Frogs range in size from less than 0.5 inches in species in Brazil and
Cuba to the over 1-foot (33 cm) long goliath frog of Cameroon, which can weigh up to 7 pounds. That is 1-foot from
the nose to the back of the body, not including the length of the legs. Even the largest frogs are signiﬁcantly smaller
than common reptiles.

539

10.9. Frogs and Toads

Characteristics of Frogs

www.ck12.org

Adult frogs are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed ﬁnger-like parts, and the lack of a tail. They
also have a three-chambered heart, as do all tetrapods except birds and mammals. Most frogs live part of the time
in water and part of the time on land. They move easily on land by jumping or climbing. To become great jumpers,
frogs evolved long hind legs and long ankle bones. They also have a short backbone with only ten vertebrae. Frog
and toad skin hangs loosely on the body, and skin texture can be smooth, warty, or folded.
Frogs and toads don’t have fur, feathers, or scales on their skin. Instead, they have a moist and permeable skin layer
covered with mucous glands. Their special skin allows them to breathe through their skin in addition to using their
lungs. They are vulnerable to water loss through the skin in dry conditions, which is why they need to live near
water or in moist environments. The thin layer of mucous keeps the skin moist.
In order to live on land and in water, frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is see-through to protect the eyes
underwater, and the two other ones let them see on land. Frogs also have a tympanum, which acts like a simple ear.
They are found on each side of the head. In some species, the tympanum is covered by skin.

FIGURE 10.16
A tree frog. Notice the powerful muscles
in the limbs and the coverings around the
eyes.

How do Frogs Reproduce?

Frogs typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds, or lakes. Their larvae, or tadpoles, have gills, a tail, but no legs,
and need to live in water. If fact, they are quite similar to a ﬁsh. Tadpoles develop into adult frogs in water ( Figure
10.17). During this transformation, they develop lungs, lose their tails and form their four legs.
You may hear males "ribbiting," producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating
and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract
mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across
her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and,
in some species, also guards them.

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

FIGURE 10.17
Frogs develop from tadpoles, which de-
velop from eggs. Notice the formation
of the two powerful back legs used for
jumping.

How Do Frogs Eat?

Adult frogs are meat-eaters and eat mostly insects, spiders, slugs and worms. Larger species will eat mice, birds,
and even other small reptiles and amphibians. Frogs do not have teeth on their lower jaw, so they usually swallow
their food whole. Some frogs have teeth on the upper jaw that are used to hold the prey in place.
Frogs and toads are responsible for keeping a large part of the world’s insect population under control. They catch
these insects using their long tongue. The frog tongue is about a third the length of the frog’s body, though they can
grow even longer. They can easily reach 12 inches long in an adult frog. Frog’s tongues are attached to the front of
their mouths rather than at the back like humans. They release a sticky substance at the precise moment of impact
with their food. When a frog catches an insect it throws its sticky tongue out of it’s mouth and wraps it around its
prey. The frog’s tongue then snaps back and throws the food down its throat. This happens about as fast as a blink
of your eyes.

Summary

• Frogs are characterized by long hind legs, webbed ﬁnger-like parts, a tympanum, and the lack of a tail.
• A frog’s "ribbit" is a mating call used to attract females.

10.10 Role of Amphibians

• Describe the importance of amphibians to humans.
• Discuss the use of amphibians as food.
• Explain the role of amphibians in research.

Would you eat this?
This is a plate of frog legs! Many people would view this dish as a tasty treat. As you can see, one way amphibians
are important to people is that they can be used as a food source.

Role of Amphibians

Humans have used amphibians for a number of purposes for thousands of years, if not longer. Amphibians play
signiﬁcant roles in many food webs and are thus an important part of many ecosystems. For example, frogs keep
insect populations stable. Extinction of frogs, or just signiﬁcant decreases in the frog population, would probably
have serious consequences for agricultural crops.
Humans have also consumed amphibians, especially frogs, probably since they ﬁrst ate meat. More recently,
amphibians have been tremendously useful in research.

Amphibians as Foods

Amphibians play important roles in many ecosystems, especially as middle players in many food chains and food
webs. In addition to consuming many worms and insects and other arthropods, and even some small reptiles and
mammals and ﬁsh, they are prey for turtles and snakes, as well as some ﬁsh and birds. Tadpoles keep waterways
clean by feeding on algae.

543

10.10. Role of Amphibians

www.ck12.org

Frogs are raised as a food source for humans. Frog legs are a delicacy in China, France, the Philippines, northern
Greece, and the American south, especially the Frensh-speaking parts of Louisiana. Only the upper joint of the hind
leg is served, which has a single bone similar to the upper joint of a chicken or turkey wing. They are commonly
prepared by grilling or deep frying, sometimes breaded, though they can also be served with garlic, or turned into a
soup or stew. Some estimates have well over a billion frogs harvested a year as food. That’s about one frog harvested
for every seven people on the planet.

Amphibians in Research

Amphibians have long been used in scientiﬁc research, especially developmental and physiological processes,
largely due to their unique ability to undergo metamorphosis, and in some species, to regenerate limbs.
Amphibians are also used in cloning research. Cloning involves making identical copies of a parent organism, and
the large amphibian egg helps in this process. They are also used to study embryos because their eggs lack shells, so
it is easy to watch their development.
The African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is a species that is studied to understand aspects of developmental biology.
It is a good model organism because it is easy to raise in a lab and has a large embryo, which is easy to study (
Figure 10.18). Many Xenopus genes have been identiﬁed and cloned, especially those involved in development.
Developing Xenopus embryos can be easily observed and studied with a basic microscope, though the eggs are large
enough to see without a microscope. Because of their size, the exact developmental stage after fertilization can be
easily determined. This allows proteins that are used at a speciﬁc developmental time to be collected and analyzed.
Identiﬁcation of Xenopus genes and proteins has allowed the identiﬁcation of corresponding genes and proteins from
humans.
Many environmental scientists believe that amphibians, including frogs, indicate when an environment is damaged.
When species of frogs begin to decline, it often indicates that there is a bigger problem within the ecosystem. This
could have dramatic effects on food webs and ecosystems.

FIGURE 10.18
Frog embryos are often studied to better
understand how development works.

Amphibians in Popular Culture

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

Amphibians can be found in folklore, fairy tales, and popular culture. Numerous legends have developed over the
centuries around the mystical properties of the salamander. Its name originates from the Persian words for “ﬁre” and
“within," so many of these legends are related to ﬁre. This connection likely originates from the tendency of many
salamanders to live inside rotting logs. When placed into the ﬁre, salamanders would escape from the logs, lending
to the belief that the salamander was created from ﬂames.
Unforgettable amphibians Kermit the Frog ( Figure 10.19) and his popular saying “It’s not easy being green.”
Frogger, from the video game of the same name, has been teaching children about the dangers of the road and
alligator-ﬁlled moats for years. And all it takes is a kiss from a princess to turn a frog into a prince, as told in The
Frog Prince story.

What does this chameleon have in common with a snake?
Though they are both reptiles and seem very different, chameleons and snakes actually share several traits. For
example, they both have skin covered in scales and are cold-blooded animals. But notice the distinct eyes and
"horns" on the chameleon. Snakes don’t have these. And some chameleons have the ability to change color.

Characteristics of Reptiles

What reptiles can you name? Snakes, alligators, and crocodiles are all reptiles. Modern reptiles live on every
continent except Antarctica. They range in size from the newly-discovered Jaragua Sphaero (a dwarf gecko), at 0.6
inches, to the saltwater crocodile, at up to 23 feet.
There are four living orders of reptiles:

1. Squamata, which includes lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenids (or “worm-lizards”).
2. Crocodilia, which includes crocodiles, gharials ( Figure 10.20), caimans, and alligators.

FIGURE 10.20
A gharial crocodile (left). A tuatara (right).

Traits of Reptiles

Reptiles are tetrapods (four-legged) and ectothermic, meaning their internal temperature depends on the temperature
of their environment. This is why you may see reptiles sunbathing as they use the energy from the sun to warm their
bodies. Usually the sense organs of reptiles, like ears, are well developed, though snakes do not have external ears.
All reptiles have advanced eyesight. Reptiles also have a sense of smell. Crocodilians, turtles, and tortoises smell
like most other land vertebrates. But, some lizards, and all snakes, smell with their tongues, which is ﬂicked out of
the mouth to pick up scent molecules from the air.
Reptiles also have several adaptations for living on land. They have a skin covered in scales to protect them from
drying out. All reptiles have lungs to breathe air. Reptiles are also amniotes, which means their embryos are
surrounded by a thin membrane. This membrane protects the embryo from the harsh conditions of living on land.
Reptile eggs are also surrounded by a protective shell, which may be either ﬂexible or inﬂexible.

How Do Reptiles Reproduce?

Most reptiles reproduce sexually, meaning there are two parents involved. In some families of lizards and one snake
family, however, asexual reproduction is possible. This is when only one parent is involved in creating new life.
For example, the gecko females can make tiny clones of themselves without the aid of a male.
All reptiles have a cloaca, a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste, located at the base of the tail. Most
reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or hard shell. These eggs can be placed anywhere as they don’t have
to be in a moist environment, like the eggs of amphibians. However, not all species lay eggs, as certain species of
squamates can give birth to live young.
Unlike the amphibians, there are no larval stages of development. The young reptiles look like miniature versions of
the adult. The young reptiles are generally left to fend for themselves. However, some reptiles provide care for their
young. For example, crocodiles and alligators may defend their young from predators.

Summary

• Reptiles are also amniotes, which means their embryos are surrounded by a thin membrane.
• Reptiles typically reproduce sexually and lay eggs.

10.12 Lizards and Snakes

• Describe the major traits of lizards and snakes.
• Explain the signiﬁcance of quadrate bones.

Are snakes deadly?
Some snakes are poisonous, but the majority of snakes are fairly harmless if they are left alone. This rat snake is
actually beneﬁcial to humans because it eats mice and rats, keeping those populations in balance. Some related
species are so tame that they are often kept as pets.

Lizards and Snakes

Lizards and snakes belong to the largest order of reptiles, Squamata. Lizards are a large group of reptiles, with nearly
5,000 species, living on every continent except Antarctica. Some places are just too cold for lizards.

Characteristics of Lizards and Snakes

Lizards and snakes are distinguished by scales or shields and movable quadrate bones, which make it possible to
open the upper jaw very wide. Quadrate bones are especially visible in snakes, because they are able to open their
mouths very wide to eat large prey ( Figure 10.21). Without this ability, the snake diet would be very limited.

Characteristics of Lizards

Key features of lizards include:

• Four limbs.

• External ears.
• Movable eyelids.
• A short neck.
• A long tail, which they can shed in order to escape from predators.
• They eat insects.

Vision, including color vision, is well-developed in lizards. You may have seen a lizard camouﬂaged to blend in
with its surroundings. Since they have great vision, lizards communicate by changing the color of their bodies. They
also communicate with chemical signals called pheromones.
Adult lizards range from one inch in length, like some Caribbean geckos, to the nearly 10-foot-long Komodo dragon
( Figure 10.22).

capable of regenerating lost limbs or tails. Almost all lizards are carnivorous, meaning they eat animals, although
most are so small that insects are their primary prey. However, some have reached sizes where they can prey on birds
and mammals. On the other hand, a few species of lizards exclusively eat plants.

Lizard Behavior

www.ck12.org

Have you ever tried catching a lizard? Many lizards are good climbers or fast sprinters. Some can run on two feet,
such as the collared lizard. Some, like the basilisk, can even run across the surface of water to escape danger. Many
lizards can change color in response to their environments or in times of stress ( Figure 10.23). The most familiar
example is the chameleon, but more subtle color changes can occur in other lizard species.

FIGURE 10.23

lizard, showing general
body form and camouﬂage against back-
ground.

Legless Lizards

Some lizard species, including the glass lizard and ﬂap-footed lizards, have evolved to lose their legs, or their legs
are so small that they no longer work. This provides these species an evolutionary advantage in their way of life.
Legless lizards almost look like snakes, though structures leftover from earlier stages of evolution remain. For
example, ﬂap-footed lizards can be distinguished from snakes by their external ears.

Characteristics of Snakes

Snakes are different from legless lizards because they do not have eyelids, limbs, external ears, or forelimbs. The
more than 2,700 species of snake can be found on every continent except Antarctica and range in size from the tiny,
4-inch-long thread snake to pythons, to the over 17-foot-long anaconda ( Figure 10.24).
In order to ﬁt inside of snakes’ narrow bodies, paired organs, such as kidneys, appear one in front of the other instead
of side by side. Snakes’ eyelids are transparent “spectacle” scales which remain permanently closed. Most snakes
are not venomous, but some have venom capable of causing painful injury or death to humans. However, snake
venom is primarily used for killing prey rather than for self-defense. Snakes that are kept as pets can have their
venom removed without affecting the health of the snake.
Most snakes use specialized belly scales, which grip surfaces to move ( Figure 10.25). In the shedding of scales,
known as molting, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer ( Figure 10.26). Molting replaces old and
worn skin, allows the snake to grow, and helps it get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks.
Although different snake species reproduce in different ways, all snakes use internal fertilization, where fertiliza-
tion of the egg takes place inside the female. The male uses sex organs stored in its tail to transfer sperm to the
female. Most species of snakes lay eggs, and most species abandon these eggs shortly after laying them.

How do Snakes Eat?

All snakes are strictly carnivorous, eating small animals including lizards, other snakes, small mammals, birds, eggs,
ﬁsh, snails, or insects. Because snakes cannot bite or tear their food to pieces, prey must be swallowed whole.
Therefore, the body size of a snake has a major inﬂuence on its eating habits. A snake can usually estimate in
advance if a prey is too large.
The snake’s jaw is unique in the animal kingdom. Snakes have a very ﬂexible lower jaw, the two halves of which
are not rigidly attached. They also have many other joints in their skull, allowing them to open their mouths wide

enough to swallow their prey whole.
Some snakes have a venomous bite, which they use to kill their prey before eating it. Other snakes kill their prey by
strangling them, and still others swallow their prey whole and alive. After eating, snakes enter a resting stage, while
the process of digestion takes place. The process is highly efﬁcient, with the snake’s digestive enzymes dissolving
and absorbing everything but the prey’s hair and claws!

Summary

• Snakes and lizards are both in the order Squamata, distinguished by horny scales or shields and movable

quadrate bones, which make it possible to open the upper jaw very wide.

• Snakes are different from legless lizards because they do NOT have eyelids, limbs, external ears, or forelimbs.

10.13 Alligators and Crocodiles

• Describe the features of alligators and crocodiles.
• Describe crocodilian senses.
• Explain sex determination in crocodilians.

Crocodile or Alligator?
This picture is a crocodile, identiﬁed by it’s V-shaped snout. Alligators have more of a U-shaped snout. Although
crocodiles and alligators have a few differences, they are very much alike and belong to the same order, Crocodilia.

Alligators and Crocodiles

Crocodilia, containing both alligators and crocodiles, is an order of large reptiles. Reptiles belonging to Crocodilia
are the closest living relatives of birds. Reptiles and birds are the only known living descendants of the dinosaurs.
Some would day that alligators and crocodiles actually look like small dinosaurs. Dinosaurs that evolved wings are
the ancestors of birds.
The basic crocodilian body plan ( Figure 10.27) is a very successful one and has changed little over time. Modern
species actually look very similar to their Cretaceous ancestors of 84 million years ago. All species of crocodilians
have similar body structures, including an elongated snout, powerful jaws, muscular tail, large protective scales,
streamlined body, and eyes and nostrils that are positioned on top of the head.

Characteristics of Crocodiles

Crocodilians have a ﬂexible, semi-erect posture. They can walk either in a low, sprawled “belly walk,” or hold their
legs more directly underneath them to perform the “high walk.” Most other reptiles can only walk in a sprawled
position.

556

www.ck12.org

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

FIGURE 10.27
Nile crocodiles display the basic crocodil-
ian body plan.

All crocodilians have, like humans, teeth set in bony sockets. But unlike mammals, they replace their teeth through-
out life. Crocodiles and gharials (large crocodilians with longer jaws) have salivary glands on their tongue, which
are used to remove salt from their bodies. This helps with life in a saltwater environment. Crocodilians are often
seen lying with their mouths open, a behavior called gaping. One of its functions is probably to cool them down.
The crocodilian digestive system is highly adapted to their lifestyle. Crocodilians are known to swallow stones,
known as gastroliths, which help digest their prey. The crocodilian stomach is divided into two chambers. The ﬁrst
is powerful and muscular. The other stomach is the most acidic digestive system of any animal. It can digest mostly
everything from their prey, including bones, feathers, and horns!
All crocodilians are carnivores. They feed on live animals such as birds, small mammals and ﬁsh. Crocodilians
use several methods of attack when pursuing live prey. One approach is that of the ambush. The crocodilian lies
motionless beneath the water’s surface with only their nostrils above the water line. This keeps them concealed while
they watch for prey that approaches the water’s edge. The crocodilian then lunges out of the water, taking their prey
by surprise and dragging it from the shoreline into deep water where the prey is killed.
The sex of developing crocodilians is determined by the temperature of the eggs during incubation, when eggs are
kept warm before they hatch. This means that the sex of crocodilians is not determined genetically. If the eggs are
kept at a cold or a hot temperature, then their offspring may be all male or all female. To get both male and female
offspring, the temperature must be kept within a narrow range.
Female crocodilians care for the young after they hatch, providing them with protection until they grow large enough
to defend themselves. In many species of crocodilians, the female carries her tiny offspring in her mouth.

Evolving More Complex Structures

Like all reptiles, crocodilians have a relatively small brain, but the crocodilian brain is more advanced than those of
other reptiles. Because of their aquatic habitat, the eyes, ears, and nostrils are all located on the same "face" in a line
one after the other.

557

10.13. Alligators and Crocodiles

www.ck12.org

The crocodiles have advanced sensory organs. They see well during the day and may even have color vision, and
they also have excellent night vision. A third transparent eyelid, the nictitating membrane, protects their eyes
underwater. The eardrums are located behind the eyes and are covered by a movable ﬂap of skin. This ﬂap closes,
along with the nostrils and eyes, when they dive. This prevents water from entering their external head openings.
Their jaws are covered with sensory pits, which hold bundles of nerve ﬁbers that respond to the slightest disturbance
in surface water. Crocodiles can detect vibrations and small pressure changes in water. This makes it possible for
them to sense prey and danger even in total darkness, and becomes very useful when the animal is submerged in the
water.
Like mammals and birds, and unlike other reptiles, crocodiles have a four-chambered heart. But, unlike mammals,
blood with and without oxygen can be mixed.

Summary

• Crocodilians swallow stones, known as gastroliths, which help digest their prey.
• The sex of developing crocodilians is determined by the temperature of the eggs during incubation.
• The crocodiles have advanced sensory organs, including keen eyesight, eardrums, and sensory pits that detect

disturbances in the water.

• Describe the features of the turtles.
• Explain how turtles obtain nutrition.

What are these?
This picture might look like a bunch of ping-pong balls, but actually it’s a picture of turtle eggs. Notice the soft,
leathery shell that is typical of reptile eggs.

Turtles

Turtles are reptiles in the order Testudines. If you have seen turtles before, what is the most noticeable thing about
them? Their shells. Most turtle bodies are covered by a special shell developed from their ribs. Their shells can be
bony or cartilaginous, made from a more ﬂexible supportive tissue. About 300 species are alive today, and some
are highly endangered. Like other reptiles, turtles cannot regulate their body temperature, except with behavioral
means, such as burrowing underground. The major difference between turtles and tortoises is that the land dwelling
ones are called tortoises and water dwelling are called turtles.
Turtles are broken down into two groups, based on how they bring their neck back into their shell:

1. Cryptodira, which can draw their neck inside and under their spine.
2. Pleurodira, which fold their necks to one side.

Characteristics of Turtles

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

Although many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater, they can also spend much of their lives on dry
land and breathe air. Turtles cannot breathe in water, but can hold their breath for long periods of time. Turtles must
surface at regular intervals to reﬁll their lungs.
The position of a turtle’s eyes can give a clue to their natural habitat. Most turtles that spend most of their lives
on land have their eyes looking down at objects in front of them. Some aquatic turtles, such as snapping turtles
and soft-shelled turtles, have eyes closer to the top of the head. These species of turtles can hide from predators in
shallow water, where they lie entirely submerged in water except for their eyes and nostrils.
Sea turtles ( Figure 10.28) have glands near their eyes that produce salty tears, which remove excess salt taken in
from the water they drink.

FIGURE 10.28
A species of sea turtle, showing place-
ment of eyes, shell shape, and ﬂippers.

Turtles have exceptional night vision due to the unusually large number of cells that sense light in their eyes. This
allows them to be active at any time of the day. Turtles also have color vision.
Turtles don’t lay eggs underwater. Turtles lay slightly soft and leathery eggs, like other reptiles. The eggs of the
largest species are spherical, while the eggs of the rest are longer in shape. After internal fertilization, a female is
ready to lay her eggs, she places a large numbers of eggs in holes dug into mud or sand. They are then covered and
left to grow and develop by themselves. When the turtles hatch, they squirm their way to the surface and head toward
the water. They need to get to the water as fast as possible before they are fed upon by animals such as seabirds,
crabs, and raccoons.

How do Turtles Eat?

Turtles may appear slow and harmless when they are out of the water, but in the water is another story. Turtles can be
either herbivores or carnivores, with most sea turtles carnivorous. Turtles have a rigid beak and use their jaws to cut
and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous, or
animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. But as the turtle is not a very fast
animal, and it cannot quickly turn its head to snap at prey, it does have some limitations. Sea turtles typically feed
on jellyﬁsh, sponges and other soft-bodied organisms. Some species of sea turtle with stronger jaws eat shellﬁsh,
while other species, such as the green sea turtle, do not eat any meat at all. Herbivorous turtles have serrated ridges
that help them cut through tough plants.

How Big Are Turtles?

www.ck12.org

The largest turtle is the great leatherback sea turtle ( Figure 10.29), which can have a shell length of seven feet and
can weigh more than 2,000 pounds. The only surviving giant tortoises are on the Seychelles and Galápagos Islands
and can grow to over four feet in length and weigh about 670 pounds ( Figure 10.30). The smallest turtle is the
speckled padloper tortoise of South Africa, measuring no more than three inches in length, and weighing about ﬁve
ounces. The largest ever turtle was the know extinct Archelon genus, a Late Cretaceous sea turtle known to have
been up to 15 ft long, and 16 ft wide from ﬂipper to ﬂipper. The closest living relative of this genus is the leatherback
sea turtle.
It was the giant Galápagos tortoises that Charles Darwin studied during his voyage on the Beagle, providing
signiﬁcant evidence that he used to support his theory of evolution.

• Describe how reptiles are important to humans.
• Describe the use of reptiles as food.
• Summarize the use of reptiles as pets.
• Explain the place of reptiles in the arts and in culture.

What good are reptiles?
There is a lot of fear surrounding snakes and other reptiles. What you might not realize is that reptiles do a lot of
good. For example, snakes eat rats and other small animals. Rats can carry diseases to people, so keeping their
population under control is very important.

Importance of Reptiles

Reptiles play an important role in the life of humans. In addition to playing an important role in many food chains,
which keep the populations of small animals under control, reptiles serve as food, pets, and have played roles in art
and culture for thousands of years.

564

www.ck12.org

Reptiles as Food

Reptiles are important as food sources for people:

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

• Green iguanas, a type of large lizard, are eaten in Central America.
• The tribals of Irulas from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in India are known to eat some of the snakes they

catch.

• Cantonese snake soup is consumed by local people in the fall to prevent colds. The soup is believed to warm

up their body of those who eat it.

• Cooked rattlesnake meat is commonly consumed in parts of the Midwestern United States. You can eat
rattlesnake meat without worry of the poisonous venom. Other snake meat is consumed throughout the world.

• Turtle soup is consumed throughout the world.

Reptiles as Pets

Reptiles also make good pets. In the Western world, some snakes, especially less aggressive species, like the ball
python or corn snake, are kept as pets. Turtles, particularly small land-dwelling and freshwater turtles, are also
common pets. Among the most popular are Russian tortoises, Greek spur-thighed tortoises, and terrapins. Large
constrictor snakes like pythons, boa constrictors, and anacondas are powerful wild animals capable of killing an
adult human, and they are commonly kept as pets. Many people don’t think this is a wise idea, as these reptiles pose
dangerous threats to people, especially children.
Reptiles are capable of recognizing people by voice, sight and smell; many are capable of learning. Some species
actually beneﬁt from interaction with humans. When cared for properly, all live as long or longer than mammalian
pets of similar size. Having a reptile as a pet, you get to learn about everything from adaptation, behavior and
the environment, to nutrition, camouﬂage and reproductive strategies. Learning about the natural history and proper
captive care of these animals just might change your world outlook and get you thinking more about the environment
as a whole.
Keep in mind that if you want to have a snake as a pet, that there are no herbivorous snakes, and you must be willing
to feed it a proper diet. Be prepared to feed your snake, or other reptile, mice, rats, birds’ eggs, insects, or ﬁsh. And
these need to be served raw. Of course, the herbivorous reptiles, such as the green iguanas and some tortoises, are
much easier to feed. They eat foods such as chopped collard greens, romaine lettuce, chopped squash and bananas.

Reptiles in Art and Culture

Finally, reptiles play a signiﬁcant role in folklore, religion, and popular culture. The Moche people of ancient Peru
worshipped reptiles and often put lizards in their art. Snakes or serpents are connected to healing and to the Devil.
Since snakes shed and then heal again, they are a symbol of healing and medicine, as shown in the Rod of Asclepius
( Figure 10.31). In Egyptian history, the Nile cobra is found on the crown of the pharaoh. This snake was worshiped
as one of the gods.
Reptiles have also played roles in more recent popular culture. Unforgettable reptiles include Leonardo, Donatello,
Michaelangelo, and Raphael, otherwise known as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Godzilla, one of the most
famous movie reptiles who has been terrorizing Japanese cities for years. Dino, from The Flintstones is one of the
more lovable television reptiles. On the other hand is Nagini from the Harry Potter series. This tremendously long
snake (roughly 12 feet) is difﬁcult to forget as she was very important to Lord Voldemort. Though her appearances
are far and few between, her unwavering loyalty to the Dark Lord makes her one of the more infamous reptiles.

• Deﬁne endothermic.
• Describe the characteristics of birds.
• Summarize the adaptations in birds for ﬂight.
• Explain the role of the aerofoil.

Can all birds ﬂy?
No, not all birds can ﬂy. And not all birds have wings. This penguin is a good example. Their wings have evolved
into ﬂippers, adapted for swimming instead of ﬂying. The kiwi of New Zealand is another bird without wings.

10.16. Birds

Characteristics of Birds

www.ck12.org

How many different types of birds can you think of? Robins, ostriches, hummingbirds, chickens, and eagles. All
of these are birds, but they are very different from one another. There is an amazingly wide variety of birds.
Like amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and ﬁsh, birds are vertebrates. What does that mean? It means they have
a backbone. Almost all birds have forelimbs modiﬁed as wings, but not all birds can ﬂy. In some birds, the wings
have evolved into other structures.
Birds are in the class Aves. All birds have the following key features: they are endothermic (warm-blooded), have
two legs, and lay eggs.
Birds range in size from the tiny two-inch bee hummingbird to the nine-foot ostrich ( Figure 10.32). With approxi-
mately 10,000 living species, birds are the most numerous vertebrates with four limbs. They live in diverse habitats
around the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic.

FIGURE 10.32
The ostrich can reach a height of nine
feet! Pictured here is an ostrich with
her young in the Negev Desert, southern
Israel.

Features of Birds

The digestive system of birds is unique, with a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food. Birds do
not have teeth. What do you think the stones do? They help them digest their food. Deﬁning characteristics of
modern birds also include:

• Feathers.
• High metabolism.
• A four-chambered heart.
• A beak with no teeth.

568

www.ck12.org

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

• A lightweight but strong skeleton.
• Production of hard-shelled eggs.

Which of the above traits do you think might be of importance to ﬂight?

Adaptations for Flight

In comparing birds with other vertebrates, what do you think distinguishes them the most? In most birds, ﬂight is
the obvious difference. Birds have adapted their body plan for ﬂight:

• Their skeleton is especially lightweight, with large, air-ﬁlled spaces connecting to their respiratory system.
• Their neck bones are ﬂexible. Birds that ﬂy have a bony ridge along the breastbone that the ﬂight muscles

attach to ( Figure 10.33). This allows them to remain stable in the air as they ﬂy.

• Birds also have wings that function as an aerofoil. The surface of the aerofoil is curved to help the bird control

and use the air currents to ﬂy. Aerofoils are also found on the wings of airplanes.

FIGURE 10.33
A bony ridge along the breastbone (green) allows birds to remain stable
as they ﬂy.

What other traits do you think might be important for ﬂight? Feathers help because they’re more lightweight than
scales or fur. A bird’s wing shape and size will determine how a species ﬂies. For example, many birds have powered
ﬂight at certain times, requiring the ﬂapping of their wings, while at other times they soar, using up less energy (
Figure 10.34).

About 60 living bird species are ﬂightless, such as penguins, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often evolves
when birds live on isolated islands. The absence of land predators might make ﬂying no longer necessary. Other
birds evolved into new niches where ﬂying was no longer necessary. This may have been in response to limited
resources. For example, the ﬂightless cormorant can no longer ﬂy, but its wings are now adapted to swim in the sea
( Figure 10.35).

FIGURE 10.35
A ﬂightless cormorant can no longer ﬂy,
but it uses its wings for swimming.

Summary

• Birds are endothermic (warm-blooded), have beaks, and lay eggs.
• Adaptations for ﬂight include a lightweight skeleton and ﬂexible neck bones.

• Summarize how bird parents care for their offspring.

• Deﬁne brood parasitism.

Why do peacocks have huge, bright feathers?
Male peacocks use their colorful feathers to attract females. Females tend to mate with the males with the largest,
brightest feathers. A large, bright tail indicates the male is healthy and likely to produce healthy offspring. You’ve
probably also heard birds "sing." Eagles do aerial acrobatics and tumbling. These are other ways to attract mates.

Reproduction in Birds

How do birds reproduce? We know that chickens lay eggs. But how do they do that?
It all starts with behavior aimed at attracting a mate. In birds, this will involve a type of display, usually performed
by the male. Some displays are very elaborate and may include dancing, aerial ﬂights, or wing or tail drumming.
Most male birds also sing a type of song to attract females. If they are successful at attracting a female, it will lead
to breeding.
Birds reproduce by internal fertilization, during which the egg is fertilized inside the female. Like reptiles, birds
have cloaca, or a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste. The male brings his sperm to the female
cloaca. The sperm fertilizes the egg. Then the hard-shelled egg develops within the female. The hard-shelled eggs
have a ﬂuid-ﬁlled amnion, a thin membrane forming a closed sac around the embryo. Eggs are usually laid in a nest.

572

Protecting Offspring

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

Why do you think eggs come in so many different colors? Birds that make nests in the open have camouﬂaged eggs
( Figure 10.36). This gives the eggs protection against predation. Some species, like ground-nesting nightjars, have
pale eggs, but the birds camouﬂage the eggs with their feathers.
To protect their young, different species of birds make different nests. Birds of all types, from hummingbirds to
ostriches, make nests. Many can be elaborate, shaped like cups, domes, plates, mounds, or burrows. However, some
birds, like the common guillemot, do not use nests. Instead, they lay their eggs on bare cliffs. Emperor penguins do
not have a nest at all; they sit on eggs to keep them warm before they hatch, a process called incubation.
How else might a bird help protect its young from predators? Most species locate their nests in areas that are hidden,
in order to avoid predators. Large birds, or those that nest in groups, may build nests in the open, since they are more
capable of defending their young.

FIGURE 10.36
Nest and eggs of the common moorhen,
showing camouﬂaged eggs.

Parental Care

In birds, 90% to 95% of species are monogamous, meaning the male and female remain together for breeding for a
few years or until one mate dies. Birds of all types, from parrots to eagles and falcons, are monogamous. Usually,
the parents take turns incubating the eggs. Birds usually incubate their eggs after the last one has been laid. In
polygamous species, where there is more than one mate, one parent does all of the incubating. The wild turkey is
an example of a polygamous bird.
The length and type of parental care varies widely amongst different species of birds. At one extreme, in a group of
birds called the magapodes (which are chicken-like birds), parental care ends at hatching. In this case, the newly-
hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental help and can take care of itself right away. These
birds are called precocial. Other precocial birds include the domestic chicken and many species of ducks and geese.
At the other extreme, many seabirds care for their young for extended periods of time. For example, the chicks of
the Great Frigatebird receive intensive parental care for six months, or until they are ready to ﬂy, and then take an
additional 14 months of being fed by the parents ( Figure 10.37). These birds are the opposite of precocial birds and
are called altricial.
In most animals, male parental care is rare. But it is very common in birds. Often both parents share tasks such as

573

10.17. Bird Reproduction

www.ck12.org

defense of territory and nest site, incubation, and the feeding of chicks. Since birds often take great care of their
young, some birds have evolved a behavior called brood parasitism. This happens when a bird leaves her eggs in
another bird’s nest. The host bird often accepts and raises the parasite bird’s eggs.

FIGURE 10.37
Great Frigatebird adults are known to care
for their young for up to 20 months after
hatching, the longest in a bird species.
Here, a young bird is begging for food.

Summary

• Birds often use ﬂashy displays to attract mates.
• Breeding in birds is through internal fertilization, where the egg is fertilized inside the female.
• Birds generally are monogamous, and both parents help to care for the young.

• Describe differences in bird beaks and feet.

How are birds different?
Not all birds look the same. They are obviously different in many ways. They come in all colors and sizes. They
live in a variety of habitats. They eat a variety of foods.

Diversity of Birds

Turkey, hummingbird, penguin, parrot, owl and eagle. These are just some of the many different types of birds.
If you just think about the birds in this list, the differences are striking. About 10,000 bird species belong to 29
different orders within the class Aves. They live and breed on all seven continents. The tropics are home to the
greatest biodiversity of birds. The diversity among birds is striking. Birds can vary greatly in size and color. Some

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

ﬂy, some swim, some just walk or run. Some are savage carnivores, others are gentle herbivores. Some are low on
the food chain, others are at the top.
Birds live in a variety of different habitats. Birds that live in different habitats will encounter different foods
and different predators. Birds can be carnivores (feeding on other animals), herbivores (feeding on plants), or
generalists (feeding on a variety of foods). The lifestyle of the bird can affect what it looks like. For example, can
you think of some examples of beaks that are adapted to the type of food a bird eats? Carnivorous birds include
hawks, falcons, eagles, osprey, vultures and owls. Herbivorous birds include the goose, cockatoo and parrot. The
American Crow is an example of a generalist. In addition, a specialist is a bird (or other animal) that is specially
adapted to eat a certain food. An example of a specialist is a hummingbird, whose long, thin beak is excellent for
reaching into ﬂowers for nectar, but not very good for eating other foods.
Waterfowl are birds that live on the water. These include ducks, geese, swans, and pelicans, to name a few. Landfowl
are ground-feeding birds such as chickens and turkeys. Penguins are a group of ﬂightless birds adapted for life in
the water with ﬂippers. Diurnal raptors are birds of prey that hunt during the day. These include falcons, eagles and
hawks. Nocturnal raptors hunt during the night. These include various types of owls. Parrots are brightly colored
and very intelligent. They are found in the tropics and include cockatoos, parrots, and parakeets.

Beaks

The size and shape of the beak is related to the food the bird eats and can vary greatly among different birds.
Parrots have down-curved, hooked bills, which are well-adapted for cracking seeds and nuts ( Figure 10.38).
Hummingbirds, on the other hand, have long, thin, pointed bills, which are adapted for getting the nectar out of
ﬂowers ( Figure 10.38). Hawks, eagles, falcons and owls have a sharp, hooked beak.

FIGURE 10.38
(left) The down-curved, hooked bill of a
scarlet macaw, a large colorful parrot.
(right) A long, thin and pointed bill of the
hummingbird.

Feet

Bird feet can also vary greatly among different birds. Some birds, such as gulls and terns and other waterfowl, have
webbed feet used for swimming or ﬂoating ( Figure 10.39). Other birds, such as herons, gallinules, and rails, have
four long spreading toes, which are adapted for walking delicately in the wetlands ( Figure 10.39). You can predict
how the beaks and feet of birds will look depending on where they live and what type of food they eat. Flightless
birds also have long legs that are adapted for running. Flightless birds include the ostrich and kiwi.
Raptors have clawed feet. They also have strong legs. Hawks, eagles and falcons also have excellent vision and they
hunt by sight. Owls, with excellent hearing, can hunt by that sense alone.

10.19 Importance of Birds

• Describe how birds are important to people.
• Summarize the roles of birds within an ecosystem.
• Explain the role of birds as pollinators.

Do you eat birds?
If you’ve eaten a turkey or a chicken nugget, then you’ve eaten a bird! Providing a food source is just one way that
birds are important to humans. In the United States, more than 230 million turkeys are consumed each year, with
almost 50 million of those turkeys being eaten at Thanksgiving.

Importance of Birds

You are probably familiar with birds as food. People have always hunted birds for food. People eventually discovered
that certain wild fowl (ducks, chickens, turkeys) could be tamed. This discovery led to the development of poultry,
which is domesticated fowl that farmers raise for meat and eggs. Chickens are probably the oldest kinds of poultry.
Chickens were domesticated in Asia at least 3,000 years ago. Since then, farmers have developed other poultry,
including ducks, geese, guineafowl, pheasants, and turkeys. Around the world, people consume all these birds,
and even more exotic birds, like ostriches. Today, chickens rank as the most widely raised poultry by far. Farmers
throughout the world produce hundreds of millions of chickens annually for meat and eggs. Ducks and turkeys rank
second and third in production worldwide. Ducks are raised for both meat and eggs. Turkeys are raised mainly for
meat.
Can you think of other ways that birds are important?

580

www.ck12.org

Birds and Humans

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

1. In agriculture, humans harvest bird droppings for use as fertilizer. These droppings have a high content of

nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium, three nutrients essential for plant growth.

2. Chickens are also used as an early warning system of human diseases, such as West Nile virus. Mosquitoes
carry the West Nile virus, bite young chickens and other birds, and infect them with the virus. When chickens
or other birds become infected, humans may also become infected in the near future.

3. Birds have important cultural relationships with humans. Birds are common pets in the Western world.
Common bird pets include canaries, parrots, ﬁnches, and parakeets. Sometimes, people act cooperatively
with birds. For example, the Borana people in Africa use birds to guide them to honey that they use in food.
4. Birds also play prominent and diverse roles in folklore, religion, and popular culture. They have been featured
in art since prehistoric times, when they appeared in early cave paintings. Many young child know of Big
Bird, a very large canary of Sesame Street fame.

5. Feathers are also used all over the world to stuff pillows, mattresses, sleeping bags, coats, and quilting. Goose
feathers are preferred because they are soft. Manufacturers often mix goose feathers with down feathers to
provide extra softness.

Birds and the Ecosystem

Birds are obviously important members of many ecosystems. They are integral parts of food chains and food webs.
In a woodland ecosystem for example, some birds get their food mainly from plants. Others chieﬂy eat small
animals, such as insects or earthworms. Birds and bird eggs, in turn, serve as food for such animals as foxes,
raccoons, and snakes. The feeding relationships among all the animals in an ecosystem help prevent any one species
from becoming too numerous. Birds play a vital role in keeping this balance of nature. In addition to being important
parts of food webs, birds play other roles within ecosystems.

1. Birds eat insects. They are a natural way to control pests in gardens, on farms, and other places. A group of
birds gliding through the air can easily eat hundreds of insects each day. Insect eating birds include warblers,
bluebirds and woodpeckers.

2. Nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, meaning they move the pollen from ﬂower to ﬂower to help
fertilize the sex cells and create new plants. Hummingbirds, sunbirds, and the honey-eaters are common
pollinators.

3. Many fruit-eating birds help disperse seeds. After eating fruit, they carry the seeds in their intestines and

deposit them in new places. Fruit-eating birds include mockingbirds, orioles, ﬁnches and robins.

4. Birds are often important to island ecology. In New Zealand, the kereru and kokako are important browsers,
or animals that eat or nibble on leaves, tender young shoots, or other vegetation ( Figure 10.40). Seabirds add
nutrients to soil and to water with their production of guano, their dung.

10.20 Mammal Characteristics

• Describe the characteristics of mammals.
• List the three general categories of mammals.
• Deﬁne viviparous.

What do you have in common with a bat?
Both humans and bats have body hair, and both humans and bats can nurse their young. These are both characteristics
of mammals, the class that both bats and humans belong to.

Characteristics of Mammals

What is a mammal? These animals range from bats, cats, and rats to dogs, monkeys, elephants, and whales. They
walk, run, swim, and ﬂy. They live in the ocean, ﬂy in the sky, walk on the prairies, and run in the savanna. There
is a tremendous amount of diversity within the group in terms of reproduction, habitat, and adaptation for living in
those different habitats.
What allows them to live in such diverse environments? They have evolved specialized traits, unlike those of any
other group of animal. Mammals (class Mammalia) are endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrate animals with a
number of unique characteristics. In most mammals, these include:

• The presence of hair or fur.
• Sweat glands.
• Glands specialized to produce milk, known as mammary glands.
• Three middle ear bones.
• A neocortex region in the brain, which specializes in seeing and hearing.
• Specialized teeth.

583

10.20. Mammal Characteristics

• A four-chambered heart.

www.ck12.org

There are approximately 5,400 mammalian species, ranging in size from the tiny 1-2 inch bumblebee bat to the
108-foot blue whale. These are distributed in 29 orders, 153 families, and about 1,200 genera.
There are three types of mammals, characterized by their method of reproduction. All mammals, except for a few,
are viviparous, meaning they produce live young instead of laying eggs. The monotremes, however, have birdlike
and reptilian characteristics, such as laying eggs and a cloaca. An example of a monotreme is the platypus with
its birdlike beak and egg-laying characteristics. The echidnas are the only other monotreme mammals. A second
type of mammal, the marsupial mammal, includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and possums. These mammals
give birth to underdeveloped embryos, which then climb from the birth canal into a pouch on the front of the
mother’s body, where it feeds and continues to grow. The remainder of mammals, which is the majority of mammals,
are placental mammals. These mammals develop in the mother’s uterus, receiving nutrients across the placenta.
Placental mammals include humans, rabbits, squirrels, whales, elephants, shrews, and armadillos. Dogs and cats,
and sheep, cattle and horses are also placental mammals.
Mammals are also the only animal group that evolved to live on land and then back to live in the ocean. Whales,
dolphins, and porpoises have all adapted from land-dwelling creatures to a life of swimming and reproducing in the
water ( Figure 10.41). Whales have evolved into the largest mammals.

10.21 Mammal Reproduction

• List and describe the three general ways mammals reproduce.
• Summarize the unique characteristics of embryonic development in marsupials.
• Describe the role of the placenta.

Do mammals lay eggs?
Could a rabbit really lay eggs? Rabbits are mammals, and most mammals do not lay eggs. Mammals usually give
birth to live offspring. But there are some mammals that do lay eggs.

Mammal Reproduction

You probably realize that cats, dogs, people, and other mammals don’t typically lay eggs. There are exceptions,
however. Egg-laying is possible among the monotremes, mammals with birdlike and reptilian characteristics. Recall
that mammals can be classiﬁed into three general groups, based on their reproductive strategy: the monotremes, the
marsupials and the placental mammals.
The egg-laying monotremes, such as echidnas ( Figure 10.42) and platypuses ( Figure 10.42), use one opening, the
cloaca, to urinate, release waste, and reproduce, just like birds. They lay leathery eggs, similar to those of lizards,
turtles, and crocodilians. Monotremes feed their young by “sweating” milk from patches on their bellies, as they
lack the nipples present on other mammals.
All other mammals give birth to live young and belong to one of two different categories, the marsupials and the
placental mammals. A marsupial is an animal in which the embryo, which is often called a joey, is born at an
immature stage. Development must be completed outside the mother’s body. Most female marsupials have an
abdominal pouch or skin fold where there are mammary glands. The pouch is a place for completing the development
of the baby. Although blind, without fur, and with only partially formed hind legs, the tiny newborns have well
developed forelimbs with claws that enable them to climb their way into their mother’s pouch where they drink
their mother’s milk and continue their development. Marsupials include kangaroos, koalas, and opossums. Other

marsupials are the wallaby and the Tasmanian Devil. Most marsupials live in Australia and nearby areas. ( Figure
10.43).
The majority of mammals are placental mammals. These are mammals in which the developing baby is fed through
the mother’s placenta. Female placental mammals develop a placenta after fertilization. A placenta is a spongy
structure that passes oxygen, nutrients, and other useful substances from the mother to the fetus. It also passes
carbon dioxide and other wastes from the fetus to the mother. The placenta allows the fetus to grow for a long time
within the mother.

Some mammals are alone until a female can become pregnant. Others form social groups with big differences
between sexes, such as size differences, a trait called sexual dimorphism. Dominant males are those that are the
largest or best-armed. These males usually have an advantage in mating. They may also keep other males from
mating with females within a group. This is seen in elephant seals ( Figure 10.44), and also with elk, lions and
non-human primates, including the orangutans and gorillas. Male elk grow antlers, while female elk do not have
antlers. Adult male lions are not only larger than females, they have a mane of long hair on the side of the face and
top of the head.

Summary

• Monotremes can lay eggs, but most mammals give birth to live young.
• Mammals can be marsupial, where the embryo is born at an immature stage and develops in the pouch.

• List the unique traits of the rodents, bats, and ungulates.
• Give examples of the carnivores and insectivores.
• List the deﬁning features of the primates.

To what group do rats belong?
Rats are mammals, but this class can be divided into more speciﬁc groups. Rats are in a group known as rodents.
Rodents are gnawing animals that include beavers, mice, and squirrels.

Groups of Mammals

Traditionally, mammals were divided into groups based on their characteristics. Scientists took into consideration
their anatomy (body structure), their habitats, and their feeding habits. Mammals are divided into three subclasses
and about 26 orders. Some of the groups of mammals include:

1. Lagomorphs include hares and rabbits. Rabbits and hares characteristically have long ears, a short tail, and
strong hind limbs that provide for a bouncing method of locomotion. They are all are small to medium-sized
terrestrial herbivores.

2. Rodents include rats, mice, and other small gnawing mammals. They have a single pair of continuously

growing incisors (teeth) in each of the upper and lower jaws that must be kept short by gnawing.
3. Carnivores include cats and lions and tigers, dogs and wolves, polar bears, and other meat eaters.
4. Insectivores include moles and shrews ( Figure 10.45). These mammals eat primarily insects, other arthro-

pods, and earthworms.

FIGURE 10.45
One of the subgroups of mammals is the
insectivores, including this shrew.

5. Bats include the vampire bat. These mammals have forelimbs that form webbed wings, making bats the only

mammals naturally capable of true and sustained ﬂight.

6. Primates include monkeys, apes and humans. These mammals are characterized by detailed development of

the hands and feet, a shortened snout, and a large brain.

7. Ungulates include hoofed animals, such as deer, sheep, goats, pigs, buffalo, elephants and giraffes ( Figure
10.46). These mammals use their hoofs to sustain their whole body weight while moving. Hoofs are formed
by a thick nail rolled around the tip of the toe.

Mammals can also be grouped according to the adaptations they form to live in a certain habitat. For example,
terrestrial mammals with leaping kinds of movement, as in some marsupials and lagomorphs, typically live in open
habitats. Other terrestrial mammals are adapted for running, such as dogs or horses. Still others, such as elephants,
hippopotamuses, and rhinoceroses, move slowly. Other mammals are adapted for living in trees, such as many
monkeys ( Figure 10.47). Others live in water, such as manatees, whales, dolphins, and seals. Still others are
adapted for ﬂight, like bats.

for life among the trees.

Summary

• Traditionally, mammals were divided into groups based on their anatomy (body structure), their habitats, and

their feeding habits.

• Subgroups of the mammals include rodents, carnivores, insectivores, bats, and primates.

10.23 Importance of Mammals

• Describe how mammals are important to humans.
• Summarize the roles of mammals in ecosystems.
• Give examples of the roles of mammals in the arts and culture.

How are mammals helpful?
An example of a helpful mammal is a service dog. Like many dogs, service dogs can pick up or retrieve objects for
their owners. They can also perform many other tasks for a disabled person, depending on the type of disability.

Importance of Mammals

Mammals play many important roles in ecosystems, and they also beneﬁt people.

Importance to Ecosystems

Mammals have important roles in the food webs of practically every ecosystem. Mammals are important members
of food chains and food webs, as grazers and predators. Mammals can feed at various levels of food chains, as

595

10.23. Importance of Mammals

www.ck12.org

herbivores, insectivores, carnivores and omnivores.
Mammals also interact with other species in many symbiotic relationships. For example, bats have established
mutually beneﬁcial relationships with plants. Nectar-feeding bats receive a tasty treat from each ﬂower, and, in
return, they pollinate the ﬂowers. That means they transfer pollen from one ﬂower to another, allowing the plant
to reproduce. Non-ﬂying mammalian pollinators include marsupials, primates, and rodents. In most cases, these
animals visit ﬂowers to eat their nectar, and end up with pollen stuck to their bodies. When the animal visits another
ﬂower to eat the nectar, the pollen is transferred to that ﬂower.
Fruit-eating bats ( Figure 10.48) also receive food from plants. In return, they help these plants spread their seeds.
When bats consume fruit, they also consume the seeds within the fruit. Then they carry the seeds in their guts to
far-away locations.
Zebras have been known to befriend ostriches. In this symbiotic relationship, both species beneﬁt. The ostrich, with
its terrible senses of smell and hearing and the zebra with its poor eyesight, are both able to warn the other when
danger is near. The zebra can smell or hear certain dangers approaching, while the ostrich can see other dangers.
Both are prepared to warn one another at a moment’s notice so they can each ﬂee when necessary.
Baboons and impala have a similar relationship. Impala are one of the most common prey species for all predators
and need to be constantly alert. Impala have good hearing and eyesight, raising an alarm when danger is near.
Baboons use trees to check for danger and bark an alarm when danger is sensed. What do the baboons receive?
Male baboons sometimes prey on young impala soon after birth. So, though both alert others to dangers, sometimes
this is not the best of relationships for young impala.
Zebra and wildebeest are found together on the African savanna grazing different parts of the same grass. The zebra
grazes the tougher parts of the plant, saving the softer parts for the wildebeest. A zebra will move into an area of tall
grass before other herbivores and graze the grass down to the area that the wildebeest prefers.

FIGURE 10.48
Bats, like this Egyptian fruit bat, play an
important role in seed dispersal.

Importance to Humans

We see examples of mammals (other than people!) serving our needs everywhere. We have pets that are mammals,
such as dogs and cats. Mammals are also used around the world for transport. For example, horses, donkeys, mules,
or camels ( Figure 10.49) may be the primary means of transport in some parts of the world. Mammals also do

596

www.ck12.org

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

work for us. Service dogs can be trained to help the disabled. These include guide dogs, which are assistance dogs
trained to lead blind and visually impaired people around obstacles. Horses and elephants can carry heavy loads.
Humans also use some mammals for food. For example, cows and goats are commonly raised for their milk and
meat. Mammals’ more highly developed brains have made them ideal for use by scientists in studying such things
as learning, as seen in maze studies of mice and rats.

FIGURE 10.49
This camel provides transportation in
Egypt.

Cultural Importance

Mammals have also played a signiﬁcant role in different cultures’ folklore and religion. For example, the grace and
power of the cougar have been admired in the cultures of the native peoples of the Americas. The Inca city of Cuzco
is designed in the shape of a cougar, and the thunder god of the Inca, Viracocha, has been associated with the animal.
In North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of several American Indian
tribes.
Important mammals include Dolly the sheep, Lassie the dog, and ﬂipper the dolphin. Dolly was the ﬁrst mammal
to be cloned from an adult somatic (body) cell, using the process of nuclear transfer. Lassie was a collie dog
who appeared in seven full length feature ﬁlms in the 1940s and 1950s, starting with Lassie Come Home in 1943.
Additional Lassie movies were made as recently as 2005. Between 1954 and 1973, the Lassie television series
aired, with plenty of additional productions as recently as 2007. Flipper was a bottle nose dolphin that starred in
a television series between 1964 and 1967. The most famous mammal may be King Kong, the giant gorilla that
terrorized New York City in 1933 in the movie of the same name.

Summary

• Ecologically, nectar-feeding and fruit-eating bats play an important role in plant pollination and seed dispersal,

respectively.

• Mammals meet people’s needs by serving as pets, transport, food, or research subjects.

• Explain where non-human primates live.

How are the monkey and the girl alike?
Both are intelligent and can learn new things quickly. They both like to play. And they are both primates.

What Are Primates?

If primates are mammals, what makes them seem so different from most mammals? Primates, including humans,
have several unique features. Some adaptations give primates advantages that allow them to live in certain habitats,
such as in trees. Other features have allowed them to adapt to complex social and cultural situations.
Primates are mostly omnivorous, meaning many primate species eat both plant and animal material. The order
contains all of the species commonly related to lemurs, monkeys, and apes. The order also includes humans (
Figure 10.50).
Key features of primates include:

• Five ﬁngers, known as pentadactyl.
• Several types of teeth.
• Certain eye orbit characteristics, such as a postorbital bar, or a bone that runs around the eye socket.
• An opposable thumb, a ﬁnger that allows a grip that can hold objects.

humans lived in Europe and western and
central Asia from about 100,000 –40,000
BCE.

What’s the difference between monkeys and apes? The easiest way to distinguish monkeys from the other primates
is to look for a tail. Most monkey species have tails, but no apes or humans do. Monkeys are much more like other
mammals than apes and humans are.

Big Brains

In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger compared to the rest of the brain. A larger cerebrum
allows primates to develop higher levels of intelligence. Primates have the ability to learn new behaviors. They also
engage in complex social interactions, such as ﬁghting and play.

Social Relationships

Old World species, such as apes and some monkeys ( Figure 10.50 and Figure 10.51), tend to have signiﬁcant size
differences between the sexes. This is known as sexual dimorphism. Males tend to be slightly more than twice
as heavy as females. This dimorphism may have evolved when one male had to defend many females. Old World
generally refers to monkeys of Africa and Asia. New World refers to monkeys of the Americas.
New World species, including tamarins (squirrel-sized monkeys) and marmosets (very small primitive monkeys) (
Figure 10.51), form pair bonds, which is a partnership between a mating pair that lasts at least one season. The pair
cooperatively raise the young and generally do not show a signiﬁcant size difference between the sexes. Old World
monkeys do not tend to form monogamous relationships.

Where Do Non-human Primates Live?

Non-human primates live mostly in Central and South America, Africa, and South Asia. Since primates evolved
from animals living in trees, many modern species still live mostly in trees. Other species live on land most of the
time, such as baboons ( Figure 10.52) and the Patas monkey. Only a few species live on land all of the time, such as
the gelada and humans.

FIGURE 10.52
Baboons are partially terrestrial. Pictured
here is a mother baboon and her young.

Primates live in a diverse number of forested habitats, including rain forests, mangrove forests and mountain forests
to altitudes of over 9,800 feet. The combination of opposable thumbs, short ﬁngernails, and long, inward-closing
ﬁngers has allowed some species to develop the ability to move by swinging their arms from one branch to another (
Figure 10.53). Another feature for climbing are expanded ﬁnger-like parts, such as those in tarsiers, which improve
grasping ( Figure 10.53).
A few species, such as the proboscis monkey, De Brazza’s monkey, and Allen’s swamp monkey, evolved webbed
ﬁngers so they can swim and live in swamps and aquatic habitats. Some species, such as the rhesus macaque and the
Hanuman langur, can even live in cities by eating human garbage.

• Describe the characteristics of the great apes.
• Summarize the genetic and behavioral similarities among the great apes.
• List specialized human features.

What animals are humans’ closest cousins?
Looking at our evolutionary tree, our closest relatives include the orangutans pictured here. Notice the way this
mother cradles her child; they look very human-like. Orangutans are also highly intelligent. Notice the detail in the
hand. In the wild, they can create and use tools.

Humans and Primates

The great apes are the members of the biological family Hominidae, which includes four living genera: chimpanzees,
gorillas, orangutans and humans. Among these four genera are just seven species, two of each except humans, which
has only one species, Homo sapiens.

604

www.ck12.org

Characteristics

Chapter 10. Vertebrates

The Great Apes are large, tailless primates, ranging in size from the pygmy chimpanzee, at 66-88 pounds in weight,
to the gorilla, at 300-400 pounds ( Figure 10.54). In all species, the males are, on average, larger and stronger than
the females.

FIGURE 10.54
A Western Lowland gorilla, member of the
great apes. The gorilla is the largest of the
hominids, weighing up to 309-397 lbs.

Most living primate species are four-footed, but all are able to use their hands for gathering food or nesting materials.
In some cases, hands are used as tools, such as when gorillas use sticks to measure the depth of water ( Figure 10.55).
Chimpanzees sharpen sticks to use as spears in hunting; they also use sticks to gather food and to “ﬁsh” for termites.

FIGURE 10.55
Tool using in a primate. A gorilla uses a
stick to determine the water’s depth.

Most primate species eat both plants and meat ( omnivorous), but fruit is the preferred food among all but humans.
In contrast, humans eat a large amount of highly processed, low ﬁber foods, and unusual proportions of grains and

605

10.25. Humans and Primates

www.ck12.org

vertebrate meat. As a result of our diets, human teeth and jaws are markedly smaller for our size than those of other
apes. Humans may have been eating cooked food for a million years or more, so perhaps our teeth adapted to eating
cooked food.
Gestation (pregnancy) lasts 8-9 months and usually results in the birth of a single offspring. The young are born
helpless, and thus, they need parental care for long periods of time. Compared with most other mammals, great apes
have a long adolescence and are not fully mature until 8-13 years of age (longer in humans). Females usually give
birth only once every few years.
Gorillas and chimpanzees live in family groups of approximately ﬁve to ten individuals, although larger groups are
sometimes observed. The groups include at least one dominant male, and females leave the group when they can
mate. Orangutans, however, generally live alone.

Genetic and Behavioral Similarities

Gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans have more than 97% of their DNA sequence in common. This means that a
similar percent of the amino acid sequences of the proteins will be the same, resulting in many proteins with similar
or identical functions.
All organisms in the Hominidae communicate with some kind of language. They can also create simple cultures
beyond the family or group of animals. Having a culture means that knowledge and behaviors can be passed on from
generation to generation.

Specialized Human Features

Specialized features of Homo sapiens include the following:

• small front teeth (canines and incisors) and very large molars relative to other primate species,
• a fully upright posture resulting in bipedalism (walking on two limbs instead of four),
• shortening of the arms relative to the legs,
• increased usefulness (dexterity) of the hands,
• increase in brain size, especially in the frontal lobes
• and a decrease in bone mass of the skull and face.

Summary

Vertebrates. From ﬁsh to mammals. Obviously, there is a tremendous amount of differences among these groups of
species. But there also exist many similarities. Fish had to evolve ﬁrst. Then they moved onto land as amphibians,
but they still had to live close to the water. Then they moved farther away from the water as reptiles. Reptiles could
live anywhere, and they did. Reptiles became very large and dominated life on the planet. Some reptiles evolved
ﬂight and turned into birds. Others stayed small and became mammals. When all the large reptiles were extinct,
what remained? Smaller animals, including mammals, which then became the dominant form of life.

Human Biology provides an overview of the physiology of humans, from the skin inward. In addition to the skin,
the skeletal, muscular, nervous, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, excretory, immune, and reproductive systems are
described.

• List the levels of organization in the human body.
• Deﬁne cell, tissue, organ, and organ system.
• Identify the four types of tissues that make up the body.
• Give examples of organ systems and their functions.

Do cells work together?
Cells, like these nerve cells, do not work in isolation. To send orders from your brain to your legs, for example,
signals pass through many nerve cells. These cells work together to perform a similar function. Just as muscle cells
work together, bone cells and many other cells do as well. A group of similar cells that work together is known as a
tissue.

Chapter 11. Human Biology

Organization of Your Body: Cells, Tissues, Organs

Cells are grouped together to carry out speciﬁc functions. A group of cells that work together form a tissue. Your
body has four main types of tissues, as do the bodies of other animals. These tissues make up all structures and
contents of your body. An example of each tissue type is pictured in the Figure 11.1.

FIGURE 11.1
Your body has four main types of tissue: nervous tissue, epithelial tissue, connective tissue, and muscle tissue.
They are found throughout your body.

1. Epithelial tissue is made up of layers of tightly packed cells that line the surfaces of the body. Examples of

epithelial tissue include the skin, the lining of the mouth and nose, and the lining of the digestive system.

2. Connective tissue is made up of many different types of cells that are all involved in supporting and binding
other tissues of the body. Examples include tendon, cartilage, and bone. Blood is also classiﬁed as a
specialized connective tissue.

3. Muscle tissue is made up of bands of cells that contract and allow movement.
4. Nervous tissue is made up of nerve cells that sense stimuli and transmit signals. Nervous tissue is found in

nerves, the spinal cord, and the brain.

615

11.1. Organization of the Human Body

Groups of Tissues Form Organs

www.ck12.org

A single tissue alone cannot do all the jobs that are needed to keep you alive and healthy. Two or more tissues
working together can do a lot more. An organ is a structure made of two or more tissues that work together. The
heart ( Figure 11.2) is made up of the four types of tissues.

FIGURE 11.2
The four different tissue types work to-
gether in the heart as they do in the other
organs.

Groups of Organs Form Organ Systems

Your heart pumps blood around your body. But how does your heart get blood to and from every cell in your body?
Your heart is connected to blood vessels such as veins and arteries. Organs that work together form an organ system.
Together, your heart, blood, and blood vessels form your cardiovascular system.
What other organ systems can you think of?

Organ Systems Work Together

Your body’s 12 organ systems are shown below ( Table 11.1). Your organ systems do not work alone in your body.
They must all be able to work together.
For example, one of the most important functions of organ systems is to provide cells with oxygen and nutrients and
to remove toxic waste products such as carbon dioxide. A number of organ systems, including the cardiovascular
and respiratory systems, all work together to do this.

11.2 Homeostasis

• Deﬁne homeostasis.
• Describe homeostasis and how it is maintained.
• Distinguish negative feedback from positive feedback.

How does your body react to cold?
These people may be having fun in the icy water, but their bodies are struggling to react to the cold. For example,
they may begin to shiver. Shivering helps the body return to a stable temperature. The body is always working to
achieve stability, or homeostasis.

Homeostasis and Feedback Regulation

When you walk outside on a cool day, does your body temperature drop? No, your body temperature stays stable
at around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Even when the temperature around you changes, your internal temperature stays
the same.
This ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment despite a changing environment is called home-
ostasis. Homeostasis doesn’t just protect against temperature changes. Other aspects of your internal environment
also stay stable. For example, your body closely regulates your ﬂuid balance. You may have noticed that if you are
slightly dehydrated, your urine is darker. That’s because the urine is more concentrated and less water is mixed in
with it.

619

11.2. Homeostasis

Maintaining Homeostasis

www.ck12.org

So how does your body maintain homeostasis? The regulation of your internal environment is done primarily through
negative feedback. Negative feedback is a response to a stimulus that keeps a variable close to a set value ( Figure
11.3). Essentially, it "shuts off" or "turns on" a system when it varies from a set value.
For example, your body has an internal thermostat. During a winter day, in your house a thermostat senses the
temperature in a room and responds by turning on or off the heater. Your body acts in much the same way. When
body temperature rises, receptors in the skin and the brain sense the temperature change. The temperature change
triggers a command from the brain. This command can cause several responses. If you are too hot, the skin makes
sweat and blood vessels near the skin surface dilate. This response helps decrease body temperature.
Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood
are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into
glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose
levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back
to glucose.
For additional information, see Homeostasis at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSBbnHLR_cg .

FIGURE 11.3
Feedback Regulation.
If a raise in body
temperature (stimulus) is detected (recep-
tor), a signal will cause the brain to main-
tain homeostasis (response). Once the
body temperature returns to normal, neg-
ative feedback will cause the response to
end. This sequence of stimulus-receptor-
signal-response is used throughout the
body to maintain homeostasis.

Positive Feedback

Some processes in the body are regulated by positive feedback. Positive feedback is when a response to an event
increases the likelihood of the event to continue. An example of positive feedback is milk production in nursing
mothers. As the baby drinks her mother’s milk, the hormone prolactin, a chemical signal, is released. The more the
baby suckles, the more prolactin is released, which causes more milk to be produced. Other examples of positive
feedback include contractions during childbirth. When constrictions in the uterus push a baby into the birth canal,
additional contractions occur.

• Homeostasis is the ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment despite a changing external

environment.

11.3. Skin

11.3 Skin

• Describe the functions of the skin.
• Summarize skin structure.
• Identify the roles of sebum and sweat glands.

Why is your skin important?
Some people put a lot of time and money into maintaining their skin. They may use special creams and lotions.
While expensive creams may not be necessary, it is a good idea to take care of your skin. It does a lot of things for
you, from protecting you from disease to sensing your environment.

Your Skin

Did you know that you see the largest organ in your body every day? You wash it, dry it, cover it up to stay warm,
and uncover it to cool off. Yes, your skin is your body’s largest organ. Your skin is part of your integumentary
system ( Figure 11.4), which is the outer covering of your body. The integumentary system is made up of your skin,
hair, and nails.

622

www.ck12.org

Functions of Skin

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.4
Skin acts as a barrier that stops water
and other things, like soap and dirt, from
getting into your body.

The skin has many important functions. The skin:

• Provides a barrier. It keeps organisms that could harm the body out. It stops water from entering or leaving

the body.

• Controls body temperature. It does this by making sweat (or perspiration), a watery substance that cools the

body when it evaporates.

• Gathers information about your environment. Special nerve endings in your skin sense heat, pressure, cold,

and pain.

• Helps the body get rid of some types of waste, which are removed in sweat.
• Acts as a sun block. A pigment called melanin blocks sunlight from getting to deeper layers of skin cells,

which are easily damaged by sunlight.

Structure of Skin

Your skin is always exposed to your external environment, so it gets cut, scratched, and worn down. You also
naturally shed many skin cells every day. Your body replaces damaged or missing skin cells by growing more of
them. Did you know that the layer of skin you can see is actually dead? As the dead cells are shed or removed from
the upper layer, they are replaced by the skin cells below them.
Two different layers make up the skin: the epidermis and the dermis ( Figure 11.5). A fatty layer lies under the
dermis, but it is not part of your skin.

The Epidermis

The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin. It forms the waterproof, protective wrap over the body’s surface.
Although the top layer of epidermis is only about as thick as a sheet of paper, it is made up of 25 to 30 layers of cells.
The epidermis also contains cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin and hair
their color. Melanin-producing cells are found in the bottom layer of the epidermis. The epidermis does not have
any blood vessels. The lower part of the epidermis receives blood by diffusion from blood vessels of the dermis.

FIGURE 11.5
Skin is made up of two layers, the epider-
mis on top and the dermis below. The
tissue below the dermis is called the hy-
podermis, but it is not part of the skin.

The Dermis

The dermis is the layer of skin directly under the epidermis. It is made of a tough connective tissue. The dermis
contains hair follicles, sweat glands, oil glands, and blood vessels ( Figure 11.5). It also holds many nerve endings
that give you your sense of touch, pressure, heat, and pain.
Do you ever notice how your hair stands up when you are cold or afraid? Tiny muscles in the dermis pull on hair
follicles which cause hair to stand up. The resulting little bumps in the skin are commonly called "goosebumps" (
Figure 11.6).

Oil Glands and Sweat Glands

Glands and hair follicles open out into the epidermis, but they start in the dermis. Oil glands ( Figure 11.5) release,
or secrete an oily substance, called sebum, into the hair follicle. Sebum “waterproofs” hair and the skin surface to
prevent them from drying out. It can also stop the growth of bacteria on the skin. It is odorless, but the breakdown
of sebum by bacteria can cause odors. If an oil gland becomes plugged and infected, it develops into a pimple. Up to
85% of teenagers get pimples, which usually go away by adulthood. Frequent washing can help decrease the amount
of sebum on the skin.
Sweat glands ( Figure 11.5) open to the skin surface through skin pores. They are found all over the body.
Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface helps to lower skin temperature. The skin also releases excess water,
salts, sugars, and other wastes, such as ammonia and urea, in sweat.

11.4 Nails and Hair

• Describe the structure of hair and nails.
• Explain the role of keratin.

Why do you have arm hair?
Hair covers much of our bodies. But why? Think of the way that you can sense something brush against your arm.
Your arm hair is important in providing this type of sensation and making you aware of your environment. Also,
hair can trap heat and keep your body warm.

Hair and Nails

Along with the skin, the integumentary system includes the nails and hair. Both the nails and hair contain the tough
protein, keratin. The keratin forms ﬁbers, which makes your nails and hair tough and strong. Keratin is similar in
toughness to chitin, the carbohydrate found in the exoskeleton of arthropods.

Nails

Nails are similar to claws in other animals. They cover the tips of ﬁngers and toes. Fingernails and toenails both
grow from nail beds. As the nail grows, more cells are added at the nail bed. Older cells get pushed away from the
nail bed and the nail grows longer. There are no nerve endings in the nail. Otherwise cutting your nails would hurt
a lot!
Nails act as protective plates over the ﬁngertips and toes. Fingernails also help in sensing the environment. The area
under your nail has many nerve endings. These nerve endings allow you to receive more information about objects
you touch.

627

11.4. Nails and Hair

www.ck12.org

The Guinness Book of World Records began tracking record ﬁngernail lengths in 1955. At that time the record was
1 foot 10.75 inches long. The current record-holder for men is from India, with a record of 20 feet 2.25 inches for
all nails on his left hand, the longest being his thumbnail at 4 feet 9.6 inches. The record for women is held by an
American woman. The record is 28 feet (850 cm) for all nails of both hands, with the longest nail on her right thumb
at 2 feet 11 inches. Since adult nails grow at about 3 mm a month (1/10 of an inch), how long would it take to grow
such long nails?

Hair

Hair is one of the deﬁning characteristics of mammals. In fact, mammals are the only animals to have hair. Hair
sticks out from the epidermis, but it grows from the dermis ( Figure 11.7). Hair grows from inside the hair follicle.
New cells grow in the bottom part of the hair, called the bulb. Older cells get pushed up, and the hair grows longer.
The cells that make up the hair strand are dead and ﬁlled with the rope-like protein keratin.

FIGURE 11.7
Hair, hair follicle, and oil glands. The
oil, called sebum, helps to prevent water
loss from the skin. The sebaceous gland
secretes sebum, which waterproofs the
skin and hair.

In humans, hair grows everywhere on the body except the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands, the lips, and
the eyelids (except for eyelashes). Hair grows at a rate of about half an inch (1.25 cm) each month, or about 6 inches
(15 cm) a year.
Hair, especially on the head, helps to keep the body warm. The air traps a layer of warm air near the skin and acts
like a warm blanket. Hair can also act as a ﬁlter. Nose hair helps to trap particles in the air that may otherwise travel
to the lungs. Eyelashes shield eyes from dust and sunlight. Eyebrows stop salty sweat and rain from ﬂowing into the
eye.
The world’s longest documented hair, according to Guinness World Records, belongs to Xie Qiuping of China at
just under 18 feet 6 inches (5.627 m) when measured on May 8, 2004. She had been growing her hair since 1973
when she was 13 years old.

• Describe how to take care of your skin.
• Explain the dangerous effects of sunburns.
• Describe common skin disorders.

Why shower every day?
Of course, showering every day keeps you feeling and smelling fresh. But keeping clean is also good for your health!
For example, a shower or bath washes away bacteria and viruses that could harm you.

Keeping Skin Healthy

Your skin is your largest organ and constantly protects you from infections, so keeping your skin healthy is a good
idea.

Avoiding Sunburn

Chapter 11. Human Biology

Some sunlight is good for your health. Vitamin D is made in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. But getting too
much sun can be unhealthy. A sunburn is a burn to the skin that is caused by overexposure to UV radiation from
the sun’s rays or tanning beds.
Light-skinned people, like the man pictured below ( Figure 11.8), get sunburned more quickly than people with
darker skin. This is because pigments (melanin) in the skin act as a natural sunblock that help to protect the body
from UV radiation.
With over one million new cases each year, skin cancer, which is cancer that forms in the tissues of the skin, is the
most common form of human cancer. Children and teens who have been sunburned are at a greater risk of developing
skin cancer later in life. Long-term exposure to UV radiation is the leading cause of skin cancer. About 90 percent
of skin cancers are linked to sun exposure. UV radiation damages the genetic material (DNA) of skin cells. This
damage can cause the skin cells to grow out of control and form a tumor. Some of these tumors are very difﬁcult to
cure. For this reason you should always wear sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF), a hat, and clothing
when out in the sun.

FIGURE 11.8
Sunburn is caused by overexposure to
UV rays. Getting sunburned as a child
or a teen, especially sunburn that causes
blistering, increases the risk of developing
skin cancer later in life.

Keeping Clean

Keeping your skin clean is important because dirty skin is more prone to infection. Bathing every day helps to keep
your skin clean and healthy. Also, you know that taking a bath or shower helps prevent body odor. But where does
body odor come from? During the day, sweat, oil, dirt, dust, and dead skin cells can build up on the skin surface.
If not washed away, the mix of these materials can encourage the excess growth of bacteria. These bacteria feed on
these substances and cause a smell that is commonly called body odor.

Skin Disorders

Conditions that irritate, clog or inﬂame your skin can cause symptoms such as redness, swelling, burning and itching.
Allergies, irritants, your genetic background and certain diseases and immune system problems can cause numerous
skin conditions. Many skin problems, such as acne, also affect your appearance.

631

11.5. Keeping Skin Healthy

Acne

www.ck12.org

Your skin has tiny holes called pores that that can become blocked by oil, bacteria, dead skin and dirt. When this
occurs, you may develop a pimple. Acne is a skin condition that causes pimples, and is one of the more common
skin problem among teenagers. A diet high in reﬁned sugars or carbohydrates such as bread and chips can also lead
to acne.
Each pore on your skin is the opening to a follicle, which is made of a hair and sebaceous gland that releases sebum.
Acne may result from too much sebum produced by the follicle, dead skin cells accumulating in the pore, or bacteria
built up in the pore. Cleaning your skin daily with a mild soap to remove excess oil and dirt can help prevent acne.

Cold Sores

Cold sores are red, ﬂuid-ﬁlled blisters that appear near the mouth or on other areas of the face, usually caused by
herpes simplex virus type 1. Visible sores are contagious, but herpes may be spread even when sores can’t be seen.
You can catch the herpes simplex virus through kissing, sharing cosmetics, or sharing food with infected individuals.
Once you catch herpes simplex virus, it can’t be cured. Even after sores have healed, the virus remains in your body,
and new cold sores can appear at any time. This is not to be confused with genital herpes, which is caused by herpes
simplex virus type 2.

Canker Sore

A canker sore is a mouth ulcer or sore that is open and painful. They may be on the lips or inside of the lip or cheek.
Canker sores are usually white or yellowish, surrounded by red, inﬂamed soft tissue. A canker sore can be either
a simple canker or a complex canker. A simple canker sore reemerges about three to four times every year, and is
the common type in people between the ages of 10 and 20. Canker sores are not contagious and usually heal on
their own within a week or two. Causes of canker sores include a viral infection, stress, hormonal ﬂuctuations, food
allergies, immune system problems, or mouth injuries.

• Bathing every day helps to keep your skin clean and healthy.
• Excessive exposure to UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds is the leading cause of skin cancer.

11.6 Human Skeletal System

• Identify the main structures and functions of the skeletal system.
• Describe the structure of bones and how bones grow.
• Deﬁne cartilage and ligament.
• Explain bone growth.

Are bones alive?
From seeing a skeleton, you might think that bones are just dead, hollow structures. But in a living person, those
hollow spaces are full of living cells. Bones have a blood supply and nerves. Bones are a living tissue.

Your Skeleton

How important is your skeleton? Can you imagine your body without it? You would be a wobbly pile of muscle and
internal organs, and you would not be able to move.
The adult human skeleton has 206 bones, some of which are named below ( Figure 11.9). Bones are made up of
living tissue. They contain many different types of tissues. Cartilage, a dense connective tissue, is found at the end
of bones and is made of tough protein ﬁbers. Cartilage creates smooth surfaces for the movement of bones that are
next to each other, like the bones of the knee.
Ligaments are made of tough protein ﬁbers and connect bones to each other. Your bones, cartilage, and ligaments
make up your skeletal system.

634

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.9
The skeletal system is made up of bones,
cartilage, and ligaments. The skeletal
system has many important functions in
your body. What bones protect the heart
and lungs? What protects the brain?

Functions of Bones

Your skeletal system gives shape and form to your body, but it also plays other important roles. The main functions
of the skeletal system include:

• Support. The skeleton supports the body against the pull of gravity, meaning you don’t fall over when you

635

11.6. Human Skeletal System

www.ck12.org

stand up. The large bones of the lower limbs support the rest of the body when standing.

• Protection. The skeleton supports and protects the soft organs of the body. For example, the skull surrounds

the brain to protect it from injury. The bones of the rib cage help protect the heart and lungs.

• Movement. Bones work together with muscles to move the body.
• Making blood cells. Blood cells are mostly made inside certain types of bones.
• Storage. Bones store calcium. They contain more calcium than any other organ. Calcium is released by the

bones when blood levels of calcium drop too low. The mineral, phosphorus is also stored in bones.

Structure of Bones

Bones come in many different shapes and sizes, but they are all made of the same materials. Bones are organs, and
recall that organs are made up of two or more types of tissues.
The two main types of bone tissue are compact bone and spongy bone ( Figure 11.10).

• Compact bone makes up the dense outer layer of bones.
• Spongy bone is found at the center of the bone and is lighter and more porous than compact bone.

Bones look tough, shiny, and white because they are covered by a layer called the periosteum. Many bones also
contain a soft connective tissue called bone marrow in the pores of the spongy bone. Bone marrow is where blood
cells are made.

FIGURE 11.10
Bones are made up of different types of
tissues.

Bone Growth

Early in human development, the skeleton consists of only cartilage and other connective tissues. At this point, the
skeleton is very ﬂexible. As the fetus develops, hard bone begins to replace the cartilage, and the skeleton begins
to harden. Not all of the cartilage, however, is replaced by bone. Cartilage remains in many places in your body,
including your joints, your rib cage, your ears, and the tip of your nose.

636

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

A baby is born with zones of cartilage in its bones that allow growth of the bones. These areas, called growth plates,
allow the bones to grow longer as the child grows. By the time the child reaches an age of about 18 to 25 years, all
of the cartilage in the growth plate has been replaced by bone. This stops the bone from growing any longer. Even
though bones stop growing in length in early adulthood, they can continue to increase in thickness throughout life.
This thickening occurs in response to strain from increased muscle activity and from weight-lifting exercises.

Summary

• Bones, cartilage, and ligaments make up the skeletal system.
• Functions of the skeletal system include providing support, protecting the soft organs of the body, aiding in

movement, and making blood cells.

• Give examples of ﬁxed joints, partly movable joints, and movable joints.
• Distinguish a ball-and-socket joint from a hinge joint and a pivot joint.

Why does his knee hurt?
As you age, you might start noticing pain in your knees or elbows. These are examples of joints. Joints are the part
of the skeletal system that connect your bones. Joint pain is a common problem as people age.

Joints and How They Move

A joint is a point at which two or more bones meet. There are three main types of joints in the body:

1. Fixed joints do not allow any bone movement. Many of the joints in your skull are ﬁxed ( Figure 11.11).
There are eight bones that fuse together to form the cranium. The joints between these bones do not allow
movement, which helps protect the brain.

638

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.11
The skull has ﬁxed joints. Fixed joints
do not allow any movement of the bones,
which protects the brain from injury.

2. Partly movable joints allow only a little movement. Your backbone has partly movable joints between the

vertebrae ( Figure 11.12).

FIGURE 11.12
The joints between your vertebrae are
partially movable.

3. Movable joints allow the most movement.

639

11.7. Skeletal System Joints

www.ck12.org

Movable joints are also the most common type of joint in your body. Your ﬁngers, toes, hips, elbows, and knees
all provide examples of movable joints. The surfaces of bones at movable joints are covered with a smooth layer
of cartilage. The cartilage reduces friction between the bones. Ligaments often cross a joint, holding two nones
together. For example, there are numerous ligaments connecting the leg bones across the knee joint.

Types of Movable Joints

Four types of movable joints are discussed here.

1. In a ball-and-socket joint, the ball-shaped surface of one bone ﬁts into the cup-like shape of another. Exam-

ples of a ball-and-socket joint include the hip ( Figure 11.13) and the shoulder.

FIGURE 11.13
Your hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint.
The “ball” end of one bone ﬁts into the
“socket” of another bone. These joints
can move in many different directions.

2. In a hinge joint, the ends of the bones are shaped in a way that allows motion in two directions, forward and

backward. Examples of hinge joints are the knees ( Figure 11.14) and elbows.

FIGURE 11.14
Hinge Joint. The knee joint is a hinge
joint. Like a door hinge, a hinge joint
allows backward and forward movement.

3. The pivot joint ( Figure 11.15) only allows rotating movement. An example of a pivot joint is the joint

between the radius and ulna that allows you to turn the palm of your hand up and down.

640

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.15
Pivot Joint. The joint at which the radius
and ulna meet is a pivot joint. Movement
at this joint allows you to ﬂip your palm
over without moving your elbow joint.

4. A gliding joint is a joint which allows only gliding movement. The gliding joint allows one bone to slide over
the other. The gliding joint in your wrist allows you to ﬂex your wrist. It also allows you to make very small
side-to-side motions. There are also gliding joints in your ankles.

Summary

• Joints, a point at which two or more bones meet; they can be ﬁxed, partly movable, or movable.
• Types of movable joints include the ball-and-socket joint, hinge joint, pivot joint, and gliding joint.

• Describe problems of the skeletal system and steps you can take to keep your bones and joints healthy.
• Explain the importance of calcium and vitamin D.
• Describe osteoporosis.
• Distinguish cartilage injuries from ligament injuries.

Why drink milk?
Milk is naturally a good source of calcium. Vitamin D is also often added to milk. Both these nutrients help build
strong bones.

Keeping Bones and Joints Healthy

You can help keep your bones and skeletal system healthy by eating well and getting enough exercise. Weight-
bearing exercises help keep bones strong. Weight-bearing exercises and activities work against gravity. Such
activities include basketball, tennis, gymnastics, karate, running, and walking. When the body is exercised regularly
by performing weight-bearing activity, bones respond by adding more bone cells to increase their bone density.

643

Eating Well

Did you know that what you eat as a teenager can affect how healthy your skeletal system will be in 30, 40, and even
50 years? Calcium and vitamin D are two of the most important nutrients for a healthy skeletal system. Your bones
need calcium to grow properly. If you do not get enough calcium in your diet as a teenager, your bones may become
weak and break easily later in life.
Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones lose mass and become more fragile than they should be. Osteoporosis also
makes bones more likely to break. Two of the easiest ways to prevent osteoporosis are eating a healthy diet that has
the right amount of calcium and vitamin D and to do some sort of weight-bearing exercise every day. Foods that are
a good source of calcium include milk, yogurt, and cheese. Non-dairy sources of calcium include Chinese cabbage,
kale, and broccoli. Many fruit juices, fruit drinks, tofu, and cereals have calcium added to them. It is recommended
that teenagers get 1300 mg of calcium every day. For example, one cup (8 ﬂ. oz.) of milk provides about 300 mg of
calcium, or about 30% of the daily requirement. Other sources of calcium are pictured in the Figure 11.16.

FIGURE 11.16
There are many different sources of cal-
cium. Getting enough calcium in your
daily diet
for good bone
health.

is important

Vitamin D is unusual since you don’t have to rely on your diet alone to get enough of this vitamin. Your skin makes
vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Pigments in the skin act like a ﬁlter that can prevent the skin from making
vitamin D. As a result, people with darker skin need more time in the sun than people with lighter skin to make the
same amount of vitamin D.
You can also get vitamin D from foods. Fish is naturally rich in vitamin D. In the United States, vitamin D is added
to other foods, including milk, soy milk, and breakfast cereals. Teenagers are recommended to get 5 micrograms
(200 IU) of vitamin D every day. A 3 1
2-ounce portion of cooked salmon provides 360 IU of vitamin D. A 8-ounce
glass of milk is fortiﬁed with about 100 IU of vitamin D.

Bone Fractures

Even though they are very strong, bones can fracture, or break. Fractures can happen at different places on a bone.
They are usually caused by excess bending stress on the bone. Bending stress is what causes a pencil to break if you
bend it too far.
Soon after a fracture, the body begins to repair the break. The area becomes swollen and sore. Within a few days,
bone cells travel to the break site and begin to rebuild the bone. It takes about two to three months before compact
and spongy bone form at the break site. Sometimes the body needs extra help in repairing a broken bone. In such a
case, a surgeon will piece a broken bone together with metal pins. Moving the broken pieces together will help keep

the bone from moving and give the body a chance to repair the break. Below, a broken ulna has been repaired with
pins ( Figure 11.17).

FIGURE 11.17
The upper part of the ulna, just above the
elbow joint, is broken, as you can see in
the X-ray to the left. The x-ray to the
right was taken after a surgeon inserted
a system of pins and wires across the
fracture to bring the two pieces of the ulna
into close proximity.

Cartilage Injuries

Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage at the ends of the bones breaks down. The break down of the cartilage leads
to pain and stiffness in the joint. Decreased movement of the joint because of the pain may lead to weakening of the
muscles that normally move the joint, and the ligaments surrounding the joint may become loose. Osteoarthritis is
the most common form of arthritis. It has many contributing factors, including aging, sport injuries, fractures, and
obesity.

Ligament Injuries

Recall that a ligament is a short band of tough connective tissue that connects bones together to form a joint.
Ligaments can get injured when a joint gets twisted or bends too far. The protein ﬁbers that make up a ligament can
get strained or torn, causing swelling and pain. Injuries to ligaments are called sprains. Ankle sprains are a common
type of sprain.

Preventing Injuries

Preventing injuries to your bones and ligaments is easier and much less painful than treating an injury. Wearing the
correct safety equipment when performing activities that require such equipment can help prevent many common
injuries. For example, wearing a bicycle helmet can help prevent a skull injury if you fall. Warming up and cooling
down properly can help prevent ligament and muscle injuries. Stretching before and after activity also helps prevent
injuries.

11.9 Smooth, Skeletal, and Cardiac Muscles

• Explain the roles of the muscular system.
• Deﬁne muscle ﬁber.
• Identify and describe the three muscle types in the body.

Does the heart have muscles?
When you think of muscles, you might think of biceps and the external muscles you see in a bodybuilder. However,
some muscles are found deep inside your body. The heart, for example, is a very muscular organ. It has to pump
blood all around your body.

Types of Muscles

The muscular system consists of all the muscles in the body. This is the body system that allows us to move. You
also depend on many muscles to keep you alive. Your heart, which is mostly muscle, pumps blood around your
body.
Each muscle in the body is made up of cells called muscle ﬁbers. Muscle ﬁbers are long, thin cells that can do
something that other cells cannot do—they are able to get shorter. Shortening of muscle ﬁbers is called contraction.
Muscle ﬁbers can contract because they are made of proteins, called actin and myosin, that form long ﬁlaments (or
ﬁbers). When muscles contract, these protein ﬁlaments slide or glide past one another, shortening the length of the

647

11.9. Smooth, Skeletal, and Cardiac Muscles

www.ck12.org

cell. When your muscles relax, the length extends back to the previous position. Nearly all movement in the body is
the result of muscle contraction.
You can control some muscle movements. However, certain muscle movements happen without you thinking about
them. Muscles that are under your conscious control are called voluntary muscles. Muscles that are not under your
conscious control are called involuntary muscles.
Muscle tissue is one of the four types of tissue found in animals. There are three different types of muscle in the
body ( Figure 11.18):

1. Skeletal muscle is made up of voluntary muscles, usually attached to the skeleton. Skeletal muscles move the
body. They can also contract involuntarily by reﬂexes. For example, you can choose to move your arm, but
your arm would move automatically if you were to burn your ﬁnger on a stove top. This voluntary contraction
begins with a thought process. A signal from your brain tells your muscles to contract or relax. Quickly
contract and relax the muscles in your ﬁngers a few times. Think about how quickly these signals must travel
throughout your body to make this happen.

2. Smooth muscle is composed of involuntary muscles found within the walls of organs and structures such
as the esophagus, stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. These muscles push materials like food or blood
through organs. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle can never be under your control.

3. Cardiac muscle is also an involuntary muscle, found only in the heart. The cardiac muscle ﬁbers all contract
together, generating enough force to push blood throughout the body. What would happen if this muscle was
under conscious or voluntary control?

FIGURE 11.18
There are three types of muscles in the
body: cardiac, skeletal, and smooth.

Summary

• Muscles that are under your conscious control are called voluntary muscles, while muscles that are not under

your conscious control are called involuntary muscles.

• The three types of muscles in the body include skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle.

11.10 Muscles, Bones, and Movement

• Describe how skeletal muscles and bones work together to move the body.
• Compare the ﬂexor to the extensor.
• Describe functions of smooth muscle.
• Explain the importance of cardiac muscle.

Do muscles come in pairs?
This woman is doing a stretch for the muscles on the back of her legs, the hamstrings. She also has a muscles on the
front of her legs, directly opposite the hamstrings. These are the quadriceps. The hamstrings and quadriceps work
together as a pair to move your legs back and forth while you run.

Muscles, Bones, and Movement

When skeletal muscles contract, bones move. But how do muscles make your bones move? A voluntary muscles
usually works across a joint. It is attached to both the bones on either side of the joint by strong cords called tendons.
A tendon is a tough band of connective tissue that connects a muscle to a bone. Tendons are similar to ligaments,
except that ligaments join bones to each other. Muscles move the body by contracting against the skeleton. When
muscles contract, they get shorter. By contracting, muscles pull on bones and allow the body to move.
Muscles can only contract. They cannot actively extend, though they can move or relax back into the non-contracted
neutral position. Therefore, to move bones in opposite directions, pairs of muscles must work in opposition. Each
muscle in the pair works against the other to move bones at the joints of the body. The muscle that contracts to cause
a joint to bend is called the ﬂexor. The muscle that contracts to cause the joint to straighten is called the extensor.
When one muscle is contracted, the other muscle from the pair is always elongated.

650

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

For example, the biceps and triceps muscles work together to allow you to bend and straighten your elbow. When
you want to bend your elbow, your biceps muscle contracts ( Figure 11.19), and, at the same time, the triceps muscle
relaxes. The biceps is the ﬂexor, and the triceps is the extensor of your elbow joint. Other muscles that work together
are the quadriceps and hamstrings used to bend and straighten the knee, and the pectorals and trapezius used to move
the arms and shoulders forward and backward. During daily routines we do not use muscles equally. For example,
we use our biceps more than our triceps due to lifting against gravity.

FIGURE 11.19
The biceps and triceps act against one another to bend and straighten
the elbow joint. To bend the elbow, the biceps contracts and the triceps
relaxes. To straighten the elbow, the triceps contract and the biceps relax.

Smooth Muscles and Cardiac Muscles

Smooth muscles and cardiac muscles are not attached to bone. Recall that these types of muscles are under
involuntary control. Smooth muscle is responsible for the contractility of hollow organs, such as blood vessels,
the gastrointestinal tract, the bladder, or the uterus. Like skeletal muscles, smooth muscle ﬁbers do contract together,
causing the muscle to shorten. Smooth muscles have numerous functions, including the following.

• The smooth muscle in the uterus helps a woman to push out her baby.
• In the bladder, smooth muscle helps to push out urine.
• Smooth muscles move food through the digestive tract.
• In arteries, smooth muscle movements maintain the arteries’ diameter.
• Smooth muscle regulates air ﬂow in lungs.
• Smooth muscle in the lungs helps the airways to expand and contract as necessary.
• Smooth muscles in arteries and veins are largely responsible for regulation of blood pressure.

Cardiac muscle also contracts and gets shorter. This muscle is found only in the heart. The sudden burst of
contraction forces blood throughout your body. When the cardiac muscle relaxes, the heart ﬁlls with blood. This
rhythmic contraction must continue for your whole life, luckily the heart muscle never gets tired. If your heart beats
75 times a minute, how many times does it beat in an hour? A day? A year? 85 years?

11.11 Muscles and Exercise

• Deﬁne lifestyle disease.
• Describe how exercise affects the muscular system.
• Distinguish between aerobic exercises and anaerobic exercises.
• Describe common muscle injuries.

What is aerobic exercise?
When you hear the word "aerobic," an aerobics class may come to mind. But that’s just one type of aerobic exercise.
Aerobic exercise is any exercise that strengthens your cardiovascular system—playing basketball or swimming, for
example.

Muscles and Exercise

Regular physical exercise is important in preventing lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular disease, some types of
cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Regular exercise also improves the health of the muscular system. Muscles that
are exercised are bigger and stronger than muscles that are not exercised.
Exercise improves both muscular strength and muscular endurance. Muscular strength is the ability of a muscle to
use force during a contraction. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle to continue to contract over a long
time without getting tired.
Exercises are grouped into three types depending on the effect they have on the body:

• Aerobic exercises, such as cycling, walking, and running, increase muscular endurance and cardiovascular

health.

• Anaerobic exercises, such as weight training or sprinting, increase muscle strength.

653

11.11. Muscles and Exercise

www.ck12.org

• Flexibility exercises, such as stretching, improve the range of motion of muscles and joints. Regular stretching

helps people avoid activity-related injuries.

Anaerobic Exercise and Muscular Strength

Anaerobic exercises comprise brief periods of physical exertion and high-intensity, strength-training activities.
Anaerobic exercises cause muscles to get bigger and stronger. Anaerobic exercises use a resistance against which
the muscle has to work to lift or push away. The resistance can be a weight or a person’s own body weight ( Figure
11.20). Sports such as basketball, tennis, football and even baseball can be anaerobic.

FIGURE 11.20
Anaerobic exercises involve the muscles
working against resistance.
In this case
the resistance is the weight of a barbell.

Aerobic Exercise and Muscular Endurance

Aerobic exercises are exercises in which a low to moderate level of exertion can be sustained over long periods.
These are exercises that cause your heart to beat faster and allow your muscles to use oxygen to contract. If you
exercise aerobically, overtime, your muscles will not get easily tired, and you will use oxygen more efﬁciently.
Aerobic exercise ( Figure 11.21) also helps improve cardiac muscle.

Muscle Injuries

Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up
properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity.
Warming up increases the blood ﬂow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons
are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm
muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure 11.22).
When you don’t do a proper warm-up, several types of injuries can occur. A strain happens when muscle or tendons
tear. Strains are also known as "pulled muscles." Another common injury is tendinitis, the irritation of the tendons.
Strains and tendinitis are usually treated with rest, cold compresses, and stretching exercises that a physical therapist
designs for each patient.
Injuries can also be prevented by proper rest and recovery. If you do not get enough rest, your body will become
injured and will not react well to exercise, or improve. You can also rest by doing a different activity. For example,

654

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

if you run, you can rest your running muscles and joints by swimming.

FIGURE 11.21
When done regularly, aerobic activities,
such as cycling, make the heart stronger.
Other aerobic activities include mowing
lawn, shoveling snow and cross country
skiing.

FIGURE 11.22
Warming up before the game helps the
players avoid injuries. Some warm-ups
may include stretching exercises.

Summary

• Aerobic exercise helps improve the cardiovascular system, while anaerobic exercise causes muscles to get

bigger and stronger.

• Muscle strain and tendinitis can be prevented by warming up before rigorous exercise and allowing your

muscles to rest and recover.

11.12 Food and Nutrients

• Explain why the body needs food.
• Deﬁne nutrient.
• List and describe the ﬁve types of nutrients.

What happens when you don’t eat?
Refusing one meal won’t stunt your growth. But lack of proper food over a period of time can lead to malnutrition.
That means, the body is not getting enough nutrients to grow and stay healthy. Kids who are malnourished may not
grow as tall as they would otherwise.

Why We Need Food

Did you ever hear the old saying, An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Do apples really prevent you from getting
sick? Probably not, but eating apples and other fresh fruits can help keep you healthy. Do you eat your vegetables?
Maybe you do, but you may have friends who won’t touch a piece of broccoli or asparagus. Should you eat these
foods and food like them? The girls pictured in the Figure 11.23 are eating salads. Why do you need foods like
these for good health? What role does food play in the body?
Your body needs food for three reasons:

1. Food gives your body energy. You need energy for everything you do. Remember that cellular respiration
converts the glucose in the food you eat into ATP, or cellular energy. Which has more glucose, a salad or a

piece of meat? Do you remember what types of foods produce glucose? Recall that glucose is the product of
photosynthesis.

2. Food provides building materials for your body. Your body needs building materials so it can grow and repair

itself. Speciﬁcally, it needs these materials to produce more cells and its components.

3. Food contains substances that help control body processes. Your body processes must be kept in balance for

good health.

For all these reasons, you must have a regular supply of nutrients. Nutrients are chemicals in food that your body
needs. There are ﬁve types of nutrients.

1. Carbohydrates
2. Proteins
3. Lipids
4. Vitamins
5. Minerals

Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids are categories of organic compounds. They give your body energy, though
carbohydrates are the main source of energy. Proteins provide building materials, such as amino acids to build your
own proteins. Proteins, vitamins, and minerals also help control body processes. Carbohydrates include sugars such
as the glucose made by photosynthesis. Often glucose is stored in large molecules such as starch. Proteins are found
in foods like meats and nuts. Lipids includes fats and oils. Though you should stay away from many types of fats,
others are needed by your body. Important vitamins include vitamins A, B (multiple types) C, D, and E. Important
minerals include calcium and potassium. What should you drink to get calcium? Milk is a good source.

Summary

• Your body needs food to obtain energy, to get building blocks for your body, and to get substances that help

control body processes.

• Nutrients, chemicals in food that your body needs, include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, and

minerals.

11.13 Types of Nutrients

• Identify sources of nutrients.
• Identify the roles of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.
• Distinguish simple carbohydrates from complex carbohydrates.
• Distinguish saturated fats from unsaturated fats.

What nutrients are in this meal?
There are many different nutrients that are present in this meal. For example, the steak is a source of protein. The
french fries are a source of carbohydrates. Both these nutrients help supply the body with energy.

Nutrients

Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids contain energy. When your body digests food, it breaks down the molecules of
these nutrients. This releases the energy so your body can use it.

Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are nutrients that include sugars, starches, and ﬁber. There are two types of carbohydrates: simple
and complex. Pictured below are some foods that are good sources of carbohydrates ( Figure 11.24).

Simple Carbohydrates

Sugars are small, simple carbohydrates that are found in foods such as fruits and milk. The sugar found in fruits
is called fructose. The sugar found in milk is called lactose. These sugars are broken down by the body to form
glucose (C6H12O6), the simplest sugar of all.

660

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.24
Up to the age of 13 years, you need about
130 grams of carbohydrates a day. Most
of the carbohydrates should be complex.
They are broken down by the body more
slowly than simple carbohydrates. There-
fore, they provide energy longer and more
steadily.

Where does glucose come from? Recall that glucose is the product of photosynthesis, so some organisms such as
plants are able to make their own glucose. As animals cannot photosynthesize, they must eat to obtain carbohydrates.
Through the process of cellular respiration, glucose is converted by cells into energy that is usable by the cell (ATP).

Complex Carbohydrates

Starch is a large, complex carbohydrate made of thousands of glucose units (monomers) joined together. Starches
are found in foods such as vegetables and grains. Starches are broken down by the body into sugars that provide
energy. Breads and pasta are good sources of complex carbohydrates.
Fiber is another type of large, complex carbohydrate that is partly indigestible. Unlike sugars and starches, ﬁber does
not provide energy. However, it has other important roles in the body. For example, ﬁber is important for maintaining
the health of your gastrointestinal tract. Eating foods high in ﬁber also helps ﬁll you up without providing too many
calories. Most fruits and vegetables are high in ﬁber. Some examples are pictured below ( Figure 11.25).

Proteins

Proteins are nutrients made up of smaller molecules called amino acids. Recall that there are 20 different amino
acids arranged like "beads on a string" to form proteins. These amino acid chains then fold up into a three-
dimensional molecule, giving the protein a speciﬁc function. Proteins have several important roles in the body.
For example, proteins make up antibodies, muscle ﬁbers and enzymes that help control cell and body processes.
You need to make sure you have enough protein in your diet to obtain the necessary amino acids to make your
proteins.

661

11.13. Types of Nutrients

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 11.25
Between the ages of 9 and 13 years, girls need about 26 grams of ﬁber per day, and boys need about 31 grams
of ﬁber per day.

If you eat more than you need for these purposes, the extra protein is used for energy. The image below shows how
many grams of protein you need each day ( Figure 11.26). It also shows some foods that are good sources of protein.

Lipids

Lipids are nutrients, such as fats that store energy. Lipids also have several other roles in the body. For example,
lipids protect nerves and make up the membranes that surround cells.
Fats are one type of lipid. Stored fat gives your body energy to use for later. It’s like having money in a savings
account: it’s there in case you need it. Stored fat also cushions and protects internal organs. In addition, it insulates
the body. It helps keep you warm in cold weather.

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.26
Between the ages of 9 and 13 years, you need about 34 grams of proteins a day. Seafood and eggs are other
good sources of protein.

There are two main types of fats, saturated and unsaturated.

1. Saturated fats can be unhealthy, even in very small amounts. They are found mainly in animal foods, such as
meats, whole milk, and eggs. So even though these foods are good sources of proteins, they should be eaten in
limited amounts. Saturated lipids increase cholesterol levels in the blood. Too much cholesterol in the blood

663

11.13. Types of Nutrients

www.ck12.org

can lead to heart disease.

2. Unsaturated fats are found mainly in plant foods, such as vegetable oil, olive oil, and nuts. Unsaturated lipids
are also found in ﬁsh, such as salmon. Unsaturated lipids are needed in small amounts for good health. Most
lipids in your diet should be unsaturated.

Another type of lipid is called trans fat. Trans fats are manufactured and added to certain foods to keep them fresher
for longer. Foods that contain trans fats include cakes, cookies, fried foods, and margarine. Eating foods that contain
trans fats increases the risk of heart disease.
Beginning with Denmark in 2003, many nations now limit the amount of trans fat that can be in food products or
ban these products all together. On January 1, 2008, Calgary became the ﬁrst city in Canada to ban trans fats from
restaurants and fast food chains. Beginning in 2010, California banned trans fats from restaurant products, and in
2011, from all retail baked goods.

Summary

• Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids provide energy and have other important roles in the body.
• Unsaturated fats are better for your health than trans fats or saturated fats.

How do you get your vitamins?
You may take a vitamin pill. That is a good way to make sure you are getting most of the vitamins your body needs

Vitamins and Minerals

Vitamins and minerals are also nutrients. They do not provide energy, but they are needed for good health.

Vitamins are organic compounds that the body needs in small amounts to function properly. Humans need 13
different vitamins. Some of them are listed below ( Table 11.2). The table also shows how much of each vitamin
you need every day. Vitamins have many roles in the body. For example, Vitamin A helps maintain good vision.
Vitamin B9 helps form red blood cells. Vitamin K is needed for blood to clot when you have a cut or other wound.

Some vitamins are produced in the body. For example, vitamin D is made in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight.
Vitamins B12 and K are produced by bacteria that normally live inside the body. Most other vitamins must come
from foods. Foods that are good sources of vitamins include whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and milk ( Table 11.2).
Not getting enough vitamins can cause health problems. For example, too little vitamin C causes a disease called
scurvy. People with scurvy have bleeding gums, nosebleeds, and other symptoms.

Minerals

Minerals are chemical elements that are needed for body processes. Minerals that you need in relatively large
amounts are listed below ( Table 11.3). Minerals that you need in smaller amounts include iodine, iron, and zinc.
Minerals have many important roles in the body. For example, calcium and phosphorus are needed for strong bones
and teeth. Potassium and sodium are needed for muscles and nerves to work normally.

Your body cannot produce any of the minerals that it needs. Instead, you must get minerals from the foods you eat.
Good sources of minerals include milk, leafy green vegetables, and whole grains ( Table 11.3).
Not getting enough minerals can cause health problems. For example, too little calcium may cause osteoporosis.
This is a disease in which bones become soft and break easily. Getting too much of some minerals can also cause
health problems. Many people get too much sodium. Sodium is added to most packaged foods. People often add
more sodium to their food by using table salt. Too much sodium causes high blood pressure in some people.

Summary

• Vitamins and minerals do not provide energy but are needed in small amounts for the body to function properly.
• Some vitamins are produced in your body, while others must come from the foods you eat.

11.15 Choosing Healthy Foods

• Describe how to choose foods wisely for optimal health.
• Explain MyPyramid and MyPlate.
• List eating healthy guidelines.
• Read and understand a nutrition facts label.
• Deﬁne obesity.

Which foods would be the best choice?
Each day you make many food choices. You decide which lunch line to get into. Then you may choose an after-
school snack. How can you make the most healthy decisions?

Choosing Healthy Foods

Foods such as whole grain breads, fresh fruits, and ﬁsh provide nutrients you need for good health. But different
foods give you different types of nutrients. You also need different amounts of each nutrient. How can you choose the
right mix of foods to get the proper balance of nutrients? Three tools can help you choose foods wisely: MyPyramid,
MyPlate, and food labels.

668

www.ck12.org

MyPyramid

Chapter 11. Human Biology

MyPyramid ( Figure 11.27) is a diagram that shows how much you should eat each day of foods from six different
food groups. It recommends the amount of nutrients you need based on your age, your gender, and your level of
activity. The six food groups in MyPyramid are:

• Grains, such as bread, rice, pasta, and cereal.
• Vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, carrots, and sweet potatoes.
• Fruits, such as oranges, apples, bananas, and strawberries.
• Oils, such as vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, and peanut oil.
• Dairy, such as milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other cheeses.
• Meat and beans, such as chicken, ﬁsh, soybeans, and kidney beans.

FIGURE 11.27
MyPyramid can help you choose foods
wisely for good health. Each colored
band represents a different food group.
The key shows which food group each
color represents. Which colored band of
MyPyramid is widest? Which food group
does it represent?

In MyPyramid, each food group is represented by a band of a different color. For example, grains are represented
by an orange band, and vegetables are represented by a green band. The wider the band, the more foods you should
choose from that food group each day.
The orange band in MyPyramid is the widest band. This means that you should choose more foods from the grain
group than from any other single food group. The green, blue, and red bands are also relatively wide. Therefore,
you should choose plenty of foods from the vegetable, dairy, and fruit groups as well. You should choose the fewest
foods from the food group with the narrowest band. Which band is narrowest? Which food group does it represent?
Are you wondering where foods like ice cream, cookies, and potato chips ﬁt into MyPyramid? The white tip of
MyPyramid represents foods such as these. These are foods that should be eaten only in very small amounts and not
very often. Such foods contain very few nutrients and are called nutrient-poor. Instead, they are high in fats, sugars,
and sodium, which are nutrients that you should limit in a healthy eating plan. Ice cream, cookies, and potato chips
are also high in calories. Eating too much of them may lead to unhealthy weight gain.

Healthy Eating Guidelines

• Make at least half your daily grain choices whole grains. Examples of whole grains are whole wheat bread,

whole wheat pasta, and brown rice.

669

11.15. Choosing Healthy Foods

www.ck12.org

• Choose a variety of different vegetables each day. Be sure to include both dark green vegetables, such as

spinach and broccoli, and orange vegetables, such as carrots and sweet potatoes.

• Choose a variety of different fruits each day. Select mainly fresh fruits rather than canned fruits, and whole

fruits instead of fruit juices.

• When choosing oils, choose unsaturated oils, such as olive oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil.
• Choose low-fat or fat-free milk and other dairy products. For example, select fat-free yogurt and low-fat

cheese.

• For meats, choose ﬁsh, chicken, and lean cuts of beef. Also, be sure to include beans, nuts, and seeds.

MyPlate

In June 2011, the United States Department of Agriculture replaced My Pyramid with MyPlate. MyPlate depicts
the relative daily portions of various food groups ( Figure 11.28). See http://www.choosemyplate.gov/ for more
information.

FIGURE 11.28
MyPlate is a visual guideline for balanced
eating, replacing MyPyramid in 2011.

The following guidelines accompany MyPlate:
1. Balancing Calories

• Enjoy your food, but eat less.
• Avoid oversized portions.

2. Foods to Increase

• Make half your plate fruits and vegetables.
• Make at least half your grains whole grains.
• Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk.

3. Foods to Reduce

670

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

• Compare sodium in foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals; choose the foods with lower levels.
• Drink water instead of drinks with high levels of sugar.

Using Nutrition Facts Labels

In the United States and other nations, packaged foods are required by law to have nutrition facts labels. A nutrition
facts label ( Figure 11.29) shows the nutrients in a food. Packaged foods are also required to list their ingredients.
The information listed at the right of the label tells you what to look for. At the top of the label, look for the serving
size. The serving size tells you how much of the food you should eat to get the nutrients listed on the label. A cup
of food from the label pictured below is a serving. The calories in one serving are listed next. In this food, there are
250 calories per serving.

FIGURE 11.29
Reading nutrition facts labels can help
you choose healthy foods. Look at the
nutrition facts label shown here. Do you
think this food is a good choice for a
healthy eating plan? Why or why not?

Next on the nutrition facts label, look for the percent daily values (% DV) of nutrients. Remember the following tips
when reading a food label:

• A food is low in a nutrient if the percent daily value of the nutrient is 5% or less.
• The healthiest foods are low in nutrients such as fats and sodium.
• A food is high in a nutrient if the percent daily value of the nutrient is 20% or more.
• The healthiest foods are high in nutrients such as ﬁber and proteins.

671

11.15. Choosing Healthy Foods

www.ck12.org

Look at the percent daily values on the food label ( Figure 11.29). Which nutrients have values of 5% or less? These
are the nutrients that are low in this food. They include ﬁber, vitamin A, vitamin C, and iron. Which nutrients have
values of 20% or more? These are the nutrients that are high in this food. They include sodium, potassium, and
calcium.

Balancing Food with Exercise

Look at MyPyramid ( Figure 11.27). Note the person walking up the side of the pyramid. This shows that exercise
is important for balanced eating. Exercise helps you use any extra energy in the foods you eat. The more active you
are, the more energy you use. You should try to get at least an hour of physical activity just about every day. Pictured
below are some activities that can help you use extra energy ( Figure 11.30).

Weight Gain and Obesity

Any unused energy in food is stored in the body as fat. This is true whether the extra energy comes from carbohy-
drates, proteins, or lipids. What happens if you take in more energy than you use, day after day? You will store more
and more fat and become overweight.
Eventually, you may become obese. Obesity is having a very high percentage of body fat. Obese people are at least
20 percent heavier than their healthy weight range. The excess body fat of obesity is linked to many diseases. Obese
people often have serious health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. They are also
more likely to develop arthritis and some types of cancer. People who remain obese during their entire adulthood
usually do not live as long as people who stay within a healthy weight range.
The current generation of children and teens is the ﬁrst generation in our history that may have a shorter life than
their parents. The reason is their high rate of obesity and the health problems associated with obesity. You can avoid
gaining weight and becoming obese. The choice is yours. Choose healthy foods by using MyPyramid and reading
food labels. Then get plenty of exercise to balance the energy in the foods you eat.

Summary

• MyPlate, MyPyramid, and food labels are tools that can help you choose the best foods for healthy eating.
• Eating too much and exercising too little can lead to weight gain and obesity.

11.16 Human Digestive System

• List the functions of the digestive system.
• Deﬁne digestion and absorption.
• Distinguish chemical digestion from mechanical digestion.

Do you know when you’re digesting food?
Unless you have an upset stomach, digestion usually happens without you even noticing. You consciously chew up
your food, but most of the digestive process takes place without your conscious awareness. Long after you put down
your fork, food is still passing through your stomach and small intestine. It may take over a day for a meal to pass
all the way through your digestive system.

Function of the Digestive System

Nutrients in the foods you eat are needed by the cells of your body. How do the nutrients in foods get to your body
cells? What organs and processes break down the foods and make the nutrients available to cells? The organs are
those of the digestive system. The processes are digestion and absorption.

675

11.16. Human Digestive System

www.ck12.org

The digestive system is the body system that breaks down food and absorbs nutrients. It also gets rid of solid food
waste. The digestive system is mainly one long tube from the mouth to the anus, known as the gastrointestinal
tract (GI tract). The main organs of the digestive system include the esophagus, stomach and the intestine, and are
pictured below ( Figure 11.31). The intestine is divided into the small and large intestine. The small intestine has
three segments. The ileum is the longest segment of the small intestine, which is well over 10 feet long. The large
intestine is about 5 feet long.

FIGURE 11.31
This drawing shows the major organs of
the digestive system. The liver, pancreas
and gallbladder are also organs of the
digestive system.

Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion, mechanical and
chemical. In mechanical digestion, large chunks of food are broken down into small pieces. Mechanical digestion
begins in the mouth and involves physical processes, such as chewing. This process continues in the stomach as
the food is mixed with digestive juices. In chemical digestion, large food molecules are broken down into small
nutrient molecules. This is a chemical process which also begins in the mouth as saliva begins to break down food
and continues in the stomach as stomach enzymes further digest the food.
Absorption is the process that allows substances you eat to be taken up by the blood. After food is broken down into
small nutrient molecules, the molecules are absorbed by the blood. After absorption, the nutrient molecules travel
in the bloodstream to cells throughout the body. This happens mostly in the small intestine.
Some substances in food cannot be broken down into nutrients. They remain behind in the digestive system after the
nutrients are absorbed. Any substances in food that cannot be digested and absorbed pass out of the body as solid
waste. The process of passing solid food waste out of the body is called elimination.

Summary

• The digestive system is the body system that breaks down food, absorbs nutrients, and gets rid of solid wastes.
• Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients, while absorption is the process that allows

nutrients to be taken up by the blood.

11.17 Enzymes in the Digestive System

• Explain the role of enzymes in digestion.
• List and describe digestive enzymes.
• List and describe digestive hormones.

What happens if you suck on a piece of white bread?
If you kept a bite of white bread in your mouth for a long period of time, it would start to get really mushy. Then it
would start tasting sweet. That’s because you have enzymes in your saliva. The enzymes break down the complex
carbohydrates in the bread into simple sugars.

The Role of Enzymes in the Digestive System

Chemical digestion could not take place without the help of digestive enzymes. An enzyme is a protein that speeds
up chemical reactions in the body. Digestive enzymes speed up chemical reactions that break down large food

678

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

molecules into small molecules.
Did you ever use a wrench to tighten a bolt? You could tighten a bolt with your ﬁngers, but it would be difﬁcult and
slow. If you use a wrench, you can tighten a bolt much more easily and quickly. Enzymes are like wrenches. They
make it much easier and quicker for chemical reactions to take place. Like a wrench, enzymes can also be used over
and over again. But you need the appropriate size and shape of the wrench to efﬁciently tighten the bolt, just like
each enzyme is speciﬁc for the reaction it helps.
Digestive enzymes are released, or secreted, by the organs of the digestive system. These enzymes include proteases
that digest proteins, and nucleases that digest nucleic acids. Examples of digestive enzymes are:

• Amylase, produced in the mouth. It helps break down large starch molecules into smaller sugar molecules.
• Pepsin, produced in the stomach. Pepsin helps break down proteins into amino acids.
• Trypsin, produced in the pancreas. Trypsin also breaks down proteins.
• Pancreatic lipase, produced in the pancreas. It is used to break apart fats.
• Deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease, produced in the pancreas. They are enzymes that break bonds in nucleic

acids like DNA and RNA.

Bile salts are bile acids that help to break down fat. Bile acids are made in the liver. When you eat a meal, bile is
secreted into the intestine, where it breaks down the fats ( Figure 11.32).

FIGURE 11.32
Bile is made in the liver, stored in the
gallbladder, and then secreted into the
intestine. It helps break down fats.

Hormones and Digestion

If you are a typical teenager, you like to eat. For your body to break down, absorb and spread the nutrients from
your food throughout your body, your digestive system and endocrine system need to work together. The endocrine
system sends hormones around your body to communicate between cells. Essentially, hormones are chemical
messenger molecules.
Digestive hormones are made by cells lining the stomach and small intestine. These hormones cross into the blood
where they can affect other parts of the digestive system. Some of these hormones are listed below.

• Gastrin, which signals the secretion of gastric acid.

679

11.17. Enzymes in the Digestive System

www.ck12.org

• Cholecystokinin, which signals the secretion of pancreatic enzymes.
• Secretin, which signals secretion of water and bicarbonate from the pancreas.
• Ghrelin, which signals when you are hungry.
• Gastric inhibitory polypeptide, which stops or decreases gastric secretion. It also causes the release of insulin

in response to high blood glucose levels.

Summary

• Digestive enzymes speed up the reactions of chemical digestion.
• Hormones, chemical messengers used to communicate between cells, are important in regulating digestion.

11.18 Digestive System Organs

• List the organs of the digestive system.
• Describe the digestive organs and their functions.
• Deﬁne peristalsis.
• Explain the function of the villi of the small intestine.

How many organs of the digestive system can you name?
Stomach? Mouth? It takes many different organs working together in order to digest your food. Some are part of
the pipeline that food passes through. Others make special chemicals that are needed for digestion.

Organs of the Digestive System

The mouth and stomach are just two of the organs of the digestive system. Other digestive system organs are the
esophagus, small intestine, and large intestine. Below, you can see that the digestive organs form a long tube (
Figure 11.33). In adults, this tube is about 30 feet long! At one end of the tube is the mouth. At the other end is the
anus. Food enters the mouth and then passes through the rest of the digestive system. Food waste leaves the body
through the anus.

681

11.18. Digestive System Organs

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 11.33
This drawing shows the liver, gallbladder,
and pancreas. These organs are part
of the digestive system. Food does not
pass through them, but they secrete sub-
stances needed for chemical digestion.

The organs of the digestive system are lined with muscles. The muscles contract, or tighten, to push food through
the system ( Figure 11.34). The muscles contract in waves. The waves pass through the digestive system like waves
through a slinky. This movement of muscle contractions is called peristalsis. Without peristalsis, food would not be
able to move through the digestive system. Peristalsis is an involuntary process, which means that it occurs without
your conscious control.
The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are also organs of the digestive system ( Figure 11.33). Food does not pass
through these three organs. However, these organs are important for digestion. They secrete or store enzymes or
other chemicals that are needed to help digest food chemically.

682

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.34
This diagram shows how muscles push food through the digestive system. Muscle contractions travel through the
system in waves, pushing the food ahead of them. This is called peristalsis.

Mouth, Esophagus, and Stomach

The mouth is the ﬁrst organ that food enters. But digestion may start even before you put the ﬁrst bite of food into
your mouth. Just seeing or smelling food can cause the release of saliva and digestive enzymes in your mouth.
Once you start eating, saliva wets the food, which makes it easier to break up and swallow. Digestive enzymes,
including the enzyme amylase, start breaking down starches into sugars. Your tongue helps mix the food with the
saliva and enzymes.
Your teeth also help digest food. Your front teeth are sharp. They cut and tear food when you bite into it. Your
back teeth are broad and ﬂat. They grind food into smaller pieces when you chew. Chewing is part of mechanical
digestion. Your tongue pushes the food to the back of your mouth so you can swallow it. When you swallow, the
lump of chewed food passes down your throat to your esophagus.
The esophagus is a narrow tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. Food moves through the esophagus
because of peristalsis. At the lower end of the esophagus, a circular muscle controls the opening to the stomach. The
muscle relaxes to let food pass into the stomach. Then the muscle contracts again to prevent food from passing back
into the esophagus.
Some people think that gravity moves food through the esophagus. If that were true, food would move through the
esophagus only when you are sitting or standing upright. In fact, because of peristalsis, food can move through the
esophagus no matter what position you are in—even upside down! Just don’t try to swallow food when you are
upside down—you could choke!
The stomach is a sac-like organ at the end of the esophagus. It has thick muscular walls. The muscles contract and
relax. This moves the food around and helps break it into smaller pieces. Mixing the food around with the enzyme
pepsin and other chemicals helps digest proteins.
Water, salt, and simple sugars can be absorbed into the blood from the stomach. Most other substances are broken
down further in the small intestine before they are absorbed. The stomach stores food until the small intestine is
ready to receive it. A circular muscle controls the opening between the stomach and small intestine. When the small
intestine is empty, the muscle relaxes. This lets food pass from the stomach into the small intestine.

683

11.18. Digestive System Organs

Small Intestine

www.ck12.org

The small intestine a is narrow tube that starts at the stomach and ends at the large intestine ( Figure 11.33). In
adults, the small intestine is about 23 feet long. Chemical digestion takes place in the ﬁrst part of the small intestine.
Many enzymes and other chemicals are secreted here. The small intestine is also where most nutrients are absorbed
into the blood. The later sections of the small intestines are covered with tiny projections called villi ( Figure 11.35).
Villi contain very tiny blood vessels. Nutrients are absorbed into the blood through these tiny vessels. There are
millions of villi, so, altogether, there is a very large area for absorption to take place. In fact, villi make the inner
surface area of the small intestine 1,000 times larger than it would be without them. The entire inner surface area of
the small intestine is about as big as a basketball court!

FIGURE 11.35
This is what the villi
lining the intestine
looks like when magniﬁed. Each one is
actually only about 1 millimeter long. Villi
are just barely visible with the unaided
eye.

The small intestine is much longer than the large intestine. So why is it called “small”? If you compare small and
large intestines ( Figure 11.33), you will see the small intestine is smaller in width than the large intestine.

Large Intestine

The large intestine is a wide tube that connects the small intestine with the anus. In adults, it is about ﬁve feet
long. Waste enters the large intestine from the small intestine in a liquid state. As the waste moves through the large
intestine, excess water is absorbed from it. After the excess water is absorbed, the remaining solid waste is called
feces.
Circular muscles control the anus. They relax to let the feces pass out of the body through the anus. After feces pass
out of the body, they are called stool. Releasing the stool from the body is referred to as a bowel movement.

11.19 Bacteria in the Digestive System

• Explain the roles of helpful bacteria in the digestive system.

Why eat yogurt?
Yogurt is a good source of calcium. Yogurt also contains active cultures of "good" bacteria. Foods that contain these
beneﬁcial bacteria are sometimes called "probiotic."

Bacteria in the Digestive System

Your large intestine is not just made up of cells. It is also an ecosystem, home to trillions of bacteria known as the
"gut ﬂora" ( Figure 11.36). But don’t worry, most of these bacteria are helpful. Friendly bacteria live mostly in
the large intestine and part of the small intestine. The acidic environment of the stomach does not allow bacterial
growth.
Gut bacteria have several roles in the body. For example, intestinal bacteria:

• Produce vitamin B12 and vitamin K.
• Control the growth of harmful bacteria.
• Break down poisons in the large intestine.

686

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

• Break down some substances in food that cannot be digested, such as ﬁber and some starches and sugars.
Bacteria produce enzymes that digest carbohydrates in plant cell walls. Most of the nutritional value of plant
material would be wasted without these bacteria. These help us digest plant foods like spinach.

FIGURE 11.36
Your intestines are home to trillions of
bacteria.

A wide range of friendly bacteria live in the gut. Bacteria begin to populate the human digestive system right after
birth. Gut bacteria include Lactobacillus, the bacteria commonly used in probiotic foods such as yogurt, and E. coli
bacteria. About a third of all bacteria in the gut are members of the Bacteroides species. Bacteroides are key in
helping us digest plant food.
It is estimated that 100 trillion bacteria live in the gut. This is more than the human cells that make up you. It has
also been estimated that there are more bacteria in your mouth than people on the planet. There are over 7 billion
people on the planet.
The bacteria in your digestive system are from anywhere between 300 and 1000 species. As these bacteria are
helpful, your body does not attack them. They actually appear to the body’s immune system as cells of the digestive
system, not foreign invaders. The bacteria actually cover themselves with sugar molecules removed from the actual
cells of the digestive system. This disguises the bacteria and protects them from the immune system.
As the bacteria that live in the human gut are beneﬁcial to us, and as the bacteria enjoy a safe environment to live,
the relationship that we have with these tiny organisms is described as mutualism, a type of symbiotic relationship.
Lastly, keep in mind the small size of bacteria. Together, all the bacteria in your gut may weight just about 2 pounds.

Summary

• Your large intestine is home to trillions of bacteria.
• Bacteria in the large intestine have important roles, such as producing vitamins and controlling the growth of

harmful bacteria.

Have you ever been sick to your stomach?
You may have even had to stay home from school because of a "stomach bug." It is possible that you caught a
contagious illness, or you could have gotten sick from food you had eaten recently. The symptoms are very similar,
so it’s hard to pinpoint the cause.

Most of the time, you probably aren’t aware of your digestive system. It works well without causing any problems.
But most people have problems with their digestive system at least once in a while. Did you ever eat something that
didn’t “agree” with you? Maybe you had a stomachache or felt sick to your stomach? Maybe you had diarrhea?
These could be symptoms of foodborne illness, food allergies, or a food intolerance.

Foodborne Illness

Harmful bacteria can enter your digestive system in food and make you sick. This is called foodborne illness or food
poisoning. The bacteria, or the toxins they produce, may cause vomiting or cramping, in addition to the symptoms
mentioned above. Foodborne illnesses can also be caused by viruses and parasites. The most common foodborne
illnesses happen within a few minutes to a few hours, and make you feel really sick, but last for only about a day or
so. Others can take longer for the illness to appear. Some people believe that the taste of food will tell you if it is
bad. As a rule, you probably should not eat bad tasting food, but many contaminated foods can still taste good.
You can help prevent foodborne illness by following a few simple rules.

• Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. This helps prevent any bacteria in the foods from multiplying.
• Wash your hands before you prepare or eat food. This helps prevent bacteria on your hands from getting on

the food. This is the easiest way to prevent foodborne illnesses.

• Wash your hands after you touch raw foods, such as meats, poultry, ﬁsh, or eggs. These foods often contain

bacteria that your hands could transfer to your mouth.

• Cook meats, poultry, ﬁsh, and eggs thoroughly before eating them. The heat of cooking kills any bacteria the

foods may contain, so they cannot make you sick.

• Refrigerate cooked food soon after a meal. Cooked food can be left out for up to two hours before they need
to be placed in the cold. This will prevent the spread of bacteria. Cooked foods should not be left out all day.

Bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses include Salmonella, a bacterium found in many foods, including raw and
undercooked meat, poultry, dairy products, and seafood. Campylobacter jejuni is found in raw or undercooked
chicken and unpasteurized milk. Several strains of E. coli can cause illnesses, and are found in raw or undercooked
hamburger, unpasteurized fruit juices and milk, and even fresh produce. Vibrio is a bacterium that may contaminate
ﬁsh or shellﬁsh. Listeria has been found in raw and undercooked meats, unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, and ready-
to-eat deli meats and hot dogs. Most of these bacterial illnesses can be prevented with proper cooking of food and
washing of hands.
Common foodborne viruses include norovirus and hepatitis A virus. Norovirus, which causes inﬂammation of the
stomach and intestines, has been a recent issue on cruise ships, infecting hundreds of passengers and crew on certain
voyages. Hepatitis A causes inﬂammation of the liver, which is treated with rest and diet changes. Parasites are tiny
organisms that live inside another organism. Giardia is a parasite spread through water contaminated with the stools
of people or animals who are infected. Food preparers who are infected with parasites can also contaminate food
if they do not thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom and before handling food. Trichinella is a type
of roundworm parasite. People may be infected with this parasite by consuming raw or undercooked pork or wild
game.

Food Allergies

Food allergies are like other allergies. They occur when the immune system reacts to harmless substances as though
they were harmful. Almost ten percent of children have food allergies. Some of the foods most likely to cause
allergies are shown below ( Figure 11.37).

690

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

Eating foods you are allergic to may cause vomiting, diarrhea, or skin rashes. Some people are very allergic to certain
foods. Eating even tiny amounts of the foods causes them to have serious symptoms, such as difﬁculty breathing. If
they eat the foods by accident, they may need emergency medical treatment.

FIGURE 11.37
Some of the foods that commonly cause
allergies are shown here. They include
nuts, eggs, grains, milk, and shellﬁsh. Are
you allergic to any of these foods?

The most common food allergy symptoms include:

• tingling or itching in the mouth
• hives, itching or eczema,
• swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other parts of the body,
• wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing,
• abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting,
• dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting.

In some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Emergency treatment is
critical for anaphylaxis. Untreated, anaphylaxis can cause a coma or death. Anaphylaxis is vary rare. The vast
majority of people will never have an anaphylactic reaction. The life-threatening symptoms of anaphylaxis include:

• constriction and tightening of the airway,
• a swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it difﬁcult to breathe,
• shock, with a severe drop in blood pressure,
• a rapid pulse,
• dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.

Food Intolerance

A food intolerance, or food sensitivity, is different from a food allergy. A food intolerance happens when the
digestive system is unable to break down a certain type of food. This can result in stomach cramping, diarrhea,

691

11.20. Health of the Digestive System

www.ck12.org

tiredness, and weight loss. Food intolerances are often mistakenly called allergies. Lactose intolerance is a food
intolerance. A person who is lactose intolerant does not make enough lactase, the enzyme that breaks down the
milk sugar, lactose. Lactose intolerance may be as high as 75% in some populations, but overall the percentage of
affected individuals is much less. Still, well over 10% of the world’s population is lactose intolerant.

Summary

• Foodborne illness can be prevented by taking precautions during food preparation.
• Food allergies and food intolerance can upset your digestive system.

11.21 Cardiovascular System

• List the components of the cardiovascular system.
• Explain the main function of the cardiovascular system.
• Describe additional functions of the cardiovascular system.

What do you do for "cardio"?
"Cardio" has become slang for aerobic exercise that raises your heart rate for an extended amount of time. Cardio
can include biking, running, or swimming. Can you guess one of the main organs of the cardiovascular system? Yes,
your heart.

Functions of the Cardiovascular System

Your cardiovascular system has many jobs. At times the cardiovascular system can work like a pump, a heating
system, or even a postal carrier. To do these tasks, your cardiovascular system works with other organ systems, such
as the respiratory, endocrine, and nervous systems.
The cardiovascular system ( Figure 11.38) is made up of the heart, the blood vessels, and the blood. It moves nutri-
ents, gases (like oxygen), and wastes to and from your cells. Every cell in your body depends on your cardiovascular
system. If your cells don’t receive nutrients, they cannot survive. The main function of the cardiovascular system
is to deliver oxygen to each of your cells. Blood receives oxygen in your lungs (the main organs of the respiratory
system) and then is pumped, by your heart, throughout your body. The oxygen then diffuses into your cells, and
carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, moves from your cells into your blood to be delivered back
to your lungs and exhaled. Each cell in your body needs oxygen, as oxygen is used in cellular respiration to produce
energy in the form of ATP. Without oxygen, lactic acid fermentation would occur in your cells, which can only be
maintained for a brief period of time. Arteries carry blood full of oxygen ("oxygen-rich") away from the heart and
veins return oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.

693

11.21. Cardiovascular System

www.ck12.org

The cardiovascular system also plays a role in maintaining body temperature. It helps to keep you warm by moving
warm blood around your body. Your blood vessels also control your body temperature to keep you from getting too
hot or too cold. When your brain senses that your body temperature is increasing, it sends messages to the blood
vessels in the skin to increase in diameter. Increasing the diameter of the blood vessels increases the amount of blood
and heat that moves near the skin’s surface. The heat is then released from the skin. This helps you cool down. What
do you think your blood vessels do when your body temperature is decreasing?
The blood also carries hormones, which are chemical messenger molecules produced by organs of the endocrine
system, through your body. Hormones are produced in one area of your body and have an effect on another area.
To get to that other area, they must travel through your blood. An example is the hormone adrenaline, produced by
the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys. Adrenaline has multiple effects on the heart (it quickens the heart rate), on
muscles and on the airway.

ents and other substances throughout the
body.

11.22 Circulation and the Lymphatic System

• List the components of the lymphatic system.
• Describe the functions of the lymphatic system.
• Explain how the cardiovascular and the lymphatic systems work together.

Are your blood vessels leaky?
None of your blood vessels are leaking this badly, or you’d be in the hospital! But your blood vessels do leak a
little bit. Water and solutes pass out of the blood vessels and help form the ﬂuid that bathes your body’s tissues.
Ultimately the ﬂuid that is lost from the blood vessels is returned through the lymphatic system.

The Lymphatic System and Circulation

The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and tissues that carry a clear ﬂuid called lymph. The lymphatic
system ( Figure 11.39) spreads all around the body and ﬁlters and cleans the lymph of any debris, abnormal cells,
or pathogens. Lymph vessels are tube-shaped, just like blood vessels, with about 500-600 lymph nodes (in an
adult) attached. The lymphatic system works with the cardiovascular system to return body ﬂuids to the blood. The
lymphatic system and the cardiovascular system are often called the body’s two "circulatory systems."
Organs of the lymphatic system include the tonsils, thymus gland and spleen. The thymus gland produces T cells
or T-lymphocytes (see below) and the spleen and tonsils help in ﬁghting infections. The spleen’s main function is
to ﬁlter the blood, removing unwanted red blood cells. The spleen also detects viruses and bacteria and triggers the
release of pathogen ﬁghting cells.

11.22. Circulation and the Lymphatic System

www.ck12.org

Role of the Lymphatic System in Circulation

You may think that your blood vessels have thick walls without any leaks, but that’s not true. Blood vessels can leak
just like any other pipe. The lymphatic system makes sure leaked blood returns back to the bloodstream.
When a small amount of ﬂuid leaks out from the blood vessels, it collects in the spaces between cells and tissues.
Some of the ﬂuid returns to the cardiovascular system, and the rest is collected by the lymph vessels of the lymphatic
system ( Figure 11.40). The ﬂuid that collects in the lymph vessels is called lymph. The lymphatic system then
returns the lymph to the cardiovascular system. Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not closed
(meaning it is an open circulatory system that releases and collects ﬂuid) and has no central pump (or heart). Lymph
moves slowly in lymph vessels. It is moved along in the lymph vessels by the squeezing action of smooth muscles
and skeletal muscles.

FIGURE 11.40
Lymph capillaries collect ﬂuid that leaks
out from blood capillaries. The lymphatic
vessels return the ﬂuid to the cardiovas-
cular system.

Role of the Lymphatic System in the Body’s Defenses

The lymphatic system also plays an important role in the immune system. For example, the lymphatic system
makes white blood cells that protect the body from diseases. Cells of the lymphatic system produce two types
of white blood cells, T cells and B cells, that are involved in ﬁghting speciﬁc pathogens. Lymph nodes, which
are scattered throughout the lymphatic system, act as ﬁlters or traps for foreign particles and are important in the
proper functioning of the immune system. The role of the lymphatic system in the immune response is discussed in
additional concepts.

Summary

• The lymphatic system works with the cardiovascular system to return body ﬂuids to the blood.
• The lymph, the clear liquid found in the lymphatic system, is moved along in the lymph vessels by the

squeezing action of smooth muscles and skeletal muscles.

11.23 Heart

• Describe the structure of the heart.
• Explain the function of each heart chamber.
• Summarize how blood moves through the heart.

Where is your heart?
Place your hand on your heart. Did you put your hand on the left side of your chest? Most people do, but the heart
is actually located closer to the center of the chest.

The Heart

What does the heart look like? How does it pump blood? The heart is divided into four chambers ( Figure 11.41), or
spaces: the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles. An atrium (singular for atria) is one of the two small,
thin-walled chambers on the top of the heart where the blood ﬁrst enters. A ventricle is one of the two muscular
V-shaped chambers that pump blood out of the heart. You can remember they are called ventricles because they are
shaped like a "V."
The atria receive the blood, and the ventricles pump the blood out of the heart. Each of the four chambers of the
heart has a speciﬁc job.

• The right atrium receives oxygen-poor blood from the body.

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.41
The atria receive blood and the ventricles
pump blood out of the heart.

• The right ventricle pumps oxygen-poor blood toward the lungs, where it receives oxygen.
• The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs.
• The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood out of the heart to the rest of the body.

Blood Flow Through the Heart

Blood ﬂows through the heart in two separate loops. You can think of them as a “left side loop” and a “right side
loop.” The right side of the heart collects oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it into the lungs, where it
releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. (Recall that carbon dioxide is a waste product that must be removed.
It is removed when we exhale.) The left side carries the oxygen-rich blood back from the lungs into the left side of
the heart, which then pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. The blood delivers oxygen to the cells of
the body, where it is needed for cellular respiration, and returns to the heart oxygen-poor.
To move blood through the heart, the cardiac muscle needs to contract in an organized way. Blood ﬁrst enters the
atria ( Figure 11.42). When the atria contract, blood is pushed into the ventricles. After the ventricles ﬁll with blood,
they contract, and blood is pushed out of the heart. The heart is mainly composed of cardiac muscle. These muscle
cells contract in unison, causing the heart itself to contract and generating enough force to push the blood out.
So how is the blood kept from ﬂowing back on itself? Valves ( Figure 11.42) in the heart keep the blood ﬂowing in
one direction. The valves do this by opening and closing in one direction only. Blood only moves forward through
the heart. The valves stop the blood from ﬂowing backward. There are four valves of the heart.

• The two atrioventricular (AV) valves stop blood from moving from the ventricles to the atria.
• The two semilunar (SL) valves are found in the arteries leaving the heart, and they prevent blood from ﬂowing

back from the arteries into the ventricles.

Why does a heart beat? The “lub-dub” sound of the heartbeat is caused by the closing of the AV valves ("lub") and
SL valves ("dub") after blood has passed through them.

push blood around the body.

Summary

• Blood enters the heart at the atria and then ﬂows into the ventricles, which contract and push blood around the

body.

• Valves in the heart keep the blood ﬂowing in one direction.

Why are these arteries so important?
The major arteries of the neck are shown here in red. The heart pumps oxygen-rich blood through these arteries to
the brain. Without oxygen, the brain cannot survive longer than just a few minutes. So these arteries in the neck are
very important.

Blood Vessels and Blood Circulation

The blood vessels are an important part of the cardiovascular system. They connect the heart to every cell in the
body. Arteries carry blood away from the heart, while veins return blood to the heart ( Figure 11.43).

Important Arteries and Veins

There are speciﬁc veins and arteries that are more signiﬁcant than others. The pulmonary arteries carry oxygen-
poor blood away from the heart to the lungs. These are the only arteries that carry oxygen-poor blood. The aorta is
the largest artery in the body. It carries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart.
Further away from the heart, the aorta branches into smaller arteries, which eventually branch into capillaries.
Capillaries are the smallest type of blood vessel; they connect very small arteries and veins. Gases and other
substances are exchanged between cells and the blood across the very thin walls of capillaries.
The veins that return oxygen-poor blood to the heart are the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava. The
pulmonary veins return oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart. The pulmonary veins are the only veins that
carry oxygen-rich blood.

Pulmonary Circulation

Pulmonary circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system that carries oxygen-poor blood away from the heart
and brings it to the lungs. Oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart from the body and leaves the right ventricle
through the pulmonary arteries, which carry the blood to each lung. Once at the lungs, the red blood cells release
carbon dioxide and pick up oxygen when you breathe. The oxygen-rich blood then leaves the lungs through the
pulmonary veins, which return it to the left side of the heart. This completes the pulmonary cycle. The oxygenated
blood is then pumped to the body through systemic circulation, before returning again to pulmonary circulation.

Systemic Circulation

Chapter 11. Human Biology

Systemic circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system that carries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart,
to the body, and returns oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. Oxygen-rich blood leaves the left ventricle through
the aorta. Then it travels to the body’s organs and tissues. The tissues and organs absorb the oxygen through the
capillaries. Oxygen-poor blood is collected from the tissues and organs by tiny veins, which then ﬂow into bigger
veins, and, eventually, into the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava. This completes systemic circulation.
The blood releases carbon dioxide and gets more oxygen in pulmonary circulation before returning to systemic
circulation. The inferior vena cava returns blood from the body. The superior vena cava returns blood from the head.

Summary

• Arteries carry blood away from the heart, while veins return blood to the heart.
• Pulmonary circulation carries blood between the heart and lungs, while systemic circulation carries blood

between the heart and body.

11.25 Components of Blood

• List the components of the blood.
• Describe the main roles of red blood cells and white blood cells.
• List the types of white blood cells and explain their functions.
• Summarize the importance of platelets.

What’s in your blood?
These bags of blood will be stored until they are needed for a transfusion. But what exactly is blood? What makes
up the blood? Most of your blood is water. However, there are also many other important components of your blood.

Components of Blood

Did you know that blood is a tissue? Blood is a ﬂuid connective tissue that is made up of red blood cells, white blood
cells, platelets, and plasma. The cells that make up blood are pictured below ( Figure 11.44). The different parts of
blood have different roles.

707

11.25. Components of Blood

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 11.44
A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of human blood cells. Red
blood cells are the ﬂat, bowl-shaped cells, the tiny disc-shaped pieces are
platelets, and white blood cells are the round cells shown in the center.

Plasma

If you were to ﬁlter out all the cells in blood, a golden-yellow liquid would be left behind. Plasma is this ﬂuid part
of the blood. Plasma is about 90% water and about 10% dissolved proteins, glucose, ions, hormones, and gases.
Blood is made up mostly of plasma.

Red Blood Cells

Red blood cells (RBCs) are ﬂattened, disk-shaped cells that carry oxygen. They are the most common blood cell
in the blood. There are about 4 to 6 million RBCs per cubic millimeter of blood. Each RBC has about 200 million
molecules of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen. Hemoglobin also gives the red blood cells
their red color.
Red blood cells ( Figure 11.45) are made in the red marrow of long bones, rib bones, the skull, and vertebrae. Each
red blood cell lives for only 120 days (about four months). After this time, they are destroyed in the liver and spleen.
Mature red blood cells do not have a nucleus or other organelles. Lacking these components allows the cells to have
more hemoglobin and carry more oxygen.

FIGURE 11.45
The ﬂattened shape of red blood cells helps them carry more oxygen than
if they were rounded.

White Blood Cells

White blood cells (WBCs) are usually larger than red blood cells. They do not have hemoglobin and do not carry

708

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

oxygen. White blood cells make up less than one percent of the blood’s volume. Most WBCs are made in the bone
marrow, and some mature in the lymphatic system. There are different WBCs with different jobs. WBCs defend the
body against infection by bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. WBCs do have a nucleus and other organelles.

• Neutrophils are WBCs that can squeeze through capillary walls and swallow particles such as bacteria and

parasites.

• Macrophages are large WBCs that can also swallow and destroy old and dying cells, bacteria, or viruses.
Below, a macrophage is attacking and swallowing two particles, possibly disease-causing pathogens ( Figure
11.46). Macrophages also release chemical messages that cause the number of WBCs to increase.

• Lymphocytes are WBCs that ﬁght infections caused by viruses and bacteria. Some lymphocytes attack and

kill cancer cells. Lymphocytes called B-cells make antibodies.

FIGURE 11.46
A type of white blood cell, called a
macrophage, is attacking a cancer cell.

Platelets

Platelets ( Figure 11.47) are very small, but they are very important in blood clotting. Platelets are not cells. They
are sticky little pieces of larger cells. Platelets bud off large cells that stay in the bone marrow. When a blood vessel
gets cut, platelets stick to the injured areas. They release chemicals called clotting factors, which cause proteins to
form over the wound. This web of proteins catches red blood cells and forms a clot. This clot stops more blood from
leaving the body through the cut blood vessel. The clot also stops bacteria from entering the body. Platelets survive
in the blood for ten days before they are removed by the liver and spleen.

Summary

• Plasma, the ﬂuid part of the blood, is mostly made up of water but also contains dissolved proteins, glucose,

ions, hormones, and gases.

• Red blood cells carry oxygen, while white blood cells defend the body against infection by bacteria, viruses,

and other diseases.

11.26 Blood Types

• List blood types in humans.
• Describe how blood type is determined.
• Explain universal donors and universal recipients.

What’s your type?
As this woman donates blood, you can see her blood collecting in a special bag. This bag is coded with her blood
type. That makes it possible for doctors and nurses to match up the blood she is giving to a recipient that has the
same blood type.

Blood Types

Do you know what your blood type is? Maybe you have heard people say that they have type A or type O blood.
Blood type is a way to describe the type of antigens, or proteins, on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). There
are four blood types; A, B, AB, and O.

711

11.26. Blood Types

www.ck12.org

1. Type A blood has type A antigens on the RBCs in the blood.
2. Type AB blood has A and B antigens on the RBCs.
3. Type B has B antigens on the RBCs.
4. Type O does not have either A or B antigens.

The ABO blood group system is important if a person needs a blood transfusion. A blood transfusion is the process
of putting blood or blood products from one person into the circulatory system of another person. The blood type
of the recipient needs to be carefully matched to the blood type of the donor. That’s because different blood types
have different types of antibodies, or proteins, released by the blood cells. Antibodies attack strange substances in
the body. This is a normal part of your immune response, which is your defense against disease.
For example, imagine a person with type O blood was given type A blood. First, what type of antibodies do people
with type O blood produce? They produce anti-A and anti-B antibodies. This means, if a person with type O blood
received type A blood, the anti-A antibodies in the person’s blood would attack the A antigens on the RBCs in the
donor blood ( Figure 11.48). The antibodies would cause the RBCs to clump together, and the clumps could block
a blood vessel. This clumping of blood cells could cause death.

FIGURE 11.48
A person with type O blood has A and B
antibodies in his/her plasma; if the person
was to get type A blood instead of type O,
his/her A antibodies would attach to the
antigens on the RBCs and cause them to
clump together.

People with type A blood produce anti-B antibodies, and people with type B blood produce anti-A antibodies. People
with type AB blood do not produce either antibody.

The Rhesus Factor

The second most important blood group system in human blood is the Rhesus (Rh) factor. A person either has, or
does not have, the Rh antigen on the surface of their RBCs. If they do have it, then the person is positive. If the
person does not have the antigen, they are considered negative.

Blood Donors

Recall that people with type O blood do not have any antigens on their RBCs. As a result, type O blood can be given
to people with blood types A, B, or AB. If there are no antigens on the RBCs, there cannot be an antibody reaction
in the blood. People with type O blood are often called universal donors.
The blood plasma of AB blood does not contain any anti-A or anti-B antibodies. People with type AB blood can
receive any ABO blood type. People with type AB blood are called universal recipients because they can receive
any blood type. The antigens and antibodies that deﬁne blood type are listed as follows ( Table 11.4).

11.27 Blood Diseases

• Describe diseases of the blood.
• Describe causes of anemia.
• Explain sickle-cell anemia and hemophilia.
• Deﬁne leukemia.

What do these foods have in common?
Red meat, legumes, and spinach are all good sources of iron. Getting enough iron in your diet is important to prevent
anemia. Anemia is a blood disease that causes you to feel weak and tired. Although anemia is caused by a nutrient
deﬁciency, other blood diseases are genetic diseases, or forms of cancer.

Blood Diseases

Problems can occur with red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and other parts of the blood. Many blood
disorders are genetic, meaning they are inherited from a parent. Some blood diseases are caused by not getting
enough of a certain nutrient, while others are cancers of the blood.

Anemia

Anemia is a disease that occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin in the blood to carry oxygen to body cells.
Hemoglobin is the blood protein that normally carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Anemia leads to a lack
of oxygen in organs.
Anemia is usually caused by one of the following:

• A loss of blood from a bleeding wound or a slow leak of blood.
• The destruction of red blood cells.
• A lack of red blood cell production.

Anemia may not have any symptoms. Some people with anemia feel weak or tired in general or during exercise.
They also may have poor concentration. People with more severe anemia often get short of breath during times

Chapter 11. Human Biology

of activity. Iron-deﬁciency anemia is the most common type of anemia. It occurs when the body does not receive
enough iron. Since there is not enough iron, hemoglobin, which needs iron to bind oxygen, cannot function properly.
In the United States, 20% of all women of childbearing age have iron-deﬁciency anemia, compared with only 2% of
adult men. The most common cause of iron-deﬁciency anemia in young women is blood lost during menstruation.
Iron deﬁciency anemia can be avoided by getting the recommended amount of iron in one’s diet. Anemia is often
treated or prevented by taking iron supplements.
Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18
should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant
women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellﬁsh, such as clams and oysters. Red
meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes.
Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortiﬁcation. Some good sources of iron are listed
below ( Table 11.5). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body
can absorb.

Sickle-Cell Anemia

Sickle-cell anemia is a blood disease that is caused by an abnormally shaped hemoglobin protein in red blood cells.
Many of the red blood cells of a person with sickle-cell anemia are long and curved (sickle-shaped) ( Figure 11.49).
The long, sickle shape of the cells can cause them to get stuck in narrow blood vessels. This clotting means that
oxygen cannot reach the cells. People with sickle-cell anemia are most often well but can occasionally have painful
attacks. The disease is not curable, but it can be treated with medicines.

FIGURE 11.49
The red blood cells of a person with
sickle-cell anemia (left) are long and
pointed, rather than straight, like normal
cells (right). The abnormal cells cannot
carry oxygen properly and can get stuck
in capillaries.

11.27. Blood Diseases

Blood Cancer

www.ck12.org

Blood cancers affect the production and function of your blood cells. Most of these cancers start in your bone marrow
where blood is produced. In most blood cancers, the normal production of blood cells is replaced by uncontrolled
growth of an abnormal type of blood cell. These abnormal blood cells are cancerous cells, and prevent your blood
from performing many of its functions, like ﬁghting off infections or preventing serious bleeding. Leukemia is a
cancer of the blood or bone marrow. It is characterized by an abnormal production of blood cells, usually white
blood cells. Lymphoma is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. There are many types of
lymphoma.

Hemophilia

Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body’s ability to control blood clotting.
Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets.
Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of
internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal
families of Europe.

11.28 Blood Pressure

• Deﬁne blood pressure.
• List healthy blood pressure ranges.
• Describe the effects of hypertension.

Why check your blood pressure?
It’s a good idea to have a blood pressure test as part of a routine physical, especially in adulthood. High blood
pressure is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. It’s important to know if you have high blood pressure, so it can
be treated. A combination of medications and lifestyle changes can be successful in lowering your blood pressure.

Blood Pressure

The health of your whole body depends on the good health of your cardiovascular system. One measure of the health
of your cardiovascular system is blood pressure. Blood pressure occurs when circulating blood puts pressure on
the walls of blood vessels. Since blood pressure is primarily caused by the beating of your heart, the walls of the
arteries move in a rhythmic fashion. Blood in arteries is under the greatest amount of pressure. The pressure of the
circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries and into the smaller blood vessels. Blood in
veins is not under much pressure.

Healthy Blood Pressure Ranges

Blood pressure is read as two numbers. The ﬁrst number is the systolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the pressure
on the blood vessels when the heart beats. This is the time when there is the highest pressure in the arteries. The
diastolic pressure, which is the second number, is when your blood pressure is lowest, when the heart is resting
between beats.

717

11.28. Blood Pressure

Healthy ranges for blood pressure are:

• Systolic: less than 120
• Diastolic: less than 80

www.ck12.org

Blood pressure is written as systolic/diastolic. For example, a reading of 120/80 is said as "one twenty over eighty."
These measures of blood pressure can change with each heartbeat and over the course of the day. Pressure varies
with exercise, emotions, sleep, stress, nutrition, drugs, or disease.
Studies have shown that people whose systolic pressure is around 115, rather than 120, have fewer health problems.
Clinical trials have shown that people who have blood pressures at the low end of these ranges have much better
long term cardiovascular health. Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer ( Figure 11.50).

FIGURE 11.50
A digital sphygmomanometer is made of
an inﬂatable cuff and a pressure meter
to measure blood pressure. This reading
shows a blood pressure of 126/70.

Hypertension, which is also called "high blood pressure," occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high.
Hypertension is said to be present when a person’s systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the
person’s diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for
developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension
often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this
reason, hypertension is often called the "silent killer." Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and
medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate.
Some health conditions, as well as a person’s lifestyle and genetic background, can put someone at a higher risk
for developing high blood pressure. As a person cannot alter their genetic background, lifestyle changes may be
necessary to reduce the chance of developing high blood pressure. These changes include getting enough exercise,
limiting the amount of sodium (salt) in the diet, not being overweight, not drinking alcohol to excess, and not
smoking.
Low blood pressure is not usually a concern, as long as there are no problems associated with the low pressure.
Symptoms associated with low blood pressure include dizziness or lightheadedness, fainting, dehydration and
unusual thirst, lack of concentration, blurred vision, nausea, and fatigue.

11.29 Cardiovascular Diseases

• Describe the various types of cardiovascular disease.
• Deﬁne cardiovascular disease.
• Summarize the relationship between plaque, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease.
• Describe when a heart attack or stroke may occur.

How do you "ﬁx" arteries?
When a blood vessel gets clogged, there is no medical equivalent of "Drano" that will clear it out. There is, however,
a procedure known as angioplasty. A thin tube with a balloon is threaded through the blood vessels. Once in place,
the balloon is inﬂated to compress the clog against the artery wall.

Cardiovascular Diseases

A cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease that affects the cardiovascular system. But the term is usually used
to describe diseases that are linked to atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis ( Figure 11.51) is an inﬂammation of the walls of arteries that causes swelling and a buildup of
material called plaque. Plaque is made of cell pieces, fatty substances, calcium, and connective tissue that builds up
around the area of inﬂammation. As a plaque grows, it stiffens and narrows the artery, which decreases the ﬂow of
blood through the artery.
Atherosclerosis normally begins in late childhood and is typically found in most major arteries. It does not usually
have any early symptoms. Causes of atherosclerosis include a high-fat diet, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and
diabetes. Atherosclerosis becomes a threat to health when the plaque buildup prevents blood circulation in the heart
or the brain. A blocked blood vessel in the heart can cause a heart attack. Blockage of the circulation in the brain
can cause a stroke.
Ways to prevent atherosclerosis include eating healthy foods, getting plenty of exercise and not smoking. These
three factors are not as hard to control as you may think. If you smoke, STOP. Start a regular exercise program and
watch what you eat.

720

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.51
Atherosclerosis is sometimes referred to
as hardening of the arteries; plaque build-
up decreases the blood ﬂow through the
artery.

A diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels, which makes more plaque available to
line artery walls and narrow your arteries. Cholesterol and saturated fats are found mostly in animal products such
as meat, eggs, milk, and other dairy products. Check food labels to ﬁnd the amount of saturated fat in a product.
Also, avoid large amounts of salt and sugar. Be careful with processed foods, such as frozen dinners, as they can be
high in fat, sugar, salt and cholesterol. Eat lots of fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, smaller portions of lean meats
and ﬁsh, and whole grains such as oats and whole wheat. Limit saturated fats like butter, instead choose unsaturated
vegetable oils such as canola oil.

Coronary Heart Disease

Like any other muscle, your heart needs oxygen. Hearts have arteries that provide oxygen through the blood. They
are known as coronary arteries. Coronary heart disease is the end result of the buildup of plaque within the walls
of the coronary arteries.
Coronary heart disease often does not have any symptoms. A symptom of coronary heart disease is chest pain.
Occasional chest pain can happen during times of stress or physical activity. The pain of angina means the heart
muscle ﬁbers need more oxygen than they are getting. Most people with coronary heart disease often have no
symptoms for many years until they have a heart attack.
A heart attack happens when the blood cannot reach the heart because a blood vessel is blocked. If cardiac muscle
is starved of oxygen for more than roughly ﬁve minutes, it will die. Cardiac muscle cells cannot be replaced, so once
they die, they are dead forever. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death of adults in the United States.
The image below shows the way in which a blocked coronary artery can cause a heart attack and cause part of the
heart muscle to die ( Figure 11.52). Maybe one day stem cells will be used to replace dead cardiac muscle cells.

Stroke

Atherosclerosis in the arteries of the brain can also lead to a stroke. A stroke is a loss of brain function due to a
blockage of the blood supply to the brain. Risk factors for stroke include old age, high blood pressure, having a
previous stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, and smoking. The best way to reduce the risk of stroke is to have low
blood pressure.

FIGURE 11.52

oxygen from getting to part of the heart
muscle, so areas of the heart that depend

are starved of oxygen.

Summary

• Atherosclerosis is a condition in which the inside of arteries become clogged with plaque, a deposit of fatty

material.

• Atherosclerosis can be dangerous when it prevents blood circulation to the heart or the brain, causing a heart

attack or stroke.

Why is smoking bad for you?
Most people associate smoking with lung disease. But that is not the only health risk of smoking. Smoking is also a
major cause of cardiovascular disease.

Keeping Your Cardiovascular System Healthy

There are many risk factors that can cause a person to develop cardiovascular disease. A risk factor is anything that
is linked to an increased chance of developing a disease. Some of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease you
cannot control, but there are many risk factors you can control.
Risk factors you cannot control include:

• Age: The older a person is, the greater their chance of developing a cardiovascular disease.
• Gender: Men under age 64 are much more likely to die of coronary heart disease than women, although the

gender difference decreases with age.

• Genetics: Family history of cardiovascular disease increases a person’s chance of developing heart disease.

Risk factors you can control include many lifestyle factors:

• Tobacco smoking: Giving up smoking or never starting to smoke is the best way to reduce the risk of heart

disease.

723

11.30. Cardiovascular System Health

• Diabetes: Diabetes can cause bodily changes, such as high cholesterol levels, which are are risk factors for

cardiovascular disease.

• High cholesterol levels: High amounts of "bad cholesterol," increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.
• Obesity: Having a very high percentage of body fat, especially if the fat is mostly found in the upper body,

rather than the hips and thighs, increases risk signiﬁcantly.

• High blood pressure: If the heart and blood vessels have to work harder than normal, this puts the cardiovas-

cular system under a strain.

• Lack of physical activity: Aerobic activities, such as the one pictured below ( Figure 11.53), help keep your
heart healthy. To reduce the risk of disease, you should be active for at least 60 minutes a day, ﬁve days a
week.

• Poor eating habits: Eating mostly foods that do not have many nutrients other than fat or carbohydrate leads

to high cholesterol levels, obesity, and cardiovascular disease ( Figure 11.54).

FIGURE 11.53
60 minutes a day of vigorous aerobic
activity, such as basketball,
is enough
to help keep your cardiovascular system
healthy.

What is bad cholesterol?

Cholesterol can’t dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins.
Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as "bad" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good
cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the
arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis.

724

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.54
The USDA’s MyPyramid recommends
that you limit the amount of such foods in
your diet to occasional treats.

If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you
eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol
should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.

Summary

• A family history of cardiovascular disease increases a person’s chance of developing heart disease.
• Having a poor diet and not getting enough exercise are two major causes of cardiovascular disease.

11.31 Respiration

• Describe how breathing works.
• Deﬁne respiration, inhalation, and exhalation.
• Summarize how the lungs allow air in, and how inhaled oxygen enters the bloodstream.

Why do you breathe?
We breathe because we need oxygen. Breathing also releases carbon dioxide from our bodies into the air. The
respiratory system is the body system that brings air containing oxygen into the body and releases carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere. Recall that oxygen is needed to make ATP.

How We Breathe

Most of the time, you breathe without thinking about it. Breathing is mostly an involuntary action that is controlled
by a part of your brain that also controls your heart beat. If you swim, do yoga, or sing, you know you can control
your breathing, however. Taking air into the body through the nose and mouth is called inhalation. Pushing air
out of the body through the nose or mouth is called exhalation. The woman pictured below is exhaling before she
surfaces from the pool water ( Figure 11.55).

727

11.31. Respiration

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 11.55
Being able to control breathing is impor-
tant for many activities, such as swim-
ming. The woman in the photograph is
exhaling as she exits the water.

How do lungs allow air in? Air moves into and out of the lungs by the movement of muscles. The most important
muscle in the process of breathing is the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle that spreads across the bottom of the rib
cage. The diaphragm and rib muscles contract and relax to move air into and out of the lungs. During inhalation,
the diaphragm contracts and moves downward. The rib muscles contract and cause the ribs to move outward. This
causes the chest volume to increase. Because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than
the air pressure outside. This difference in air pressures causes air to be sucked into the lungs. When the diaphragm
and rib muscles relax, air is pushed out of the lungs. Exhalation is similar to letting the air out of a balloon.
How does the inhaled oxygen get into the bloodstream? The exchange of gasses between the lungs and the blood
happens in tiny sacs called alveoli. The walls of the alveoli are very thin and allow gases to pass though them. The
alveoli are lined with capillaries ( Figure 11.56). Oxygen moves from the alveoli to the blood in the capillaries
that surround the alveoli. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves in the opposite direction, from capillary blood
to the alveoli. The gases move by simple diffusion, passing from an area of high concentration to an area of low
concentration. For example, initially there is more oxygen in the alveoli than in the blood, so oxygen moves by
diffusion from the alveoli into the blood.

Breathing and Respiration

The process of getting oxygen into the body and releasing carbon dioxide is called respiration. Sometimes breathing
is called respiration, but there is much more to respiration than just breathing. Breathing is only the movement of
oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide out of the body. The process of respiration also includes the exchange of
oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the cells of the body.

Summary

• The diaphragm and rib muscles contract when you inhale and relax when you exhale.
• The process of getting oxygen into the body and releasing carbon dioxide is called respiration.

11.32 Respiratory System Organs

• Identify the organs of the respiratory system.
• Summarize the functions of the larynx, pharynx, and trachea.
• Describe the importance of the alveoli.
• Explain the structure and function of the diaphragm.

What are the organs that help you breathe?
When you think of the processes of breathing, the lungs probably come to mind. The lungs are the main organ of
the respiratory system. However, many other organs are also needed for the process of respiration to take place.

Organs of The Respiratory System

Your respiratory system is made up of the tissues and organs that allow oxygen to enter your body and carbon dioxide
to leave your body. Organs in your respiratory system include your:

• Nose.
• Mouth.
• Larynx.
• Pharynx.
• Lungs.

730

www.ck12.org

• Diaphragm.

These structures are shown below ( Figure 11.57).

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.57
The organs of
move air into and out of the body.

the respiratory system

What do you think is the purpose of each of these organs?

• The nose and the nasal cavity ﬁlter, warm, and moisten the air you breathe. The nose hairs and the mucus

produced by the cells in the nose catch particles in the air and keep them from entering the lungs.

• Behind the nasal cavity, air passes through the pharynx, a long tube. Both food and air pass through the

pharynx.

• The larynx, also called the "voice box," is found just below the pharynx. Your voice comes from your larynx.

Air from the lungs passes across thin tissues in the larynx and produces sound.

• The trachea, or windpipe, is a long tube that leads down to the lungs, where it divides into the right and
left bronchi. The bronchi branch out into smaller bronchioles in each lung. There is small ﬂap called the
epiglottis that covers your trachea when you eat or drink. The muscle controlling the epiglottis is involuntary
and prevents food from entering your lungs or wind pipe.

• The bronchioles lead to the alveoli. Alveoli are the little sacs at the end of the bronchioles ( Figure 11.58).
They look like little bunches of grapes. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide in the alveoli. That means
oxygen enters the blood, and carbon dioxide moves out of the blood. The gases are exchanged between the
blood and alveoli by simple diffusion.

• The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle that spreads across the bottom of the rib cage. When the diaphragm
contracts, the chest volume gets larger, and the lungs take in air. When the diaphragm relaxes, the chest
volume gets smaller, and air is pushed out of the lungs.

11.33 Processes of Breathing

• Describe the journey of oxygen through the body.
• Outline how the respiratory system and the cardiovascular system work together.
• Explain the importance of oxygen to each cell of the body.

Where does oxygen go in your body?
Once you take in a breath of air, the oxygen doesn’t just stay there in your lungs. It has a lot of traveling to do!
Oxygen has to reach each one of your cells. How do you think the oxygen is moved?

The Journey of a Breath of Air

Breathing is only part of the process of bringing oxygen to where it is needed in the body. After oxygen enters the
lungs, what happens?

1. The oxygen enters the bloodstream from the alveoli, tiny sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place (

Figure 11.59). The transfer of oxygen into the blood is through simple diffusion.

2. The oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart.
3. Oxygen-rich blood is then pumped through the aorta, the large artery that receives blood directly from the

heart.

4. From the aorta, oxygen-rich blood travels to the smaller arteries and, ﬁnally, to the capillaries, the smallest

type of blood vessel.

5. The oxygen molecules move, by diffusion, out of the capillaries and into the body cells.
6. While oxygen moves from the capillaries and into body cells, carbon dioxide moves from the cells into the

capillaries.

733

11.33. Processes of Breathing

www.ck12.org

7. Carbon dioxide is brought, through the blood, back to the heart and then to the lungs. Then it is released into

the air during exhalation.

FIGURE 11.59
Gas exchange is the movement of oxygen
into the blood and carbon dioxide out of
the blood.

Why is oxygen needed by each cell in your body? To make ATP, the usable form of cellular energy. Oxygen is
needed in the ﬁnal stage of cellular respiration, which is the process of converting glucose into ATP. This process is
much more efﬁcient in the presence of oxygen. Without oxygen, much less ATP is produced. As ATP is needed for
the cells to function properly, every cell in your body needs oxygen. Getting that oxygen begins with inhaling. The
oxygen moves into your blood, where it travels to every cell in your body.

Summary

• Oxygen enters the lungs, then passes through the alveoli and into the blood. The oxygen is carried around the

body in blood vessels.

• Carbon dioxide moves into the blood capillaries and is brought to the lungs to be released into the air during

exhalation.

• List causes of asthma and pneumonia.
• Summarize facts about lung cancer and emphysema.

What’s this boy doing?
This inhaler can help ease the symptoms of asthma. This girl may have felt an asthma attack coming on. Tightness
in the chest and difﬁculty breathing are common signs of an asthma attack. She is fortunate that asthma can usually
be controlled with medicine.

Diseases of the Respiratory System

Respiratory diseases are diseases of the lungs, bronchial tubes, trachea, nose, and throat ( Figure 11.60). These
diseases can range from a mild cold to a severe case of pneumonia. Respiratory diseases are common. Many are
easily treated, while others may cause severe illness or death. Some respiratory diseases are caused by bacteria or
viruses, while others are caused by environmental pollutants, such as tobacco smoke. Some diseases are genetic and,
therefore, are inherited.

FIGURE 11.60
This boy is suffering from whooping cough (also known as pertussis),
which gets its name from the loud whooping sound that is made when
the person inhales during a coughing ﬁt.

Bronchitis

Bronchitis is an inﬂammation of the bronchi, the air passages that conduct air into the lungs. The bronchi become
red and swollen with infection. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses or bacteria, and may last several days
or weeks. It is characterized by a cough that produces phlegm, or mucus. Symptoms include shortness of breath and
wheezing. Acute bronchitis is usually treated with antibiotics.

Asthma

Asthma is a chronic illness in which the bronchioles, the tiny branches into which the bronchi are divided, become
inﬂamed and narrow ( Figure 11.61). The muscles around the bronchioles contract, which narrows the airways.
Large amounts of mucus are also made by the cells in the lungs. People with asthma have difﬁculty breathing. Their
chests feel tight, and they wheeze. Asthma can be caused by different things, such as allergies. Asthma can also be
caused by cold air, warm air, moist air, exercise, or stress. The most common asthma triggers are illnesses, like the
common cold. Asthma is not contagious and cannot be passed on to other people. Children and adolescents who
have asthma can still lead active lives if they control their asthma. Asthma can be controlled by taking medication
and by avoiding contact with environmental triggers for asthma, like smoking.

Pneumonia

Pneumonia is an illness that occurs when the alveoli, the tiny sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place,
become inﬂamed and ﬁlled with ﬂuid. When a person has pneumonia, gas exchange cannot occur properly across
the alveoli. Pneumonia can be caused by many things. Infection by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites can cause
pneumonia. An injury caused by chemicals or a physical injury to the lungs can also cause pneumonia. Symptoms of
pneumonia include cough, chest pain, fever, and difﬁculty breathing. Treatment depends on the cause of pneumonia.
Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics.
Pneumonia is a common illness that affects people in all age groups. It is a leading cause of death among the elderly
and people who are chronically and terminally ill.

Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis (TB) is a common and often deadly disease caused by a genus of bacterium called Mycobacterium.
Tuberculosis most commonly attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. TB is a chronic disease,
but most people who become infected do not develop the full disease. Symptoms include a cough, which usually
contains mucus and coughing up blood.
The TB bacteria are spread in the air when people who have the disease cough, sneeze, or spit, so it is very
contagious. To help prevent the spread of the disease, public health notices, such as the one pictured below (
Figure 11.62), remind people how to stop the spread of the disease.

Lung Cancer

Chapter 11. Human Biology

Lung cancer is a disease in which the cells found in the lungs grow out of control. The growing mass of cells can
form a tumor that pushes into nearby tissues. The tumor will affect how these tissues work. Lung cancer is the
most common cause of cancer-related death in men, and the second most common in women. It is responsible for
1.3 million deaths worldwide every year ( Figure 11.63). The most common symptoms are shortness of breath,
coughing (including coughing up blood), and weight loss. The most common cause of lung cancer is exposure to
tobacco smoke.

FIGURE 11.63
The inside of a lung showing cancerous tissue.

Emphysema

Emphysema is a chronic lung disease caused by the breakdown of the lung tissue. Symptoms of emphysema include
shortness of breath, especially during exercise, and chronic cough, usually due to cigarette smoking, and wheezing,
especially during expiration. Damage to the alveoli ( Figure 11.64), is not curable. Smoking is the leading cause of
emphysema.

Causes of Respiratory Diseases

Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another
organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and ﬂu are
caused by viruses. The inﬂuenza virus that causes the ﬂu is pictured below ( Figure 11.65). Tuberculosis, whooping
cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, ﬂu, and TB can be passed from
person to person by coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics.
Those caused by viruses cannot.
Pollution is another common cause of respiratory disease. The quality of the air you breathe can affect the health of
your lungs. Asthma, heart and lung diseases, allergies, and several types of cancers are all linked to air quality. Air
pollution is not just found outdoors; indoor air pollution can also be responsible for health problems.
Smoking is the major cause of chronic respiratory disease as well as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Exposure
to tobacco smoke by smoking or by breathing air that contains tobacco smoke is the leading cause of preventable
death in the United States. Regular smokers die about 10 years earlier than nonsmokers do. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) describes tobacco use as "the single most important preventable risk to human health

in developed countries and an important cause of [early] death worldwide." Simply stated: Stopping smoking can
prevent many respiratory diseases.

Summary

• Common diseases and conditions affecting the respiratory system include asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer,

tuberculosis, and emphysema.

• Pollution, smoking, and pathogens can also contribute to diseases of the respiratory system.

• Identify what you can do to keep your respiratory system healthy.

Why sneeze into your elbow?
Sneezing into your elbow can help stop the spread of a respiratory illness, like the ﬂu or common cold. If you sneeze
into your hands, you may then spread germs when you touch a doorknob or other surfaces.

Keeping Your Respiratory System Healthy

We know that many respiratory illnesses are caused by bacteria or viruses. There are steps you can take to help
the spread of these pathogens, and also to prevent you from catching one. Furthermore, many respiratory illnesses
are caused by poor habits, such as smoking. Many of the diseases related to smoking are called lifestyle diseases.
Lifestyle diseases are diseases that are caused by choices that people make in their daily lives. For example, the
choice to smoke can lead to emphysema, cancer and heart disease in later life. But you can make healthy choices
instead. There are many things you can do to keep yourself healthy.

Avoid Smoking

Cigarette smoking can cause serious diseases, so not smoking or quitting now are the most effective ways to reduce
your risk of developing chronic respiratory diseases, such as lung cancer. Avoiding (or stopping) smoking is the

Eat Well, Exercise Regularly, and Get Rest

Eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep, and being active every day can help keep your respiratory system,
cardiovascular system and immune system strong. Getting enough exercise makes your lungs stronger and better at
giving your body the oxygen it needs. It also helps to boost your body ﬁght germs that could make you sick. These
can also, of course, keep your skeletal and muscular systems strong.

Wash Your Hands

Washing your hands often, especially after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose, helps to protect you and others
from diseases. Washing your hands for 20 seconds with soap and warm water can help prevent colds and ﬂu. In one
respect, you can think of hand washing as a survival skill. Some viruses and bacteria can live from 20 minutes to
two hours or more on surfaces like cafeteria tables, doorknobs, and desks. Washing your hands often can remove
many of these pathogens. Never touch your mouth, nose, or eyes without washing your hands.

Avoid Contact with Others When Sick

Do not go to school or to other public places when you are sick. You risk spreading your illness to other people. You
may also get even sicker if you catch something else. Do not share food and other things that go in the mouth, as
in guzzling milk from the carton or double dipping chips. You never know what pathogens can be lurking around.
Cover your mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and to dispose of the tissue yourself. No time to grab a
tissue. Cough or sneeze into the inside of your elbow instead of your hands.

Visit Your Doctor

Getting the recommended vaccinations can help prevent diseases, such as whooping cough and ﬂu. In fact, a yearly
ﬂu vaccine is recommended for everyone who is at least 6 months of age. The ﬂu vaccine is especially important
for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications (like pneumonia) if they get sick with the ﬂu.
People who have certain medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, pregnant women,
and people younger than 5 years (and especially those younger than 2), and people 65 years and older should also
make sure they get the yearly ﬂu vaccine.
Seeking medical help for diseases like asthma can help stop the disease from getting worse. If you are unsure if you
should go to the doctor, call the doctor’s ofﬁce and ask.

Summary

• Avoid smoking, get enough exercise, and wash your hands to protect your respiratory system from illness.
• Getting the recommended vaccinations can help prevent diseases, such as whooping cough and ﬂu.

11.36 Excretion

• Deﬁne excretion.
• List organs of the excretory system.
• Identify the functions of the excretory system.

What happens to your body’s waste?
There is no space for a landﬁll in your body to contain wastes. You must be able to expel wastes from your body.
This is the role of the excretory system.

Excretion

So what happens to your body’s wastes? Obviously, you must get rid of them. This is the job of the excretory
system. You remove waste as a gas (carbon dioxide), as a liquid (urine and sweat), and as a solid. Excretion is the
process of removing wastes and excess water from the body.
Recall that carbon dioxide travels through the blood and is transferred to the lungs where it is exhaled. In the large
intestine, the remains of food are turned into solid waste for excretion. How is waste other than carbon dioxide
removed from the blood? That is the role of the kidneys.
Urine is a liquid waste formed by the kidneys as they ﬁlter the blood. If you are getting plenty of ﬂuids, your urine
should be almost clear. But you might have noticed that sometimes your urine is darker than usual. Do you know
why this happens? Sometimes your body is low on water and trying to reduce the amount of water lost in urine.
Therefore, your urine gets darker than usual. Your body is striving to maintain homeostasis through the process of
excretion.
Urine helps remove excess water, salts, and nitrogen from your body. Your body also needs to remove the wastes
that build up from cell activity and from digestion. If these wastes are not removed, your cells can stop working, and
you can get very sick. The organs of your excretory system help to release wastes from the body.

745

The organs of the excretory system are also parts of other organ systems. For example, your lungs are part of the
respiratory system. Your lungs remove carbon dioxide from your body, so they are also part of the excretory system.
More organs of the excretory system are listed below ( Table 11.6).

11.37 Urinary System

• Describe the role of the urinary system.
• List the parts of urinary system.
• Explain the role of the kidneys.
• Describe urine.

Why is urine important?
You might have had to give a urine sample when you’ve gone to the doctor for a check-up. Urine is basically your
liquid waste. The contents of your urine can tell the doctor if you have certain illnesses.

The Urinary System

Sometimes, the urinary system ( Figure 11.66) is called the excretory system. But the urinary system is only one
part of the excretory system. Recall that the excretory system is also made up of the skin, lungs, and large intestine,
as well as the kidneys. The urinary system is the organ system that makes, stores, and gets rid of urine.

Organs of the Urinary System

1. As you can see above ( Figure 11.66), the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs. Kidneys ﬁlter and clean the
blood and form urine. They are about the size of your ﬁsts and are found near the middle of the back, just
below your ribcage.

2. Ureters are tube-shaped and bring urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.
3. The urinary bladder is a hollow and muscular organ. It is shaped a little like a balloon. It is the organ that

collects urine.

4. Urine leaves the body through the urethra.

FIGURE 11.66
The kidneys ﬁlter the blood that passes
through them, and the urinary bladder
stores the urine until it is released from
the body.

What is Urine?

Urine is a liquid that is formed by the kidneys when they ﬁlter wastes from the blood. Urine contains mostly water,
but it also contains salts and nitrogen-containing molecules. The amount of urine released from the body depends
on many things. Some of these include the amount of ﬂuid and food a person consumes and how much ﬂuid they
have lost from sweating and breathing. Urine ranges from colorless to dark yellow but is usually a pale yellow color.
Light yellow urine contains mostly water. The darker the urine, the less water it contains.
The urinary system also removes a type of waste called urea from your blood. Urea is a nitrogen-containing
molecule that is made when foods containing protein, such as meat, poultry, and certain vegetables, are broken
down in the body. Urea and other wastes are carried in the bloodstream to the kidneys, where they are removed and
form urine.

Summary

• The urinary system is made up of the kidneys, the ureters, the bladder, and the urethra.
• Urine is the liquid that is formed by the kidneys when they ﬁlter wastes from the blood. Urine contains water,

salts, and nitrogen-containing molecules.

11.38 Kidneys

• List the roles of the kidneys.
• Outline how the kidneys ﬁlter blood.
• Summarize the process of urine formation.
• Explain how urination is controlled.

Why are the kidneys important?
These kidney beans are named after a very important organ in your body. Though you probably can live without
these beans, you can’t live without at least one kidney. The kidneys have several essential functions. For example,
kidneys ﬁlter your blood, removing wastes and regulating the amount of water in your body.

The Kidneys

The kidneys ( Figure 11.67) are important organs in maintaining homeostasis, the ability of the body to maintain a
stable internal environment despite a changing environment. Kidneys perform a number of homeostatic functions.

• They maintain the volume of body ﬂuids.
• They maintain the balance of salt ions in body ﬂuids.
• They excrete harmful nitrogen-containing molecules, such as urea, ammonia, and uric acid.

There are many blood vessels in the kidneys ( Figure 11.67). The kidneys remove urea and other wastes from the
blood through tiny ﬁltering units called nephrons. Nephrons ( Figure 11.68) are tiny, tube-shaped structures found

750

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.67

the capillaries and into the nephrons
where the ﬂuid forms urine then moves to
the ureter and on to the bladder.

inside each kidney. Each kidney has up to a million nephrons. Each nephron collects a small amount of ﬂuid and
waste from a small group of capillaries.
Nitrogen-containing wastes, together with water and other wastes, form the urine as it passes through the nephrons
and the kidney. The ﬂuid within nephrons is carried out into a larger tube in the kidney called a ureter, which carries
it to the bladder ( Figure 11.68).
The kidneys never stop ﬁltering waste products from the blood, so they are always producing urine. The amount
of urine your kidneys produce is dependent on the amount of ﬂuid in your body. Your body loses water through
sweating, breathing, and urination. The water and other ﬂuids you drink every day help to replace the lost water.
This water ends up circulating in the blood because blood plasma is mostly water.

Formation of Urine

The process of urine formation is as follows:

1. Blood ﬂows into the kidney through the renal artery. The renal artery connects to capillaries inside the kidney.

Capillaries and nephrons lie very close to each other in the kidney.

2. The blood pressure within the capillaries causes water, salts, sugars, and urea to leave the capillaries and move

into the nephron.

3. The water and salts move along through the tube-shaped nephron to a lower part of the nephron.
4. The ﬂuid that remains in the nephron at this point is called urine.
5. The blood that leaves the kidney in the renal vein has much less waste than the blood that entered the kidney.
6. The urine is collected in the ureters and is moved to the urinary bladder, where it is stored.

Nephrons ﬁlter about 1
4 cup of body ﬂuid per minute. In a 24-hour period, nephrons ﬁlter 180 liters of ﬂuid, and 1.5
liters of the ﬂuid is released as urine. Urine enters the bladder through the ureters. Similar to a balloon, the walls of
the bladder are stretchy. The stretchy walls allow the bladder to hold a large amount of urine. The bladder can hold
about 1 1

2 cups of urine but may also hold more if the urine cannot be released immediately.

FIGURE 11.68
The location of nephrons in the kidney.
The ﬂuid collects in the nephron tubules
and moves to the bladder through the
ureter.

How do you know when you have to urinate? Urination is the process of releasing urine from the body. Urine
leaves the body through the urethra. Nerves in the bladder tell you when it is time to urinate. As the bladder ﬁrst ﬁlls
with urine, you may notice a feeling that you need to urinate. The urge to urinate becomes stronger as the bladder
continues to ﬁll up.

Brain Control of Urination

The ﬁltering action of the kidneys is controlled by the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is about the size of a pea
and is found below the brain ( Figure 11.69). The pituitary gland releases hormones that help the kidneys to ﬁlter
water from the blood.
The movement of water back into blood is controlled by a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is
one of the hormones released from the pituitary gland in the brain. One of the most important roles of ADH is to
control the body’s ability to hold onto water. If a person does not drink enough water, ADH is released. It causes the
blood to reabsorb water from the kidneys. If the kidneys remove less water from the blood, what will the urine look
like? It will look darker, because there is less water in it.
When a person drinks a lot of water, then there will be a lot of water in the blood. The pituitary gland will then
release a lower amount of ADH into the blood. This means less water will be reabsorbed by the blood. The kidneys
then produce a large volume of urine. What color will this urine be?

Summary

• Water and waste molecules move out of the blood capillaries and into the nephrons of the kidney to form the

urine.

• ADH is the hormone released by the pituitary gland and controls how water is reabsorbed by the blood from

the kidneys.

• Identify disorders of the urinary system.
• Explain the cause of kidney stones.
• Describe kidney failure.
• Describe the signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection.

Why drink water?
It’s always a good idea to drink plenty of ﬂuids, especially when you have been exercising. Drinking plenty of water
helps to ﬂush away materials that might form kidney stones. Staying hydrated is the best way to prevent kidney
stones.

Problems of the Excretory System

The urinary system controls the amount of water in the body and removes wastes. Any problem with the urinary
system can also affect many other body systems.

Kidney Stones

In some cases, certain mineral wastes can form kidney stones ( Figure 11.70). Stones form in the kidneys and
may be found anywhere in the urinary system. Often, stones form when the urine becomes concentrated, allowing
minerals to crystallize and stick together. They can vary in size, from small stones that can ﬂow through your urinary
system, to larger stones that cannot. Some stones cause great pain, while others cause very little pain. Some stones
may need to be removed by surgery or ultrasound treatments.
What are the symptoms of kidney stones? You may have a kidney stone if you have pain while urinating, see blood
in your urine, and/or feel a sharp pain in your back or lower abdomen (the area between your chest and hips). The

pain may last for a long or short time. You may also have nausea and vomiting with the pain. If you have a small
stone that passes on its own easily, you may not experience any symptoms. If you have some of these symptoms,
you should see your doctor.

Kidney failure

Kidney failure happens when the kidneys cannot remove wastes from the blood. If the kidneys are unable to ﬁlter
wastes from the blood, the wastes build up in the body. Kidney failure can be caused by an accident that injures
the kidneys, the loss of a lot of blood, or by some drugs and poisons. Kidney failure may lead to permanent loss of
kidney function. But if the kidneys are not seriously damaged, they may recover.
Chronic kidney disease is the slow decrease in kidney function that may lead to permanent kidney failure. A person
who has lost kidney function may need to get kidney dialysis. Kidney dialysis is the process of ﬁltering the blood
of wastes using a machine. A dialysis machine ( Figure 11.71) ﬁlters waste from the blood by pumping the blood
through a fake kidney. The ﬁltered blood is then returned to the patient’s body.

FIGURE 11.71
During dialysis, a patient’s blood is sent
through a ﬁlter that removes waste prod-
ucts. The clean blood is returned to the
body.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs)

Chapter 11. Human Biology

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are bacterial infections of any part of the urinary tract. When bacteria get into the
bladder or kidney and produce more bacteria in the urine, they cause a UTI. The most common type of UTI is a
bladder infection. Women get UTIs more often than men. UTIs are often treated with antibiotics.
Most UTIs are not serious, but some infections can lead to serious problems. Long lasting kidney infections can
cause permanent damage, including kidney scars, poor kidney function, high blood pressure, and other problems.
Some sudden kidney infections can be life threatening, especially if the bacteria enter the bloodstream, a condition
called septicemia.
What are the signs and symptoms of a UTI?

• a burning feeling when you urinate,
• frequent or intense urges to urinate, even when you have little urine to pass,
• pain in your back or side below the ribs,
• cloudy, dark, bloody, or foul-smelling urine,
• fever or chills.

You should see your doctor if you have signs of a UTI. Your doctor will diagnose a UTIs by asking about your
symptoms and then testing a sample of your urine.

Summary

• Disorders of the urinary system include kidney stones, kidney failure, and urinary tract infections.
• Kidney dialysis is the process of ﬁltering wastes from the blood using a machine.

11.40 Nervous System

• Deﬁne nerve.
• Describe the role of a nerve.
• Explain the functions of the nervous system.

What body system helps you learn?
As these girls are studying, many processes are taking place. Their eyes have to take in the words on the page, and
their brains have to process the meaning of the words. The brain also has to assimilate the knowledge so it can be
retrieved at a later time. All these processes are controlled by the nervous system.

Introduction to the Nervous System

Michelle was riding her scooter when she hit a hole in the street and started to lose control. She thought she would
fall, but, in the blink of an eye, she shifted her weight and kept her balance. Her heart was pounding, but at least
she didn’t get hurt. How was she able to react so quickly? Michelle can thank her nervous system for that ( Figure
11.72).
The nervous system, together with the endocrine system, controls all the other organ systems. The nervous system
sends one type of signal around the body, and the endocrine system sends another type of signal around the body.
The endocrine system makes and releases chemical messenger molecules, or hormones, which tell other body parts
that a change or a reaction is necessary. So what type of signal does the nervous system send?
Controlling muscles and maintaining balance are just two of the roles of the nervous system. The nervous system
also lets you:

• Sense your surroundings with your eyes and other sense organs.
• Sense the environment inside of your body, including temperature.

759

11.40. Nervous System

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 11.72
Staying balanced when riding a scooter
requires control over the body’s muscles.
The nervous system controls the muscles
and maintains balance.

• Control your internal body systems and keep them in balance.
• Prepare your body to ﬁght or ﬂee in an emergency.
• Use language, think, learn, and remember.

The nervous system works by sending and receiving electrical signals. The main organs of the nervous system are
the brain and the spinal cord. The signals are carried by nerves in the body, similar to the wires that carry electricity
all over a house. The signals travel from all over the body to the spinal cord and up to the brain, as well as moving
in the other direction. For example, when Michelle started to fall off her scooter, her nervous system sensed that she
was losing her balance. It responded by sending messages from her brain to muscles in her body. Some muscles
tightened while others relaxed. Maybe these actions moved her hips or her arms. The nervous system, working
together with the muscular and skeletal systems, allowed Michelle to react to the situation. As a result, Michelle’s
body became balanced again. The messages released by the nervous system traveled through nerves. Just like the
electricity that travels through wires, nerve quickly carry the electrical messages around the body.
Think about how quickly all this happens. It has to be really fast, otherwise Michelle would not have been able to
react. What would happen if a car pulled out unexpectedly in front of Michelle? A signal would have to go from her
eyes to her brain and then to her muscles. What allows the nervous system to react so fast. It starts with the special
cell of the nervous system, the neuron.

Summary

• The nervous system sends electrical messages throughout the body and controls all other body systems.
• The nervous system allows you to think, learn, sense your surroundings, and control your internal body

systems.

• Describe neuron structure.
• Explain the role of the dendrites and axon.
• Distinguish sensory neurons from motor neurons.
• Summarize what happens when a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon.

What do nerve cells look like?
Note that like most other cells, these nerve cells have a nucleus. They also have other organelles. However, the long,
threadlike extensions of the nerve cells are unique. This is where the nerve impulses are transmitted.

Neurons and Nerve Impulses

The nervous system is made up of nerves. A nerve is a bundle of nerve cells. A nerve cell that carries messages is
called a neuron ( Figure 11.73). The messages carried by neurons are called nerve impulses. Nerve impulses can
travel very quickly because they are electrical impulses.
Think about ﬂipping on a light switch when you enter a room. When you ﬂip the switch, the electricity ﬂows to the
light through wires inside the walls. The electricity may have to travel many meters to reach the light, but the light
still comes on as soon as you ﬂip the switch. Nerve impulses travel just as fast through the network of nerves inside
the body.

FIGURE 11.73
The axons of many neurons, like the one
shown here, are covered with a fatty layer
called myelin sheath. The sheath covers
the axon, like the plastic covering on an
electrical wire, and allows nerve impulses
to travel faster along the axon. The node
of Ranvier, shown in this diagram, is any
gap in the myelin sheath; it allows faster
transmission of a signal.

What Does a Neuron Look Like?

A neuron has a special shape that lets it pass signals from one cell to another. A neuron has three main parts ( Figure
11.73):

1. The cell body.
2. Many dendrites.
3. One axon.

The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles. Dendrites and axons connect to the cell body, similar to
rays coming off of the sun. Dendrites receive nerve impulses from other cells. Axons pass the nerve impulses on to
other cells. A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites, so it can communicate with thousands of other cells
but only one axon. The axon is covered with a myelin sheath, a fatty layer that insulates the axon and allows the
electrical signal to travel much more quickly. The node of Ranvier is any gap within the myelin sheath exposing
the axon, and it allows even faster transmission of a signal.

Types of Neurons

Neurons are usually classiﬁed based on the role they play in the body. Two main types of neurons are sensory
neurons and motor neurons.

• Sensory neurons carry nerve impulses from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system.
• Motor neurons carry nerve impulses from the central nervous system to organs, glands, and muscles—the

opposite direction.

Both types of neurons work together. Sensory neurons carry information about the environment found inside or
outside of the body to the central nervous system. The central nervous system uses the information to send messages
through motor neurons to tell the body how to respond to the information.

The Synapse

The place where the axon of one neuron meets the dendrite of another is called a synapse. Synapses are also found
between neurons and other types of cells, such as muscle cells. The axon of the sending neuron does not actually
touch the dendrite of the receiving neuron. There is a tiny gap between them, the synaptic cleft ( Figure 11.74).

FIGURE 11.74
This diagram shows a synapse between
neurons. When a nerve impulse arrives at
the end of the axon, neurotransmitters are
released and travel to the dendrite of an-
other neuron, carrying the nerve impulse
from one neuron to the next.

The following steps describe what happens when a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon.

1. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon, the axon releases chemicals called neurotransmitters.
2. Neurotransmitters travel across the synapse between the axon and the dendrite of the next neuron.
3. Neurotransmitters bind to the membrane of the dendrite.
4. The binding allows the nerve impulse to travel through the receiving neuron.

Did you ever watch a relay race? After the ﬁrst runner races, he or she passes the baton to the next runner, who
takes over. Neurons are a little like relay runners. Instead of a baton, they pass neurotransmitters to the next neuron.
Examples of neurotransmitters are chemicals such as serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline.
You can watch an animation of nerve impulses and neurotransmitters at http://www.mind.ilstu.edu/curriculum/neu
rons_intro/neurons_intro.php .
Some people have low levels of the neurotransmitter called serotonin in their brain. Scientists think that this is one
cause of depression. Medications called antidepressants help bring serotonin levels back to normal. For many people
with depression, antidepressants control the symptoms of their depression and help them lead happy, productive lives.

11.42 Central Nervous System

• Describe the structures of the central nervous system.
• Identify sections of the brain.
• Identify functions of the cerebral lobes.

What’s the control center of your body?
Your brain is like the control center of your body. It controls your breathing and heartbeat. It helps you to think and
learn. The brain is so "central" to all your body systems, it’s not surprising that the brain and spinal cord are called
the central nervous system.

The Central Nervous System

The central nervous system (CNS) ( Figure 11.75) is the largest part of the nervous system. It includes the brain
and the spinal cord. The bony skull protects the brain. The spinal cord is protected within the bones of the spine,
which are called vertebrae.

The Brain

What weighs about three pounds and contains up to 100 billion cells? The answer is the human brain. The brain is
the control center of the nervous system. It’s like the pilot of a plane. It tells other parts of the nervous system what
to do.
The brain is also the most complex organ in the body. Each of its 100 billion neurons has synapses connecting it
with thousands of other neurons. All those neurons use a lot of energy. In fact, the adult brain uses almost a quarter
of the total energy used by the body. The developing brain of a baby uses an even greater amount of the body’s total
energy.

FIGURE 11.75
The brain and spinal cord make up the
central nervous system.

The brain is the organ that lets us understand what we see, hear, or sense in other ways. It also allows us to use
language, learn, think, and remember. The brain controls the organs in our body and our movements as well. The
brain consists of three main parts, the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem ( Figure 11.76).

1. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It sits on top of the brain stem. The cerebrum controls functions
that we are aware of, such as problem-solving and speech. It also controls voluntary movements, like waving
to a friend. Whether you are doing your homework or jumping hurdles, you are using your cerebrum.

2. The cerebellum is the next largest part of the brain. It lies under the cerebrum and behind the brain stem. The
cerebellum controls body position, coordination, and balance. Whether you are riding a bicycle or writing
with a pen, you are using your cerebellum.

3. The brain stem is the smallest of the three main parts of the brain. It lies directly under the cerebrum. The
brain stem controls basic body functions, such as breathing, heartbeat, and digestion. The brain stem also
carries information back and forth between the cerebrum and spinal cord.

The cerebrum is divided into a right and left half ( Figure 11.76). Each half of the cerebrum is called a hemisphere.
The two hemispheres are connected by a thick bundle of axons called the corpus callosum. It lies deep inside the
brain and carries messages back and forth between the two hemispheres.
Did you know that the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere controls the right
side of the body? By connecting the two hemispheres, the corpus callosum allows this to happen.
Each hemisphere of the cerebrum is divided into four parts, called lobes. The four lobes are the:

1. Frontal.
2. Parietal.

The spinal cord is a long, tube-shaped bundle of neurons, protected by the vertebrae. It runs from the brain stem
to the lower back. The main job of the spinal cord is to carry nerve impulses back and forth between the body and
brain. The spinal cord is like a two-way highway. Messages about the body, both inside and out, pass through the
spinal cord to the brain. Messages from the brain pass in the other direction through the spinal cord to tell the body
what to do.

How does your brain connect to the rest of your body?
You know you have nerves in your ﬁngers and toes because you can feel them. But how does your brain know what’s
going on in these nerves? You have a network of nerves running from your brain and spinal cord to your ﬁngers and
toes and the rest of your body. This network is known as the peripheral nervous system.

The Peripheral Nervous System

There are other nerves in your body that are not found in the brain or spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system
(PNS) ( Figure 11.77) contains all the nerves in the body that are found outside of the central nervous system. They
include nerves of the hands, arms, feet, legs, and trunk. They also include nerves of the scalp, neck, and face. Nerves
that send and receive messages to the internal organs are also part of the peripheral nervous system.

770

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.77
The blue lines in this drawing represent
nerves of the peripheral nervous system.
Every peripheral nerve is connected di-
rectly or indirectly to the spinal cord. No-
tice the thick sciatic nerve. It is the longest
(and thickest) nerve in the body, running
from the lower region of the spinal cord to
just above the knee.

The peripheral nervous system is divided into two parts, the sensory division and the motor division. How these
divisions of the peripheral nervous system are related to the rest of the nervous system is shown below ( Figure
11.78). Refer to the ﬁgure as you read more about the peripheral nervous system in the text that follows.

The Sensory Division

The sensory division carries messages from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system. Human
beings have several senses. They include sight, hearing, balance, touch, taste, and smell. We have special sense
organs for each of these senses. What is the sense organ for sight? For hearing?
Sensory neurons in each sense organ receive stimuli, or messages from the environment that cause a response in the
body. For example, sensory neurons in the eyes send messages to the brain about light. Sensory neurons in the skin

send messages to the brain about touch. Our sense organs recognize sensations, but they don’t tell us what we are
sensing. For example, when you breathe in chemicals given off by baking cookies, your nose does not tell you that
you are smelling cookies. That’s your brain’s job. The sense organs send messages about sights, smells, and other
stimuli to the brain ( Figure 11.79). The brain then reads the messages and tells you what they mean. A certain area
of the brain receives and interprets information from each sense organ. For example, information from the nose is
received and interpreted by the temporal lobe of the cerebrum.

FIGURE 11.79
Which senses would be stimulated by these raspberries?

The Motor Division

The motor division of the peripheral system carries messages from the central nervous system to internal organs
and muscles. The motor division is also divided into two parts ( Figure 11.78), the somatic nervous system and the
autonomic nervous system.
The somatic nervous system carries messages that control body movements. It is responsible for activities that are
under your control, such as waving your hand or kicking a ball. The girl pictured below ( Figure 11.80) is using her
somatic nervous system to control the muscles needed to play the violin. Her brain sends messages to motor neurons
that move her hands so she can play. Without the messages from her brain, she would not be able to move her hands
and play the violin.
The autonomic nervous system carries nerve impulses to internal organs. It controls activities that are not under
your control, such as sweating and digesting food. The autonomic nervous system has two parts:

FIGURE 11.80
These women’s central nervous systems
are controlling the movements of
their
hands and arms as they play the violin.
Their brains send commands to their so-
matic nervous system, which controls the
muscles of their hands and arms.

1. The sympathetic division controls internal organs and glands during emergencies. It prepares the body for
ﬁght or ﬂight ( Figure 11.81). For example, it increases the heart rate and the ﬂow of blood to the legs, so you
can run away from danger.

2. The parasympathetic division controls internal organs and glands during the rest of the time. It controls

processes like digestion, heartbeat, and breathing when there is not an emergency.

FIGURE 11.81
The woman pictured here is just pretend-
ing to be frightened, but assuming that
she really was scared, think of which di-
vision of the autonomic nervous system
would prepare her body for an emergency.

Have you ever become frightened and felt your heart start pounding? How does this happen? The answer is your
autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic division prepared you to deal with a possible emergency by increasing

773

your heart rate. The fact that this happened in the blink of an eye shows how amazing the nervous system is.

Summary

• The peripheral nervous system consists of all the nerves that are found outside the central nervous system.
• The peripheral nervous system is divided into the sensory and motor divisions, which are then divided into

further systems and subdivisions.

11.44 Human Vision

• Describe how humans see and explain why vision is important.
• Explain the importance of seeing in three dimensions and in color.

How have you used your vision today?
Maybe you were just doing some schoolwork. Or walking down the hallway. No matter what you were doing, you
were probably using your sense of sight. You may depend on your sense of sight so much that it’s hard to think of
anything you do without it, except sleep. Why is sight so important?

The Nature of Human Vision

Think about all the ways that students use their sense of sight during a typical school day. As soon as they open their
eyes in the morning, they might look at the clock to see what time it is. Then, they might look out the window to see
what the weather is like. They probably look in a mirror to comb their hair. In school, they use their eyes to read
the board, their textbooks, and the expressions on their friends’ faces. After school, they might keep their eye on the
ball while playing basketball ( Figure 11.82). Then, they might read their homework assignment and text messages
from their friends.
Sight, or vision, is the ability to see light. It depends on the eyes detecting light and forming images. It also depends
on the brain making sense of the images, so that we know what we are seeing. Human beings and other primates
depend on vision more than many other animals. It’s not surprising, then, that we have a better sense of vision than
many other animals. Not only can we normally see both distant and close-up objects clearly, but we can also see in
three dimensions and in color.
But humans do not have the best vision. You may think you see things fairly clearly. Imagine if you could see even
better. How about 8 times better? Raptors, or birds of prey, including the eagles, hawks and falcons can see up to
8 times more clearly than the sharpest human eye. A golden eagle for example can see a rabbit from a mile away.
Why do you think they have such a good sense of vision? Other animals also have much better night vision then us.

FIGURE 11.82
All eyes are on the ball in this basketball
game. Think about how we use the sense
of sight in other games.

Seeing in Three Dimensions

Did you ever use 3-D glasses to watch a movie, like the boy pictured below ( Figure 11.83)? If you did, then you
know that the glasses make people and objects in the movie appear to jump out of the screen. They make images on
the ﬂat movie screen seem more realistic because they give them depth. That’s the difference between seeing things
in two dimensions and three dimensions.

FIGURE 11.83
This boy is wearing 3-D glasses; when you look at objects and people in
the real world, your eyes automatically see in three dimensions.

We are able to see in three dimensions because we have two eyes facing the same direction but a few inches apart.
As a result, we see objects and people with both eyes at the same time but from slightly different angles.
Hold up a ﬁnger a few inches away from your face, and look at it, ﬁrst with one eye and then with the other. You’ll
notice that your ﬁnger appears to move. Now hold up your ﬁnger at arm’s length, and look at it with one eye and
then the other. Your ﬁnger seems to move less than it did when it was closer. Although you aren’t aware of it, your
brain constantly uses such differences to determine the distance of objects.

776

Seeing in Color

Chapter 11. Human Biology

For animals like us that see in color, it may be hard to imagine a world that appears to be mainly shades of gray. You
can get an idea of how many other animals see the world by looking at a black-and-white picture of colorful objects.
For example, look at the apple on the tree pictured below ( Figure 11.84). In the top picture, they appear in color,
the way you would normally see them. In the bottom picture they appear without color, in shades of gray ( Figure
11.85).

FIGURE 11.84
Humans with color vision see the apple on this tree; the bright red color of
the apple stands out clearly from the green background of leaves.

FIGURE 11.85
This black-and-white picture gives an idea of how many animals see the
world. Dogs and cats would see the green and red colors as shades of
gray; they are able to see blue, but red and green appear the same to
them. Many animals see just one or two colors. Some see colors that we
cannot see. Apes and chimps see the same colors as us.

But whereas many animals cannot see colors, some animals see colors that we cannot. The range of color vision of
bees and butterﬂies for example, extends beyond the visible spectrum of light we can see. The leaves of the ﬂowers
they pollinate have special ultraviolet patterns which guide the insects deep into the ﬂower.

Evolution and Primate Vision

Why do you think primates, including humans, evolved the ability to see in three dimensions and in color? To answer
that question, you need to know a little about primate evolution. Millions of years ago, primate ancestors lived in
trees. To move about in the trees, they needed to be able to judge how far away the next branch was. Otherwise, they
might have a dangerous fall. Being able see in depth was important. It was an adaptation that would help tree-living
primates survive.
Primate ancestors also mainly ate fruit. They needed to be able to spot colored fruits in the leafy background of the
trees ( Figure 11.86). They also had to be able to judge which fruits were ripe and which were still green. Ripe
fruits are usually red, orange, yellow, or purple. Being able to see in color was important for ﬁnding food. It was an
adaptation that would help fruit-eating primates survive.

Summary

• Vision depends on the eyes detecting light and forming images, and then the brain must make sense of the

images.

• Deﬁne retina, cornea, lens, and pupil.
• Distinguish rod cells from cone cells.
• Explain the steps involved in vision.

How do you see the board?
As you are sitting in the classroom, you may at ﬁrst be focused on a paper directly in front of you. Then you may
look to the front of the room to see a math problem worked out on the board. How can your eyes focus directly in
front of you and then, a second later, at a distance? Your eyes are rather amazing!

How the Eye Works

The job of the eye is to focus light. The parts of the eye ( Figure 11.87) help it to carry out its job. Follow the path
of light through the eye as you read about it below.
Vision involves sensing and focusing light from people and objects. The steps involved are as follows:

1. First, light passes through the cornea of the eye. The cornea is a clear, protective covering on the outside of

the eye.

2. Next, light passes through the pupil. The pupil is a black opening in the eye that lets light enter the eye.
3. After passing into the eye through the pupil, light passes through the lens. The lens of the eye is a clear, curved
structure. Along with the cornea, the lens helps focus light at the back of the eye. This is pictured below (
Figure 11.88).

4. The lens must bend light from nearby objects more than it bends light from far-away objects. The lens changes

shape to bend the light by just the right amount to bring objects into focus.

779

11.45. How the Eye Works

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 11.87
The human eye is a complex structure
that senses light; the light passes through
the cornea, pupil, and lens, and is focused
on the retina. The vitreous humor is the
clear gel that ﬁlls the space between the
lens and the retina of the eye, and the
hyaloid canal is a small transparent canal
running through the vitreous humor from
the optical disc to the lens.

5. The lens focuses light on the retina, which covers the back of the inside of the eye. The retina has light-
sensing photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. Rods let us see in dim light. Cones let us detect light of
different colors.

6. When light hits rods and cones, it causes chemical changes. The chemical changes start nerve impulses. The

nerve impulses travel to the brain through the optic nerve.

7. The brain makes sense of the nerve impulses and tells you what you are seeing.

FIGURE 11.88
Light from objects at different distances is
focused by the lens of the eye. Muscles
in the eye control the shape of the lens so
the light is focused on the back of the eye
no matter how far the object is from the
lens.

Summary

• Light entering the eye is focused by the lens on the retina, which sends messages to the brain through the optic

nerve.

• Muscles in the eye control the shape of the lens so the light is focused on the back of the eye no matter how

far the object is from the lens.

11.46 Vision Correction

• Deﬁne myopia and hyperopia.
• Explain how lenses correct vision problems.

Why get an eye exam?
During a routine eye exam, your vision will be evaluated to see if you need glasses or contacts. Also, the eye doctor
checks your eyes for diseases that could lead to vision loss. About one of every two people end up needing some
sort of vision correction during their lifetime.

Vision Correction

You probably know people who need eyeglasses or contact lenses to see clearly. Maybe you need them yourself.
Lenses are used to correct vision problems. Two of the most common vision problems are myopia and hyperopia.

Myopia

Myopia is also called nearsightedness. It affects about one third of people. People with myopia can see nearby
objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. The picture below shows how a person with myopia might see two
boys that are a few meters away ( Figure 11.89).
In myopia, the eye is too long. Below, you can see how images are focused on the retina of someone with myopia
( Figure 11.90). Myopia is corrected with a concave lens, which curves inward like the inside of a bowl. The lens
changes the focus, so images fall on the retina as they should.
Generally, nearsightedness ﬁrst occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If
one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a
lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to

develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until
about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as
diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difﬁculty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the
whiteboard or chalkboard in school.
Eyeglasses or contact lenses can easily help with myopia. Depending on the amount of myopia, you may only need
to wear glasses or contact lenses for certain activities, like watching a movie or driving a car. Or, if you are very
nearsighted, they may need to be worn all the time.

Farsightedness

Farsightedness is also known as hyperopia. It affects about one fourth of people. People with hyperopia can see
distant objects clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. In hyperopia, the eye is too short. This results in images
being focused in back of the retina ( Figure 11.90). Hyperopia is corrected with a convex lens, which curves outward
like the outside of a bowl. The lens changes the focus so that images fall on the retina as they should.
Common signs of farsightedness include difﬁculty in concentrating and maintaining a clear focus on close objects,
eye strain, fatigue and headaches after close work, and aching or burning eyes, especially after intense concentration
on close work.

11.46. Vision Correction

www.ck12.org

In addition to lenses, many cases of myopia and hyperopia can be corrected with surgery. For example, a procedure
called LASIK (Laser-Assisted in situ Keratomileusis) uses a laser to permanently change the shape of the cornea so
light is correctly focused on the retina.

Summary

• Vision problems such as myopia and hyperopia can be corrected with lenses that help focus light on the retina.
• Myopia is corrected with a concave lens, while hyperopia is corrected with a convex lens.

11.47 Hearing and Balance

• Describe the hammer, anvil, and stirrup.
• Explain the steps involved in hearing.
• Describe how balance is maintained.

Feeling dizzy?
Have you ever gotten off a spinning ride at an amusement park and felt dizzy? Why does this happen? It actually
all goes back to your ears! When you stop spinning, the ﬂuid in the canals of your ears is still moving. Sensing the
position of the liquid in the canals usually helps you keep balance, so spinning the ﬂuid throws you off balance.

Hearing and Balance

What do listening to music and riding a bike have in common? It might surprise you to learn that both activities
depend on your ears. The ears do more than just detect sound. They also sense the position of the body and help
maintain balance.

Hearing

Hearing is the ability to sense sound. Sound travels through the air in waves, much like the waves you see in
the water pictured below ( Figure 11.91). Sound waves in air cause vibrations inside the ears. The ears sense the
vibrations.
The human ear is pictured below ( Figure 11.92). As you read about it, trace the path of sound waves through the
ear. Assume a car horn blows in the distance. Sound waves spread through the air from the horn. Some of the sound
waves reach your ear. The steps below show what happens next. They explain how your ears sense the sound.

786

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.91
Sound waves travel through the air in all
directions away from a sound, like waves
traveling through water away from where
a pebble was dropped.

FIGURE 11.92
Read the names of the parts of the ear in
the text; then ﬁnd each of the parts in the
diagram. Note that the round window is
distinct from the oval window.

1. The sound waves travel to the ear canal (external auditory canal in the ﬁgure). This is a tube-shaped opening

in the ear.

2. At the end of the ear canal, the sound waves hit the eardrum (tympanic membrane). This is a thin membrane

that vibrates like the head of a drum when sound waves hit it.

3. The vibrations pass from the eardrum to the hammer (malleus). This is the ﬁrst of three tiny bones that pass

vibrations through the ear.

4. The hammer passes the vibrations to the anvil (incus), the second tiny bone that passes vibrations through the

ear.

5. The anvil passes the vibrations to the stirrup (stapes), the third tiny bone that passes vibrations through the

ear.

6. From the stirrup, the vibrations pass to the oval window. This is another membrane like the eardrum.
7. The oval window passes the vibrations to the cochlea. The cochlea is ﬁlled with liquid that moves when the
vibrations pass through, like the waves in water when you drop a pebble into a pond. Tiny hair cells line the

787

11.47. Hearing and Balance

www.ck12.org

cochlea and bend when the liquid moves. When the hair cells bend, they release neurotransmitters.

8. The neurotransmitters trigger nerve impulses that travel to the brain through the auditory nerve (cochlear

nerve). The brain reads the sound and “tells” you what you are hearing.

No doubt you’ve been warned that listening to loud music or other loud sounds can damage your hearing. It’s true.
In fact, repeated exposure to loud sounds is the most common cause of hearing loss. The reason? Very loud sounds
can kill the tiny hair cells lining the cochlea. The hair cells do not generally grow back once they are destroyed, so
this type of hearing loss is permanent. You can protect your hearing by avoiding loud sounds or wearing earplugs or
other ear protectors.

Balance

Did you ever try to stand on one foot with your eyes closed? Try it and see what happens, but be careful! It’s
harder to keep your balance when you can’t see. Your eyes obviously play a role in balance. But your ears play
an even bigger role. The gymnast pictured below ( Figure 11.93) may not realize it, but her ears—along with her
cerebellum—are mostly responsible for her ability to perform on the balance beam.

FIGURE 11.93
This gymnast
is using the semicircular
canals in her ears, along with the cerebel-
lum in her brain, to help keep her balance
on the balance beam.

The parts of the ears involved in balance are the semicircular canals. Above, the semicircular canals are colored
purple ( Figure 11.92). The canals contain liquid and are like the bottle of water pictured below ( Figure 11.94).
When the bottle tips, the water surface moves up and down the sides of the bottle. When the body tips, the liquid
in the semicircular canals moves up and down the sides of the canals. Tiny hair cells line the semicircular canals.
Movement of the liquid inside the canals causes the hair cells to send nerve impulses. The nerve impulses travel to
the cerebellum in the brain along the vestibular nerve. In response, the cerebellum sends commands to muscles to
contract or relax so that the body stays balanced.

Summary

1. At the end of the ear canal, sound waves hit the eardrum, which passes vibrations through a series of bones to

the cochlea.

2. The parts of the ears involved in balance are the semicircular canals.

the canals. Tiny hair cells lining the canals
sense the movement of liquid and send
messages to the brain.

11.48 Touch

• Describe touch.
• Explain a reﬂex arc.
• Distinguish between mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, pain receptors, and proprioceptors.

What if you felt no pain?
It might sound good to you to have a condition where you feel no pain. But actually this type of condition would be
very dangerous. What would happen if you strained your back but felt no pain? Instead of resting your back, you
might injure it further.

Touch

When you look at the prickly cactus pictured below ( Figure 11.95), does the word "ouch" come to mind? Touching
the cactus would be painful. Touch is the sense of pain, pressure, or temperature. Touch depends on sensory
neurons, or nerve cells, in the skin. The skin on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and face has the most
sensory neurons and is especially sensitive to touch. The tongue and lips are very sensitive to touch as well. Neurons

791

11.48. Touch

www.ck12.org

that sense pain are also found inside the body in muscles, joints, and organs. If you have a stomach ache or pain
from a sprained ankle, it’s because of these sensory neurons found inside of your body.

FIGURE 11.95
The spines on this cactus are like needles; they help keep away animals
that might want to eat the cactus.

The following example shows how messages about touch travel from sensory neurons to the brain, as well as how
the brain responds to the messages. Suppose you wanted to test the temperature of the water in a lake before jumping
in. You might stick one bare foot in the water. Neurons in the skin on your foot would sense the temperature of the
water and send a message about it to your central nervous system. The frontal lobe of the cerebrum would process
the information. It might decide that the water is really cold and send a message to your muscles to pull your foot
out of the water.
In some cases, messages about pain or temperature don’t travel all the way to and from the brain. Instead, they travel
only as far as the spinal cord, and the spinal cord responds to the messages by giving orders to the muscles. This
allows you to respond to pain more quickly. When messages avoid the brain in this way, it forms a reﬂex arc, like
the one shown below ( Figure 11.96).

Touch Receptors

Our sense of touch is controlled by a huge network of nerve endings and touch receptors. This system is responsible
for all the sensations we feel, including cold, hot, smooth, rough, pressure, tickle, itch, pain, vibrations, and more.
There are four main types of receptors: mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, pain receptors, and proprioceptors.

• Mechanoreceptors perceive sensations such as pressure, vibrations, and texture. Your brain gets an enormous
amount of information about the texture of objects through your ﬁngertips because the ridges that make up
your ﬁngerprints are full of these sensitive receptors.

• Thermoreceptors perceive sensations related to the temperature of objects. There are two basic categories of
thermoreceptors: hot receptors and cold receptors. The highest concentration of thermoreceptors can be found
in the face and ears.

• Pain receptors, or nociceptor detect pain or stimuli that can or does cause damage to the skin and other tissues
of the body. There are over three million pain receptors throughout the body, found in skin, muscles, bones,
blood vessels, and some organs.

• Proprioceptors detect the position of different parts of the body in relation to each other and the surrounding
environment. These receptors are found in joints, tendons and muscles, and allow us to do fundamental things
such as feeding or clothing ourselves.

Reﬂex Arc: When a reﬂex hammer taps
your knee, you may immediately kick your
leg—without even thinking about it. The
nerve impulse from your knee travels to
the spinal cord, and the spinal cord sends
a message to your muscles to kick your
leg.

Summary

• Sensory neurons in the skin sense pain, pressure, and temperature.
• When sensory messages only travel as far as the spinal cord, and skip the brain, this is called a reﬂex arc.

11.49 Taste and Smell

• Describe how we identify different tastes and smells.
• Describe the ﬁve tastes.

Why are your senses of taste and smell important?
Imagine you open a gallon of milk, and you suddenly smell a foul odor. Your sense of smell has informed you that
the milk has spoiled. So you pour the spoiled milk down the kitchen sink. Your sense of smell has possibly kept you
from getting sick!

Taste and Smell

The senses of taste and smell are more complicated than many people might think and have a surprisingly large
impact on behavior, perception and overall health. Imagine your sense of smell disappearing as you age. Though
this doesn’t usually happen, it could provide clues about diseases of the nervous system. What about differences in
taste? Do all foods taste the same to all people? Are there some foods you would never eat because you don’t like

795

11.49. Taste and Smell

www.ck12.org

the taste? Does this food taste good to other people? Genetic differences in taste could help predict what we eat, how
well our metabolism works, and even whether or not we’re overweight. These two senses actually work together to
provide some of the basic sensations of everyday life.

Taste

Your sense of taste is controlled by sensory neurons, or nerve cells, on your tongue that sense the chemicals in
food. The neurons are grouped in bundles within taste buds. Each taste bud actually has a pore that opens out to the
surface of the tongue enabling molecules and ions taken into the mouth to reach the receptor cells inside. There are
ﬁve different types of taste neurons on the tongue. Each type detects a different taste. The tastes are:

1. Sweet, which is produced by the presence of sugars, such as the common table sugar sucrose, and a few other

substances.

2. Salty, which is produced primarily by the presence of sodium ions. Common salt is sodium chloride, NaCl.

The use of salt can donate the sodium ion producing this taste.

3. Sour, which is the taste that detects acidity. The most common food group that contains naturally sour foods is
fruit, such as lemon, grape, orange, and sometimes melon. Children show a greater enjoyment of sour ﬂavors
than adults, and sour candy such as Lemon Drops, Shock Tarts and sour versions of Skittles and Starburst, is
popular. Many of these candies contain citric acid.

4. Bitter is an unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable taste. Common bitter foods and beverages include coffee,

unsweetened cocoa, beer (due to hops), olives, and citrus peel.

5. Umami, which is a meaty or savory taste. This taste can be found in ﬁsh, shellﬁsh, cured meats, mushrooms,

cheese, tomatoes, grains, and beans.

A single taste bud contains 50–100 taste cells representing all 5 taste sensations. A stimulated taste receptor cell
triggers action potentials in a nearby sensory neuron, which send messages to the brain about the taste. The brain
then decides what tastes you are sensing.

Smell

Your sense of smell also involves sensory neurons that sense chemicals. The neurons are found in the nose, and they
detect chemicals in the air. Unlike taste neurons, which can detect only ﬁve different tastes, the sensory neurons
in the nose can detect thousands of different odors. Have you ever noticed that you lose your sense of taste when
your nose is stuffed up? That’s because your sense of smell greatly affects your ability to taste food. As you eat,
molecules of food chemicals enter your nose (actually your nasal cavity). You experience the taste and smell at the
same time. Being able to smell as well as taste food greatly increases the number of different ﬂavors you are able to
sense. For example, you can use your sense of taste alone to learn that a food is sweet, but you have to also use your
sense of smell to learn that the food tastes like strawberry cheesecake.
Speciﬁc scents are often associated with our memories of places and events. That’s because scents are more novel
or speciﬁc than shapes or other things you might see. So an odor similar to that of your grandmother’s kitchen or
pantry might be more quickly associated with your memories of that place than a similar sight, which might be more
generalized.

Summary

• Sensory neurons on the tongue detect ﬁve types of tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami.
• Sensory neurons that sense chemicals in your nose allow you to detect smells.

• Explain encephalitis and meningitis.

• Summarize causes and symptoms of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

Why get vaccinations?
Like this girl, many people are a little afraid of needles. But this is no reason to avoid vaccinations. Vaccinations can
help you avoid serious diseases. For example, a vaccination to prevent meningitis, a serious infection of the nervous
system, is now available.

Diseases of the Nervous System

The nervous system controls sensing, feeling, and thinking. It also controls movement and just about every other
body function. That’s why problems with the nervous system can affect the entire body. Diseases of the nervous
system include brain and spinal cord infections. Other problems of the nervous system range from very serious
diseases, such as tumors, to less serious problems, such as tension headaches. Some of these diseases are present at
birth. Others begin during childhood or adulthood.

Central Nervous System Infections

When you think of infections, you probably think of an ear infection or strep throat. You probably don’t think of
a brain or spinal cord infection. But bacteria and viruses can infect these organs as well as other parts of the body.
Infections of the brain and spinal cord are not very common. But when they happen, they can be very serious. That’s
why it’s important to know their symptoms.

799

11.50. Diseases of the Nervous System

www.ck12.org

Encephalitis

Encephalitis is a brain infection ( Figure 11.97).
If you have encephalitis, you are likely to have a fever and
headache or feel drowsy and confused. The disease is most often caused by viruses. The immune system tries to
ﬁght off a brain infection, just as it tries to ﬁght off other infections. But sometimes this can do more harm than
good. The immune system’s response may cause swelling in the brain. With no room to expand, the brain pushes
against the skull. This may injure the brain and even cause death. Medicines can help ﬁght some viral infections of
the brain, but not all infections.

FIGURE 11.97
This scan shows a person with encephali-
tis.

Meningitis

Meningitis is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. If you have meningitis, you are
likely to have a fever and a headache. Another telltale symptom is a stiff neck. Meningitis can be caused by viruses
or bacteria. Viral meningitis often clears up on its own after a few days. Bacterial meningitis is much more serious
( Figure 11.98). It may cause brain damage and death. People with bacterial meningitis need emergency medical
treatment. They are usually given antibiotics to kill the bacteria.
A vaccine to prevent meningitis recently became available. It can be given to children as young as two years old.
Many doctors recommend that children receive the vaccine no later than age 12 or 13, or before they begin high
school.

FIGURE 11.98
These bacteria, shown at more than
1,000 times their actual size, are the
cause of bacterial meningitis. Despite
their tiny size, they can cause very serious
illness.

Reye’s Syndrome

A condition called Reye’s syndrome can occur in young people that take aspirin when they have a viral infection.
The syndrome causes swelling of the brain and may be fatal. Fortunately, Reye’s syndrome is very rare. The best
way to prevent it is by not taking aspirin when you have a viral infection. Products like cold medicines often contain
aspirin. So, read labels carefully when taking any medicines ( Figure 11.99).

FIGURE 11.99
Since 1988, the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration has required that all aspirin
and aspirin-containing products carry a
warning about Reye’s syndrome.

Other Nervous System Diseases

Like other parts of the body, the nervous system may develop tumors. A tumor is a mass of cells that grows out of
control. A tumor in the brain may press on normal brain tissues. This can cause headaches, difﬁculty speaking, or
other problems, depending on where the tumor is located. Pressure from a tumor can even cause permanent brain
damage. In many cases, brain tumors can be removed with surgery. In other cases, tumors can’t be removed without
damaging the brain even more. In those cases, other types of treatments may be needed.
Cerebral palsy is a disease caused by injury to the developing brain. The injury occurs before, during, or shortly
after birth. Cerebral palsy is more common in babies that have a low weight at birth. But the cause of the brain
injury is not often known. The disease usually affects the parts of the brain that control body movements. Symptoms

801

11.50. Diseases of the Nervous System

www.ck12.org

range from weak muscles in mild cases to trouble walking and talking in more severe cases. There is no known cure
for cerebral palsy.
Epilepsy is a disease that causes seizures. A seizure is a period of lost consciousness that may include violent muscle
contractions. It is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The cause of epilepsy may be an infection, a
brain injury, or a tumor. The seizures of epilepsy can often be controlled with medicine. There is no known cure for
the disease, but children with epilepsy may outgrow it by adulthood.
A headache is a very common nervous system problem. Headaches may be a symptom of serious diseases, but they
are more commonly due to muscle tension. A tension headache occurs when muscles in the shoulders, neck, and
head become too tense. This often happens when people are “stressed out.” Just trying to relax may help relieve this
type of headache. Mild pain relievers such as ibuprofen may also help.

be triggered by certain foods, bright lights, weather changes, or other factors. People with migraines may also have
nausea or other symptoms. Fortunately, migraines can often be relieved with prescription drugs.
There are many other nervous system diseases. They include multiple sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. However, these diseases rarely, if ever, occur in young people. Their causes and

• Explain how the nervous system can be injured.
• Deﬁne concussion.
• List symptoms of a severe brain injury.
• Describe what to do if you suspect that someone has a back or neck injury.

No diving?
Make sure you always heed the advice of signs that say "no diving." Diving in shallow water can lead to serious
injuries to your nervous system.

Injuries of the Nervous System

Injuries to the central nervous system may damage tissues of the brain or spinal cord. If an injury is mild, a person
may have a full recovery. If an injury is severe, it may cause permanent disability or even death. Brain and spinal
cord injuries most commonly occur because of car crashes or sports accidents. The best way to deal with such
injuries is to try to prevent them.

Brain Injuries

Brain injuries can range from mild to extremely severe, but even mild injuries need medical attention. Brain injuries
can result from falls, car accidents, violence, sports injuries, and war and combat. Falls are the most common cause
of brain injuries, particularly in older adults and young children.
The mildest and most common type of brain injury is a concussion. This is a bruise on the surface of the brain. It
may cause temporary problems such as headache, drowsiness, and confusion. Most concussions in young people
occur when they are playing sports, especially contact sports like football. Other sports, like soccer, boxing, baseball,

804

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

lacrosse, skateboarding, and hockey can also result in concussions. A concussion normally heals on its own in a few
days.
A single concussion is unlikely to cause permanent damage. But repeated concussions may lead to lasting problems.
People who have had two or more concussions may have life-long difﬁculties with memory, learning, speech, or
balance. For this reason, concussions are treated very seriously among athletes and in professional sports. You can
see an animation of how a concussion occurs by visiting http://www.pennmedicine.org/encyclopedia/em_DisplayA
nimation.aspx?gcid=000034&ptid=17 .
A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur
when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An
object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury.
As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of
the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities
such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover
from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.
Symptoms of severe brain injuries include

• the loss of consciousness from several minutes to hours,
• profound confusion,
• slurred speech,
• the inability to awaken from sleep,
• seizures,
• loss of coordination,
• persistent headache or headache that worsens.

Spinal Cord Injuries

A spinal cord injury is damage to any part of the spinal cord or nerves at the end of the spinal canal. This injury
often causes permanent changes in strength, sensation and other body functions below the site of the injury.
Spinal cord injuries make it difﬁcult for messages to travel between the brain and body. They may cause a person
to lose the ability to feel or move parts of the body. This is called paralysis. Whether paralysis occurs—and what
parts of the body are affected if it does—depends on the location and seriousness of the injury. In addition to car
crashes and sports injuries, diving accidents are a common cause of spinal cord injuries. Quadriplegia means your
arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury. Paraplegia means the paralysis
affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs. These people can still use their arms and hands.
Some people recover from spinal cord injuries. But many people are paralyzed for life. Thanks to the work of
Christopher Reeve ( Figure 11.101), more research is being done on spinal cord injuries now than ever before. For
example, scientists are trying to discover ways to regrow damaged spinal cord neurons.
If you suspect that someone has a back or neck injury:

• don’t move the injured person as permanent paralysis and other serious complications may result,
• call 911 or your local emergency medical assistance number,
• keep the person very still,
• place heavy towels on both sides of the neck or hold the head and neck to prevent them from moving, until

emergency care arrives,

• provide basic ﬁrst aid, such as stopping any bleeding and making the person comfortable, without moving the

head or neck.

11.52 Keeping the Nervous System Healthy

• List ways to keep the nervous system healthy.
• List safe behaviors that will help keep your nervous system safe.

Do you like doing puzzles?
Activities that challenge your brain, such as working on a Sudoku puzzle, are good for the health of your nervous
system. Just like you need to work out your body to stay in shape, your brain also needs a good work out regularly
in order to stay sharp.

Keeping the Nervous System Healthy

The nervous system is such an important part of your body. You want it to work at its best so that you can be at your
best. Your nervous system contains what is probably the most important part of your body, which, of course, is your
brain. Your brain allows you to learn. It allows you to feel emotions like love, anger, and sadness. Your brain gives
you the ability to see, hear, taste, touch, and smell. It works together with the nerves and spinal cord to send the
signals that make your body move. Your nervous system lets you do things like run, jump, play sports, and do your
homework.
There are many choices you can make to keep your nervous system healthy. One obvious choice is to avoid using
alcohol or other drugs. Not only will you avoid the injury that drugs themselves can cause, but you will also be
less likely to get involved in other risky behaviors that could harm your nervous system. Another way to keep
the nervous system healthy is to eat a variety of healthy foods. The minerals sodium, calcium, and potassium,
and vitamins B1 and B12 are important for a healthy nervous system. Some foods that are good sources for these
minerals and vitamins include milk, whole grains, beef steak, and kidney beans (shown in Figure 11.102). Your

807

11.52. Keeping the Nervous System Healthy

www.ck12.org

brain also needs healthy fats like those in nuts and ﬁsh. Recall that fats insulate the axons of neurons. These fats
help build new connections between nerves and brain cells. These fats may improve memory and increase learning
and intelligence. Water is also important for the nervous system, so drink plenty of water and other ﬂuids. This helps
prevent dehydration, which can cause confusion and memory problems. And get plenty of rest. Your brain requires
plenty of rest so it can strengthen circuits that help with memory. A good night’s sleep will help keep your brain
functioning at its best.

FIGURE 11.102
These foods are sources of nutrients needed for a healthy nervous system.

Daily physical activity is also important for nervous system health. Regular exercise makes your heart more efﬁcient
at pumping blood to your brain. As a result, your brain gets more oxygen, which it needs to function normally. The
saying “use it or lose it” applies to your brain as well as your body. This means that mental activity, not just physical
activity, is important for nervous system health. Doing crossword puzzles, reading, and playing a musical instrument
are just a few ways you can keep your brain active.
You can also choose to practice safe behaviors to protect your nervous system from injury. To keep your nervous
system safe, choose to:

• Wear safety goggles or sunglasses to protect your eyes from injury.

808

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

• Wear hearing protectors, such as ear plugs to protect your ears from loud sounds.
• Wear a safety helmet for activities like bike riding and skating ( Figure 11.103).
• Wear a safety belt every time you ride in a motor vehicle.
• Avoid unnecessary risks, such as performing dangerous stunts on your bike.
• Never dive into water that is not approved for diving. If the water is too shallow, you could seriously injure

your brain or spinal cord. A few minutes of fun could turn into a lifetime in a wheelchair.

FIGURE 11.103
Bicycle helmets help protect from head
injuries. Making healthy choices like this
can help prevent nervous system injuries
that could cause lifelong disability.

Furthermore, make sure to exercise your nervous system on a daily basis. The simple act of writing requires that
you use all the major components of your motor and sensory pathways. These include a number of different sensory
receptors, peripheral nerves, synaptic connections within your spinal cord, major tracts within your spinal cord, and
nerve tissue throughout your brain. All these components need to be utilized with great precision and coordination
to produce neatly written words. What should you do? Spend a few minutes each day writing on paper as neatly
as you can. This takes a lot more effort on the part of the nervous system than typing on a keyboard, as typing on
a keyboard doesn’t require as much ﬁne motor control as writing on paper. If you don’t want to write, then draw.
Drawing with precision also requires use of all the major components of the sensory and motor divisions of the
nervous system.

Summary

• The minerals, calcium and potassium, and vitamins B1 and B12 are important for a healthy nervous system.
• You can make choices that will help keep your nervous system healthy and safe, such as choosing to wear a

bicycle helmet.

11.53 Pathogens

• Deﬁne infectious disease and pathogen.
• List common causes of infectious diseases.
• Distinguish between a bacterium, a protozoa, and a fungi.
• Discuss how infectious diseases are spread.

What are germs?
You know germs can make you sick. They can live anywhere, from on your doorknob to in your food. A more
scientiﬁc word for germ is pathogen.

Pathogens

Has this ever happened to you? A student sitting next to you in class has a cold. The other student is coughing and
sneezing, but you feel ﬁne. Two days later, you come down with a cold, too. Diseases like colds are contagious.
Contagious diseases are also called infectious diseases. An infectious disease is a disease that spreads from person
to person.

811

11.53. Pathogens

www.ck12.org

Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is a living thing or virus that causes disease. Pathogens
are commonly called “germs.” They can travel from one person to another.

Types of Pathogens

Living things that cause human diseases include bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Most infectious diseases caused by
these organisms can be cured with medicines. For example, medicines called antibiotics can cure most diseases
caused by bacteria. Bacteria are one-celled organisms without a nucleus. Although most bacteria are harmless,
some cause diseases.
Worldwide, the most common disease caused by bacteria is tuberculosis (TB). TB is a serious disease of the lungs.
Another common disease caused by bacteria is strep throat. You may have had strep throat yourself. Bacteria that
cause strep throat are shown below ( Figure 11.104). Some types of pneumonia and many cases of illnesses from
food are also caused by bacteria.

FIGURE 11.104
The structures that
look like strings of
beads are bacteria.
They belong to
the genus Streptococcus. Bacteria of
this genus cause diseases such as strep
throat and pneumonia. They are shown
here 900 times bigger than their actual
size.

Fungi are simple eukaryotic organisms that consist of one or more cells. They include mushrooms and yeasts.
Human diseases caused by fungi include ringworm and athlete’s foot. Both are skin diseases that are not usually
serious. A ringworm infection is pictured below ( Figure 11.105). A more serious fungus disease is histoplasmosis.
It is a lung infection. Though fungal infections can be annoying, they are rarely as serious or deadly as bacterial or
viral infections.

FIGURE 11.105
Ringworm isn’t a worm at all.
fungus causes a ring-shaped rash on the skin, like the one shown here.

It’s a disease caused by a fungus. The

Protozoa are one-celled organisms with a nucleus, making them eukaryotic organisms. They cause diseases such as
malaria. Malaria is a serious disease that is common in warm climates. The protozoa infect people when they are bit

by a mosquito. More than a million people die of malaria each year. Other protozoa cause diarrhea. An example is
Giardia lamblia ( Figure 11.106).

FIGURE 11.106
This picture shows a one-celled organism called Giardia lamblia.
protozoan that causes diarrhea.

It is a

Viruses are nonliving collections of protein and DNA that must reproduce inside of living cells. Viruses cause many
common diseases. For example, viruses cause colds and the ﬂu. Cold sores are caused by the virus Herpes simplex
( Figure 11.107). Antibiotics do not affect viruses, because antibiotics only kill bacteria. But medicines called
antiviral drugs can treat many diseases caused by viruses. Keep in mind that viruses are nonliving, so can they be
killed?

FIGURE 11.107
The Herpes simplex virus, which is rep-
resented here, causes cold sores on the
lips. Viruses are extremely small parti-
cles. This illustration is greatly magniﬁed.

813

11.53. Pathogens

How Pathogens Spread

www.ck12.org

Different pathogens spread in different ways. Some pathogens spread through food. They cause food borne illnesses,
which are discussed in a previous concept. Some pathogens spread through water. Giardia lamblia is one example.
Water can be boiled to kill Giardia and most other pathogens.
Several pathogens spread through sexual contact. HIV is one example, which is discussed in the next concept. Other
pathogens that spread through sexual contact are discussed in a separate concept.
Many pathogens that cause respiratory diseases spread by droplets in the air. Droplets are released when a person
sneezes or coughs. Thousands of tiny droplets are released when a person sneezes ( Figure 11.108). Each droplet
can contain thousands of pathogens. Viruses that cause colds and the ﬂu can spread in this way. You may get sick if
you breathe in the pathogens.

FIGURE 11.108
As this picture shows, thousands of tiny
droplets are released into the air when
a person sneezes. Each droplet may
carry thousands of pathogens. You can’t
normally see the droplets from a sneeze
because they are so small. However,
you can breathe them in, along with any
pathogens they carry. This is how many
diseases of
the respiratory system are
spread.

Pathogens on Surfaces

Other pathogens spread when they get on objects or surfaces. A fungus may spread in this way. For example, you
can pick up the fungus that causes athlete’s foot by wearing shoes that an infected person has worn. You can also
pick up this fungus from the ﬂoor of a public shower or other damp areas. After acne, athlete’s foot is the most
common skin disease in the United States. Therefore, the chance of coming in contact with the fungus in one of
these ways is fairly high.
Bacteria that cause the skin disease impetigo, which causes blisters, can spread when people share towels or clothes.
The bacteria can also spread through direct skin contact in sports like wrestling.

Pathogens and Vectors

Still other pathogens are spread by vectors. A vector is an organism that carries pathogens from one person or
animal to another. Most vectors are insects, such as ticks and mosquitoes. These insects tend to transfer protozoan
or viral parasites. When an insect bites an infected person or animal, it picks up the pathogen. Then the pathogen
travels to the next person or animal it bites. Ticks carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Mosquitoes ( Figure
11.109) carry West Nile virus. Both pathogens cause fever, headache, and tiredness. If the diseases are not treated,
more serious symptoms may develop. Other diseases spread by mosquitoes include Dengue Fever and Yellow Fever.

814

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.109
Some diseases are spread by insects.
The type of mosquito shown here can
spread West Nile virus. The virus doesn’t
make the mosquito sick. The mosquito
just carries the virus from one person or
animal to another. The mosquito is a
vector.

The ﬁrst case of West Nile virus in North America occurred in 1999. Within just a few years, the virus had spread
throughout most of the United States. Birds as well as humans can be infected with the virus. Birds often ﬂy long
distances. This is one reason why West Nile virus spread so quickly.

Summary

• Infectious diseases are caused by bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or viruses that can travel from one person to

another.

• Infectious diseases can be spread by a vector, an organism that carries pathogens from one person or animal

to another.

11.54 HIV and AIDS

• Explain how the virus known as HIV causes AIDS.
• Discuss how HIV is spread.
• Summarize the effects of HIV in the immune system.
• Describe AIDS.

What does a red ribbon symbolize?
This red ribbon is a symbol for support of HIV-positive people and those living with AIDS. As of 2010, an estimated
34 million people are living with HIV worldwide.

HIV Infection and AIDS

HIV, or human immunodeﬁciency virus, causes AIDS. AIDS stands for "acquired immune deﬁciency syndrome."
It is a condition that causes death and does not have a known cure. AIDS usually develops 10 to 15 years after a
person is ﬁrst infected with HIV. The development of AIDS can be delayed with proper medicines. The delay can
be well over 20 years with the right medicines. Today, individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age can expect
to reach an average human life span.

How HIV Spreads

HIV spreads through contact between an infected person’s body ﬂuids and another person’s bloodstream or mucus
membranes, which are found in the mouth, nose, and genital areas. Body ﬂuids that may contain HIV are blood,
semen, vaginal ﬂuid, and breast milk. The virus can spread through sexual contact or shared drug needles. It can
also spread from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth or breastfeeding. Saliva can carry the HIV virus,
but it won’t spread it, unless the saliva gets into the bloodstream. Other body ﬂuids such as urine and sweat do not
contain the virus. HIV does not spread in any ﬂuid in which the host cells cannot survive.
Some people think they can become infected with HIV by donating blood or receiving donated blood. This is not
true. The needles used to draw blood for donations are always new. Therefore, they cannot spread the virus. Donated
blood is also tested to make sure it is does not contain HIV.

817

11.54. HIV and AIDS

www.ck12.org

HIV is not transmitted by day-to-day contact in the workplace, schools, or social settings. HIV is not transmitted
through shaking hands, hugging, or a casual kiss. You cannot become infected from a toilet seat, a drinking fountain,
a door knob, dishes, drinking glasses, food, or pets.

HIV and the Immune System

How does an HIV infection develop into AIDS? HIV destroys white blood cells called helper T cells. The cells are
produced by the immune system. This is the body system that ﬁghts infections and other diseases.
HIV invades helper T cells and uses them to produce more virus particles ( Figure 11.110). Then, the virus kills the
helper T cells. As the number of viruses in the blood rises, the number of helper T cells falls. Without helper T cells,
the immune system is unable to protect the body. The infected person cannot ﬁght infections and other diseases
because they do not have T cells. This is why people do not die from HIV. Instead, they die from another illness,
like the common cold, that they cannot ﬁght because they do not have helper T cells.
Medications can slow down the increase of viruses in the blood. But the medications cannot remove the viruses from
the body. At present, there is no cure for HIV infection. A vaccine against HIV could stop this disease, and such a
vaccine is in development, though it could take many years before it can be given to prevent this virus.

FIGURE 11.110
In this picture, the large structure on the bottom is a human immune cell.
It is infected with HIV. A new HIV particle is shown budding out of the
immune cell.

AIDS

AIDS is not really a single disease. It is a set of symptoms and other diseases. It results from years of damage to the
immune system by HIV. AIDS occurs when helper T cells fall to a very low level, making it difﬁcult for the affected
person to ﬁght various diseases and other infections. These people develop infections or cancers that people with a
healthy immune systems can easily resist. These diseases are usually the cause of death of people with AIDS.
The ﬁrst known cases of AIDS occurred in 1981. Since then, AIDS has led to the deaths of more than 35 million
people worldwide. Many of them were children. The greatest number of deaths occurred in Africa. It is also where
medications to control HIV are least available. There are currently more people infected with HIV in Africa than
any other part of the world. Well over 30 million people are living with HIV worldwide.

Summary

• HIV causes AIDS by destroying disease-ﬁghting cells produced by the immune system.
• HIV spreads through contact between an infected person’s body ﬂuids and another person’s bloodstream or

mucus membranes; body ﬂuids that may contain HIV include blood, semen, vaginal ﬂuid, and breast milk.

• State and describe how infectious diseases can be prevented.

What is this girl doing to prevent the spread of the ﬂu?
Notice how this girl is covering her nose and mouth with a tissue as she sneezes. This is a good habit that helps

going out and possibly infecting others with her illness.

Preventing Infectious Diseases

Infectious diseases are diseases that spread from person to person. They are caused by pathogens such as bacteria,
viruses or fungi. What can you do to avoid infectious diseases? Eating right and getting plenty of sleep are a good
start. These habits will help keep your immune system healthy. With a healthy immune system, you will be able to
ﬁght off many pathogens. The next best way is to avoid pathogens. Though this is difﬁcult, there are steps you can
take to limit your exposure to pathogens.
Here are the ten best ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

1. Wash your hands frequently.
2. Don’t share personal items.
3. Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.
4. Get vaccinated.

Chapter 11. Human Biology

5. Use safe cooking practices.
6. Be a smart traveler.
7. Practice safe sex.
8. Don’t pick your nose (or your mouth or eyes either).
9. Exercise caution with animals.
10. Watch the news, and be aware of disease outbreaks.

Avoiding Pathogens

You can also take steps to avoid pathogens in the ﬁrst place. The best way to avoid pathogens is to wash your hands
often. You should wash your hands after using the bathroom or handling raw meat or ﬁsh. You should also wash
your hands before eating or preparing food. In addition, you should also wash the food that your eat, and the utensils
and countertop where food is prepared. In addition, you should wash your hands after being around sick people.
The correct way to wash your hands is demonstrated below ( Figure 11.111). If soap and water aren’t available, use
some hand sanitizer.

FIGURE 11.111
This picture shows the proper way to
wash your hands. Frequent hand washing
helps prevent the spread of pathogens.

The best way to prevent diseases spread by vectors is to avoid contact with the vectors. Recall that a vector is
an organism that carries pathogens from one person or animal to another. For example, ticks and mosquitoes are
vectors, so you should wear long sleeves and long pants when appropriate to avoid tick and mosquito bites. Using
insect repellent can also reduce your risk of insect bites.
Many infectious diseases can be prevented with vaccinations. Immunization can drastically reduce your chances of
contracting many diseases. You will read more about vaccinations in another concept. Vaccinations can help prevent
measles, mumps, chicken pox, and several other diseases.
If you do develop an infectious disease, try to avoid infecting others. Stay home from school until you are well.
Also, take steps to keep your germs to yourself. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you sneeze or cough,
and wash your hands often to avoid spreading pathogens to other people. Don’t go to work or school if you’re

821

11.55. Preventing Infectious Diseases

www.ck12.org

vomiting, have diarrhea or are running a fever (and if you are, drink plenty of ﬂuids). Also, to avoid infectious
diseases, don’t share personal items; use your own toothbrush, comb, and razor. And avoid sharing drinking glasses
or dining utensils.
Watching the news will allow you to make informed decisions. If an outbreak of bad beef due to a bacterial infection
is in the news, don’t buy beef for a while. If tomatoes are making people sick, don’t eat tomatoes until the outbreak
is over. If a place has an unhealthy water supply, boil the water or drink bottled water. Local news can tell you of
restaurants to avoid due to unhealthy conditions. And so on.

Summary

• A healthy lifestyle and frequent hand washing can help reduce your risk of infectious diseases.
• To avoid infecting others when you are sick, stay home from school, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue

when you sneeze or cough, and wash your hands often.

Why is tanning bad for your health?
It might be fun to lay out in the sun like these two girls are doing. But getting too much sun can be very dangerous.
Overexposure to sunlight raises your risk for skin cancer.

Cancer

Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells
from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations.
Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell
cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a
tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything
that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen. Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.

Pathogens

Pathogens that cause cancer include the human papilloma virus (HPV) ( Figure 11.112) and the hepatitis B virus.
HPV is spread through sexual contact. It can cause cancer of the reproductive system in females. The hepatitis B
virus is spread through sexual contact or contact with blood containing the virus. It can cause cancer of the liver.

FIGURE 11.112
The mutations that cause cancer may occur when people are exposed
to pathogens, such as the human papilloma virus (HPV), which is shown
here.

Chemicals

Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have
been shown to cause cancer ( Figure 11.113). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcino-
gens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco
can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and
nickel.

FIGURE 11.113
The mutations that cause cancer may oc-
cur when people are exposed to chemical
carcinogens, such as those in cigarettes.
It can be argued that tobacco smoke is the
main source of chemical carcinogens.

Radiation

Forms of radiation that cause cancer include ultraviolet (UV) radiation and radon ( Figure 11.114). UV radiation
is part of sunlight. It is the leading cause of skin cancer. Radon is a natural radioactive gas that seeps into buildings
from the ground. It can cause lung cancer.

Common Types of Cancer

Cancer is usually found in adults, especially in adults over the age of 50. The most common type of cancer in adult
males is cancer of the prostate gland. The prostate gland is part of the male reproductive system. Prostate cancer
makes up about one third of all cancers in men. The most common type of cancer in adult females is breast cancer. It
makes up about one third of all cancers in women. In both men and women, lung cancer is the second most common
type of cancer. Most cases of lung cancer happen in people who smoke.
Cancer can also be found in children. But childhood cancer is rare. Leukemia is the main type of cancer in children.
It makes up about one third of all childhood cancers. It happens when the body makes abnormal white blood cells.
Sometimes cancer cells break away from a tumor. If they enter the bloodstream, they are carried throughout the
body. Then, the cells may start growing in other tissues. This is usually how cancer spreads from one part of the
body to another. Once this happens, cancer is very hard to stop or control.

Treating Cancer

If leukemia is treated early, it usually can be cured. In fact, many cancers can be cured, which is known as remission,
if treated early. Treatment of cancer often involves removing a tumor with surgery. This may be followed by other
types of treatments. These treatments may include drugs (known as chemotherapy) and radiation therapy, which kill
cancer cells.

826

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

The sooner cancer is treated, the greater the chances of a cure. This is why it is important to know the warning signs
of cancer. Having warning signs does not mean that you have cancer. However, you should see a doctor to be sure.
Everyone should know the warning signs of cancer. Detecting and treating cancer early can often lead to a cure.
Some warning signs of cancer include:

• Change in bowel or bladder habits.
• Sores that do not heal.
• Unusual bleeding or discharge.
• Lump in the breast or elsewhere.
• Chronic indigestion.
• Difﬁculty swallowing.
• Obvious changes in a wart or mole.
• Persistent cough or hoarseness.

• Deﬁne diabetes.
• Explain causes of diabetes.
• Distinguish type 1 diabetes from type 2 diabetes.
• List common symptoms and complications of diabetes.

What do these foods have in common?
These foods are all high in sugar. A person with diabetes has to avoid these types of foods.

Diabetes

Diabetes is a non-infectious disease in which the body is unable to control the amount of sugar in the blood. People
with diabetes have high blood sugar, either because their bodies do not produce enough insulin, or because their
cells do not respond to insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells take up sugar from the blood. Without enough
insulin, the blood contains too much sugar. This can damage blood vessels and other cells throughout the body. The
kidneys work hard to ﬁlter out and remove some of the extra sugar. This leads to frequent urination and excessive
thirst.
There are two main types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes makes up about 5-10%
of all cases of diabetes in the United States. Type 2 diabetes accounts for most of the other cases. Both types of
diabetes are more likely in people that have certain genes. Having a family member with diabetes increases the risk
of developing the disease.
Either type of diabetes can increase the chances of having other health problems. For example, people with diabetes
are more likely to develop heart disease and kidney disease. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are similar in these ways.
However, the two types of diabetes have different causes.

828

www.ck12.org

Type 1 Diabetes

Chapter 11. Human Biology

Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system attacks normal cells of the pancreas. Since the cells in the pancreas
are damaged, the pancreas cannot make insulin. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence.
People with type 1 diabetes must frequently check the sugar in their blood. They use a meter to monitor their blood
sugar ( Figure 11.115). Whenever their blood sugar starts to get too high, they need a shot of insulin. The insulin
brings their blood sugar back to normal. There is no cure for type 1 diabetes. Therefore, insulin shots must be taken
for life. Most people with this type of diabetes learn how to give themselves insulin shots.

FIGURE 11.115
This is one type of meter used by people with diabetes to measure their
blood sugar. Modern meters like this one need only a drop of blood and
take less than a minute to use.

Type 2 Diabetes

Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells are no longer sensitive to insulin. The pancreas may still make insulin, but
the cells of the body cannot use it efﬁciently. Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances
of developing type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes usually develops in adulthood, but it is becoming more common in
teens and children. This is because more young people are overweight, due to a high sugar and fat diet, now than
ever before.
Some cases of type 2 diabetes can be cured with weight loss. However, most people with the disease need to take
medicine to control their blood sugar. Regular exercise and balanced eating also help, and should be a regular part of
the treatment for these people. Like people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes must frequently check
their blood sugar.

Symptoms

Common symptoms of diabetes include the following:

• frequent urination
• feeling very thirsty
• feeling very hungry, even though you are eating
• extreme fatigue
• blurry vision
• cuts or bruises that are slow to heal
• weight loss, even though you are eating more (type 1)
• tingling, pain, or numbness in the hands or feet (type 2)

Summary

11.58 Autoimmune Diseases

• Deﬁne autoimmune disease and allergy.
• Give examples of autoimmune diseases.
• List common allergies.

Does pollen make you sneeze?
If so, you are not alone. It is one of the most common allergies. The runny nose and sneezing associated with
allergies results from the immune system working improperly.

Diseases of the Immune System

The immune system usually protects you from pathogens and other causes of disease. When the immune system is
working properly, it keeps you from getting sick. But the immune system is like any other system of the body. It can
break down or develop diseases.
AIDS is an infectious disease of the immune system caused by a virus. Some diseases of the immune system are
noninfectious. They include autoimmune diseases and allergies.

Autoimmune Diseases

Does it make sense for an immune system to attack the cells it is meant to protect? No, but an immune system that
does not function properly will attack its own cells. An autoimmune disease is a disease in which the immune
system attacks the body’s own cells.
One example is type 1 diabetes. In this disease, the immune system attacks cells of the pancreas. Other examples
are multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks nerve cells. This

831

11.58. Autoimmune Diseases

www.ck12.org

causes weakness and pain. In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks the cells of joints. This causes joint
damage and pain.
Autoimmune diseases cannot be cured. But they can be helped with medicines that weaken the immune system’s
attack on normal cells. Other autoimmune diseases include celiac disease (damages to the small intestine), inﬂam-
matory bowel disease (damage to the digestive tract), psoriasis (damage to the skin), and lupus (damage to the joints,
skin, kidneys, heart, and lungs).

Allergies

An allergy occurs when the immune system attacks a harmless substance that enters the body from the outside.
A substance that causes an allergy is called an allergen. It is the immune system, not the allergen, that causes the
symptoms of an allergy.
Did you ever hear of hay fever? It’s not really a fever at all. It’s an allergy to plant pollens. People with this type of
allergy have symptoms such as watery eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. A common cause of hay fever is the pollen
of ragweed. Many people are also allergic to poison ivy ( Figure 11.117). Skin contact with poison ivy leads to an
itchy rash in people who are allergic to the plant.

FIGURE 11.116
Ragweed is a common roadside weed found throughout the United States.
Many people are allergic to its pollen.

Some people are allergic to certain foods. Nuts and shellﬁsh are common causes of food allergies. Other common
causes of allergies include:

• Drugs, such as penicillin.
• Mold.
• Dust.
• The dead skin cells of dogs and cats, called dander.
• Stings of wasps and bees.

Most allergies can be treated with medicines. Medicines used to treat allergies include antihistamines and corticos-
teroids. These medicines help control the immune system when it attacks an allergen. Sometimes, allergies cause
severe symptoms, a condition known as anaphylaxis. For example, they may cause the throat to swell so it is hard to
breathe. Severe allergies may be life threatening. They require emergency medical care.

• Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks normal body cells.
• Allergies occur when the immune system attacks harmless substances that enter the body from the outside.

11.59 Preventing Noninfectious Diseases

• Deﬁne noninfectious disease.
• Describe how noninfectious diseases can be prevented.

How can you reduce your risk of developing cancer?
You can reduce your risk of developing cancer by staying away from certain hazards. For example, the use of tanning
beds can lead to skin cancer.

Preventing Noninfectious Diseases

Noninfectious diseases can’t be passed from one person to another. Instead, these types of diseases are caused by
factors such as the environment, genetics, and lifestyle. Examples of inherited noninfectious conditions include
cystic ﬁbrosis and Down syndrome.
If you’re born with these conditions, you must learn how to manage the
symptoms. Examples of conditions caused by environmental or lifestyle factors include heart disease and skin
cancer. We can’t change our genetic codes, but there are plenty of ways to prevent other noninfectious diseases. For
example, cutting down on exposure to cigarette smoke and the sun’s rays will prevent certain types of cancer.
It is a fact that most chronic noninfectious diseases can be prevented. The chronic noninfectious diseases that cause
the most deaths in many developed countries are largely preventable. These diseases are heart disease, stroke,
diabetes and cancer, and though they do have some genetic components, they also have many lifestyle components.
For example, some cancers have genetic risks, but people at high risk for cancers can have screening examinations
to catch them early or sometimes can take other steps to prevent the cancers. Heart disease, stroke and diabetes are
mostly linked to lifestyle choices, even when family history puts a person at higher risk for the diseases.
Most allergies can be prevented by avoiding the substances that cause them. For example, you can avoid pollens
by staying indoors as much as possible. You can learn to recognize plants like poison ivy and not touch them. A

835

11.59. Preventing Noninfectious Diseases

www.ck12.org

good way to remember how to avoid poison ivy is "leaves of three, let it be." Some people receive allergy shots to
help prevent allergic reactions. The shots contain tiny amounts of allergens, which are the substances that cause an
allergic reaction. After many months or years of shots, the immune system gets used to the allergens and no longer
responds to them.
Type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases cannot be prevented. But choosing a healthy lifestyle can help
prevent type 2 diabetes. Getting plenty of exercise, avoiding high-fat foods, and staying at a healthy weight can
reduce the risk of developing this type of diabetes. This is especially important for people who have family members
with the disease.
Making these healthy lifestyle choices can also help prevent some types of cancer. In addition, you can lower the
risk of cancer by avoiding carcinogens, which are substances that cause cancer. For example, you can reduce your
risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a
sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure 11.118). Some people think that tanning beds
are a safe way to get a tan. This is a myth. Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation. Any exposure to UV
radiation increases the risk of skin cancer. It doesn’t matter whether the radiation comes from tanning lamps or the
sun.
Overall, people in many developed countries are contributing to higher rates of noninfectious diseases (heart disease,
stroke, diabetes and cancer) by taking advantage of technology and social environments that encourage a less active
lifestyle, and also encourages faster and cheaper meals. For example, many children now spend more time on their
computer or watching TV then playing outdoors. The "faster and cheaper" meals are usually less healthy than other
meals. Even though many people are living longer, they can choose to live more healthily by adopting regular
exercise routines and healthy eating habits.

FIGURE 11.118
When you choose a sunscreen, select one with an SPF (sun protection
factor) of 30 or higher. Also, choose a sunscreen that protects against
both UVB and UVA radiation.

Summary

• A healthy lifestyle can help reduce your risk of developing many noninfectious diseases.
• You can lower your risk of cancer by avoiding habits that expose you to carcinogens, such as smoking and

tanning beds.

11.60 Barriers to Pathogens

• Describe the body’s ﬁrst line of defense against pathogens.
• Discuss the role of skin and mucous membranes in the ﬁrst line of defense.

What is your nose good for?
Your nose does a lot of work for you! Obviously, it helps you breathe and provides your sense of smell. But you
might not realize that your nose also helps to ﬁght off disease.

The Immune System’s First Line of Defense

It is the immune system’s job to protect the body. Your body has many ways to protect you from pathogens. Your
body’s defenses are like a castle. The outside of a castle was protected by a moat and high walls. Inside the castle,
soldiers were ready to ﬁght off any enemies that made it across the moat and over the walls. Like a castle, your body
has a series of defenses. Only pathogens that get through all the defenses can harm you.
The ﬁrst line of defence includes both physical and chemical barriers that are always ready and prepared to defend
the body from infection. Pathogens must make it past this ﬁrst line of defense to cause harm. If this defense is
broken, the second line of defense within your body is activated.
Your body’s ﬁrst line of defense is like a castle’s moat and walls. It keeps most pathogens out of your body. This is
a non-speciﬁc type of defense, in that it tries to keep all pathogens out. The ﬁrst line of defense includes different
types of barriers. Being the "ﬁrst line", it starts with the skin. The ﬁrst line also includes tears, mucus, cilia, stomach
acid, urine ﬂow, and friendly bacteria.

838

www.ck12.org

Skin and Mucous Membranes

Chapter 11. Human Biology

The skin is a very important barrier to pathogens. The skin is the body’s largest organ. In adults, it covers an area of
about 16 to 22 square feet! The skin is also the body’s most important defense against disease. It forms a physical
barrier between the body and the outside world. The skin has several layers that stack on top of each other ( Figure
11.119). The outer layer is tough and waterproof. It is very difﬁcult for pathogens to get through this layer of skin.

FIGURE 11.119
This drawing shows that
the skin has
many layers. The outer layer is so tough
that it keeps out most pathogens.

The mouth and nose are not lined with skin. Instead, they are lined with mucous membranes. Other organs that
are exposed to the outside world, including the lungs and stomach, are also lined with mucous membranes. Mucous
membranes are not tough like skin, but they have other defenses.
One defense of mucous membranes is the mucus they release. Mucus is a sticky, moist substance that covers mucous
membranes. Most pathogens get stuck in the mucus before they can do harm to the body. Many mucous membranes
also have cilia. Cilia in the lungs are pictured below ( Figure 11.120). Cilia are tiny ﬁnger-like projections. They
move in waves and sweep mucus and trapped pathogens toward body openings. When you clear your throat or blow
your nose, you remove mucus and pathogens from your body.

Chemicals

Most body ﬂuids that you release from your body contain chemicals that kill pathogens. For example, mucus, sweat,
tears, and saliva contain enzymes called lysozymes that kill pathogens. These enzymes can break down the cell
walls of bacteria to kill them.

This is what the cilia lining the lungs look like when they are magniﬁed.
Their movements constantly sweep mucus and pathogens out of the
lungs. Do they remind you of brushes?

The stomach also releases a very strong acid, called hydrochloric acid. This acid kills most pathogens that enter the
stomach in food or water. Urine is also acidic, so few pathogens can grow in it.

Helpful Bacteria

You are not aware of them, but your skin is covered by millions (or more!) of bacteria. Millions more live inside
your body. Most of these bacteria help defend your body from pathogens. How do they do it? They compete with
harmful bacteria for food and space. This prevents the harmful bacteria from multiplying and making you sick.

Summary

• Your body’s ﬁrst line of defense includes the skin and other barriers that keep pathogens out of your body.
• Most body ﬂuids that you release from your body contain chemicals that kill pathogens.

• Explain how inﬂammation helps protect you from pathogens.
• Describe the roles of white blood cells.

Have you ever sprained your ankle?
Did you notice redness and swelling near the injury? These symptoms indicate that your body is attempting to ﬁght
off infection.

The Immune System’s Second Line of Defense

The little girl pictured below ( Figure 11.121) has a scraped knee. A scrape is a break in the skin that may let
pathogens enter the body. If bacteria enter through the scrape, they could cause an infection. These bacteria would
then face the body’s second line of defense. The second line of defense is also nonspeciﬁc, ﬁghting many types of
pathogens.

Inﬂammation

The body’s second line of defense against pathogens includes the inﬂammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin
through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inﬂammation. Inﬂammation is
one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inﬂammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin
or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood
ﬂow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells
called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

FIGURE 11.121
This little girl just got her ﬁrst scraped knee. It doesn’t seem to hurt, but the
break in her skin could let pathogens enter her body. That’s why scrapes
should be kept clean and protected until they heal.

White Blood Cells

What do these white blood cells do at the site of inﬂammation? The main role of white blood cells is to ﬁght
pathogens in the body. There are actually several different kinds of white blood cells. Some white blood cells have
very speciﬁc functions. They attack only certain pathogens. Other white blood cells attack any pathogen they ﬁnd.
These white blood cells travel to areas of the body that are inﬂamed. They are called phagocytes, which means
“eating cells.” Neutrophils are a type of phagocyte. In addition to pathogens, phagocytes “eat” dead cells. They
surround the pathogens and destroy them. Sometimes it is said that the phagocyte engulfs the pathogen, and then
destroys it. This process is called phagocytosis.
White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature.
Normal human body temperature is 98.6◦F (37◦C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest
at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the
temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a
fever helps the body ﬁght infection.

Summary

• If pathogens enter your body, inﬂammation occurs.
• White blood cells called phagocytes travel to areas of the body that are inﬂamed.

• Deﬁne immune response.
• Describe the role of the lymphatic system in the immune response.
• List the lymph organs.
• Explain the roles of the lymph and lymph vessels.
• Describe the two main types of lymphocytes.

Do you still have your tonsils?
Many people have their tonsils removed because they can hold on to germs that cause throat infections. Although
sometimes they can do more harm than good, tonsils are there to help you. They trap pathogens so that they can be
destroyed before they enter farther into your body.

The Lymphatic System and the Immune Response

If pathogens get through the body’s ﬁrst two lines of defense, a third line of defense takes over. This third line of
defense involves the immune system. It is called an immune response, and is a speciﬁc type of response. The
immune system has a special response for each type of pathogen.
The immune system ( Figure 11.122) is also part of the lymphatic system—named for lymphocytes, which are
the type of white blood cells involved in an immune response. They include several lymph organs, lymph vessels,
lymph, and lymph nodes.

FIGURE 11.122
This diagram shows the parts of the im-
mune system. The immune system in-
cludes several organs and a system of
vessels that carry lymph. Lymph nodes
are located along the lymph vessels.

846

www.ck12.org

Lymph Organs

Chapter 11. Human Biology

The lymph organs are the red bone marrow, tonsils, spleen, and thymus gland. They are described below ( Figure
11.123).

FIGURE 11.123
Each lymph organ has a different job in
the immune system.

Lymph and Lymph Vessels

Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the cardiovascular system, which you can read about
in a previous concept. Lymph vessels are like blood vessels, except they move lymph instead of blood. Lymph
is a yellowish liquid that leaks out of tiny blood vessels into spaces between cells in tissues. Where there is more
inﬂammation, there is usually more lymph in tissues. This lymph may contain many pathogens.
The lymph that collects in tissues slowly passes into tiny lymph vessels. It then travels from smaller to larger lymph
vessels. Lymph is not pumped through lymph vessels like blood is pumped through blood vessels by the heart.
Instead, muscles around the lymph vessels contract and squeeze the lymph through the vessels. The lymph vessels
also contract to help move the lymph along. The lymph ﬁnally reaches the main lymph vessels in the chest. Here,
the lymph drains into two large veins. This is how the lymph returns to the bloodstream.
Before lymph reaches the bloodstream, pathogens are removed from it at lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small,
oval structures located along the lymph vessels. They act like ﬁlters. Any pathogens ﬁltered out of the lymph at
lymph nodes are destroyed by lymphocytes in the nodes.

Lymphocytes

Lymphocytes ( Figure 11.124), a type of white blood cell, are the key cells of an immune response. There are
trillions of lymphocytes in the human body. They make up about one quarter of all white blood cells. Usually, fewer
than half of the body’s lymphocytes are in the blood. The rest are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs.
There are two main types of lymphocytes:

1. B cells.

847

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 11.124
This image of a lymphocyte was made
with an electron microscope. The lym-
phocyte is shown 10,000 times its actual
size.

2. T cells.

Both types of lymphocytes are produced in the red bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow
larger. The "B" in B cells stands for “bone.” B cells grow larger in red bone marrow. The "T" in T cells stands for
“thymus.” T cells mature in the thymus gland.
B and T cells must be “switched on” in order to ﬁght a speciﬁc pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army
of cells ready to ﬁght that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize speciﬁc pathogens? Pathogens have
proteins, often located on their cell surface. These proteins are called antigens. An antigen is any protein that causes
an immune response, because it is unlike any protein that the body makes. Antigens are found on bacteria, viruses,
and other pathogens. Your body sees these as foreign, meaning they do not belong in your body.

Summary

• The immune system includes lymph organs, lymph vessels, lymph, and lymph nodes.
• Lymph organs include the red bone marrow, thymus gland, spleen, and tonsils.

• Distinguish B cells from T cells.
• Deﬁne antibody and antigen.
• Explain how B cells and T cells respond to pathogens.
• Summarize the roles of killer T cells and helper T cells.

What happens when your body recognizes an invader?
When your immune system detects an invading pathogen, it goes on the attack! Notice how this T-cell is setting out
to destroy a cancer cell.

B and T Cell Response

Some defenses, like your skin and mucous membranes, are not designed to ward off a speciﬁc pathogen. They are
just general defenders against disease. Your body also has defenses that are more specialized. Through the help of
your immune system, your body can generate an army of cells to kill that one speciﬁc pathogen.
There are two different types of speciﬁc immune responses. One type involves B cells. The other type involves T
cells. Recall that B cells and T cells are types of white blood cells that are key in the immune response. Whereas
the immune system’s ﬁrst and second line of defense are more generalized or non-speciﬁc, the immune response is
speciﬁc. It can be described as a speciﬁc response to a speciﬁc pathogen, meaning it uses methods to target just one
pathogen at a time. These methods involve B and T cells.

850

www.ck12.org

B Cell Response

Chapter 11. Human Biology

B cells respond to pathogens and other cells from outside the body in the blood and lymph. Most B cells ﬁght
infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen, a protein that
is recognized as foreign. Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms.
Each antibody can bind with just one speciﬁc type of antigen ( Figure 11.125). They ﬁt together like a lock and
key. Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. Phagocytes are
white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the
pathogen is destroyed by this process.
At any one time the average human body contains antibodies that can react with about 100,000,000 different antigens.
This means that there can be 100,000,000 different antibody proteins in the body.

FIGURE 11.125
This diagram shows how an antibody
binds with an antigen. The antibody was
produced by a B cell. It binds with just one
type of antigen. Antibodies produced by
different B cells bind with other types of
antigens. The antigen-binding sites can
vary, such that they are speciﬁc for just
one antigen.

T Cell Response

There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and helper T cells. Killer T cells destroy infected,
damaged, or cancerous body cells ( Figure 11.126). When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell,

851

11.63. B and T Cell Response

www.ck12.org

it releases poisons. The poisons make tiny holes in the cell membrane of the infected cell. This causes the cell to
burst open. Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed.

FIGURE 11.126
In this diagram, a killer T cell recognizes
a body cell
infected with a virus. After
the killer T cell makes contact with the in-
fected cell, it releases poisons that cause
the infected cell to burst. This kills both
the infected cell and the viruses inside it.

Helper T cells do not destroy infected or damaged body cells. But they are still necessary for an immune response.
They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by helper T cells “switch
on” both B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and ﬁght speciﬁc pathogens.

• B cells produce antibodies against pathogens in the blood and lymph.
• Killer T cells destroy body cells infected with pathogens.

11.64 Immunity

• Deﬁne immunity and vaccination.
• Describe immunity and how vaccinations work.

Is this child more fortunate than many children?
You may not feel lucky to get a shot. But you are very lucky to be able to get vaccinations. In many parts of the
world, children do not get routine vaccinations. In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 1.5
million children under the age of 5 died from diseases that are preventable with vaccinations.

Immunity and Vaccination

In previous concepts, you learned about B and T cells, special types of white blood cells that help your body to ﬁght
off a speciﬁc pathogen. They are necessary when the body is ﬁghting off an infection. But what happens to them
after the pathogen has been destroyed?
Most B and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control. But some of them survive for many years.
They may even survive for a person’s lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called memory cells. They allow
the immune system to “remember” the pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again,
the memory cells will start dividing in order to ﬁght the pathogen or disease.
These dividing cells will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to ﬁght the pathogen. They will begin a
faster, stronger attack than the ﬁrst time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system will be
able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection. Being able to attack the pathogen in this way is called
immunity.
Immunity can also be caused by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to a pathogen on
purpose in order to develop immunity. In vaccination, a modiﬁed pathogen is usually injected under the skin by a
shot. Only part of the pathogen is injected, or a weak or dead pathogen is used. It sounds dangerous, but the shot

854

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

prepares your body for ﬁghting the pathogen without causing the actual illness. Vaccination triggers an immune
response against the injected antigen. The body prepares "memory" cells for use at a later time, in case the antigen is
ever encountered again. Essentially, a vaccine imitates an infection, triggering an immune response, without making
a person sick.
In many countries, children receive their ﬁrst vaccination at birth with the Hepatitis B shot, which protects infants
from Hepatitis B, a serious liver disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now
prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are now
protected by vaccines, we do not see these diseases nearly as often. Diseases you have probably been vaccinated
against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox.

• List the functions of the male reproductive system.
• List the roles of testosterone.

Why do men and women look different?
The features that make men unique from women, such as this man’s beard, are controlled by the sex hormones. The
production of the sex hormones is a key role of the male reproductive system.

The Male Reproductive System Functions

Dogs have puppies. Cats have kittens. All organisms reproduce, obviously including humans. Like other mammals,
humans have a body system that controls reproduction. It is called the reproductive system. It is the only human
body system that is very different in males and females. The male and female reproductive systems have different
organs and different functions.
The male reproductive system has two main functions:

1. Producing sperm.
2. Releasing testosterone into the body.

Sperm are male gametes, or reproductive cells. When a male gamete meets a female gamete, they can form a new
organism. Sperm form when certain cells in the male reproductive system divide by meiosis, resulting in cells with
half the amount of DNA as a regular "body" cell. More precisely, sperm cells are haploid sex cells, having one set
of chromosomes. Regular body cells are diploid, having two set of chromosomes. As there are 46 chromosomes in
a diploid human cell, how many are in a human sperm cell?
When males grow older, they produce millions of sperm each day. The male reproductive system also maintains and
transports and delivers sperm and a protective ﬂuid, known as semen.

856

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

Testosterone is the main sex hormone in males. Hormones are chemicals that control many body processes.
Testosterone has two major roles:

• During the teen years, testosterone causes the reproductive organs to mature. It also causes other male traits

to develop. For example, it causes hair to grow on the face and allows for muscle growth.

• During adulthood, testosterone helps a man to produce sperm.

When a hormone is released into the body, we say it is "secreted." Testosterone is secreted by males, but it is not
the only sex hormone that males secrete. Males also secrete small amounts of estrogen. Even though estrogen is the
main female sex hormone, scientists think that estrogen is needed for normal sperm production in males.

FIGURE 11.127
Testosterone, the main sex hormone in
males, allows men to build larger muscles
than women.

Summary

• The main functions of the male reproductive system are to produce sperm and secrete testosterone.
• Testosterone, the main sex hormone in males, causes the reproductive organs to mature and other male traits

to develop.

What organs are unique to the male body?
Men and women share most of the same organs. We all have skin, a heart, and lungs. Men and women differ only in
their reproductive organs.

Male Reproductive Organs

The male reproductive organs include the penis, testes, and epididymis ( Figure 11.128). The ﬁgure also shows
other parts of the male reproductive system.

• The penis is a cylinder-shaped organ. It contains the urethra. The urethra is a tube that carries urine out of

the body. The urethra also carries sperm out of the body.

the
male reproductive system.
It shows the
organs from the side. Find each organ
in the drawing as you read about it in the
text.

• The two testes (singular, testis) are egg-shaped organs. They produce sperm and secrete testosterone. The
testes are found inside of the scrotum. The scrotum is a sac that hangs down outside the body. The scrotum
also contains the epididymis. The testes, being in the scrotum outside the body, allow the temperature of the
sperm to be maintained at a few degrees lower than body temperature. This is necessary for the stability of
these reproductive cells.

• The epididymis is a tube that is about six meters (20 feet) long in adults. It is tightly coiled, so it ﬁts inside the
scrotum. It rests on top of the testes. The epididymis is where sperm grow larger and mature. The epididymis
also stores sperm until they leave the body.

Other parts of the male reproductive system include the vas deferens and the prostate gland. Both of these structures
are pictured below ( Figure 11.128).

• The vas deferens is a tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
• The prostate gland secretes a ﬂuid that mixes with sperm to help form semen. The prostate gland is located
beneath the bladder. Semen is a "milky" liquid that carries sperm through the urethra and out of the body.
In addition to sperm cells, semen contains sugars (fructose) which provide energy to the sperm cells, and
enzymes and other substances which help the sperm survive.

• Summarize the steps of sperm production.

How many sperm does it take to fertilize an egg?
It might only take one sperm to fertilize an egg, but that sperm is not alone. Hundreds of millions of sperm can be
released during sexual intercourse.

Sperm and Sperm Production

Sperm ( Figure 11.129), the male reproductive cells, are tiny. In fact, they are the smallest cells in the human body.
What do you think a sperm cell looks like? Some people think that it looks like a tadpole. Do you agree?

Sperm

A sperm has three main parts:

1. The head of the sperm contains the nucleus. The nucleus holds the DNA of the cell. The head also contains

enzymes that help the sperm break through the cell membrane of an egg.

2. The midpiece of the sperm is packed with mitochondria. Mitochondria are organelles in cells that produce

energy. Sperm use the energy in the midpiece to move.

3. The tail of the sperm moves like a propeller, around and around. This tail is a long ﬂagella that pushes the
sperm forward. A sperm can travel about 30 inches per hour. This may not sound very fast, but don’t forget
how small a sperm is. For its size, a sperm moves about as fast as you do when you walk briskly.

Sperm Production

To make sperm, cells start in the testes and end in the epididymis. It takes up to two months to make sperm. The
steps are explained below:

1. Special cells in the testes go through mitosis (cell division) to make identical copies of themselves.
2. The copies of the original cells divide by meiosis, producing cells called spermatids. The spermatids have
half the number of chromosomes as the original cell. The spermatids are immature and cannot move on their
own.

3. The spermatids are transported from the testes to the epididymis. Involuntary muscular contraction moves the

spermatids along.

4. In the epididymis, spermatids slowly grow older and mature. They grow a tail. They also lose some of the

cytoplasm from the head. It is here that the spermatids mature, becoming sperm cells.

5. When sperm are mature, they can “swim.” The mature sperm are stored in the epididymis until it is time for

them to leave the body.

Sperm leave the epididymis through the vas deferens. As they travel through the vas deferens, they pass by the
prostate and other glands. The sperm mix with liquids from these glands, forming semen. The semen travels
through the urethra and leaves the body through the penis. A teaspoon of semen may contain as many as 500 million
sperm!

Summary

• Sperm are male gametes that form in the testes and mature in the epididymis.
• The head of the sperm contains the nucleus, the midpiece is packed with mitochondria, and the tail moves like

a propeller.

11.68 Female Reproductive System

• State the functions of the female reproductive system.
• List the roles of estrogen.

What causes a girl to develop into a woman?
Adult female characteristics, such as breasts, develop during the teen years. What causes this to happen? The
development of the female traits is caused by the hormones produced by the female reproductive system.

The Female Reproductive System Functions

Most of the male reproductive organs are outside of the body. But female reproductive organs are inside of the body.
The male and female organs also look very different and have different jobs. Two of the functions of the female
reproductive system are similar to the functions of the male reproductive system. The female system:

1. Produces gametes, the reproductive cells, which are called eggs in females.
2. Secretes a major sex hormone, estrogen.

One of the main roles of the female reproductive system is to produce eggs. Eggs ( Figure 11.130) are female
gametes, and they are made in the ovaries. After puberty, females release only one egg at a time. Eggs are actually
made in the body before birth, but they do not fully develop until later in life. Like sperm, eggs are produced by
meiosis, so they contain half the number of chromosomes as the original cell.
Another role of the female system is to secrete estrogen. Estrogen is the main sex hormone in females. Estrogen
has two major roles:

1. During the teen years, estrogen causes the reproductive organs to develop. It also causes other female traits to

develop. For example, it causes the breasts to grow.

864

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

2. During adulthood, estrogen is needed for a woman to release eggs. On average, a woman releases one egg

each month from her ovaries.

The female reproductive system has another important function. After puberty, the female reproductive system must
prepare itself to accept a fertilized egg each cycle (about every month). This cycle is controlled by a well-planned
and very complex interplay of hormones. If an egg is not fertilized, the system must prepare itself again the next
cycle. The female reproductive system also supports a baby as it develops before birth, and it facilitates the baby’s
birth at the end of pregnancy.

FIGURE 11.130
This represents a human egg, which is
the gamete, or reproductive cell,
in fe-
males. Notice that is does not have a
distinct shape, like a sperm cell has. The
egg is a round cell with a haploid nucleus
in the center. The egg contains most of
the cytoplasm and organelles present in
the ﬁrst cell of a new organism.

Summary

• The functions of the female reproductive system are to produce eggs, secrete estrogen, and support a baby as

it develops before birth.

• Estrogen, the main sex hormone in females, causes the female traits and reproductive organs to develop and is

needed for the release of eggs.

11.69 Female Reproductive Structures

• Deﬁne ovary, uterus, and fallopian tube.
• Identify the organs of the female reproductive system.
• Describe the functions of the female reproductive organs.

Where are the female reproductive organs?
Unlike the male reproductive organs, much of the female reproductive organs are internal. This allows them to be
well-protected by the body.

Female Reproductive Organs

The female reproductive organs include the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries ( Figure 11.131). The
breasts are not shown in this ﬁgure. They are not considered reproductive organs, even though they are involved in
reproduction. They contain mammary glands that give milk to feed a baby. The milk leaves the breast through the
nipple when the baby sucks on it.

• The vagina is a cylinder-shaped organ found inside of the female body. One end of the vagina opens at the
outside of the body. The other end joins with the uterus. During sexual intercourse, sperm may be released
into the vagina. If this occurs, the sperm will move through the vagina and into the uterus. During birth, a
baby passes from the uterus to the vagina to leave the body.

• The uterus is a hollow organ with muscular walls. The part that connects the vagina with the uterus is called
the cervix. The uterus is where a baby develops until birth. The walls of the uterus grow bigger as the baby
grows. The muscular walls of the uterus push the baby out during birth.

This drawing shows the organs of
the
female reproductive system. It shows the
organs from the side. Find each organ
in the drawing as you read about it in the
text.

• The two ovaries are small, oval organs on either side of the uterus. Each ovary contains thousands of eggs,
with about 1-2 million immature eggs present at birth and 40,000 immature eggs present at puberty, as most of
the eggs die off. The eggs do not fully develop until a female has gone through puberty. About once a month,
on average one egg completes development and is released by the ovary. The ovaries also secrete estrogen,
the main female sex hormone.

• The two fallopian tubes are narrow tubes that open off from the uterus. Each tube reaches for one of the
ovaries, but the tubes are not attached to the ovaries. The end of each fallopian tube by the ovary has “ﬁngers”
( Figure 11.131). They sweep an egg into the fallopian tube. Then the egg passes through the fallopian tube
to the uterus. If an egg is to be fertilized, this will occur in the fallopian tube. A fertilized egg then implants
into the wall of the uterus, where it begins to develop. An unfertilized egg will ﬂow through the uterus and be
excreted from the body.

Summary

• Female reproductive organs include the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.
• The ovaries release the eggs and secrete estrogen.

11.70 Human Egg Cells

• State facts associated with the egg.
• Summarize egg production.

How is egg different from sperm?
Egg and sperm are both gametes, or reproductive cells. Notice how different they are, however. The egg is much
larger than the sperm. The egg also does not have a tail. And the female only releases one egg at time, while the
male releases millions of sperm at a time.

Eggs and Egg Production

When a baby girl is born, her ovaries contain all of the eggs they will ever produce. But these eggs are not fully
developed. They develop only after she starts having menstrual periods at about age 12 or 13. Just one egg develops
each month. A woman will release an egg once each month until she is in her 40s. A girl is born with over a million
eggs. They die off and by puberty about 40,000 remain.

Eggs

Eggs are very big cells. In fact, they are the biggest cells in the human female body. (How many egg cells are in
the human male body?) An egg is about 30 times as wide as a sperm cell! You can even see an egg cell without a
microscope. Like a sperm cell, the egg contains a nucleus with half the number of chromosomes as other body cells.
Unlike a sperm cell, the egg contains a lot of cytoplasm, the contents of the cell, which is why it is so big. The egg
also does not have a tail.

870

www.ck12.org

Egg Production

Chapter 11. Human Biology

Egg production takes place in the ovaries. It takes several steps to make an egg:

1. Before birth, special cells in the ovaries go through mitosis (cell division), producing identical cells.
2. The daughter cells then start to divide by meiosis. But they only go through the ﬁrst of the two cell divisions of
meiosis at that time. They go through the second stage of cell division after the female goes through puberty.
3. In a mature female, an egg develops in an ovary about once a month. The drawing below shows how this

happens ( Figure 11.132).

As you can see from the ﬁgure, the egg rests in a nest of cells called a follicle. The follicle and egg grow larger and
go through other changes. The follicle protects the egg as it matures in the ovary.
After a couple of weeks, the egg bursts out of the follicle and through the wall of the ovary. This is called ovulation,
which usually occurs at the midpoint of a monthly cycle. In a 28 day cycle, ovulation would occur around day 14.
The moving ﬁngers of the nearby fallopian tube then sweep the egg into the tube. At this time, if sperm are present
the egg can be fertilized.

FIGURE 11.132
This diagram shows how an egg and
its follicle develop in an ovary. After it
develops, the egg leaves the ovary and
enters the fallopian tube. (1) Undeveloped
eggs, (2) Egg and follicle developing, (3)
Egg and follicle developing, (4) Ovulation.
After ovulation, what remains of the follicle
is known as the corpus luteum, which
degenerates (5, 6).

Fertilization occurs if a sperm enters the egg while it is passing through the fallopian tube. When this happens, the
egg ﬁnally completes meiosis. This results in two daughter cells that are different in size. The smaller cell is called
a polar body. It contains very little cytoplasm. It soon breaks down and disappears. The larger cell is the egg. It
contains most of the cytoplasm. This will develop into a child.

Summary

• Eggs are female gametes that form in the ovaries and are released into the fallopian tubes.
• The eggs are formed before a baby girl is born, but these eggs are not fully developed.

11.71 Menstrual Cycle

• Deﬁne menstrual cycle and menstruation.
• Outline the monthly cycle of the female reproductive system.

What happens during the menstrual cycle?
When you think of the menstrual cycle, you probably think of the discharge of blood that happens during menstrua-
tion. This is only one small part of the female monthly cycle, however.

The Female Monthly Cycle

The menstrual cycle is a series of changes in the reproductive system of mature females that repeats every month.
While the egg and follicle are developing in the ovary, tissues are building up inside the uterus, the reproductive
organ where the baby would develop. The uterus develops a thick lining covered in tiny blood vessels. This prepares
the uterus to receive an egg that could develop into a child (a fertilized egg). The occurs during the ﬁrst part of the
cycle.
Ovulation, the release of an egg from the ovary, occurs at about the midpoint of the cycle. This would be around
day 14 of a 28 day cycle. The egg is swept into the fallopian tube. If sperm is present, fertilization may occur. As

873

11.71. Menstrual Cycle

www.ck12.org

sperm can only survive in the fallopian tube for up to a few days, fertilization can only occur within those few days
post-ovulation.
If the egg is fertilized, the egg makes its way through the fallopian tube into the uterus, where it imbeds into the
thick lining. When this occurs, the monthly cycle stops. The monthly cycle does not resume until the pregnancy is
over.
If a sperm does not enter an egg, the lining of the uterus breaks down. Blood and other tissues from the lining break
off from the uterus. They pass through the vagina and out of the body. This is called menstruation. Menstruation is
also called a menstrual period. It lasts about 4 days, on average. When the menstrual period ends, the cycle repeats.
Some women feel discomfort during this process.
Some people think that the average length of a menstrual period is the same as the “normal” length. They assume
that shorter or longer menstrual periods are not normal. In fact, menstrual periods can vary from 1 to 8 days in
length. This is usually normal. The average length of the cycle (time between menstrual periods) is about 28 days,
but there is no “normal” cycle length.

FIGURE 11.133
Some women experience cramping and
pain before and during menstruation.

Summary

• The menstrual cycle is a monthly cycle of changes in the ovaries and uterus.
• During menstruation, blood and other tissues from the lining of the uterus are shed and exit the body.

11.72 Fertilization

• Deﬁne fertilization and implantation.
• Explain the process of fertilization.
• Describe the events immediately after fertilization.

Where do sperm meet the egg?
You might guess that sperm meet the egg in the uterus, the organ where the baby develops. But that is incorrect.
The sperm meet the egg in the fallopian tubes that carry the egg from the ovary to the uterus. Then the developing
embryo travels to the uterus.

Fertilization and Implantation

The sperm and egg don’t look anything like a human baby ( Figure 11.134). After they come together, they will
develop into a human being. How does a single cell become a complex organism made up of billions of cells? Keep
reading to ﬁnd out.
Sexual reproduction happens when a sperm and an egg cell combine together. This is called fertilization. Sperm
are released into the vagina during sexual intercourse. They “swim” through the uterus and enter a fallopian tube.
This is where fertilization normally takes place.
A sperm that is about to enter an egg is pictured below ( Figure 11.134). If the sperm breaks through the egg’s
membrane, it will immediately cause changes in the egg that keep other sperm out. This ensures that only a single
sperm can penetrate an egg. It will also cause the egg to go through meiosis. Recall that meiosis, cell division that
creates the egg, begins long before an egg is released from an ovary. In fact, it begins prior to birth.
The sperm and egg each have only half the number of chromosomes as other cells in the body. These cells are
haploid, with a single set of chromosomes. This is because when they combine together, they form a cell with the full
number of chromosomes. The cell they form is called a zygote. The zygote is diploid, with two sets of chromosomes,
one from each parent. A human zygote has two sets of 23 chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs).

Chapter 11. Human Biology

FIGURE 11.134
This sperm is ready to penetrate the
membrane of this egg. Notice the differ-
ence in size of the sperm and egg. Why
is the egg so much larger? The egg con-
tributes all the cytoplasm and organelles
to the zygote. The sperm only contributes
one set of chromosomes.

The zygote slowly travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus. As it travels, it divides by mitosis many times. It
forms a hollow ball of cells.
After the ball of cells reaches the uterus, it ﬁxes itself to the side of the uterus. This is called implantation. It usually
happens about a week after fertilization. Now the implanted ball of cells is ready to continue its development into a
baby boy or girl.

Summary

• Fertilization occurs when an egg and sperm come together to form a zygote.
• Implantation occurs when the developing embryo ﬁxes itself to the side of the uterus.

Does a growing embryo always look like a tiny human?
The above picture shows the very early stages of human development. Notice that, at ﬁrst, the embryo doesn’t look
very human! It takes time for the human features to take shape.

Pregnancy and Childbirth

While a woman is pregnant, the developing baby may be called an embryo or a fetus. Do these mean the same thing?
No, in the very early stages the developing baby is called an embryo, while in the later stages it is called a fetus.
When the ball of cells ﬁrst implants into the uterus, it is called an embryo. The embryo stage lasts until the end of
the 8th week after fertilization. After that point until birth, the developing baby is called a fetus.

879

Growth and Development of the Embryo

During the embryo stage, the baby grows in size.

• 3rd week after fertilization: Cells of different types start to develop. Cells that will form muscles and skin, for

example, start to develop at this time.

• 4th week after fertilization: Body organs begin to form.
• 8th week after fertilization: All the major organs have started to develop.

Pictured below are some of the changes that take place during the 4th and 8th weeks ( Figure 11.135). Look closely
at the two embryos in the ﬁgure. Do you think that the older embryo looks more human? Notice that it has arms and
legs and lacks a tail. The face has also started to form, and it is much bigger.

FIGURE 11.135

Most organs develop in the embryo during
weeks four through eight.
the
drawings of the embryos are not to scale.)

(Note:

Growth and Development of the Fetus

There are also many changes that take place after the embryo becomes a fetus. Some of the differences between
them are obvious. For example, the fetus has ears and eyelids. Its ﬁngers and toes are also fully formed. The fetus
even has ﬁngernails and toenails. In addition, the reproductive organs have developed to make the baby a male or
female. The brain and lungs are also developing quickly. The fetus has started to move around inside the uterus.
This is usually when the mother ﬁrst feels the fetus moving.
By the 28th week, the fetus is starting to look much more like a baby. Eyelashes and eyebrows are present. Hair has
started to grow on the head. The body of the fetus is also starting to ﬁll out as muscles and bones develop. Babies

880

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

born after the 28th week are usually able to survive. However, they need help breathing because their lungs are not
yet fully mature. A baby should not be delivered prior to this time, unless absolutely necessary. A baby born prior
to week 28 will need considerable medical intervention to survive.
During the last several weeks of the fetal period, all of the organs become mature. The most obvious change,
however, is an increase in body size. The fetus rapidly puts on body fat and gains weight during the last couple of
months. By the end of the 38th week, all of the organs are working, and the fetus is ready to be born. This is when
birth normally occurs. A baby born before this time is considered premature.

The Amniotic Sac and Placenta

During pregnancy, other structures also develop inside the mother’s uterus. They are the amniotic sac, placenta, and
umbilical cord ( Figure 11.136).

FIGURE 11.136
Surrounding the fetus is the ﬂuid-ﬁlled
amniotic sac. The placenta and umbilical
cord are also shown here. They provide
a connection between the mother’s and
fetus’s blood for the transfer of nutrients
and gases.

• The amniotic sac is a membrane that surrounds the fetus. It is ﬁlled with water and dissolved substances,
known as amniotic ﬂuid. Imagine placing a small plastic toy inside a balloon and then ﬁlling the balloon with
water. The toy would be cushioned and protected by the water. It would also be able to move freely inside
the balloon. The amniotic sac and its ﬂuid are like a water-ﬁlled balloon. They cushion and protect the fetus.
They also let the fetus move freely inside the uterus.

• The placenta is a spongy mass of blood vessels. Some of the vessels come from the mother. Some come from
the fetus. The placenta is attached to the inside of the mother’s uterus. The fetus is connected to the placenta
by a tube called the umbilical cord. The cord contains two arteries and a vein. Substances pass back and
forth between the mother’s and fetus’s blood through the placenta and cord. Oxygen and nutrients pass from
the mother to the fetus. Carbon dioxide passes from the fetus to the mother.

It is important for the mother to eat plenty of nutritious foods during pregnancy. She must take in enough nutrients
for the fetus as well as for herself. She needs extra calories, proteins, and lipids. She also needs more vitamins and
minerals.
In addition to eating well, the mother must avoid substances that could harm the embryo or fetus. These include
alcohol, illegal drugs, and some medicines. It is especially important for her to avoid these substances during the
ﬁrst eight weeks after fertilization. This is when all the major organs are forming. Exposure to harmful substances
during this time could damage the developing body systems.

11.73. Pregnancy and Childbirth

www.ck12.org

Childbirth

During childbirth, a baby passes from the uterus, through the vagina, and out of the mother’s body. Childbirth
usually starts when the amniotic sac breaks.
Then, the muscles of the uterus start contracting. The contractions get stronger and closer together. They may go
on for hours. Eventually, the contractions squeeze the baby out of the uterus. Once the baby enters the vagina, the
mother starts pushing. She soon pushes the baby through the vagina and out of her body.
As soon as the baby is born, the umbilical cord is cut. After the cord is cut, the baby can no longer get rid of carbon
dioxide through the cord and placenta. As a result, carbon dioxide builds up in the baby’s blood. This triggers the
baby to start breathing. The amniotic sac and placenta pass through the vagina and out of the body shortly after the
birth of the baby.

Summary

• A zygote develops into an embryo and then a fetus.

11.74 Infancy and Childhood

• Deﬁne infancy and childhood.
• List important developments of infancy.
• List milestones that occur during the ﬁrst few years of childhood.

Does a baby learn much during his ﬁrst year?
The ﬁrst years of life are full of important milestones as new skills are mastered. For example, at ﬁrst this baby
wasn’t even able to roll over on his stomach or hold up his head!

Infancy and Childhood

The ﬁrst year after birth is called infancy. Infancy is a period when the baby grows very fast. During infancy, the
baby doubles in length and triples in weight. Other important changes also happen during infancy:

• The baby’s teeth start to come in, usually at about six months of age ( Figure 11.137).
• The baby starts smiling, paying attention to other people, and grabbing toys.
• The baby begins making babbling sounds. By the end of the ﬁrst year, the baby is starting to say a few words,

such as “mama” and “dada.”

• The baby learns to sit, crawl, and stand. By the end of the ﬁrst year, the baby may be starting to walk.

Childhood begins after the baby’s ﬁrst birthday and continues until the teen years. Between one and three years of
age, a child is called a toddler. During the toddler stage, growth is still fast, but not as fast as it was during infancy.
A toddler learns many new words. The child even starts putting together words in simple sentences. Motor skills
also develop quickly during this stage. By age three, most children can run and climb steps. They can hold crayons
and scribble with them. They can also feed themselves and use the toilet.

FIGURE 11.137
This baby’s teeth have started to come
in. Babies often chew on toys or other
objects when they are getting new teeth.
They may even chew on their toes.

From age three until the teens, growth is slower. The body also changes shape. The arms and legs get longer
compared to the trunk. Children continue to develop new motor skills. For example, many young children learn how
to ride a tricycle and then a bicycle. Most also learn how to play games and sports ( Figure 11.138). By age six,
children start losing their baby teeth. Their permanent teeth begin coming in to replace them. They also start school
and learn how to read and write. They develop friendships and become less dependent on their parents.

Early Childhood Development

There are numerous milestones that occur during the ﬁrst few years of childhood. These include

• the use of language,
• walking and running,
• understanding simple concepts,
• pretend play,

11.75 Puberty and Adolescence

• Deﬁne puberty and adolescence.
• Outline changes that occur during puberty and adolescence.

How do you know you are entering puberty?
The ﬁrst signs of puberty appear at different times for different people. A boy might realize he’s reached puberty
when he starts needing to shave. A girl, on the other hand, starts getting her menstrual period during puberty.

Puberty and Adolescence

Puberty is the stage of life when a child becomes sexually mature. Puberty lasts from about 12 to 18 years of age
in boys and from about 10 to 16 years of age in girls. The age when puberty begins is different from one child to

887

11.75. Puberty and Adolescence

www.ck12.org

another. Children that begin puberty much earlier or later than their peers may feel self-conscious. They may also
worry that something is wrong with them. Usually, an early or late puberty is perfectly normal.
In boys, puberty begins when the pituitary gland tells the testes to secrete testosterone. Testosterone causes the
following to happen:

1. The penis and testes grow.
2. The testes start making sperm.
3. Pubic and facial hair grow.
4. The shoulders broaden, and the voice becomes deeper.

In girls, puberty begins when the pituitary gland tells the ovaries to secrete estrogen. Estrogen causes the following
to happen:

1. The uterus and ovaries grow.
2. The ovaries start releasing eggs.
3. The menstrual cycle begins.
4. Pubic hair grows.
5. The hips widen, and the breasts develop.

Boys and girls are close to the same height during childhood. In both boys and girls, growth in height and weight
is very fast during puberty. But boys grow faster than girls during puberty. Their period of fast growth also lasts
longer. By the end of puberty, boys are an average of 10 centimeters (4 inches) taller than girls.

Adolescence

Adolescence is the period of life between the start of puberty and the beginning of adulthood. Adolescence includes
the physical changes of puberty. It also includes many other changes, including signiﬁcant mental, emotional, and
social changes. During adolescence:

• Teenagers develop new thinking abilities. For example, they can think about abstract ideas, such as freedom.

They are also better at thinking logically. They are usually better at solving problems as well.

• Teenagers try to establish a sense of who they are as individuals. They may try to become more independent
from their parents. Most teens also have emotional ups and downs. This is partly due to changing hormone
levels.

• Teenagers usually spend much more time with peers than with family members.

Summary

• A child becomes sexually mature during puberty.
• Adolescence includes the physical changes of puberty among other changes.

11.76 Adulthood and Aging

• Distinguish early adulthood from middle adulthood and from late adulthood.
• Describe changes that begin in middle adulthood.
• Summarize issues associated with late adulthood.

What does adulthood mean to you?
You might think sometimes that you can’t wait to be an adult! In adulthood you have greater freedom, but you also
have greater responsibilities. Like this man, you might have a house and children to take care of.

Adulthood

When is a person considered an adult? That depends. Most teens become physically mature by the age of 16 or so.
But they are not adults in a legal sense until they are older. For example, in the U.S., you must be 18 to vote. Once
adulthood begins, it can be divided into three stages: (1) early, (2) middle, and (3) late adulthood.

Early Adulthood

Early adulthood starts at age 18 or 21. It continues until the mid-30s. During early adulthood, people are at their
physical peak. They are also usually in good health. The ability to have children is greatest during early adulthood,
as well. This is the stage of life when most people complete their education. They are likely to begin a career or take
a full-time job. Many people also marry and start a family during early adulthood.

Middle Adulthood

Middle adulthood begins in the mid-30s. It continues until the mid-60s.

890

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

During middle adulthood, people start to show signs of aging. Their hair slowly turns gray. Their skin develops
wrinkles. The risk of health problems also increases during middle adulthood. For example, heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes become more common during this time. This is the stage of life when people are most likely to achieve
career goals. Their children also grow up and may leave home during this stage.

Late Adulthood

Late adulthood begins in the mid-60s. It continues until death. This is the stage of life when most people retire
from work. They are also likely to reﬂect on their life. They may focus on their grandchildren.
During late adulthood, people are not as physically able. For example, they usually have less muscle and slower
reﬂexes. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, they have a harder time ﬁghting
diseases like the ﬂu. The risk of developing diseases such as heart disease and cancer continues to rise. Arthritis
is also common. In arthritis, joints wear out and become stiff and painful. As many as one in four late adults may
develop Alzheimer’s disease. In this disease, brain changes cause mental abilities to decrease.

FIGURE 11.140
This family picture shows females in each
of the three stages of life. Which stage
does each represent?

Despite problems such as these, many people remain healthy and active into their 80s or even 90s. Do you want to
be one of them? Then adopt a healthy lifestyle now and follow it for life. Doing so will increase your chances of
staying healthy and active to an old age. Exercising the body and brain help prevent the physical and mental effects
of aging.

Summary

• Adulthood is divided into the stages of early, middle, and late adulthood.
• The risk of health problems increases in middle adulthood and late adulthood.

11.77 Sexually Transmitted Infections

• Deﬁne sexually transmitted infection.
• State common myths and facts about STIs.
• List common bacterial and viral STIs.
• Describe common sexually transmitted infections.

What is safe sex?
Safe sex is sexual activity engaged in by people who have taken precautions to protect themselves against sexually
transmitted infections. Abstaining from sexual activity, however, is the only way to be absolutely sure that you won’t
get a sexually transmitted infection.

Sexually Transmitted Infections

A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that spreads through sexual contact. STIs are caused by
pathogens, a living thing or virus that causes infection. The pathogens enter the body through the reproductive
organs. Many STIs also spread through body ﬂuids, such as blood. For example, a shared tattoo needle is one way
an STI could spread. Some STIs can also spread from a mother to her baby during childbirth.
STIs are more common in teens and young adults than in older people. One reason is that young people are more
likely to take risks. They also may not know how STIs spread. They are likely to believe myths about STIs ( Table
11.9).

893

11.77. Sexually Transmitted Infections

www.ck12.org

TABLE 11.9: Myths and Facts about STIs

Myth
If you are sexually active with just one person, you
can’t get STIs.
If you don’t have any symptoms, then you don’t have
an STI.
Getting STIs is no big deal, because STIs can be cured
with medicine.

Fact
The only way to avoid the risk of STIs is to practice
abstinence from sexual activity.
Many STIs do not cause symptoms, especially in fe-
males.
Only some STIs can be cured with medicine; other STIs
cannot be cured.

Most STIs are caused by bacteria or viruses. STIs caused by bacteria usually can be cured with drugs called
antibiotics. But antibiotics are not effective against viruses. Therefore, STIs caused by viruses are not treated
with antibiotics. Other drugs may be used to help control the symptoms of viral STIs, but they cannot be cured.
Once you have a viral STI, you are usually infected for life.

Bacterial STIs

In the U.S., chlamydia is the most common STI caused by bacteria. Females are more likely than males to develop
the infection. Rates of chlamydia among U.S. females in 2006 are shown below ( Figure 11.141). Rates were much
higher in teens and young women than in other age groups.
Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also cause a discharge (leaking of ﬂuids) from the
vagina or penis. But in many cases it causes no symptoms. As a result, people do not know they are infected, so
they don’t go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It
may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections may leave a woman unable to have
children.

FIGURE 11.141
This graph shows data on the number
of cases of chlamydia in U.S. males and
females in 2009. Which two age groups
had the highest rates of chlamydia? Why
do you think rates were highest in these
age groups?

Gonorrhea is another common STI. Gonorrhea may cause pain during urination. It may also cause a discharge
from the vagina or penis. On the other hand, some people with gonorrhea have no symptoms. As a result, they don’t
seek treatment. Without treatment, gonorrhea may lead to infection of other reproductive organs. This can happen
in males as well as females.
Syphilis is a very serious STI. Luckily, it is less common than chlamydia or gonorrhea. Syphilis usually begins with
a small sore on the genitals. This is followed a few months later by a rash and ﬂu-like symptoms. If syphilis is not
treated, it may damage the heart, brain, and other organs. It can even cause death.

Viral STIs

Chapter 11. Human Biology

Genital warts are an STI caused by human papilloma virus, or HPV. They are one of the most common STIs in
teenagers. HPV infections cannot be cured. But a new vaccine called Gardasil® can prevent most HPV infections in
females. Many doctors recommend that females between the ages of 9 and 26 years receive the vaccine. Preventing
HPV infections in females is important because HPV can also cause cancer of the cervix.
A related herpes virus causes cold sores on the lips ( Figure 11.142). Both viruses cause painful blisters. In the case
of genital herpes, the blisters are on the penis or around the vaginal opening. The blisters go away on their own,
but the virus remains in the body. The blisters may come back repeatedly, especially when a person is under stress.
There is no cure for genital herpes. But drugs can help prevent or shorten outbreaks. Researchers are trying to ﬁnd
a vaccine to prevent genital herpes.

FIGURE 11.142
This lip blister, or cold sore, is caused by a
herpes virus. The virus is closely related
to the virus that causes genital herpes.
The genital herpes virus causes similar
blisters on the genitals. If you’ve ever had
a cold sore, you know how painful they
can be. Genital herpes blisters are also
painful.

Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual
activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its
own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages
the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a
vaccine to protect against hepatitis B.
HIV stands for "human immunodeﬁciency virus." It is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV and AIDS are described in
a previous concept. HIV can spread through sexual contact. It can also spread through body ﬂuids such as blood.
There is no cure for HIV infection, and AIDS can cause death, although AIDS can be delayed for several years with
medication. Researchers are trying to ﬁnd a vaccine to prevent HIV infection.

Summary

• Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by pathogens. They spread through sexual contact or other

exchanges of body ﬂuids.

• Examples of STIs caused by bacteria include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.
• Examples of STIs caused by viruses include HPV, genital herpes, hepatitis B, and AIDS.

11.78 Non-Infectious Reproductive System Dis-

orders

• Identify and describe non-STI reproductive system disorders.
• List facts associated with breast cancer.

Why should women perform a monthly breast self-exam?
If you are a young woman, getting in the habit of performing a monthly breast self-exam is a good idea. Lumps or
other subtle changes in the breasts may indicate breast cancer. The outcome is typically better if breast cancer is
caught and treated early.

Other Reproductive System Disorders

Many disorders of the reproductive system are not sexually transmitted infections. They are not caused by pathogens,
so they don’t spread from person to person. They develop for other reasons. The disorders are different between
males and females. In both genders, the disorders could cause a little discomfort, or they could cause death.

Disorders in Males

Most common disorders of the male reproductive system involve the testes. For example, injuries to the testes are
very common. In teenagers, injuries to the testes most often occur while playing sports. An injury such as a strike

897

11.78. Non-Infectious Reproductive System Disorders

www.ck12.org

or kick to the testes can be very painful. It may also cause bruising and swelling. Such injuries do not usually last
very long.
Another disorder of the testes is cancer. Cancer of the testes is most common in males aged 15 to 35. It occurs
when cells in the testes grow out of control. The cells form a lump called a tumor. If found early, cancer of the testes
usually can be easily cured with surgery.

Disorders in Females

Disorders of the female reproductive system may affect the vagina, uterus, or ovaries. They may also affect the
breasts.
One of the most common disorders is vaginitis. This is redness and itching of the vagina. It may be due to irritation
by soap or bubble bath. Another possible cause of vaginitis is a yeast infection. Yeast normally grow in the vagina.
A yeast infection happens when the yeast multiply too fast and cause symptoms. A yeast infection can be treated
with medication.

FIGURE 11.143
Bubble baths may be fun, but for women
and girls they can cause irritation to the
vagina.

A common disorder of the ovaries is an ovarian cyst. A cyst is a sac ﬁlled with ﬂuid or other material. An ovarian
cyst is usually harmless, but it may cause pain. Most cysts slowly disappear and do not need treatment. Very large
or painful cysts can be removed with surgery.
Many teen girls have painful menstrual periods. They typically have cramping in the lower abdomen. Generally,
this is nothing to worry about. Taking a warm bath or using a heating pad often helps. Exercise can help as well. A
pain reliever like ibuprofen may also work. If the pain is severe, a doctor can prescribe stronger medicine to relieve
the pain.
The most common type of cancer in females is breast cancer. The cancer causes the cells of the breast to grow out
of control and form a tumor. Breast cancer is rare in teens. It becomes more common as women get older. If breast
cancer is found early, it usually can be cured with surgery.

Summary

• In males, disorders of the reproductive system include injuries to the testes and cancer of the testes.
• In females, disorders of the reproductive system include vaginitis and breast cancer.

What protective equipment do these boys need?
Along with shin guards, a protective cup is useful in preventing injuries. A kicked ball or kick to the groin can really
hurt. Wearing a protective cup also prevents a potentially serious injury to the testes.

Keeping the Reproductive System Healthy

As was discussed in previous concepts, both infectious and noninfectious diseases of the reproductive system can
be very serious. But there are ways to keep your reproductive system healthy. What can you do to keep your
reproductive system healthy? You can start by making the right choices for overall good health. To be as healthy as
you can be, you should:

• Eat a balanced diet that is high in ﬁber and low in fat.
• Drink plenty of water.
• Get regular exercise.
• Maintain a healthy weight.
• Get enough sleep.
• Avoid using tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs.
• Manage stress in healthy ways.

Keeping your genitals clean is also very important. A daily shower or bath is all that it takes. Females do not need
to use special feminine hygiene products. In fact, using them may do more harm than good because they can irritate
the vagina or other reproductive structures.
You should also avoid other behaviors that can put you at risk. Do not get into contact with another person’s blood
or other body ﬂuids. For example, never get a tattoo or piercing unless you are sure that the needles have not been

900

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Human Biology

used before. This is one of the most important ways to prevent an STI. Of course, the only way to be fully protected
against STIs is to refrain from sexual activity.
If you are a boy, you should always wear a protective cup when you play contact sports. Contact sports include
football, boxing, and hockey. Wearing a cup will help protect the testes from injury. You should also do a monthly
self-exam to check for cancer of the testes.
If you are a girl and use tampons, be sure to change them every four to six hours. Leaving tampons in for too long
can put you at risk of toxic shock syndrome. This is a serious condition. Signs and symptoms of toxic shock
syndrome develop suddenly, and the disease can be fatal. The disease involves fever, shock, and problems with the
function of several body organs.
Girls should also get in the habit of doing a monthly self-exam to check for breast cancer. Although breast cancer
is rare in teens, it’s a good idea to start doing the exam when you are young. It will help you get to know what is
normal for you.

Summary

• To keep the reproductive system healthy, keep the genitals clean and avoid coming into contact with body

ﬂuids, like blood or semen.

• To check for cancer, women should perform monthly self-exams of their breasts, and men should perform

monthly self-exams of their testes.

The human body. Made of numerous organ systems. Maybe one of the most complex structures ever. But all these
systems and structures come together in an exquisite manner to make a fascinating organism. Currently, the end of
the line of evolution. The most intelligent of all organisms. An organism that can protect itself from pathogens, has
bones for support, muscles to help it move, systems that allow it to respond to the environment, systems to bring
oxygen into and around the body, systems to extract nutrients from food and get rid of wastes, and systems to make
the next generation. And all these systems and organs and tissues and cells work together to form one complete
organism.

Introduction

What do you get when you take energy, nutrients and other resources, biomes and their populations, and all
the species and their relationships?
You get ecology. Understanding ecology is in part understanding the biology of our planet. And it can easily be
argued that this is especially important today. We literally hold the future of our planet in our hands. The lessons in
this concept discuss ecology, and all the related aspects that comprise the ecosystem.

12.1 Introduction to Ecology

• Deﬁne ecology.
• Compare ﬁeld studies to laboratory studies.
• Distinguish between abiotic and biotic factors.

Do organisms live in isolation?
No, organisms are not separated from their environment or from other organisms. They interact in many ways with
their surroundings. For example, these deer may be drinking from this stream or eating nearby plants. Ecology is
the study of these interactions.

Introduction to Ecology

Life Science can be studied at many different levels. You can study small things like cells. Or you can study big
things like a group of animals. You can also study the biosphere, which is any area in which organisms live. The
study of the biosphere is part of ecology, the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their
environment.

Research in Ecology

Ecology involves many different ﬁelds, including geology, soil science, geography, meteorology, genetics, chemistry,
and physics. You can also divide ecology into the study of different organisms, such as animal ecology, plant ecology,
insect ecology, and so on.
Ecologists also study biomes. A biome is a large community of plants and animals that live in the same place. For
example, ecologists can study the biomes as diverse as the Arctic, the tropics, or the desert ( Figure 12.1). They may

the Atacama

want to know why different species live in different biomes. They may want to know what would make a particular
biome or ecosystem stable. Can you think of other aspects of a biome or ecosystem that ecologists could study?
Ecologists do two types of research:

1. Field studies.
2. Laboratory studies.

Field studies involve collecting data outside in the natural world. An ecologist who completes a ﬁeld study may
travel to a tropical rainforest to study, count, and classify all of the insects that live in a certain area. Laboratory
studies involve working inside, usually in a controlled environment. Sometimes, ecologists collect data from the
ﬁeld, and then they analyze that data in the lab. Also, they use computer programs to predict what will happen to
organisms that live in a speciﬁc area. For example, they may make predictions about what happens to insects in the

All organisms have the ability to grow and reproduce. To grow and reproduce, organisms must get materials and
energy from the environment. Plants obtain their energy from the sun through photosynthesis, whereas animals
obtain their energy from other organisms. Either way, these plants and animals, as well as the bacteria and fungi, are
constantly interacting with other species as well as the non-living parts of their ecosystem.
An organism’s environment includes two types of factors:

1. Abiotic factors are the parts of the environment that are not living, such as sunlight, climate, soil, water, and

air.

2. Biotic factors are the parts of the environment that are alive, or were alive and then died, such as plants,

animals, and their remains. Biotic factors also include bacteria, fungi and protists.

Ecology studies the interactions between biotic factors, such as organisms like plants and animals, and abiotic
factors. For example, all animals (biotic factors) breathe in oxygen (abiotic factor). All plants (biotic factor) absorb
carbon dioxide (abiotic factor) and need water (abiotic factor) to survive.
Can you think of another way that abiotic and biotic factors interact with each other?

12.2 Levels of Ecological Organization

• Deﬁne population, community, and biosphere.
• Describe the levels of organization in ecology.
• Explain the components of an ecosystem.

How is your school organized?
Your school is organized at several levels. Individual students and teachers are divided into classes. These classes
are organized into an entire middle school. Your middle school and other nearby schools are organized into a school
district. Just like schools are organized, ecosystems are also organized into several different levels, and an ecosystem
can be studied at any one of the various levels of organization.

Levels of Ecological Organization

Ecosystems can be studied at small levels or at large levels. The levels of organization are described below from the
smallest to the largest:

• A species is a group of individuals that are genetically related and can breed to produce fertile young.
Individuals are not members of the same species if their members cannot produce offspring that can also
have children. The second word in the two word name given to every organism is the species name. For
example, in Homo sapiens, sapiens is the species name.

• A population is a group of organisms belonging to the same species that live in the same area and interact

with one another.

• A community is all of the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one

another. A community is composed of all of the biotic factors of an area.

• An ecosystem includes the living organisms (all the populations) in an area and the non-living aspects of the

environment ( Figure 12.2). An ecosystem is made of the biotic and abiotic factors in an area.

12.3 Features of Populations

• Deﬁne population.
• List ways in which a population can be described.
• Explain population density and dispersion.
• Explain how population growth is determined.

What is a population?
When you think of the word population, you might think of the number of people in your town or city. But humans
are not the only species to have populations. Every species has a population. Or many populations. This group of
penguins, which are all members of the same species and all living together in the same space, is a population.

What is a Population

A population is a group of organisms of the same species, all living in the same area and interacting with each
other. Since they live together in one area, members of the same species reproduce together. Ecologists who study
populations determine how healthy or stable the populations are. They also study how the individuals of a species
interact with each other and how populations interact with the environment. If a group of similar organisms in the
same area cannot reproduce with members of the other group, then they are members of two distinct species and
form two populations.
Ecologists look at many factors that help to describe a population. First, ecologists can measure the number of
individuals that make up the population, known as population size. They can then determine the population
density, which is the number of individuals of the same species in an area. Population density can be expressed
as number per area, such as 20 mice/acre, or 50 rabbits/square mile.

916

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

Ecologists also study how individuals in a population are spread across an environment. This spacing of individuals
within a population is called dispersion. Some species may be clumped or clustered ( Figure 12.4) in an area.
Others may be evenly spaced ( Figure 12.5). Still others may be spaced randomly within an area. The population
density and dispersion have an effect on reproduction and population size. What do you think the relationship is
between population density, dispersion and size?

This may allow for easier reproduction.

together.

FIGURE 12.5
A population of cacti
in the Sonoran
Desert generally shows even dispersion
due to competition for water.

Ecologists also study the birth and death rates of the population. Together these give the growth rate (the birth
rate minus the death rate), which tells how fast (or slow) the population size is changing. The birth rate is the
number of births within a population during a speciﬁc time period. The death rate is the number of deaths within
a population during a speciﬁc time period. Knowing the birth and death rates of populations gives you information
about a population’s health. For example, when a population is made up of mostly young organisms and the birth
rate is high, the population is growing. A population with equal birth and death rates will remain the same size.
Populations that are decreasing in size have a higher death rate than birth rate.

Summary

• A population is a group of organisms of the same species, all living in the same area and interacting with each

other.

• Scientists can study many aspects of a population, including density, dispersion, and birth and death rates.

• Compare exponential growth to logistic growth.
• Explain carrying capacity.

What affects population growth in the United States?
One way the population of the United States has grown is through the movement of individuals into the United
States from other parts of the world. The same effects can be seen in wildlife populations. Individuals move into
a population and increase its size. This is just one of the many factors affecting population growth. Of course,
individuals may also move away from a population.

919

12.4. Population Growth Patterns

Population Growth

www.ck12.org

What does population growth mean? You can probably guess that it means the number of individuals in a population
is increasing. The population growth rate tells you how quickly a population is increasing or decreasing. What
determines the population growth rate for a particular population?

Births, Deaths, and Migration

Population growth rate depends on birth rates and death rates, as well as migration. First, we will consider the effects
of birth and death rates. You can predict the growth rate by using this simple equation: growth rate = birth rate
–death rate.
If the birth rate is larger than the death rate, then the population grows. If the death rate is larger than the birth rate,
what will happen to the population? The population size will decrease. If the birth and death rates are equal, then
the population size will not change.
Factors that affect population growth are:

1. Age of organisms at ﬁrst reproduction.
2. How often an organism reproduces.
3. The number of offspring of an organism.
4. The presence or absence of parental care.
5. How long an organism is able to reproduce.
6. The death rate of offspring.

For an ecosystem to be stable, populations in that system must be healthy, and that usually means reproducing as
much as their environment allows. Do organisms reproduce yearly or every few years? Do organisms reproduce for
much of their life, or just part of their life? Do organisms produce many offspring at once, or just a few, or even just
one? Do many newborn organisms die, or do the majority survive? All these factors play a role in the growth of a
population.
Organisms can use different strategies to increase their reproduction rate. Altricial organisms are helpless at birth,
and their parents give them a lot of care. This care is often seen in bird species. ( Figure 12.6). Altricial birds are
usually born blind and without feathers. Compared to precocial organisms, altricial organisms have a longer period
of development before they reach maturity. Precocial organisms, such as the geese shown below, can take care of
themselves at birth and do not require help from their parents ( Figure 12.6). In order to reproduce as much as
possible, altricial and precocial organisms must use very different strategies.

lustrates an altricial reproductive strategy,

Canada goose shows a precocial repro-
ductive strategy.
It lays a large number
of large eggs, producing well-developed
young.

www.ck12.org

Migration

Chapter 12. Ecology

Migration is the movement of individual organisms into, or out of, a population. Migration affects population
growth rate. There are two types of migration:

1. Immigration is the movement of individuals into a population from other areas. This increases the population

size and growth rate.

2. Emigration is the movement of individuals out of a population. This decreases the population size and growth

rate.

The earlier growth rate equation can be modiﬁed to account for migration: growth rate = (birth rate + immigration
rate) –(death rate + emigration rate).
One type of migration that you are probably familiar with is the migration of birds. Maybe you have heard that birds
ﬂy south for the winter. In the fall, birds ﬂy thousands of miles to the south where it is warmer. In the spring, they
return to their homes. ( Figure 12.7).
Monarch butterﬂies also migrate from Mexico to the northern U.S. in the summer and back to Mexico in the winter.
These types of migrations move entire populations from one location to another.

FIGURE 12.7
A ﬂock of barnacle geese ﬂy in formation
during the autumn migration.

Exponential Growth

Population growth can be described with two models, based on the size of the population and necessary resources.
These two types of growth are known as exponential growth and logistic growth. If a population is given unlimited
amounts of resources, such as food and water, land if needed, moisture, oxygen, and other environmental factors,
it will grow exponentially. Exponential growth occurs as a population grows larger, dramatically increasing the
growth rate. This is shown as a "J-shaped" curve below ( Figure 12.8). You can see that the population grows slowly
at ﬁrst, but as time passes, growth occurs more and more rapidly.
In nature, organisms do not usually have ideal environments with unlimited food.
In nature, there are limits.
Sometimes, there will be plenty of food. Sometimes, a ﬁre will wipe out all of the available nutrients. Sometimes a
predator will kill many individuals in a population. How do you think these limits affect the way organisms grow?
Usually, populations ﬁrst grow exponentially while resources are abundant. But as populations increase and re-
sources become less available, rates of growth slow down and slowly level off, reaching the carrying capacity. The
carrying capacity is the upper limit to the population size that the environment can support. This type of growth is
shown as an "S-shaped" curve below ( Figure 12.8) and is called logistic growth. Why do you think occurs?

Summary

• Population growth rate is affected by birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration.
• If a population is given unlimited amounts of food, moisture, and oxygen, and other environmental factors, it

will show exponential growth.

12.5 Limiting Factors to Population Growth

• Give examples of limiting factors to population growth.
• Explain how limiting factors affect population growth.

What happened during the Irish Potato Famine?
In the 1800s, a disease called potato blight destroyed much of the potato crop in Ireland. Since many Irish people
depended on potatoes as their staple food, mass starvation and emigration resulted. This caused Ireland’s population
to dramatically decrease. Lack of food is one factor that can limit population growth.

923

12.5. Limiting Factors to Population Growth

www.ck12.org

Limiting Factors to Population Growth

For a population to be healthy, factors such as food, nutrients, water and space, must be available. What happens
when there are not resources to support the population? Limiting factors are resources or other factors in the
environment that can lower the population growth rate. Limiting factors include a low food supply and lack of
space. Limiting factors can lower birth rates, increase death rates, or lead to emigration.
When organisms face limiting factors, they show logistic growth (S-shaped curve, curve B: Figure 12.9). Compe-
tition for resources like food and space cause the growth rate to stop increasing, so the population levels off. This
ﬂat upper line on a growth curve is the carrying capacity. The carrying capacity (K) is the maximum population
size that can be supported in a particular area without destroying the habitat. Limiting factors determine the carrying
capacity of a population. Recall that when there are no limiting factors, the population grows exponentially. In
exponential growth (J-shaped curve, curve A: Figure 12.9), as the population size increases, the growth rate also
increases.

FIGURE 12.9
Exponential and Logistic Growth. Curve
A shows exponential growth. Curve B
shows logistic growth. Notice that the
carrying capacity (K) is also shown.

Food Supply as Limiting Factor

If there are 12 hamburgers at a lunch table and 24 people sit down at a lunch table, will everyone be able to eat? At
ﬁrst, maybe you will split hamburgers in half, but if more and more people keep coming to sit at the lunch table, you
will not be able to feed everyone. This is what happens in nature. But in nature, organisms that cannot get food will
die or ﬁnd a new place to live. It is possible for any resource to be a limiting factor, however, a resource such as food
can have dramatic consequences on a population.
In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual.
When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the
population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary
resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same
rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.
When the population decreases to a certain level where every individual can get enough food and other resources,
and the birth and death rates become stable, the population has leveled off at its carrying capacity.

924

www.ck12.org

Other Limiting Factors

Chapter 12. Ecology

Other limiting factors include light, water, nutrients or minerals, oxygen, the ability of an ecosystem to recycle
nutrients and/or waste, disease and/or parasites, temperature, space, and predation. Can you think of some other
factors that limit populations?
Weather can also be a limiting factor. Whereas most plants like rain, an individual cactus-like Agave americana
plant actually likes to grow when it is dry. Rainfall limits reproduction of this plant which, in turn, limits growth
rate. Can you think of some other factors like this?
Human activities can also limit the growth of populations. Such activities include use of pesticides, such as DDT,
use of herbicides, and habitat destruction.

Summary

• Limiting factors, or things in the environment that can lower the population growth rate, include low food

supply and lack of space.

• When organisms face limiting factors, they show logistic type of growth (S-curve).

• Compare Neo-Malthusians to Cornucopians.

Too many people?
In October 2011, the human population passed 7 billion people. What problems could result if the human population
continues its rapid rise? One issue is that overpopulation makes many environmental issues more serious. More
people on the planet means more food and water is needed and more pollution is generated. Is there a carrying
capacity for the human population?

Human Population

How quickly is the human population growing? If we look at worldwide human population growth from 10,000
BCE through today, our growth looks like exponential growth. It increased very slowly at ﬁrst, but later grew faster
and faster as the population increased in size ( Figure 12.10). And recently, the human population has increased at

926

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

a faster pace than ever before. It has taken only 12 years for the world’s population to increase from six billion to
seven billion. Considering that in the year 1804, there were just one billion people, and in 1927, there were just two
billion people (that’s 123 years to increase from 1 to 2 billion), the recent increase in the human population growth
rate is characteristic of exponential growth. Does this mean there are unlimited resources?

Five Stages

On the other hand, if you look at human population growth in speciﬁc countries, you may see a different pattern.
On the level of a country, the history of human population growth can be divided into ﬁve stages, as described in
Table 12.2. Some countries have very high birth rates, in some countries the growth rate has stabilized, and in some
countries the growth rate is in decline.

Description
Birth and death rates are high and population growth is
stable. This occurred in early human history.
Signiﬁcant drop in death rate, resulting in exponential
growth. This occurred in 18th- and 19th-century Eu-
rope.
Population size continues to grow.
Birth rates equal death rates and populations become
stable.
Total population size may level off.

The United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau predict that by 2050, the Earth will be populated by 9.4 billion
people. Other estimates predict 10 to 11 billion.

Future Growth

There are two different beliefs about what type of growth the human population will undergo in the future:

1. Neo-Malthusians believe that human population growth cannot continue without destroying the environment,

and maybe humans themselves.

927

12.6. Human Population

www.ck12.org

2. Cornucopians believe that the Earth can give humans a limitless amount of resources. They also believe that

technology can solve problems caused by limited resources, such as lack of food.

The Cornucopians believe that a larger population is good for technology and innovation. The 5-stage model above
predicts that when all countries are industrialized, the human population will eventually level out. But many
scientists and other Neo-Malthusians believe that humans have already gone over the Earth’s carrying capacity.
That means, we may have already reached the maximum population size that can be supported, without destroying
our resources and habitat. If this is true, then human overpopulation will lead to a lack of food and other resources.
Overpopulation may also lead to increased disease, and/or war. These problems may cause the population of humans
to crash. If these issues are not controlled, could the human population go extinct?
Which of the above theories makes sense to you? Why?

Summary

• The human population is undergoing exponential growth.
• Future outlooks on human population growth differ; some think we will have a limitless amount of resources,

while others think we have already reached our carrying capacity.

12.7 Competition

• Describe competition.
• Describe how competition affects the community.
• Compare intraspeciﬁc competition to interspeciﬁc competition.
• Summarize the competitive exclusion principle.

What does it mean to compete?
If you are in competition with someone, it usually means you are in a contest for a prize. The prize might just be
bragging rights. In nature, the stakes are higher. Organisms must compete for resources necessary for life.

Competition

Recall that ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment. But
how do organisms interact with each other? Organisms interact with each other through various mechanisms, one
of which is competition. Competition occurs when organisms strive for limited resources. Competition can be for
food, water, light, or space. This interaction can be between organisms of the same species (intraspeciﬁc) or between
organisms of different species (interspeciﬁc).
Intraspeciﬁc competition happens when members of the same species compete for the same resources. For
example, two trees may grow close together and compete for light. One may out-compete the other by growing
taller to get more available light. As members of the same species are usually genetically different, they have
different characteristics, and in this example, one tree grows taller than the other. The organism that is better adapted
to that environment is better able to survive. The other organism may not survive. In this example, it is the taller tree
that is better adapted to the environment.
Interspeciﬁc competition happens when individuals of different species strive for a limited resource in the same
area. Since any two species have different traits, one species will be able to out-compete the other. One species
will be better adapted to its environment, and essentially "win" the competition. The other species will have lower
reproductive success and lower population growth, resulting in a lower survival rate. For example, cheetahs and

929

12.7. Competition

lions feed on similar prey. If prey is limited, then lions may catch more prey than cheetahs. This will force the
cheetahs to either leave the area or suffer a decrease in population.
Looking at different types of competition, ecologists developed the competitive exclusion principle. The principle
states that species less suited to compete for resources will either adapt, move from the area, or die out. In order
for two species within the same area to coexist, they may adapt by developing different specializations. This is
known as character displacement. An example of character displacement is when different birds adapt to eating
different types of food. They can develop different types of bills, like Darwin’s Finches ( Figure 12.11). Therefore,
competition for resources within and between species plays an important role in evolution through natural selection.

Summary

• Competition, or when organisms strive for limited resources, can be between organisms of the same species

(intraspeciﬁc) or organisms of different species (interspeciﬁc).

• In order for two species within the same area to coexist, they may develop different specializations; this is

known as character displacement.

12.8 Predation

• Deﬁne predation.
• Explain the different types of predation.
• Describe how predation affects the community.
• Explain the advantages of camouﬂage and mimicry.

Can insects hunt for food?
When you think of an animal hunting for its food, large animals such as lions may come to mind. But many tiny
animals also hunt for their food. For example, this praying mantis is eating a ﬂy. To eat the ﬂy, the praying mantis
ﬁrst had to catch the ﬂy, which is a form of hunting.

Predation

Predation is another mechanism in which species interact with each other. Predation is when a predator organism
feeds on another living organism or organisms, known as prey. The predator always lowers the prey’s ﬁtness. It
does this by keeping the prey from surviving, reproducing, or both. Predator-prey relationships are essential to
maintaining the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. Examples of predator-prey relationships include the lion and
zebra, the bear and ﬁsh, and the fox and rabbit.
There are different types of predation, including:

• true predation.
• grazing.
• parasitism.

True predation is when a predator kills and eats its prey. Some predators of this type, such as jaguars, kill large
prey. They tear it apart and chew it before eating it. Others, like bottlenose dolphins or snakes, may eat their prey

whole. In some cases, the prey dies in the mouth or the digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example,
eat millions of plankton at once. The prey is digested afterward. True predators may hunt actively for prey, or they
may sit and wait for prey to get within striking distance. Certain traits enable organisms to be effective hunters.
These include camouﬂage, speed, and heightened senses. These traits also enable certain prey to avoid predators.
In grazing, the predator eats part of the prey but does not usually kill it. You may have seen cows grazing on grass.
The grass they eat grows back, so there is no real effect on the population. In the ocean, kelp (a type of seaweed)
can regrow after being eaten by ﬁsh.
Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could
become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be
keystone species. These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For
example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If
there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels
of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a
keystone species.
Prey also have adaptations for avoiding predators. Prey sometimes avoid detection by using camouﬂage ( Figure
12.13). Camouﬂage means that species have an appearance (color, shape, or pattern) that helps them blend into the
background. Mimicry is a related adaptation in which a species uses appearance to copy or mimic another species.
For example, a non-poisonous dart frog may evolve to look like a poisonous dart frog. Why do you think this is an
adaptation for the non-poisonous dart frog? Mimicry can be used by both predators and prey ( Figure 12.14).
Parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship and will be described in the Symbiosis concept.

12.9 Symbiosis

• Deﬁne symbiosis.
• Distinguish mutualism from commensalism and parasitism.
• Give examples of the different kinds of symbiosis.

Is this little ﬁsh about to become lunch?
Actually, this big ﬁsh is not opening his mouth to munch on these little ﬁsh. He is opening his mouth to get his teeth
cleaned! These small ﬁsh eat dead skin and parasites from his body. Both types of ﬁsh beneﬁt from this relationship.

Symbiosis

Symbiosis describes a close and long-term relationship between different species. At least one species will beneﬁt
in a symbiotic relationship. These relationships are often necessary for the survival of one or both organisms. There
are three types of symbiotic relationships: mutualism, communalism, and parasitism.

• Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species beneﬁt.
• Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species beneﬁts while the other is not affected.
• Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which the parasitic species beneﬁts while the host species is harmed.

An example of a mutualistic relationship is between herbivores (plant-eaters) and the bacteria that live in their
intestines. The bacteria get a place to live. Meanwhile, the bacteria help the herbivore digest food. Both species

935

12.9. Symbiosis

www.ck12.org

beneﬁt, so this is a mutualistic relationship. The clownﬁsh and the sea anemones also have a mutualistic relationship.
The clownﬁsh protects the anemone from anemone-eating ﬁsh, and the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the
clownﬁsh from predators ( Figure 12.15). Another example of this type of symbiotic relationship is the relationship
between the plover bird and the African crocodile. The tiny blackbird acts as a toothpick for the ﬁerce crocodile,
and helps by removing tiny morsels of food that are stuck between the crocodile’s teeth. These food remains are
the source of food for the bird. Another example is between the ostrich and the zebra. The ostrich always moves
with the herd of zebras since it has a poor sense of hearing and smell, whereas the zebra has very sharp senses. The
ostrich has a keen sense of sight, which the zebra lacks. Hence, these two species depend on each other to warn one
another of any nearby imposing dangers.
Commensal relationships may involve an organism using another for transportation or housing. For example, spiders
build their webs on trees. The spider gets to live in the tree, but the tree is unaffected. Other commensal relationships
exist between cattle egrets and livestock. Cattle egrets are mostly found in meadows and grasslands are always seen
near cattle, horses and other livestock. These birds feed on the insects that come out of the ﬁeld due to the movement
of the animals. They even eat ticks, ﬂeas, and other insects off the back of animals. The relationship between tigers
and golden jackals is also commensalism. The jackal alerts the tiger to a kill and feeds on the remains of the prey
left by the tiger. This is not a mutualistic relationship as the tiger does not provide anything to the jackal.
Parasites may live either inside or on the surface of their host. An example of a parasite is a hookworm. Hookworms
are roundworms that affect the small intestine and lungs of a host organism. They live inside of humans and cause
them pain. However, the hookworms must live inside of a host in order to survive. Parasites may even kill the
host they live on, but then they also kill their host organism, so this is rare. Parasites are found in animals, plants,
and fungi. Hookworms are common in the moist tropic and subtropic regions. There is very little risk of getting a
parasite in industrialized nations.

Summary

• Symbiosis describes a close and long-term interaction between different species.
• In a mutualism, both species beneﬁt; in a commensalism, one species beneﬁts while the other is not affected.
• In a parasitism, the parasitic species beneﬁts, while the host species is harmed.

12.10 Ecosystems

• Deﬁne and describe an ecosystem.
• Give examples of biotic and abiotic factors.
• Explain the relationship between producers and consumers.
• Summarize the importance of biogeochemical cycles.

What nonliving things are essential for life?
Living organisms cannot exist without the nonliving aspects of the environment. For example: air, water, and
sunlight, which are all nonliving, are all essential to living organisms. Both nonliving and living things make up an
ecosystem.

What is an Ecosystem?

Ecology is the study of ecosystems. That is, ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other
and with the nonliving part of their environment. An ecosystem consists of all the nonliving factors and living
organisms interacting in the same habitat. Recall that living organisms are biotic factors. The biotic factors of an
ecosystem include all the populations in a habitat, such as all the species of plants, animals, and fungi, as well as
all the micro-organisms. Also recall that the nonliving factors are called abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include
temperature, water, soil, and air.
You can ﬁnd an ecosystem in a large body of fresh water or in a small aquarium. You can ﬁnd an ecosystem in
a large thriving forest or in a small piece of dead wood. Examples of ecosystems are as diverse as the rainforest,
the savanna, the tundra, or the desert ( Figure 12.16). The differences in the abiotic factors, such as differences
in temperature, rainfall, and soil quality, found in these areas greatly contribute to the differences seen in these
ecosystems. Ecosystems can include well known sites, such as the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia
and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park, which actually includes a few different
ecosystems, some with geothermal features, such as Old Faithful geyser.

Ecosystems need energy. Many ecosystems get their energy in the form of sunlight, which enters the ecosystem
through photosynthesis. This energy then ﬂows through the ecosystem, passed from producers to consumers.
Plants are producers in many ecosystems. Energy ﬂows from plants to the herbivores that eat the plants, and then to
carnivores that eat the herbivores. The ﬂow of energy depicts interactions of organisms within an ecosystem.
Matter is also recycled in ecosystems. Biogeochemical cycles recycle nutrients, like carbon and nitrogen, so they are
always available. These nutrients are used over and over again by organisms. Water is also continuously recycled.
The ﬂow of energy and the recycling of nutrients and water are examples of the interactions between organisms and
the interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem.

Summary

• An ecosystem consists of all the living things and nonliving things interacting in the same area.
• Matter is also recycled in ecosystems; recycling of nutrients is important so they can always be available

12.11 Habitat and Niche

• Deﬁne habitat and niche.
• Describe the roles of the habitat and niche in an ecosystem.

What is your niche at school?
Are you on the basketball team? Are you a cheerleader? Do you play an instrument in the band? Your niche would
be your role or place in the school. Organisms also each have their own niche in the ecosystem. Is an organism a
producer or a consumer? How does the organism interact with other organisms? Is the organism involved in any
symbiotic relationships?

Habitat and Niche

Niche

Each organism plays a particular role in its ecosystem. A niche is the role a species plays in the ecosystem. In
other words, a niche is how an organism “makes a living.” A niche will include the organism’s role in the ﬂow of
energy through the ecosystem. This involves how the organism gets its energy, which usually has to do with what

941

12.11. Habitat and Niche

www.ck12.org

an organism eats, and how the organism passes that energy through the ecosystem, which has to do with what eats
the organism. An organism’s niche also includes how the organism interacts with other organisms, and its role in
recycling nutrients.
Once a niche is left vacant, other organisms can ﬁll that position. For example when the Tarpan, a small wild horse
found mainly in southern Russia, became extinct in the early 1900s, its niche was ﬁlled by a small horse breed, the
Konik ( Figure 12.17). Often this occurs as a new species evolves to occupy the vacant niche.

FIGURE 12.17
The Konik horse.

A species’ niche must be speciﬁc to that species; no two species can ﬁll the same niche. They can have very similar
niches, which can overlap, but there must be distinct differences between any two niches. If two species do ﬁll the
same niche, they will compete for all necessary resources. One species will out compete the other, forcing the other
species to adapt or risk extinction. This is known as competitive exclusion.
When plants and animals are introduced, either intentionally or by accident, into a new environment, they can occupy
the existing niches of native organisms. Sometimes new species out-compete native species, and the native species
may go extinct. They can then become a serious pest. For example, kudzu, a Japanese vine, was planted in the
southeastern United States in the 1870s to help control soil loss. Kudzu had no natural predators, so it was able to
out-compete native species of vine and take over their niches ( Figure 12.18).

Habitat

The habitat is the physical area where a species lives. Many factors are used to describe a habitat. The average
amount of sunlight received each day, the range of annual temperatures, and average yearly rainfall can all describe
a habitat. These and other abiotic factors will affect the kind of traits an organism must have in order to survive
there. The temperature, the amount of rainfall, the type of soil and other abiotic factors all have a signiﬁcant role in
determining the plants that invade an area. The plants then determine the animals that come to eat the plants, and so
on. A habitat should not be confused with an ecosystem: the habitat is the actual place of the ecosystem, whereas
the ecosystem includes both the biotic and abiotic factors in the habitat.
Habitat destruction means what it sounds like—an organism’s habitat is destroyed. Habitat destruction can cause
a population to decrease. If bad enough, it can also cause species to go extinct. Clearing large areas of land for
housing developments or businesses can cause habitat destruction. Poor ﬁre management, pest and weed invasion,
and storm damage can also destroy habitats. National parks, nature reserves, and other protected areas all preserve
habitats.

• Deﬁne biome and describe how they are classiﬁed.
• Explain what determines the differences among biomes.
• Distinguish terrestrial biomes from aquatic biomes.

Where was this picture taken?
This scene is from Anza-Borrago California Desert Park. However, deserts exist around the globe. You might ﬁnd a
similar picture of a desert in Africa. The desert is one type of biome.

What are Biomes?

Tropical rainforests and deserts are two familiar types of biomes. A biome is an area with similar populations of
organisms. This can easily be seen with a community of plants and animals. Remember that a community is all of
the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another. Different biomes, such
as a forest ( Figure 12.21) or a desert, obviously have different communities of plants and animals. How are the
plants and animals different in the rainforest than those in the desert? Why do you think they are so different?
The differences in the biomes are due to differences in the abiotic factors, especially climate. Climate is the
typical weather in an area over a long period of time. The climate includes the amount of rainfall and the average
temperature in the region. Obviously, the climate in the desert is much different than the climate in the rainforest.
As a result, different types of plants and animals live in each biome.
There are into two major groups of biomes:

1. Terrestrial biomes, which are land-based, such as deserts and forests.
2. Aquatic biomes, which are water-based, such as ponds and lakes.

945

12.12. What are Biomes?

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 12.21
Tropical rainforest landscape in Hawaii.
Notice how the plants are different from
those in the desert.

The abiotic factors, such as the amount of rainfall and the temperature, are going to inﬂuence other abiotic factors,
such as the quality of the soil. This, in turn, is going to inﬂuence the plants that migrate into the ecosystem and thrive
in that biome. Recall that migration is the movement of an organism into or out of a population. It can also refer to
a whole new species moving into a habitat. The type of plants that live in a biome are going to attract a certain type
of animal to that habitat. It is the interaction of the abiotic and biotic factors that describe a biome and ecosystem.
In aquatic biomes, abiotic factors such as salt, sunlight and temperature play signiﬁcant roles.
For example, a hot dry biome is going to be completely different from a moderate wet biome. The soil quality will be
different. Together, these will result in different plants being able to occupy each biome. Different plants will attract
different animals (herbivores) to eat these plants. These animals, in turn, will attract different (carnivores) animals
to eat the herbivores. So it is the abiotic factors that determine the biotic factors of an ecosystem, and together these
deﬁne the biome.

• A biome is an area with similar climate that includes similar communities of plants and animals.
• Climate inﬂuences the types of plants and animals that inhabit a speciﬁc biome.

• Describe the different types of terrestrial biomes.
• Summarize the roles of latitude, humidity, and elevation in a terrestrial biome.

Where could this picture have been taken?
This is an example of chaparral. This biome is usually characterized by dwarf trees and tangled shrubs. Although
this is a picture along a Colorado road, you can also ﬁnd this biome in southern California, the Mediterranean region
in Europe, and many other places.

Terrestrial Biomes

A terrestrial biome is an area of land with a similar climate that includes similar communities of plants and animals.
Different terrestrial biomes are usually deﬁned in terms of their plants, such as trees, shrubs, and grasses.
Factors such as latitude, humidity, and elevation affect biome type:

• Latitude means how far a biome is from the equator. Moving from the poles to the equator, you will ﬁnd (in

order) Arctic, boreal, temperate, subtropical, and tropical biomes.

948

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

• Humidity is the amount of water in the air. Air with a high concentration of water will be called humid.
Moving away from the most humid climate, biomes will be called semi-humid, semi-arid, or arid (the driest).
• Elevation measures how high land is above sea level. It gets colder as you go higher above sea level, which is

why you see snow-capped mountains.

Terrestrial biomes include grasslands, forests, deserts, and tundra. Grasslands are characterized as lands dominated
by grasses rather than large shrubs or trees and include the savanna and temperate grasslands. Forests are dominated
by trees and other woody vegetation and are classiﬁed based on their latitude. Forests include tropical, temperate,
and boreal forests (taiga). Deserts cover about one ﬁfth of the Earth’s surface and occur where rainfall is less than
50 cm (about 20 inches) each year. Tundra is the coldest of all the biomes. The tundra is characterized for its
frost-molded landscapes, extremely low temperatures, little precipitation, poor nutrients, and short growing seasons.
There are two main types of tundra, Arctic and Alpine tundras. Terrestrial biomes ( Figure 12.22) lying within
the Arctic and Antarctic Circles do not have very much plant or animal life. Biomes with the highest amount of
biodiversity, that is the most variation in plant and animal life, are near the equator ( Figure 12.23).

• Give examples of marine biomes.
• Deﬁne freshwater biome.

• Explain dissolved oxygen and nutrient distribution in aquatic biomes.

Is there life deep in the ocean?
Yes, there is life even at great depths in the ocean. One example of deep ocean life is this deep-sea chimaera.
Chimaeras are related to sharks and resemble them somewhat. But most chimaeras are adapted for life thousands of
feet under the ocean surface. This is one example of an organism that lives in an aquatic biome.

Aquatic Biomes

Recall that terrestrial biomes are deﬁned by their climate. That’s because plants and animals are adapted for certain
amounts of temperature and moisture. However, would aquatic biomes be classiﬁed in the same way? No, that

952

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

wouldn’t make much sense—all parts of an aquatic environment have plenty of water. Aquatic biomes can be
generally classiﬁed based on the amount of salt in the water. Freshwater biomes have less than 1% salt and are
typical of ponds and lakes, streams and rivers, and wetlands. Marine biomes have more salt and are characteristic
of the oceans, coral reefs, and estuaries.
Most aquatic organisms do not have to deal with extremes of temperature or moisture. Instead, their main limiting
factors are the availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water.

Marine Biomes

Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called marine biomes. Organisms that live in marine biomes must be adapted to
the salt in the water. For example, many have organs for excreting excess salt. Marine biomes include the oceans,
coral reefs, and estuaries ( Figure 12.24). The oceans are the largest of all the ecosystems. They can be divided into
four separate zones based on the amount of sunlight. Ocean zones are also divided based on their depth and their
distance from land. Each zone has a great diversity of species. Within a coral reef, the dominant organisms are
corals. Corals consist partially of algae, which provide nutrients via photosynthesis. Corals also extend tentacles
to obtain plankton from the water. Coral reefs include several species of microorganisms, invertebrates, ﬁshes, sea
urchins, octopuses, and sea stars. Estuaries are areas where freshwater streams or rivers merge with the ocean.

FIGURE 12.24

est, from Anacapa Island in the Channel
Islands National Marine Sanctuary.

Freshwater Biomes

Freshwater biomes are deﬁned by their low salt concentration, usually less than 1%. Plants and animals in freshwater
regions are adjusted to the low salt content and would not be able to survive in areas of high salt concentration, such
as the ocean. There are different types of freshwater biomes: ponds and lakes ( Figure 12.25), streams and rivers, and
wetlands. Ponds and lakes range in size from just a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. Streams
and rivers are bodies of ﬂowing water moving in one direction. They can be found everywhere. They get their starts
at headwaters, which may be springs, melting snow, or even lakes, and then travel all the way to their mouths,
emptying into another water channel or the ocean. Wetlands are areas of standing water that support aquatic plants.
Wetlands include marshes, swamps, and bogs.

Aquatic Biomes and Sunlight

In large bodies of water, such as the ocean and lakes, the water can be divided into zones based on the amount of
sunlight it receives:

1. The photic zone extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters (656 feet) below the surface of the water. This is
where enough sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur. Algae and other photosynthetic organisms can
make food and support food webs.

2. The aphotic zone is water deeper than 200 meters. This is where too little sunlight penetrates for photosyn-
thesis to occur. As a result, producers must make "food" by chemosynthesis, or the food must drift down
from the water above.

Aquatic Biomes and Dissolved Substances

Water in lakes and the ocean also varies in the amount of dissolved oxygen and nutrients it contains:

1. Water near the surface of lakes and the ocean usually has more dissolved oxygen than does deeper water. This

is because surface water absorbs oxygen from the air above it.

2. Water near shore generally has more dissolved nutrients than water farther from shore. This is because most
nutrients enter the water from land. They are carried by runoff, streams, and rivers that empty into a body of
water.

3. Water near the bottom of lakes and the ocean may contain more nutrients than water closer to the surface.
When aquatic organisms die, they sink to the bottom. Decomposers near the bottom of the water break down
the dead organisms and release their nutrients back into the water.

Summary

• Aquatic biomes are distinguished by the availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and

nutrients in the water.

• The photic zone extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters, while the aphotic zone is deeper than 200 meters.
• Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called marine biomes.

12.15. The Biosphere

www.ck12.org

12.15 The Biosphere

• Describe the biosphere and its importance in ecology.
• Distinguish the lithosphere from the hydrosphere and from the atmosphere.
• Discuss the Gaia hypothesis.

Is Earth a living organism?
Most scientists agree that the Earth itself is not a living thing. However, the Earth does have some aspects of life.
Some scientists argue that the Earth maintains homeostasis, a stable state, just like a living organisms.

The Biosphere

The highest level of ecological organization is the biosphere.
It is the part of Earth, including the air, land,
surface rocks, and water, where life is found. Parts of the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere make up the
biosphere. The lithosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth’s crust; essentially land is part of the lithosphere. The
hydrosphere is composed of all the areas that contain water, which can be found on, under, and over the surface of
Earth. The atmosphere is the layer of gas that surrounds the planet. The biosphere includes the area from about
11,000 meters below sea level to 15,000 meters above sea level. It overlaps with the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and
atmosphere. Land plants and animals are found on the lithosphere, freshwater and marine plants and animals are

956

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

found in the hydrosphere, and birds and other ﬂying animals are found in the atmosphere. Of course, there are
countless bacteria, protists, and fungi that are also found in the biosphere.

Is the Biosphere Living?

The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth
is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis. For example the composition of our
atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in
the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.
For a better understanding of how the biosphere works and various dysfunctions related to human activity, scientists
have simulated the biosphere in small-scale models. Biosphere 2 ( Figure 12.26) is a laboratory in Arizona that
contains 3.15 acres of closed ecosystems. Ecosystems of Biosphere 2 are an ocean ecosystem with a coral reef,
mangrove wetlands, a tropical rainforest, a savannah grassland and a fog desert. See http://www.b2science.org/ for
additional information.
Additional biosphere projects include BIOS-3, a closed ecosystem in Siberia, and Biosphere J, located in Japan.

12.16. Producers

www.ck12.org

Where does all the bear’s energy come from?
Bears get their energy from their food. Brown bears eat a varied diet, from nuts and berries to ﬁsh and other animals.
When bears eat a berry, they are obtaining energy that the plant originally captured from the sun. Even when a bear
eats another animal, the energy in that animal ultimately came from eating a producer that captured the sun’s energy.

Producers

Energy is the ability to do work. In organisms, this work can be physical work, like walking or jumping, or it can
be the work used to carry out the chemical processes in their cells. Every biochemical reaction that occurs in an
organism’s cells needs energy. All organisms need a constant supply of energy to stay alive.
Some organisms can get the energy directly from the sun. Other organisms get their energy from other organisms.
Through predator-prey relationships, the energy of one organism is passed on to another. Energy is constantly
ﬂowing through a community. With just a few exceptions, all life on Earth depends on the sun’s energy for survival.
The energy of the sun is ﬁrst captured by producers ( Figure 12.27), organisms that can make their own food. Many
producers make their own food through the process of photosynthesis. The "food" the producers make is the sugar,
glucose. Producers make food for the rest of the ecosystem. As energy is not recycled, energy must consistently
be captured by producers. This energy is then passed on to the organisms that eat the producers, and then to the
organisms that eat those organisms, and so on.
Recall that the only required ingredients needed for photosynthesis are sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and wa-
ter (H2O). From these simple inorganic ingredients, photosynthetic organisms produce the carbohydrate glucose
(C6H12O6), and other complex organic compounds. Essentially, these producers are changing the energy from the
sunlight into a usable form of energy. They are also making the oxygen that we breathe. Oxygen is a waste product
of photosynthesis.
The survival of every ecosystem is dependent on the producers. Without producers capturing the energy from
the sun and turning it into glucose, an ecosystem could not exist. On land, plants are the dominant producers.
Phytoplankton, tiny photosynthetic organisms, are the most common producers in the oceans and lakes. Algae,
which is the green layer you might see ﬂoating on a pond, are an example of phytoplankton.
There are also bacteria that use chemical processes to produce food. They get their energy from sources other than
the sun, but they are still called producers. This process is known as chemosynthesis, and is common in ecosystems
without sunlight, such as certain marine ecosystems.

www.ck12.org

12.17 Consumers and Decomposers

• Explain the roles of consumers and decomposers in an ecosystem.
• Distinguish herbivores from carnivores and omnivores.
• Classify organisms on the basis of how they obtain energy and describe examples of each.

What is breaking down this leaf?
Notice how this leaf is slowly being broken down. This process can be carried out by fungi and bacteria on the
ground. Breaking down old leaves is an important process since it releases the nutrients in the dead leaves back into
the soil for living plants to use.

Consumers and Decomposers

Recall that producers make their own food through photosynthesis. But many organisms are not producers and
cannot make their own food. So how do these organisms obtain their energy? They must get their energy from
other organisms. They must eat other organisms, or obtain their energy from these organisms some other way. The
organisms that obtain their energy from other organisms are called consumers. All animals are consumers, and
they eat other organisms. Fungi and many protists and bacteria are also consumers. But, whereas animals eat other
organisms, fungi, protists, and bacteria "consume" organisms through different methods.
The consumers can be placed into different groups, depending on what they consume.

• Herbivores are animals that eat producers to get energy. For example, rabbits and deer are herbivores that
eat plants. The caterpillar pictured below ( Figure 12.28) is a herbivore. Animals that eat phytoplankton in
aquatic environments are also herbivores.

• Carnivores feed on animals, either herbivores or other carnivores. Snakes that eat mice are carnivores. Hawks

that eat snakes are also carnivores ( Figure 12.28).

962

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

• Omnivores eat both producers and consumers. Most people are omnivores, since they eat fruits, vegetables,
and grains from plants, and also meat and dairy products from animals. Dogs, bears, and raccoons are also
omnivores.

FIGURE 12.28
Examples of consumers are caterpillars
(herbivores) and hawks (carnivore).

Decomposers and Stability

Decomposers ( Figure 12.29) get nutrients and energy by breaking down dead organisms and animal wastes.
Through this process, decomposers release nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen, back into the environment. These
nutrients are recycled back into the ecosystem so that the producers can use them. They are passed to other organisms
when they are eaten or consumed. Many of these nutrients are recycled back into the soil, so they can be taken up
by the roots of plants.
The stability of an ecosystem depends on the actions of the decomposers. Examples of decomposers include
mushrooms on a decaying log. Bacteria in the soil are also decomposers. Imagine what would happen if there
were no decomposers. Wastes and the remains of dead organisms would pile up and the nutrients within the waste
and dead organisms would not be released back into the ecosystem. Producers would not have enough nutrients. The
carbon and nitrogen necessary to build organic compounds, and then cells, allowing an organism to grow, would be
insufﬁcient. Other nutrients necessary for an organism to function properly would also not be sufﬁcient. Essentially,
many organisms could not exist.

ria and (b) fungi.

12.18 Food Webs

• Distinguish a food chain from a food web.
• Be able to draw and interpret a food web.
• Summarize the roles of producers, herbivores, and carnivores in a food web.

How do the grasshopper and the grass interact?
Grasshoppers don’t just hop on the grass. They also eat the grass. Other organisms also eat the grass, and some
animals even eat the grasshopper. These interactions can be visualized by drawing a food web.

Food Webs

Energy must constantly ﬂow through an ecosystem for the system to remain stable. What exactly does this mean?
Essentially, it means that organisms must eat other organisms. Food chains ( Figure 12.30) show the eating patterns
in an ecosystem. Food energy ﬂows from one organism to another. Arrows are used to show the feeding relationship
between the animals. The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism that eats it. For example, an
arrow from a plant to a grasshopper shows that the grasshopper eats the leaves. Energy and nutrients are moving
from the plant to the grasshopper. Next, a bird might prey on the grasshopper, a snake may eat the bird, and then an
owl might eat the snake. The food chain would be:

plant → grasshopper → bird → snake → owl.

A food chain cannot continue to go on and on. For example the food chain could not be:

plant → grasshopper → spider → frog → lizard → fox → hawk.

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 12.30
This food chain includes producers and
consumers. How could you add decom-
posers to the food chain?

Food chains only have 4 or 5 total levels. Therefore, a chain has only 3 or 4 levels for energy transfer.
In an ocean ecosystem, one possible food chain might look like this: phytoplankton → krill → ﬁsh → shark.
The producers are always at the beginning of the food chain, bringing energy into the ecosystem. Through
photosynthesis, the producers create their own food in the form of glucose, but also create the food for the other
organisms in the ecosystem. The herbivores come next, then the carnivores. When these consumers eat other
organisms, they use the glucose in those organisms for energy. In this example, phytoplankton are eaten by krill,
which are tiny, shrimp-like animals. The krill are eaten by ﬁsh, which are then eaten by sharks. Could decomposers
be added to a food chain?
Each organism can eat and be eaten by many different types of organisms, so simple food chains are rare in nature.
There are also many different species of ﬁsh and sharks. So a food chain cannot end with a shark; it must end with a
distinct species of shark. A food chain does not contain the general category of "ﬁsh," it will contain speciﬁc species
of ﬁsh. In ecosystems, there are many food chains.
Since feeding relationships are so complicated, we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate
ﬂow of energy within an ecosystem. A food web ( Figure 12.31) shows the feeding relationships between many
organisms in an ecosystem. If you expand our original example of a food chain, you could add deer that eat clover
and foxes that hunt chipmunks. A food web shows many more arrows, but still shows the ﬂow of energy. A complete
food web may show hundreds of different feeding relationships.

12.19 Energy Pyramids

• Deﬁne energy and energy pyramid.
• Explain the ﬂow of energy through an ecosystem using an energy pyramid.
• Describe a trophic level.
• Explain the maximum number of trophic levels in an ecosystem.

How much energy could be gained from the warthog?
If the cheetah is successful in capturing the warthog, it would gain some energy by eating it. But would the cheetah
gain as much energy as the warthog has ever consumed? No, the warthog has used up some of the energy it has
consumed for its own needs. The cheetah will only gain a fraction of the energy that the warthog has consumed
throughout its lifetime.

Energy Pyramids

When an herbivore eats a plant, the energy in the plant tissues is used by the herbivore. But how much of that
energy is transferred to the herbivore? Remember that plants are producers, bringing the energy into the ecosystem
by converting sunlight into glucose. Does the plant use some of the energy for its own needs? Recall the energy is
the ability to do work, and the plant has plenty or "work" to do. So of course it needs and uses energy. It converts the
glucose it makes into ATP through cellular respiration just like other organisms. After the plant uses the energy
from glucose for its own needs, the excess energy is available to the organism that eats the plant.
The herbivore uses the energy from the plant to power its own life processes and to build more body tissues. However,
only about 10% of the total energy from the plant gets stored in the herbivore’s body as extra body tissue. The rest of
the energy is used by the herbivore and released as heat. The next consumer on the food chain that eats the herbivore
will only store about 10% of the total energy from the herbivore in its own body. This means the carnivore will store
only about 1% of the total energy that was originally in the plant. In other words, only about 10% of energy of one
step in a food chain is stored in the next step in the food chain. The majority of the energy is used by the organism
or released to the environment.
Every time energy is transferred from one organism to another, there is a loss of energy. This loss of energy can be
shown in an energy pyramid. An example of an energy pyramid is pictured below ( Figure 12.32). Since there is
energy loss at each step in a food chain, it takes many producers to support just a few carnivores in a community.
Each step of the food chain in the energy pyramid is called a trophic level. Plants or other photosynthetic organisms
( autotrophs) are found on the ﬁrst trophic level, at the bottom of the pyramid. The next level will be the herbivores,

968

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

and then the carnivores that eat the herbivores. The energy pyramid ( Figure 12.32) shows four levels of a food
chain, from producers to carnivores. Because of the high rate of energy loss in food chains, there are usually only
4 or 5 trophic levels in the food chain or energy pyramid. There just is not enough energy to support any additional
trophic levels. Heterotrophs are found in all levels of an energy pyramid other than the ﬁrst level.

FIGURE 12.32
As illustrated by this ecological pyramid,
it takes a lot of phytoplankton to support
the carnivores of the oceans. This energy
pyramid has four trophic levels, which sig-
nify the organisms place in the food chain
from the original source of energy.

Summary

• As energy is transferred along a food chain, energy is lost as heat.
• Only about 10% of energy of one step in a food chain is stored in the next step in the food chain.

Could you be drinking the same water as George Washington?
Water is recycled constantly through the ecosystem. That means any water you drank today has been around for
millions of years. You could be drinking water that was once drunk by George Washington, the ﬁrst humans, or even

The Water Cycle

www.ck12.org

Whereas energy ﬂows through an ecosystem, water and elements like carbon and nitrogen are recycled. Water and
nutrients are constantly being recycled through the environment. This process through which water or a chemical
element is continuously recycled in an ecosystem is called a biogeochemical cycle. This recycling process involves
both the living organisms (biotic components) and nonliving things (abiotic factors) in the ecosystem. Through
biogeochemical cycles, water and other chemical elements are constantly being passed through living organisms
to non-living matter and back again, over and over. Three important biogeochemical cycles are the water cycle,
carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle.
The biogeochemical cycle that recycles water is the water cycle. The water cycle involves a series of interconnected
pathways involving both the biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere. Water is obviously an extremely
important aspect of every ecosystem. Life cannot exist without water. Many organisms contain a large amount of
water in their bodies, and many live in water, so the water cycle is essential to life on Earth. Water continuously
moves between living organisms, such as plants, and non-living things, such as clouds, rivers, and oceans ( Figure
12.33).
The water cycle does not have a real starting or ending point. It is an endless recycling process that involves the
oceans, lakes and other bodies of water, as well as the land surfaces and the atmosphere. The steps in the water cycle
are as follows, starting with the water in the oceans:

1. Water evaporates from the surface of the oceans, leaving behind salts. As the water vapor rises, it collects and

is stored in clouds.

2. As water cools in the clouds, condensation occurs. Condensation is when gases turn back into liquids.
3. Condensation creates precipitation. Precipitation includes rain, snow, hail, and sleet. The precipitation allows

the water to return again to the Earth’s surface.

4. When precipitation lands on land, the water can sink into the ground to become part of our underground water
reserves, also known as groundwater. Much of this underground water is stored in aquifers, which are porous
layers of rock that can hold water.

Run-off

Most precipitation that occurs over land, however, is not absorbed by the soil and is called runoff. This runoff
collects in streams and rivers and eventually ﬂows back into the ocean.

Transpiration

Water also moves through the living organisms in an ecosystem. Plants soak up large amounts of water through their
roots. The water then moves up the plant and evaporates from the leaves in a process called transpiration. The
process of transpiration, like evaporation, returns water back into the atmosphere.

Summary

• Chemical elements and water are constantly recycled in the ecosystem through biogeochemical cycles.
• During the water cycle, water enters the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration, and water returns to

land by precipitation.

12.21 The Carbon Cycle

• Describe the key features of the carbon cycle.
• Describe the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
• Deﬁne fossil fuels.
• Explain the role of fossil fuels in global climate change.

Why is Earth getting warmer?
What happens if carbon is not removed from the atmosphere? The excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is
contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming. Where does this carbon dioxide come
from? Burning gas to power our cars and burning coal to generate electricity are two main sources of the excess
carbon dioxide.

The Carbon Cycle

Carbon is one of the most common elements found in living organisms. Chains of carbon molecules form the
backbones of many organic molecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Carbon is constantly cycling

974

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

between living organisms and the atmosphere ( Figure 12.34). The cycling of carbon occurs through the carbon
cycle.
Living organisms cannot make their own carbon, so how is carbon incorporated into living organisms? In the
atmosphere, carbon is in the form of carbon dioxide gas (CO2). Recall that plants and other producers capture the
carbon dioxide and convert it to glucose (C6H12O6) through the process of photosynthesis. Then as animals eat
plants or other animals, they gain the carbon from those organisms.
The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6+ 6O2.
How does this carbon in living things end up back in the atmosphere? Remember that we breathe out carbon dioxide.
This carbon dioxide is generated through the process of cellular respiration, which has the reverse chemical reaction
as photosynthesis. That means when our cells burn food (glucose) for energy, carbon dioxide is released. We, like all
animals, exhale this carbon dioxide and return it back to the atmosphere. Also, carbon is released to the atmosphere
as an organism dies and decomposes.
Cellular respiration and photosynthesis can be described as a cycle, as one uses carbon dioxide (and water) and
makes oxygen (and glucose), and the other uses oxygen (and glucose) and makes carbon dioxide (and water).

FIGURE 12.34
The carbon cycle. The cycling of car-
bon dioxide in photosynthesis and cellular
respiration are main components of the
carbon cycle. Carbon is also returned to
the atmosphere by the burning of organic
matter (combustion) and fossil fuels and
decomposition of organic matter.

Formation of Fossil Fuels

Millions of years ago, there were so many dead plants and animals that they could not completely decompose before
they were buried. They were covered over by soil or sand, tar or ice. These dead plants and animals are organic
matter made out of cells full of carbon-containing organic compounds (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic
acids). What happened to all this carbon? When organic matter is under pressure for millions of years, it forms fossil
fuels. Fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas.
When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure 12.35). This carbon is not
recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it.
Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas, since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like
the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in
Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.

Summary

• During the carbon cycle, animals and plants add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through cellular respiration,

and plants remove carbon dioxide through photosynthesis.

• The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.

12.22 The Nitrogen Cycle

• Describe the key features of the nitrogen cycle.
• Deﬁne nitrogen ﬁxation.
• Explain assimilation and denitriﬁcation.

What can bean plants do that most other plants can’t?
No, they don’t grow giant stalks to the clouds. Bean plants and other legumes (plants that have their seeds in pods)
can use the nitrogen in the air to grow. It takes the help of special bacteria friends in the soil, and this relationship is
unique to the legumes.

The Nitrogen Cycle

Like water and carbon, nitrogen is also repeatedly recycled through the biosphere. This process is called the nitrogen
cycle. Nitrogen is one of the most common elements in living organisms. It is important for creating both proteins

978

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

and nucleic acids, like DNA. The air that we breathe is mostly nitrogen gas (N2), but, unfortunately, animals and
plants cannot use the nitrogen when it is a gas. In fact, plants often die from a lack of nitrogen even through they are
surrounded by plenty of nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas (N2) has two nitrogen atoms connected by a very strong triple
bond. Most plants and animals cannot use the nitrogen in nitrogen gas because they cannot break that triple bond.
In order for plants to make use of nitrogen, it must be transformed into molecules they can use. This can be
accomplished several different ways ( Figure 12.36).

• Lightning: When lightening strikes, nitrogen gas is transformed into nitrate (NO3
• Nitrogen ﬁxation: Special nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria can also transform nitrogen gas into useful forms. These
bacteria live in the roots of plants in the pea family. They turn the nitrogen gas into ammonium (NH4
+) (a
process called ammoniﬁcation). In water environments, bacteria in the water can also ﬁx nitrogen gas into
ammonium. Ammonium can be used by aquatic plants as a source of nitrogen.

−) that plants can use.

• Nitrogen also is released to the environment by decaying organisms or decaying wastes. These wastes release

nitrogen in the form of ammonium.

Ammonium in the soil can be turned into nitrate by a two-step process completed by two different types of bacteria.
In the form of nitrate, nitrogen can be used by plants through the process of assimilation. It is then passed along to
animals when they eat the plants.

Sending Nitrogen back to the Atmosphere

Turning nitrate back into nitrogen gas, the process of denitriﬁcation, happens through the work of denitrifying
bacteria. These bacteria often live in swamps and lakes. They take in the nitrate and release it back to the atmosphere
as nitrogen gas.
Just like the carbon cycle, human activities impact the nitrogen cycle. These human activities include the burning
of fossil fuels, which release nitrogen oxide gasses into the atmosphere. Releasing nitrogen oxide back into the
atmosphere leads to problems like acid rain.

12.23 Succession

• Explain types of ecological succession and replacement within a community.
• Distinguish primary succession from secondary succession.
• Explain the role of a pioneer species.
• Deﬁne lichen.
• Summarize what is meant by a climax community.

What will happen to this land?
Since this land was clearcut, there is little life left behind. However, that does not mean that this land will stay barren
forever. First little seedlings will establish themselves, and with time a forest could thrive here once again.

Succession

When you see an older forest, it’s easy to picture that the forest has been there forever. This is not the case.
Ecosystems are "dynamic." This means that ecosystems change over time. That forest may lie on land that was once
covered by an ocean millions of years ago. Lightning may have sparked a ﬁre in a forest, destroying much of the
plant life there. Or the forest may have been cut down at one point for agricultural use, then abandoned and allowed
to re-grow over time. During the ice ages, glaciers once covered areas that are tropical rainforests today. Both natural
forces and human actions cause ecosystems to change.
If there is a big ecosystem change caused by natural forces or human actions, the plants and animals that live there
may be destroyed. Or they may be forced to leave. Over time, a new community will develop, and then that
community may be replaced by another. You may see several changes in the plant and animal composition of the
community over time. Ecological succession is the constant replacement of one community by another. It happens
after a big change in the ecosystem. And, of course, succession occurs on brand new land.

Primary Succession

Primary succession is the type of ecological succession that happens on new lands—lands where life has not yet

981

12.23. Succession

www.ck12.org

existed. Primary succession can take place after lava ﬂow cools and hardens into new land, or a glacier recedes
exposing new land. Since the land that results from these processes is completely new land, soil must ﬁrst be
produced. How is soil produced?
Primary succession always starts with a pioneer species. This is the species that ﬁrst lives in the habitat. If life is
to begin on barren rock, which is typical of new land, the pioneer species would be an organism such as a lichen (
Figure 12.37). A lichen is actually an organism formed from two species. It results from a symbiotic relationship
between a fungus and an algae or cyanobacteria. The lichen is able to thrive as both the fungus and the algae or
bacteria contribute to the relationship. The fungus is able to absorb minerals and nutrients from the rock, while algae
supplies the fungus with sugars through photosynthesis. Since lichens can photosynthesize and do not rely on soil,
they can live in environments where other organisms cannot. As a lichen grows, it breaks down the rock, which is
the ﬁrst step of soil formation.

FIGURE 12.37
Primary succession on a rock often be-
gins with the growth of lichens. What do
lichens help create?

The pioneer species is soon replaced by other populations. Abiotic factors such as soil quality, water, and climate
will determine the species that continue the process of succession. Mosses and grasses will be able to grow in the
newly created soil. During early succession, plant species like grasses that grow and reproduce quickly will take over
the landscape. Over time, these plants improve the soil and a few shrubs can begin to grow. Slowly, the shrubs are
replaced by small trees. Small trees then are succeeded by larger trees. Since trees are more successful at competing
for resources than shrubs and grasses, a forest may be the end result of primary succession.

Secondary Succession

Sometimes ecological succession occurs in areas where life has already existed. These areas already have soil full
of nutrients. Secondary succession is the type of succession that happens after something destroys the habitat, such
as a ﬂood or other natural disaster. Abandoning a ﬁeld that was once used for agriculture can also lead to secondary
succession ( Figure 12.38). In this case, the pioneer species would be the grasses that ﬁrst appear. Lichen would not
be necessary as there is already nutrient-rich soil. Slowly, the ﬁeld would return to its natural state.
A forest ﬁre can alter a habitat such that secondary succession occurs ( Figure 12.39 and Figure 12.40). Although

982

Chapter 12. Ecology

FIGURE 12.38
This land was once used for growing
crops. Now that the ﬁeld is abandoned,
secondary succession has begun. Pio-
neer species, such as grasses, appear
ﬁrst, and then shrubs begin to grow.

the area will look devastated at ﬁrst, the seeds of new plants are underground. They are waiting for their chance to
grow. Just like primary succession, the burned forest will go through a series of communities, starting with small
grasses, then shrubs, and ﬁnally bigger trees.

Climax Communities

A climax community ( Figure 12.41) is the end result of ecological succession. The climax community is a
stable balance of all organisms in an ecosystem, and will remain stable unless a disaster strikes. After the disaster,
succession will start all over again. Depending on the climate of the area, the climax community will look different.
In the tropics, the climax community might be a tropical rainforest. At the other extreme, in northern parts of the
world, the climax community might be a coniferous forest. Though climax communities are stable, are they truly
the ﬁnal community of the habitat? Or is it likely that sometime in the future, maybe a long time in the future, the
community of populations will change, and another stable, climax community will thrive?

Summary

• Ecological succession is the constant replacement of one community by another.

What is this haze?
This picture shows a thick layer of smog and dust over a very polluted city (Singapore). Smog in the air is a serious
health hazard for people living in many big cities around the globe. Smog is one example of air pollution.

Outdoor Air Pollution

Air is all around us. Air is essential for life. Sometimes, humans can pollute the air. For example, releasing smoke
and dust from factories and cars can cause air pollution. Air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles
released into the air mainly by human actions. This pollution affects entire ecosystems around the world. Pollution
can also cause many human health problems, and it can also cause death. Air pollution can be found both outdoors
and indoors.
Outdoor air pollution is made of chemical particles. When smoke or other pollutants enter the air, the particles
found in the pollution mix with the air. Air is polluted when it contains many large toxic particles. Outdoor
air pollution changes the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Primary pollutants are added directly to the
atmosphere. Fires add primary pollutants to the air. Particles released from the ﬁre directly enter the air and cause
pollution ( Figure 12.42). Burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal is a major source of primary pollutants (
Figure 12.43).

987

12.24. Outdoor Air Pollution

www.ck12.org

Secondary pollutants are formed when primary pollutants interact with sunlight, air, or each other. They do not
directly cause pollution. However, when they interact with other parts of the air, they do cause pollution. For
example, ozone is created when some pollutants interact with sunlight. High levels of ozone in the atmosphere can
cause problems for humans.

FIGURE 12.42
Wildﬁres, either natural or human-caused,
release particles into the air, one of the
many causes of air pollution.

FIGURE 12.43
A major source of air pollution is the burn-
ing of fossil fuels from factories, power
plants, and motor vehicles.

Sources of Outdoor Air Pollution

Most air pollutants can be traced to the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are burned during many processes,
including in power plants to create electricity, in factories to make machinery run, in power stoves and furnaces for
heating, and in waste facilities. Perhaps one of the biggest uses of fossil fuels is in transportation. Fossil fuels are
used in cars, trains, and planes.
Air pollution can also be caused by agriculture, such as cattle ranching and the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Other
sources of air pollution include the production of plastics, refrigerants, and aerosols, in nuclear power and defense,
from landﬁlls and mining, and from biological warfare.

988

www.ck12.org

Acid Rain

Chapter 12. Ecology

One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very
destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic
life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid
rain to form ( Figure 12.44). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-ﬁred power plants. Nitrogen
oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.

FIGURE 12.44
A forest in the Jizera Mountains of the
Czech Republic shows effects caused by
acid rain. What do you observe?

Global Warming

Pollutants also affect the atmosphere through their contribution to global warming. Global warming is an increase
in the Earth’s temperature. It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.
Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has
produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity. The rest of the carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere is there because of deforestation, or cutting down trees ( Figure 12.45). Trees absorb carbon dioxide
during cellular respiration, so when trees are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air.
This increase in global temperature will cause the sea level to rise. It is also expected to produce an increase in
extreme weather events and change the amount of precipitation. Global warming may also cause food shortages and
species extinction.

Summary

• Air pollution is caused by chemical substances and particles released into the air, mainly by human activities.
• The major cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels.
• Problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels include acid rain and global warming.

How do you paint safely?
If you are painting indoors, there are more important concerns than just getting messy. You should also be concerned
about breathing in the fumes from the paints. Making sure to get plenty of fresh air while painting is very important.
Paint fumes can have serious health effects. Paint fumes are just one example of indoor air pollution.

Indoor Air Pollution

Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions.
When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor
air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn’t get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces
heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend
a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a signiﬁcant health risk.
Indoor air pollutants include both chemical and biological pollutants. Chemical pollutants include the following:

• Radon, a radioactive gas released from the Earth in certain locations. It can become trapped inside buildings

and increase your risk of cancer.

• Secondhand smoke, which comes from breathing the smoke release from tobacco products. Secondhand
smoke is also the smoke exhaled by a cigarette smoker. This smoke is extremely dangerous to human health.
• Carbon monoxide (CO), a toxic gas released by burning fossil fuels. It is often released indoors by faulty

chimneys, gas-powered generators, or burning charcoal; it can be extremely dangerous.

• Dry cleaning ﬂuids, such as tetrachloroethylene, which can be released from clothing days after dry cleaning.
• The past use of asbestos in factories and in homes. Asbestos is a very dangerous material, and it was used in
many buildings ( Figure 12.46). Asbestos can cause cancer and other lung diseases. The use of asbestos is
not allowed today.

FIGURE 12.46
The use of asbestos in industry and do-
mestic environments in the past, as in the

Biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors. These are produced from:

• Pet dander.
• Dust from tiny skin ﬂakes and decomposed hair.
• Dust mites.
• Mold from walls, ceilings, and other structures.
• Air conditioning systems that can incubate certain bacteria and mold.
• Pollen, dust, and mold from houseplants, soil, and surrounding gardens.

Limiting Exposure

Can you avoid indoor air pollution? You can’t go to school outside. But it is possible to reduce your exposure to air
pollution. Some tips to decrease your exposure to indoor air pollution include:

• Using less toxic chemicals when possible.
• Limiting your exposure to pesticides and cleaning ﬂuids by keeping them in a garage or shed.
• When using toxic chemicals, allowing fresh air to circulate through open windows and doors.
• Having detectors for radon and carbon monoxide in your home.

• Describe the health hazards of indoor air pollution.
• Explain the relationship between ozone and smog.
• List ways to protect yourself from air pollution.

Why is this woman wearing a mask?
In many cities around the world, the air quality is so poor that people are often told to stay indoors when possible.
When there is poor air quality in a city, some people choose to wear face masks when they have to be outdoors.
Lowering exposure to air pollutants with a face mask is especially important for people with existing heart or lung
conditions.

Health Hazards of Air Pollution

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 2.4 million people die each year from causes directly related to
air pollution. This includes both outdoor and indoor air pollution. Worldwide, there are more deaths linked to air
pollution each year than to car accidents. Research by the WHO also shows that the worst air quality is in countries
with high poverty and population rates, such as Egypt, Sudan, Mongolia, and Indonesia.
Respiratory system disorders are directly related to air pollution. These disorders have severe effects on human
health, some leading to death directly related to air pollution. Air pollution related respiratory disorders include
asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Asthma is a respiratory disorder characterized by wheezing, coughing, and a
feeling of constriction in the chest. Bronchitis is inﬂammation of the membrane lining of the bronchial tubes of the
lungs. Emphysema is a deadly lung disease characterized by abnormal enlargement of air spaces in the lungs and
destruction of the lung tissue. Additional lung and heart diseases are also related to air pollution, as are respiratory
allergies.

994

Chapter 12. Ecology

Air pollution can also indirectly cause other health issues and even deaths. Air pollutants can cause an increase in
cancer including lung cancer, eye problems, and other conditions. For example, using certain chemicals on farms,
such as the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), can cause
cancer. Indoors, pollutants such as radon or asbestos can also increase your cancer risk. Lastly, air pollution can
lead to heart disease, including heart attack and stroke.

Air Pollution in Cities

Certain respiratory conditions can be made worse in people who live closer to or in large cites. Some studies have
shown that people in urban areas suffer lower levels of lung function and more chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
If you live in a city, you have seen smog. It is a low-hanging, fog-like cloud that seems to never leave the city (
Figure 12.47). Smog is caused by coal burning and by ozone produced by motor vehicle exhaust. Smog can cause
eye irritation and respiratory problems.

Protecting Yourself from Air Pollution

After reading about the effects of air pollution, both indoors and outdoors, you may wonder how you can avoid it.
As for outdoor air pollution, if you hear in the news that the outdoor air quality is particularly bad, then it might
make sense to wear a mask outdoors or to stay indoors. Because you have more control over your indoor air quality
than the outdoor air quality, there are some simple steps you can take indoors to make sure the air quality is less
polluted. These include:

1. Make sure that vents and chimneys are working properly, and never burn charcoal indoors.
2. Place carbon monoxide detectors in the home.
3. Keep your home as clean as possible from pet dander, dust, dust mites, and mold.
4. Make sure air conditioning systems are working properly.

Are there any other ways you can think of to protect yourself from air pollution?

12.27 Sources of Water Pollution

• Describe examples of water pollution.
• Distinguish point source pollution from nonpoint source pollution.

Is the ocean a good dumping ground?
Unfortunately some people think so. A lot of garbage ends up washing ashore, and some garbage stays ﬂoating out
in the ocean. Animals can be strangled by ﬂoating trash or mistake inedible trash for food. Not only is the pollution
of our oceans a problem, but also our precious freshwater resources are often polluted.

Sources of Water Pollution

While to many people clean water may seem limitless and everywhere, to many others this is not so. Water pollution
is a serious issue facing hundreds of millions of people world-wide, having harmful effects on the lives of those
people. Water is not in unlimited supply and cannot just be made fresh when it is wanted. Water is actually a limited
resource, and for many people, fresh, unpolluted water is hard to ﬁnd. A limited resource is one that we use faster
than we can remake it. It is a resource that can be used up.
Water pollution happens when contaminants enter water bodies. Contaminants are any substances that harm the
health of the environment or humans. Most contaminants enter the water because of humans. Surface water (river
or lake) can be exposed to and contaminated by acid rain, storm water runoff, pesticide runoff, and industrial waste.
This water is cleaned somewhat by exposure to sunlight, aeration, and microorganisms in the water. Groundwater
(private wells and some public water supplies) generally takes longer to become contaminated, but the natural clean-
ing process also may take much longer. Groundwater can be contaminated by disease-producing pathogens, careless
disposal of hazardous household chemical-containing products, agricultural chemicals, and leaking underground
storage tanks.

997

12.27. Sources of Water Pollution

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 12.48
Water pollution can cause harmful effects to ecology and human health.
Shown is the pollution in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Natural events, like storms, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes can cause major changes in water quality. But
human-caused contaminants have a much greater impact on the quality of the water supply. Water is considered
polluted either when it does not support a human use, like clean drinking water, or a use for other animals and
plants. The overgrowth of algae, known as an algal bloom, can result from the runoff of fertilizer into bodies of
water. This excess of nutrients allows the algae to grow beyond control, bring harm to the rest of the ecosystem.
The main sources of water pollution can be grouped into two categories:

• Point source pollution results from the contaminants that enter a waterway or water body through a single
site. Examples of this include untreated sewage, wastewater from a sewage treatment plant, and leaking
underground tanks.

• Nonpoint source pollution is contamination that does not come from a single point source. Instead, it happens
when there is a buildup of small amounts of contaminants that collect from a large area. Examples of this
include fertilizer runoff from many farms ﬂowing into groundwater or streams.

Summary

• Water is a limited resource, but it is often polluted by humans.
• Sources of water pollution can be grouped as point source pollution (large amounts entering through a single

site) or nonpoint source pollution (small amounts entering from many sites.)

• Deﬁne eutrophication and explain how this may lead to an algal bloom.
• Summarize the effects of an algal bloom.
• Explain ocean acidiﬁcation and its effects.
• Summarize the effects of waterborne diseases.

Can water have too many nutrients?
Excess nutrients can cause algae to grow like crazy. Too much algae causes the green slime on the water that you
see in this picture. These excess nutrients come from fertilizers that were carried by the runoff from farmland. This
type of water pollution can have serious consequences for the other forms of life trying to survive here.

Effects of Water Pollution

Water pollutants can have an effect on both the ecology of ecosystems and on humans. As a result of water pollution,
humans may not be able to use a waterway for recreation and ﬁshing. Drinking water can also be affected if a toxin
enters the groundwater.

Eutrophication

Chapter 12. Ecology

In a marine ecosystem, algae are the producers. Through photosynthesis, they provide glucose for the ecosystem.
So, can too much algae be a bad thing? Eutrophication is an over-enrichment of chemical nutrients in a body of
water. Usually these nutrients are the nitrogen and phosphorous found in fertilizers. Run-off from lawns or farms
can wash fertilizers into rivers or coastal waters.
Plants are not the only things that grow more quickly with added fertilizers. Algae like the excess nutrients in
fertilizers too. When there are high levels of nutrients in the water, algae populations will grow large very quickly.
This leads to overgrowths of algae called algal blooms. However, these algae do not live very long. They die and
begin to decompose. This process uses oxygen, removing the oxygen from the water. Without oxygen, ﬁsh and
shellﬁsh cannot live, and this results in the death of these organisms ( Figure 12.49).
Certain types of algal blooms can also create toxins. These toxins can enter shellﬁsh. If humans eat these shellﬁsh,
then they can get very sick. These toxins cause neurological problems in humans.

FIGURE 12.49
Lake Valencia, Venezuela, showing green
algal blooms. How did the algal bloom
form? What will
it do to the lake over
time?

Ocean Acidiﬁcation

Ocean acidiﬁcation occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic.
Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed
by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidiﬁcation can kill corals and shellﬁsh. It may also cause
marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may
be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume.

Aquatic Debris

Aquatic debris is trash that gets into fresh- and saltwater waterways. It comes from shipping accidents, landﬁll
erosion, or the direct dumping of trash. Debris can be very dangerous to aquatic wildlife. Some animals may
swallow plastic bags, mistaking them for food. Other animals can be strangled by ﬂoating trash like plastic six-pack
rings. Wildlife can easily get tangled in nets ( Figure 12.50).

FIGURE 12.50
Marine trash can harm different types of
aquatic life. Pictured here is a marine
turtle entangled in a net. How can you
keep this from happening?

Waterborne Diseases

Unsafe water supplies have drastic effects on human health. Waterborne diseases are diseases due to microscopic
pathogens in fresh water. These diseases can be caused by protozoa, viruses, bacteria, and intestinal parasites. In
many parts of the world there are no water treatment plants. If sewage or animal manure gets into a river, then people
downstream will get sick when they drink the water. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal
disease is responsible for the deaths of 1.8 million people every year. It was estimated that 88% of the cases of
diarrheal disease are caused by unsafe water supplies.

Summary

• High levels of nutrients, called eutrophication, can cause conditions that deprive ﬁsh of oxygen.
• Ocean acidiﬁcation occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic,

which harms corals and shellﬁsh.

• Debris can be dangerous to aquatic wildlife.

• Explain why water is a limited resource.
• Explain the Clean Water Act.
• Discuss how water pollution can be prevented.
• Summarize beneﬁts of wastewater treatment.

Do we have an inﬁnite supply of drinkable water?
No. In fact, in many parts of the world, ﬁnding clean drinkable water is difﬁcult. This can lead to various serious
health issues. Hundreds of millions of people world-wide are thought to live in areas where obtaining safe water is
difﬁcult. This makes preserving water resources an important global issue.

Preserving Water Sources

It might seem like there is plenty of water on Earth, but that’s not really the case. Water is a limited resource. That
means that it is used faster than it is replaced. Theoretically, at some point in time, the supply of fresh water could
run out. Though this is unlikely, it is possible. But it is a signiﬁcant issue in parts of the world with large populations.
As these populations continue to grow, the supply of water becomes an increasingly important issue.
Even though we have lots of water in our oceans, we cannot use that water whenever we want. It takes special
equipment, such as a desalination plant, and a lot of energy (and money) to convert salt water into fresh water. Of
all the water on Earth, only about 1% can be used for drinking water. Almost all of the rest of the water is either salt
water in the ocean or ice in glaciers and ice caps. As a result, there are water shortages many places in the world.
Since we have such a limited supply of water, it is important to preserve our water supplies. Therefore, steps have
been taken to prevent water pollution. Technologies have also been developed to conserve water and prevent water
pollution.

1004

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

Sub-Saharan African countries have the most vulnerable water supplies. Some scientists believe of a potential future
crisis in both Asia and Africa from pollution and depletion of natural water resources. Many countries in the Middle
East are at an extreme risk of water shortages. Diminished water supplies could increase the risk of both internal
conﬂicts or wars between countries.

Preventing Water Pollution

In the U.S., concern over water pollution has resulted in many federal laws. Some of these laws go all the way back
to the 1800s! The laws prohibit the disposal of any waste into the nation’s rivers, lakes, streams, and other bodies
of water, unless a person ﬁrst has a permit. Growing concern for controlling water pollutants led to the enactment
of the Clean Water Act in 1972. The Clean Water Act set water quality standards. It also limits the pollution that
can enter the waterways. Other countries are also actively preventing water pollution and purifying water ( Figure
12.51).

FIGURE 12.51
A water puriﬁcation station in France.
Contaminants are removed to make clean
water.

Wastewater Treatment

Fresh water is also preserved by purifying wastewater. Wastewater is water that has been used for cleaning,
washing, ﬂushing, or manufacturing. It includes the water that goes down your shower drain and that is ﬂushed
down your toilet. Instead of dumping wastewater directly into rivers, wastewater can be puriﬁed at a water treatment
plant ( Figure 12.52). When wastewater is recycled, waterborne diseases caused by pathogens in sewage can be
prevented. What are some ways you can save water in your own house?

Summary

• The United States, as well as other countries, have passed laws to preserve water quality and prevent water

pollution.

• In the U.S., we also preserve our freshwater sources by purifying our wastewater.

12.30 Renewable Resources and Alternative En-

ergy Sources

• Distinguish renewable resources from nonrenewable resources.
• Give examples of sustainable resources.
• Describe renewable resources.
• Describe and give examples of alternative energy sources.

Can we use up all of our sunlight?
No, we have a limitless supply of sunlight. That makes it a renewable resource. Products derived from fossil fuels,
like the gasoline we use to drive our cars, are not renewable resources. We will eventually run out of fossil fuels.

Renewable Resources and Alternative Energy Sources

A resource is renewable if it is remade by natural processes at the same rate that humans use it up. Sunlight and wind
are renewable resources because they will not be used up ( Figure 12.53). The rising and falling of ocean tides is
another example of a resource in unlimited supply. A sustainable resource is a resource that is used in a way that
meets the needs of the present without keeping future generations from meeting their needs. People can sustainably
harvest wood, cork, and bamboo. Farmers can also grow crops sustainably by not planting the same crop in their soil
year after year. Planting the same crop each year can remove nutrients from the soil. This means that wood, cork,
bamboo, and crops can be sustainable resources.

Alternative Energy Sources

A nonrenewable resource is one that cannot be replaced as easily as it is consumed. Fossil fuels are an example
of nonrenewable resources. They take millions of years to form naturally, and so they cannot be replaced as fast
as they are consumed. To take the place of fossil fuel use, alternative energy resources are being developed. These

alternative energy sources often utilize renewable resources. The following are examples of sustainable alternative
energy resources:

• Solar power, which uses solar cells to turn sunlight into electricity ( Figure 12.54). The electricity can be

used to power anything that uses normal coal-generated electricity.

FIGURE 12.54
These solar panels convert sunlight into
electricity.

• Wind power, which uses windmills to transform wind energy into electricity. It is used for less than 1% of the
world’s energy needs. But wind energy is growing fast. Every year, 30% more wind energy is used to create
electricity.

• Hydropower ( Figure 12.55), which uses the energy of moving water to turn turbines (similar to windmills)
or water wheels, that create electricity. This form of energy produces no waste or pollution. It is a renewable
resource.

FIGURE 12.55
Hydropower plant.

• Geothermal power, which uses the natural ﬂow of heat from the Earth’s core to produce steam. This steam

is used to turn turbines which create electricity.

• Biomass is the mass of biological organisms. It is usually used to describe the amount of organic matter in
a trophic level of an ecosystem. Biomass production involves using organic matter ("biomass") from plants
to create electricity. Using corn to make ethanol fuel is an example of biomass generated energy. Biomass is
generally renewable.

• Tides in the ocean can also turn a turbine to create electricity. This energy can then be stored until needed (

12.31 Nonrenewable Resources

• Describe and give examples of nonrenewable resources.
• Explain why nuclear power is a nonrenewable resource.

Could we all run out of gasoline?
Yes, we will use up all our gasoline eventually. Gasoline is derived from oil. Oil deposits were formed over hundreds
of millions of years. They cannot be quickly replenished. Oil is an example of a nonrenewable resource.

Nonrenewable Resources

A nonrenewable resource is a natural resource that is consumed or used up faster than it can be made by nature.
Two main types of nonrenewable resources are fossil fuels and nuclear power. Fossil fuels, such as petroleum, coal,
and natural gas, formed from plant and animal remains over periods from 50 to 350 million years ago. They took
millions of years to form. Humans have been consuming fossil fuels for less than 200 years, yet remaining reserves
of oil can supply our needs only until around the year 2055. Natural gas can only supply us until around 2085. Coal
will last longer, until around the year 2250. That is why it is so important to develop alternate forms of energy,
especially for our cars. Today, electric cars are becoming more and more common. Considering the year 2055 is not
that far away, what would happen if we ran out of gasoline? Alternative use of energy, especially in transportation,
must become a standard feature of all cars and trucks and planes by the middle of the century.
Nuclear power is the use of nuclear energy ( nuclear ﬁssion) to create energy inside of a nuclear reactor ( Figure
12.57). Nuclear power is developed from atoms in certain elements, such as uranium. Currently, there are limited
uranium fuel supplies, which will last to about the year 2100 (or longer) at current rates of use. However, new
technologies could make some uranium fuel reserves more useful.
Population growth, especially in developing countries, should make people think about how fast they are consuming
resources. Governments around the world should seriously consider these issues. Developing nations will also

12.32 Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle

• Discuss how reducing, reusing, and recycling can help conserve resources.
• Give examples of reducing the use of resources.
• Give examples of of reusing resources.
• Give examples of things that are commonly recycled.

How can you help conserve our natural resources?
Reduce, reuse, and recycle. There are steps that you personally can take to conserve our natural resources and reduce
waste. The waste that an individual creates is small in proportion to all the waste produced by society. Yet all small
contributions, when added up, make a difference.

Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle

Why conserve resources? During your lifetime, it is possible that the world may run out of some nonrenewable
resources, especially as the population passes 8 then 9 billion people. So it is necessary to try to make these
resources last as long as possible. You may have heard people say, "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle." You may know that
this is the slogan of the campaign to conserve resources. But what do each one of those words truly mean?

1014

Reduce

Chapter 12. Ecology

What exactly does it mean to reduce? Reducing means decreasing the amount of waste we create. That could
also mean cutting down on use of natural resources. In addition, many ways to reduce also result in saving money.
Minimizing of waste may be difﬁcult to achieve for individuals and households, but here are some starting points
that you can include in your daily routine to reduce the use of resources:

• Turn lights off when not using them.
• Turn the television off when no one is watching.
• Replace burned out bulbs with ones that are more energy-efﬁcient ( Figure 12.59).
• Reduce water use by turning off faucets when not using water.
• Use low-ﬂow shower heads, which save on water and use less energy.
• Use low-ﬂush and composting toilets.
• Put kitchen and garden waste into a compost pile.
• In the summer, change ﬁlters on your air conditioner and use as little air conditioning as possible. The use of

air conditioning uses a lot of energy.

• In winter, make sure your furnace is working properly and make sure there is enough insulation on windows

and doors.

• Mend broken or worn items instead of buying new ones.
• When you go shopping for items, buy quantities you know you will use without waste.
• Walk or bicycle instead of using an automobile, in order to save on fuel usage and costs, and to cut down on

pollution.

• When buying a new vehicle, check into hybrid, semi-hybrid, or electric models to cut down on gas usage and

air pollution.

FIGURE 12.59
These ﬂuorescent light bulbs are much
more energy efﬁcient than standard light
bulbs.

Reuse

Let’s now look at what we can reuse. Reusing includes using the same item again for the same function and also
using an item again for a new function. Reuse can have both economic and environmental beneﬁts. New packaging
regulations are helping society to move towards these goals. Water is a resource that can be reused for numerous
purposes. You may not drink used water, but it is quite useful for other purposes. Some ways of reusing resources
include:

1015

12.32. Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle

www.ck12.org

• Use reusable bags when shopping.
• Use gray water. Water that has been used for laundry, for example, can be used to water the garden or ﬂush

toilets.

• At the town level, puriﬁed sewage water can be used for fountains, watering public parks or golf courses, ﬁre

ﬁghting, and irrigating crops.

• Rain can be caught in rain barrels and used to water your garden.

What are some other ways to reuse resources?

Recycle

Now we move on to recycle. Sometimes it may be difﬁcult to understand the differences between reusing and
recycling. Recycling involves processing used materials in order to make them suitable for other uses. That usually
means taking a used item, breaking it down, and reusing the pieces. Even though recycling requires extra energy, it
does often make use of items which are broken, worn out, or cannot be reused.
The things that are commonly recycled include:

• Batteries.
• Biodegradable waste.
• Electronics.
• Iron and steel.
• Aluminum ( Figure 12.60).
• Glass.
• Paper.
• Plastic.
• Textiles, such as clothing.
• Timber.
• Tires.

FIGURE 12.60
These aluminum cans are packed to-
gether in a recycling plant to be reused.

Each type of recyclable requires a different recycling technique. Here are some things you can do to recycle in your
home, school, or community:

1016

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Ecology

• If you have recycling in your community, make sure you separate aluminum, plastics, glass, and paper

products.

• See if your school recycles. If not, you and some friends could start a recycling club, or organize efforts to

better recycling goals.

Laws can also be created to make sure people and companies reduce, reuse, and recycle. Individuals can vote for
leaders who stand for sustainable ecological practices. They can also tell their leaders to make wise use of natural
resources. You can also inﬂuence companies. If you and your family only buy from companies and restaurants
that support recycling or eco-friendly packaging, then other companies will also change to be more environmentally
friendly.

Summary

• Reducing waste, as well as reusing and recycling resources, can help save natural resources
• Consumers can inﬂuence companies to become more environmentally friendly.

• Deﬁne habitat destruction.
• Give examples of habitat destruction.
• Discuss what causes the destruction of habitats.
• Explain the effects of slash-and-burn agriculture.
• Give examples of invasive species.
• Describe the effects of non-native species.

What’s happening to this land?
This picture, taken in southern Mexico, shows land being cleared for agriculture. The forest has been cut down and
burned to make room for a a farm. In the process, homes to many plants and animals were destroyed. This is an
example of habitat destruction.

Habitat Destruction

From a human point of view, a habitat is where you live, go to school, and go to have fun. Your habitat can be
altered, and you can easily adapt. Most people live in a few different places and go to a number of different schools
throughout their life. But a plant or animal may not be able to adapt to a changed habitat. A habitat is the natural
home or environment of an organism. Humans often destroy the habitats of other organisms. Habitat destruction can
cause the extinction of species. Extinction is the complete disappearance of a species. Once a species is extinct, it
can never recover. Some ways humans cause habitat destruction are by clearing land and by introducing non-native
species of plants and animals.

1018

www.ck12.org

Land Loss

Chapter 12. Ecology

Clearing land for agriculture and development is a major cause of habitat destruction. Within the past 100 years, the
amount of total land used for agriculture has almost doubled. Land used for grazing cattle has more than doubled.
Agriculture alone has cost the United States half of its wetlands ( Figure 12.61) and almost all of its tallgrass prairies.
Native prairie ecosystems, with their thick fertile soils, deep-rooted grasses, diversity of colorful ﬂowers, burrowing
prairie dogs, and herds of bison and other animals, have virtually disappeared ( Figure 12.63).

FIGURE 12.61
Wetlands such as this one in Cape
May, New Jersey, ﬁlter water and protect
coastal lands from storms and ﬂoods.

FIGURE 12.62
The Flint Hills contain some of the largest remnants of tallgrass prairie
habitat remaining in North America.

Slash-and-Burn Agriculture

Other habitats that are being rapidly destroyed are forests, especially tropical rainforests. The largest cause of
deforestation today is slash-and-burn agriculture (shown in the opening image). This means that when people
want to turn a forest into a farm, they cut down all of the trees and then burn the remainder of the forest. This
technique is used by over 200 million people in tropical forests throughout the world.
As a consequence of slash-and-burn agriculture, nutrients are quickly lost from the soil. This often results in people
abandoning the land within a few years. Then the top soil erodes and desertiﬁcation can follow. Desertiﬁcation

turns forest into a desert, where it is difﬁcult for plants to grow. Half of the Earth’s mature tropical forests are gone.
At current rates of deforestation, all tropical forests will be gone by the year 2090.

Non-native Species

One of the main causes of extinction is introduction of exotic species into an environment. These exotic and new
species can also be called invasive species or non-native species. These non-native species, being new to an area,
may not have natural predators in the new habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow. Invasive
species out-compete the native species for resources. Sometimes invasive species are so successful at living in a
certain habitat that the native species go extinct ( Figure 12.64).
Recently, cargo ships have transported zebra mussels, spiny waterﬂeas, and ruffe (a freshwater ﬁsh) into the Great
Lakes ( Figure 12.65). These invasive species are better at hunting for food. They have caused some of the native
species to go extinct.
Invasive species can disrupt food chains, carry disease, prey on native species directly, and out-compete native
species for limited resources, like food. All of these effects can lead to extinction of the native species.

Other Causes

Other causes of habitat destruction include poor ﬁre management, overﬁshing, mining ( Figure 12.66), pollution,
and storm damage. All of these can cause irreversible changes to a habitat and ecosystem.

Examples of Habitat Destruction

A habitat that is quickly being destroyed is the wetland. By the 1980s, over 80% of all wetlands in parts of the U.S.
were destroyed. In Europe, many wetland species have gone extinct. For example, many bogs in Scotland have been
lost because of human development.
Another example of species loss due to habitat destruction happened on Madagascar’s central highland plateau.
From 1970 to 2000, slash-and-burn agriculture destroyed about 10% of the country’s total native plants. The area
turned into a wasteland. Soil from erosion entered the waterways. Much of the river ecosystems of several large

Ocean are completely lost.

12.34 Human Causes of Extinction

• Describe the effects of global warming on habitats.
• Summarize associations between pollution and species extinction.
• Discuss issues associated with human overpopulation.

Why are these polar bears threatened?
These polar bears are threatened because of global warming. They depend on the sea ice for their hunting grounds,
and this ice is melting away. Plus bears have to make a longer and more hazardous journey to get to the remaining
ice.

Other Causes of Extinction

In addition to habitat destruction, other human-caused problems are also threatening many species. These include
issues associated with climate change, pollution, and over-population.

Global Warming

Another major cause of extinction is global warming, which is also known as global climate change. During the past
century, the Earth’s average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is signiﬁcant,
but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be
hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased
use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can
destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For
example, if the seas increase in temperature, even brieﬂy, it may be too warm for certain types of ﬁsh to reproduce.

1024

www.ck12.org

Pollution

Chapter 12. Ecology

Pollution adds chemicals, noise, heat, or even light to an environment. This can have many different harmful effects
on all kinds of organisms. For example, the pesticide DDT nearly eliminated the peregrine falcon in some parts of
the world. This pesticide caused falcons to lay eggs with thinner shells. As a result, fewer falcon eggs survived to
hatching. Populations of peregrine falcons declined rapidly. DDT was then banned in the U.S. and peregrine falcon
populations have recovered.
Water pollution threatens vital freshwater and marine resources throughout the world ( Figure 12.67). Speciﬁcally,
industrial and agricultural chemicals, waste, and acid rain threaten water. As water is essential for all ecosystems,
water pollution can result in the extinction of species.

FIGURE 12.67
A bird that was the victim of an oil
spill. About 58,000 gallons of oil spilled
from a South Korea-bound container ship
when it struck a tower supporting the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in dense
fog in November, 2007.

Finally, soil contamination can also result in extinction. Soil contamination can come from toxic industrial and
municipal wastes ( Figure 12.68), salts from irrigation, and pesticides from agriculture. These all degrade the soil
as well. As soil is the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems, this can result in extinction.

Human Overpopulation

Human populations are on the rise. The human population passed the 7 billion mark in October of 2011, and will
pass 8 and 9 billion probably before the middle of the century. All these people will need resources such as places to
live, food to eat, and water to drink, and they will use energy and create waste. Essentially, human population growth
can effect all other causes of extinction. For example, more people on the Earth means more people contributing
to global warming and pollution. More people also means more clearing of land for agriculture and development.
Recall that development by humans often causes habitats to be destroyed. This destruction can force species to go
extinct, or move somewhere else.

Summary

• Global climate change is a major cause of extinctions.
• Pollution of chemicals, noise, heat, or even light to an environment can be harmful to organisms.

12.35 Importance of Biodiversity

• Deﬁne biodiversity.
• Discuss the ecological and economic importance of biodiversity.
• Deﬁne and discuss biomimicry (bionics).

Why is preserving the rainforest important?
Preserving the rainforest is important for many reasons. But one reason conservation efforts have focused here is
that the rainforest is home to more species of insects, amphibians, and birds than anywhere else on the planet. This
wide diversity of life is called biodiversity.

Importance of Biodiversity

Biodiversity is a measurement of the amount of variation of the species in a given area. More speciﬁcally, biodi-
versity can be deﬁned as the variety of life and its processes, including the variety of living organisms, the genetic
differences among them, and the communities and ecosystems in which they occur.
A place such as a coral reef has many different species of plants and animals. That means the coral reef is a ecosystem
with high biodiversity ( Figure 12.69). Because of its biodiversity, the rainforest shown above is an ecosystem with
extreme importance. Why is biodiversity so important? In addition to maintaining the health and stability of the
ecosystem, the diversity of life provides us with many beneﬁts.
Extinction is a threat to biodiversity. Does it matter if we are losing thousands of species each year? The answer
is yes. It matters even if we consider not only the direct beneﬁts to humans, but also the beneﬁts to the ecosystems.
The health and survival of ecosystems is related to that ecosystem’s biodiversity.

1027

12.35. Importance of Biodiversity

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 12.69
Coral reefs are one of the biomes with the
highest biodiversity on Earth.

Economic Importance

Economically, there are many direct beneﬁts of biodiversity. As many as 40,000 species of fungi, plants, and animals
provide us with many varied types of clothing, shelter, medicines and other products. These include poisons, timber,
ﬁbers, fragrances, papers, silks, dyes, adhesives, rubber, resins, skins, furs, and more. According to one survey, 57%
of the most important prescription drugs come from nature. Speciﬁcally, they come from bacteria, fungi, plants,
and animals ( Figure 12.70). But only a small amount of species with the ability to give us medicines have been
explored. The loss of any species may mean the loss of new medicines, which will have a direct effect on human
health.

Biodiversity and Technology

Chapter 12. Ecology

Nature has inspired many technologies in use today. Bionics, also known as biomimetics or biomimicry, uses
organisms to inspire technology or engineering projects. By studying animals and their traits, we are able to gain
valuable information that we can put to use to help us. For example, rattlesnake heat-sensing pits helped inspire the
development of infrared sensors. Zimbabwe’s Eastgate Centre ( Figure 12.71) was inspired by the air-conditioning
efﬁciency of a termite mound ( Figure 12.72).

FIGURE 12.71
the Eastgate Centre (brown
Design of
building),
in Zimbabwe, which requires
just 10% of the energy needed for a con-
ventional building of the same size, was
inspired by a biological design.

Ecological Importance

Biodiversity also has many beneﬁts to ecosystems. High biodiversity makes ecosystems more stable. What can
happen to an ecosystem if just one species goes extinct? What if that one species was a producer or decomposer?
Would the loss of a producer have an effect on all the organisms that relied on that producer? If a decomposer
vanishes, are there other decomposers to ﬁll the void? Maybe the resulting species will adapt. Other species may ﬁll
in the niche left by the extinct species. But the extinction of one species could have a "domino" effect, resulting in
the extinction of other species. This could greatly effect the stability of the whole ecosystem.

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 12.72
The air-conditioning efﬁciency of this ter-
mite mound was the inspiration for the
Eastgate Centre.

One important role of biodiversity is that it helps keep the nutrients, such as nitrogen, in the soil. For example, a
diversity of organisms in the soil allows nitrogen ﬁxation and nutrient recycling to happen. Biodiversity also allows
plants to be pollinated by different types of insects. And of course, different species of fungi are necessary to recycle
wastes from dead plants and animals. These are just a few of the many examples of how biodiversity is important
for ecosystems.

Summary

• Biodiversity is a measurement of the amount of variation of the species in a given area.
• Biodiversity is important because it directly beneﬁts humans and ecosystems.

Summary

Ecology is the study of ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the
habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction.
Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the ﬂow of energy. The formation of
ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able
to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area.
The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the
human population have raised many important ecological issues.
