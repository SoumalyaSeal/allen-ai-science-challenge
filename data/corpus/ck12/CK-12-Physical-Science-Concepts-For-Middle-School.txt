Foreword

The study of physical science is an exploration of chemistry, physics, and the Earth. The CK-12 Physical Science
Concept Collection presents physical science as a set of 5 chapters, each centered around a general subject area, such
as the study of chemical interactions. Each chapter is broken down into concepts. Each concept is a mini-lesson
that addresses one speciﬁc topic or key objective. The complete CK-12 Physical Science Concept Collection is
comprised of 297 concepts.

Introduction

Are you curious about other planets? Did you ever wish you could explore them like the Mars rover in this picture?
If so, then you’re thinking like a scientist. Scientists are curious about things in nature, and they do investigations to
better understand them. They often use technology—from microscopes to Mars rovers—to extend their own senses
so they can learn even more. In this unit, you’ll read about how scientists think and how they investigate and explore
the natural world.

Introduction to Physical Science

1.1 Nature of Science

• Deﬁne science.
• Explain the goal of science.
• Describe how science advances knowledge.
• Design a scientiﬁc experiment.

Does the word science make you think of high-tech labs and researchers in white coats like the ones in this picture?
This is often an accurate image of science but not always. If you look up science in a dictionary, you would ﬁnd that
it comes from a Latin word that means “having knowledge.” However, this isn’t an adequate deﬁnition either.

What Is Science?

Science is more about gaining knowledge than it is about simply having knowledge. Science is a way of learning
about the natural world that is based on evidence and logic. In other words, science is a process, not just a body of
facts. Through the process of science, our knowledge of the world advances.

The Goal of Science

Scientists may focus on very different aspects of the natural world. For example, some scientists focus on the world
of tiny objects, such as atoms and molecules. Other scientists devote their attention to huge objects, such as the sun
and other stars. But all scientists have at least one thing in common. They want to understand how and why things
happen. Achieving this understanding is the goal of science.
Have you ever experienced the thrill of an exciting ﬁreworks show like the one pictured in the Figure 1.1? Fireworks
show how the goal of science leads to discovery. Fireworks were invented at least 2000 years ago in China, but
explaining how and why they work didn’t happen until much later.
It wasn’t until scientists had learned about
elements and chemical reactions that they could explain what caused ﬁreworks to create brilliant bursts of light and
deep rumbling booms.

Fireworks were invented long before scientists could actually explain how
and why they explode.

How Science Advances

Sometimes learning about science is frustrating because scientiﬁc knowledge is always changing. But that’s also
what makes science exciting. Occasionally, science moves forward in giant steps. More commonly, however,
science advances in baby steps.
Giant steps in science may occur if a scientist introduces a major new idea. For example, in 1666, Isaac Newton
introduced the idea that gravity is universal. People had long known that things fall to the ground because they are
attracted by Earth. But Newton proposed that everything in the universe exerts a force of attraction on everything
else. This idea is known as Newton’s law of universal gravitation.
Q: How do you think Newton’s law of universal gravitation might have inﬂuenced the advancement of science?
A: Newton’s law allowed scientists to understand many different phenomena. It explains not only why things always
fall down toward the ground or roll downhill. It also explains the motion of many other objects. For example, it
explains why planets orbit the sun. The idea of universal gravity even helped scientists discover the planets Neptune
and Pluto. The caption and diagram in the Figure 1.2 explain how.
Baby steps in science occur as small bits of evidence gradually accumulate. The accumulating evidence lets scientists
reﬁne and expand on earlier ideas. For example, the scientiﬁc idea of the atom was introduced in the early 1800s.
But scientists came to understand the structure of the atom only as evidence accumulated over the next two centuries.
Their understanding of atomic structure continues to expand today.
The advancement of science is sometimes a very bumpy road. New knowledge and ideas aren’t always accepted
at ﬁrst, and scientists may be mocked for their ideas. The idea that Earth’s continents drift on the planet’s surface
is a good example. This idea was ﬁrst proposed by a scientist named Alfred Wegener in the early 1900s. Wegener
also proposed that all of the present continents had once formed one supercontinent, which he named Pangaea (see
Figure 1.3). Other scientists not only rejected Wegener’s ideas, but ridiculed Wegener for even suggesting them. It
wasn’t until the 1950s that enough evidence had accumulated for scientists to realize that Wegener had been right.
Unfortunately, Wegener did not live long enough to see his ideas accepted.
Q: What types of evidence might support Wegener’s ideas?
A: Several types of evidence support Wegener’s ideas. For example, similar fossils and rock formations have been
found on continents that are now separated by oceans. It is also now known that Earth’s crust consists of rigid
plates that slide over molten rock below them. This explains how continents can drift. Even the shapes of today’s
continents show how they once ﬁt together, like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle.

• Science is a way of learning about the natural world that is based on evidence and logic.

the wobble
was caused by the pull of gravity of an-
other, not-yet-discovered planet. Scien-

planet. When they discovered Neptune in
1846, they thought they had found their
missing planet. After the astronomers
took into account the effects of Neptune’s
gravity,
they saw that Uranus still had
an unexplained wobble. They predicted
that
there must be another planet be-
yond Neptune. That planet, now called
Pluto, was ﬁnally discovered in 1930. Of
special note, as of 2006,
the Interna-

Pluto from its planet status as it does
not meet one of
the criteria for plan-

1.2 Scientiﬁc Induction

• Deﬁne inductive reasoning.
• Describe how inductive reasoning is used in science.
• Explain why inductive reasoning cannot prove conclusively that an idea is true.

The man in this photo is a police detective. He’s examining and gathering clues that may help solve a crime. Based
on all of the clues he ﬁnds, he may be able to conclude who committed the crime. Doing science is similar to solving
crimes. It also involves gathering evidence and drawing conclusions. Both solving crimes and doing science use
inductive reasoning.

What Is Inductive Reasoning?

Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions based on many clues, or pieces of evidence.
Many crimes are solved using inductive reasoning. It is also the hallmark of science and the basis of the scientiﬁc
method.
Q: How might the police detective pictured above use inductive reasoning to solve the crime?
A: The detective might gather clues that provide evidence about the identity of the person who committed the
crime. For example, he might ﬁnd ﬁngerprints or other evidence left behind by the perpetrator. The detective might
eventually ﬁnd enough clues to be able to conclude the identity of the most likely suspect.

Inductive Reasoning in Science

A simple example will help you understand how inductive reasoning works in science. Suppose you grew up on a
planet named Quim, where there is no gravity. In fact, assume you’ve never even heard of gravity. You travel to Earth
(on a student exchange program) and immediately notice things are very different here than on your home planet.

1.2. Scientiﬁc Induction

FIGURE 1.4

For one thing, when you step out of your spacecraft, you fall directly to the ground. Then, when you let go of your
communications device, it falls to the ground as well. On Quim, nothing ever falls to the ground. For example, if you
had let go of your communications device back home, it would have just stayed in place by your upper appendage.
You notice that everything you let go of falls to the ground. Using inductive reasoning, you conclude that all objects
fall to the ground on Earth.
Then, you make the observation pictured ( Figure 1.5). You see round objects rising up into the sky, rather
than falling toward the ground as you expect. Clearly, your ﬁrst conclusion—although based on many pieces
of evidence—is incorrect. You need to gather more evidence to come to a conclusion that explains all of your
observations.

FIGURE 1.5
Evidence that not everything falls to the ground on Earth.

Q: What conclusion might you draw based on the additional evidence of the balloons rising instead of falling?
A: With this and other evidence, you might conclude that objects heavier than air fall to the ground but objects
lighter than air do not.

Limits on Inductive Reasoning

Inductive reasoning can’t solve a crime or arrive at the correct scientiﬁc conclusion with 100 percent certainty. It’s
always possible that some piece of evidence remains to be found that would disprove the conclusion. That’s why
jurors in a trial are told to decide whether the defendant is guilty “without a reasonable doubt”—not without a shred
of doubt. Similarly, a scientiﬁc theory is never really proven conclusively to be true. However, it can be supported

8

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

by so much evidence that it is accepted “without a reasonable doubt.”

Summary

• Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions based on many pieces of evidence. This

type of reasoning is the basis of the scientiﬁc method.

• In science, inductive reasoning is used to draw general conclusions from evidence. The conclusions are

changed if necessary to explain new evidence as it becomes available.

• Inductive reasoning cannot prove conclusively that an idea is true, but it may lead to conclusions that are very

likely to be true.

Deductive reasoning is another type of reasoning. You can think of deductive reasoning as inductive reasoning in
reverse. With deductive reasoning, you draw speciﬁc conclusions based on general statements that are assumed to
be true. At the URL below, read the short article comparing inductive and deductive reasoning. Then put your
knowledge into practice by doing the exercises that follow the article.

1.3 Scientiﬁc Theory

• Deﬁne scientiﬁc theory.
• Compare "theory" to "scientiﬁc theory."
• Describe important theories of physical science.
• Relate the law of parsimony to scientiﬁc theories.

This photo shows a girl and her parents. They are having a discussion. As you can see, the girl is rolling her eyes.
What do you think her parents may have said that caused this reaction? Could it be they have just grounded her
for some reason? That’s certainly one possibility, but without any other information to go on, it’s “just a theory.” In
other words, it’s just a hunch or a guess. Theories are very important in science, but in science a theory is never a
hunch or a guess. It is much more than that.

Not “Just a Theory”

The term theory is used differently in science than it is used in everyday language. A scientiﬁc theory is a broad
explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence. Because it is so well
supported, a scientiﬁc theory has a very good chance of being a correct explanation for events in nature. Because it
is a broad explanation, it can explain many observations and pieces of evidence. In other words, it can help connect
and make sense of many phenomena in the natural world.

Introduction to Physical Science

Examples of Theories in Physical Science

A number of theories in science were ﬁrst proposed many decades or even centuries ago, but they have withstood the
test of time. An example of a physical science theory that has mainly withstood the test of time is Dalton’s atomic
theory. John Dalton was a British chemist who lived in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Around 1800, he published
his atomic theory, which is one of the most important theories in science. According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all
substances consist of tiny particles called atoms. Furthermore, all the atoms of a given element are identical, whereas
the atoms of different elements are always different. These parts of Dalton’s atomic theory are still accepted today,
although some other details of his theory have since been disproven.
Dalton based his theory on many pieces of evidence. For example, he studied many substances called compounds.
These are substances that consist of two or more different elements. Dalton determined that a given compound
always consists of the same elements in exactly the same proportions, no matter how small the sample of the
compound. This idea is illustrated for the compound water in the Figure 1.6. Dalton concluded from this evidence
that elements must be made up of tiny particles in order to always combine in the same speciﬁc proportions in any
given compound.

FIGURE 1.6
Water is a compound that consists of
the elements hydrogen (H) and oxygen
(O). Like other compounds, the smallest
particles of water are called molecules.
Each molecule of water (H2O) contains
two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of
oxygen.

Q: Dalton thought that atoms are the smallest particles of matter. Scientists now know that atoms are composed of
even smaller particles. Does this mean that the rest of Dalton’s atomic theory should be thrown out?
A: The discovery of particles smaller than atoms doesn’t mean that we should scrap the entire theory. Atoms are
still known to be the smallest particles of elements that have the properties of the elements. Also, it is atoms—not
particles of atoms—that combine in ﬁxed proportions in compounds.
Instead of throwing out Dalton’s theory,
scientists have reﬁned and expanded on it.
There are many other important physical science theories. Here are three more examples:

• Einstein’s theory of gravity
• Kinetic theory of matter
• Wave-particle theory of light

11

1.3. Scientiﬁc Theory

Keep It Simple

www.ck12.org

The formation of scientiﬁc theories is generally guided by the law of parsimony. The word parsimony means
“thriftiness.” The law of parsimony states that, when choosing between competing theories, you should select the
theory that makes the fewest assumptions. In other words, the simpler theory is more likely to be correct. For
example, you probably know that Earth and the other planets of our solar system orbit around the sun. But several
centuries ago, it was believed that Earth is at the center of the solar system and the other planets orbit around Earth.
While it is possible to explain the movement of planets according to this theory, the explanation is unnecessarily
complex.
Q: Why do you think parsimony is an important characteristic of scientiﬁc theories?
A: The more assumptions that must be made to form a scientiﬁc theory, the more chances there are for the theory to
be incorrect. If one assumption is wrong, so is the theory. Conversely, the theory that makes the fewest assumptions,
assuming it is well supported by evidence, is most likely to be correct.

Summary

• A scientiﬁc theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of

evidence.

• Examples of theories in physical science include Dalton’s atomic theory, Einstein’s theory of gravity, and the

kinetic theory of matter.

• The formation of scientiﬁc theories is generally guided by the law of parsimony. According to this law, the

simplest of competing theories is most likely to be correct.

1.4 Scientiﬁc Law

• Deﬁne scientiﬁc law.
• Compare scientiﬁc laws to scientiﬁc theories.
• Discuss scientiﬁc laws of physical science.
• Describe the place of laws in science.

Did you ever drive a bumper car like the one pictured here? As you drive around the track, other drivers try to bump
into your car and push it out of the way. When another car bumps into yours, both cars may bounce back from the
collision. The harder the two cars collide, the farther back they bounce.

It’s the Law

It may seem like common sense that bumper cars change their motion when they collide. That’s because all objects
behave this way - it’s the law! A scientiﬁc law, called Newton’s third law of motion, states that for every action there
is an equal and opposite reaction. Thus, when one bumper car acts by ramming another, one or both cars react by
pushing apart.
Q: What are some other examples of Newton’s third law of motion? What actions are always followed by reactions?
A: Other examples of actions and reactions include hitting a ball with a bat and the ball bouncing back; and pushing
a swing and the swing moving away.

Laws in Science

Newton’s third law of motion is just one of many scientiﬁc laws. A scientiﬁc law is a statement describing what
always happens under certain conditions. Other examples of laws in physical science include:

13

1.4. Scientiﬁc Law

www.ck12.org

• Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion
• Newton’s second law of motion
• Newton’s law of universal gravitation
• Law of conservation of mass
• Law of conservation of energy
• Law of conservation of momentum

Laws vs. Theories

Scientiﬁc laws state what always happen. This can be very useful. It can let you let you predict what will happen
under certain circumstances. For example, Newton’s third law tells you that the harder you hit a softball with a bat,
the faster and farther the ball will travel away from the bat. However, scientiﬁc laws have a basic limitation. They
don’t explain why things happen. “Why” questions are answered by scientiﬁc theories, not scientiﬁc laws.
Q: You know that the sun always sets in the west. This could be expressed as a scientiﬁc law. Think of something
else that always happens in nature. How could you express it as a scientiﬁc law?
A: Something else that always happens in nature is water ﬂowing downhill rather than uphill. This could be
expressed as the law, “When water ﬂows over a hill, it always ﬂows from a higher to a lower elevation.”

Summary

• A scientiﬁc law is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions. Newton’s three laws

of motion are examples of laws in physical science.

• A scientiﬁc law states what always happens but not why it happens. Scientiﬁc theories answer “why”

questions.

1.5 History of Science

• Explain what is meant by the "evolution of science."
• Summarize the evolution of science.
• Identify major contributions in the history of science.

Who is this man with the wild white hair? Could he be an aging rock star? He’s not a famous musician, but he’s just
as famous as many celebrities. His name is Albert Einstein, and he’s arguably the most important scientist of the
20th century. Einstein really shook up science with his discoveries in the early 1900s. That may sound like a long
time ago, but in terms of the history of science, it’s as though it were only yesterday.

Evolution of Science

People have probably wondered about the natural world for as long as there have been people. So it’s no surprise
that science has roots that go back thousands of years. Some of the earliest contributions to science were made
by Greek philosophers more than two thousand years ago. It wasn’t until many centuries later, however, that the
scientiﬁc method and experimentation were introduced. The dawn of modern science occurred even more recently.
It is generally traced back to the scientiﬁc revolution, which took place in Europe starting in the 1500s.

In the Beginning

A Greek philosopher named Thales, who lived around 600 BCE, has been called the “father of science” for his ideas
about the natural world. He proposed that natural events such as lightning and earthquakes have natural causes. Up
until then, people understood such events to be the acts of gods or other supernatural forces.

16

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

Q: Why was Thales’ idea about natural causes such an important contribution to science?
A: Natural causes can be investigated and understood, whereas gods or other supernatural causes are “above nature”
and not suitable for investigation.
Just a few hundred years after Thales, the Greek philosopher Aristotle made a very important contribution to science.
You can see what Aristotle looked like in the Figure 1.7. Prior to Aristotle, other philosophers believed that they
could ﬁnd the truth about the natural world by inward reﬂection—in other words, just by thinking about it. Aristotle,
in contrast, thought that truth about the natural world could come only from observations of nature and inductive
reasoning. He argued that knowledge of nature must be based on evidence and logic. This idea is called empiricism,
and it is the basis of science today.

Introducing the Scientiﬁc Method

In the ﬁrst 1000 years CE, Europe went through a period called the Dark Ages. Science and learning in general
were all but abandoned. However, in other parts of the world science ﬂourished. During this period, some of the
most important contributions to science were made by Persian scholars. For example, during the 700s CE, a Persian
scientist named Geber introduced the scientiﬁc method and experimentation in chemistry. His ideas and methods
were later adopted by European chemists. Today, Geber is known as the “father of chemistry.”

Modern Western Science Emerges

Starting in the mid-1500s, a scientiﬁc revolution occurred in Europe. This was the beginning of modern Western
science. Many scientiﬁc advances were made during a period of just a couple of hundred years. The revolution in
science began when Copernicus made the ﬁrst convincing arguments that the sun—not Earth—is the center of what
we now call the solar system. (You can see both models of the solar system in the Figure 1.8.) This was a drastic
shift in thinking about Earth’s place in the cosmos. Around 1600, the Italian scientist Galileo greatly improved the
telescope, which had just been invented, and made many important discoveries in the ﬁeld of astronomy. Some of
Galileo’s observations provided additional evidence for Copernicus’ sun-centered solar system.
Q: Copernicus’ ideas about the solar system were so inﬂuential that the scientiﬁc revolution is sometimes called the
“Copernican revolution.” Why do you think Copernicus’ ideas led to a revolution in science?
A: Copernicus’ ideas about the solar system are considered to be the starting point of modern astronomy. They
changed how all future scientists interpreted observations in astronomy. They also led to a ﬂurry of new scientiﬁc
investigation. Other contributions to science that occurred during the scientiﬁc revolution include:

• Kepler’s laws of planetary motion
• Newton’s law of universal gravitation
• Newton’s three laws of motion

Einstein Rocks Science

Another major shift in science occurred with the work of Albert Einstein (the “rock star” scientist pictured in the
opening image). In 1916, Einstein published his general theory of relativity. This theory relates matter and energy. It
also explains gravity as a property of space and time (rather than a property of matter as Newton thought). Einstein’s
theory has been supported by all evidence and observations to date, whereas Newton’s law of gravity does not apply
to all cases. Einstein’s theory is still the accepted explanation for gravity today.
Q: How might Einstein’s theory have inﬂuenced the course of science?
A: Einstein’s theory suggested new areas of investigation. Many predictions based on the theory were later found
to be true. For example, black holes in the universe were predicted by Einstein’s theory and later conﬁrmed by
scientiﬁc evidence.

Summary

• Science has roots that go back thousands of years to Greek philosophers including Thales and Aristotle.
• The scientiﬁc method was introduced in the 700s by a Persian scientist named Geber.
• Modern science began with the scientiﬁc revolution in Europe the 1500s and 1600s. The scientiﬁc revolution

was launched by Copernicus’ new ideas about the solar system.

1.6 Women and People of Color in Science

• Explain why there are relatively few women and people of color in science.
• Identify several contributions to physical science made by women or people of color.

This woman is playing a ﬂute in what appears to be a cockpit. But why are her feet strapped to the ﬂoor? And why
is her hair standing on end? The woman in the photo is astronaut Ellen Ochoa, Ph.D., and she’s playing her ﬂute
aboard the space shuttle Discovery. The straps prevent her from ﬂoating into the air in the zero-gravity ship. The
lack of gravity also explains her hairdo. In addition to being an astronaut who has ﬂown several space missions, Dr.
Ochoa is a leading research scientist and an inventor with several patents to her credit.

Biases Against Women and People of Color

Dr. Ochoa is one of just a few dozen female astronauts in the U.S. She is also the ﬁrst Hispanic woman in the world
to go into space. Although females make up more than half of the U.S. population, fewer than 25 percent of U.S.
astronauts are women. Women are also under-represented in science, especially physical sciences such as chemistry
and physics. What explains this?
Throughout history, women—and also people of color of both genders—have rarely had the same chances as white
males for education and careers in science. Cultural, social, and economic biases have made it far harder for them
than for white males to excel in this area. This explains why there have been fewer scientists among their ranks.

1.7 Ethics in Science

• Deﬁne ethics.
• Identify ethical rules in science.
• Describe how scientiﬁc knowledge might inﬂuence everyday ethical decisions.

Believe it or not, the tree bark in this photo contains a revolutionary anti-cancer drug. For almost a decade after the
drug was discovered, the trees, called Paciﬁc yews, were stripped of their bark so chemists could extract the drug for
cancer patients. Stripping the bark harmed the trees. This situation posed an ethical problem.

What Is Ethics?

Ethics refers to deciding what’s right and what’s wrong. Making ethical decisions involves weighing right and
wrong in order to make the best choice. The ethical problem of the Paciﬁc yew has both right and wrong aspects.
It’s right to save lives with the cancer drug that comes from the tree bark, but it’s wrong to endanger the tree and risk
its extinction.
Q: What do you think is the most ethical decision about the Paciﬁc yew? Should the bark be used to make the drug
and possibly save human lives? Or should this be prohibited in order to protect the tree from possible extinction?
A: This is tough ethical dilemma, and there is no right or wrong answer. Ethical dilemmas such as this often
spur scientists to come up with new solutions to problems. That’s what happened in the case of the Paciﬁc yew.
Scientists tackled and solved the problem of determining the chemical structure of the anti-cancer drug so it could
be synthesized in labs. This is a win-win solution to the problem. The synthetic drug is now available to save lives,
and the trees are no longer endangered by being stripped of their bark.

Ethical Rules in Science

www.ck12.org

Ethics is an important consideration in science. Scientiﬁc investigations must be guided by what is right and what is
wrong. That’s where ethical rules come in. They help ensure that science is done safely and that scientiﬁc knowledge
is reliable. Here are some of the ethical rules that scientists must follow:

• Scientiﬁc research must be reported honestly.

It is wrong and misleading to make up or change research

results.

• Scientiﬁc researchers must try to see things as they really are. They should avoid being biased by the results

they expect or hope to get.

• Researchers must be careful. They should do whatever they can to avoid errors in their data.
• Researchers must inform coworkers and members of the community about any risks of their research. They

should do the research only if they have the consent of these groups.

• Researchers studying living animals must treat them humanely. They should provide for their needs and take

pains to avoid harming them.

• Researchers studying human subjects must tell their subjects that they have the right to refuse to participate
in the research. Human subjects also must be fully informed about their role in the research, including any
potential risks. You can read about a terrible violation of this ethical rule in the Figure 1.9.

FIGURE 1.9
From the 1930s to 1970s, medical re-
searchers (including the one pictured
here) studied the progression of a seri-

simply receiving free medical care. They

ease, nor were the men treated for the
disease when a cure was discovered in

for another 25 years.
It came to an end
only when a whistleblower made it a front-
page story around the nation.

Science and Everyday Ethical Decisions

Sometimes, science can help people make ethical decisions in their own lives. For example, scientiﬁc evidence
shows that certain human actions—such as driving cars that burn gasoline—are contributing to changes in Earth’s
climate. This, in turn, is causing more severe weather and the extinction of many species. A number of ethical
decisions might be inﬂuenced by this scientiﬁc knowledge.
Q: For example, should people avoid driving cars to work or school because it contributes to climate change and
the serious problems associated with it? What if driving is the only way to get there? Can you think of an ethical
solution?
A: This example shows that ethical decisions may not be all or nothing. For example, rather than driving alone,
people might carpool with others. This would reduce their impact on climate change. They could also try to reduce

their impact in other ways. For example, they might turn down their thermostat in cold weather so their furnace
burns less fuel.

Summary

• Ethics refers to deciding what’s right and what’s wrong.
• Scientiﬁc investigations must be guided by ethical rules. The rules help ensure that science is done safely and

that scientiﬁc knowledge is reliable.

• Sometimes science can help people make ethical decisions in their own lives, but other factors usually must

be considered as well.

• Deﬁne physical science.
• Deﬁne chemistry and physics.
• Discuss ways people depend on physical science.

Unless you’re a competitive swimmer like the athletes in the picture, you probably don’t wear a full-body swimsuit.
The swimsuit was designed to help a swimmer glide smoothly through the water without restricting body movements.
The suit is made of two synthetic ﬁbers: nylon, which is very smooth, lightweight, and durable; and spandex, which
is very stretchy. This is just one example of the many ways that sports gear, equipment, and performance have been
improved by physical science.

What Is Physical Science?

Physical science is the study of matter and energy. That covers a lot of territory because matter refers to all the
“stuff” that exists in the universe. It includes everything you can see and many things that you cannot see, including
the air around you. Energy is also universal. It’s what gives matter the ability to move and change. Electricity, heat,
and light are some of the forms that energy can take.

Chemistry and Physics

Physical science, in turn, can be divided into chemistry and physics. Chemistry is the study of matter and energy at
the scale of atoms and molecules. For example, the synthetic ﬁbers in the swimmer’s suit were created in labs by
chemists. Physics is the study of matter and energy at all scales—from the tiniest particles of matter to the entire

universe. Knowledge of several important physics concepts—such as motion and forces—contributed to the design
of the swimmer’s suit.
Q: It’s not just athletes that depend on physical science. We all do. What might be some ways that physical science
inﬂuences our lives?
A: We depend on physical science for just about everything that makes modern life possible. You couldn’t turn on a
light, make a phone call, or use a computer without centuries of discoveries in chemistry and physics. The Figure
1.10 show a variety of other ways that people depend on physical science. Think about how knowledge of energy
and matter makes each action possible.

• Give examples of chemistry in everyday life.

The Statue of Liberty, pictured above, is an icon of America and freedom. The statue is made of steel and covered
with a thin layer of copper, the same type of matter that pennies are made of. Copper is a brownish red metal, so
why is the statue green? Chemistry, which is a branch of physical science, has the answer.

What Is Chemistry?

Chemistry is the study of matter and energy and how they interact, mainly at the level of atoms and molecules.
Basic concepts in chemistry include chemicals, which are speciﬁc types of matter, and chemical reactions. In a
chemical reaction, atoms or molecules of certain types of matter combine chemically to form other types of matter.
All chemical reactions involve energy.
Q: How do you think chemistry explains why the copper on the Statue of Liberty is green instead of brownish red?
A: The copper has become tarnished. The tarnish—also called patina—is a compound called copper carbonate,
which is green. Copper carbonate forms when copper undergoes a chemical reaction with carbon dioxide in moist
air. The green patina that forms on copper actually preserves the underlying metal. That’s why it’s not removed from
the statue. Some people also think that the patina looks attractive.

Did you ever look at your reﬂection in a funhouse mirror? That’s what the person in this picture is doing. This type
of mirror distorts your features in silly ways. Do you know how a mirror like this one works? Physics, which is a
branch of physical science, can explain it.

The Scope of Physics

Physics is the study of energy, matter, and their interactions. It’s a very broad ﬁeld because it is concerned with
matter and energy at all levels—from the most fundamental particles of matter to the entire universe. Some people
would even argue that physics is the study of everything! Important concepts in physics include motion, forces such
as magnetism and gravity, and forms of energy such as light, sound, and electrical energy.
Q: How do you think physics explains the distorted images formed by a funhouse mirror?
A: Physics explains how energy interacts with matter. In this case, for example, physics explains how visible light
reﬂects from mirrors to form images. Most mirrors, such as bathroom mirrors, have a ﬂat surface. Light reﬂected
from a ﬂat mirror forms an image that looks the same as the object in front of it. Funhouse mirrors, like the one
pictured above, are different. They have a curved surface that reﬂects light at different angles. This explains why the
images they form are distorted.

Physics in the World Around You

Physics can help you understand just about everything in the world around you. That’s because everything around
you consists of matter and energy. Several examples of matter and energy interacting are pictured in the Figure 1.12.

Examples of how matter and energy interact.

Q: Based on the examples in Figure 1.12, what might be other examples of energy and matter interacting?
A: Like the strings of cello, anything that vibrates produces waves of energy that travel through matter. For example,
when you throw a pebble into a pond, waves of energy travel from the pebble through the water in all directions.
Like an incandescent light bulb, anything that glows consists of matter that produces light energy. For example,
ﬁreﬂies use chemicals to produce light energy. Like a moving tennis racket, anything that moves has energy because
it is moving, including your eyes as they read this sentence.

Summary

• Physics is the study of energy, matter, and their interactions. It is concerned with matter and energy at all

levels—from the most fundamental particles of matter to the entire universe.

printer like the one you might have on your desk to print school papers. It was a special 3-D printer. This type of
printer forms an object, layer by layer, by spraying a ﬁne powder of plastic or metal instead of toner. It sprays the
powder in a pattern directed by a computer program. A laser beam melts the powder, which then hardens. You can

the printer, powder, and computer program. Suppose, for example, that you live in a remote location and need a new
part for your car. The solution? Just download the design on your computer and print the part on your 3-D printer.
Manufacturing would no longer require specially designed machines in factories that produce pollution. Another
advantage of using 3-D printers to make products is that no materials are wasted. This would lower manufacturing
costs as well as save natural resources.

How Technology Evolves

New technologies such as 3-D printers often evolve slowly as new materials, designs, or processes are invented.
Solar-powered cars are a good example. For several decades, researchers have been working on developing practical
solar-powered cars. Why? Cars powered by sunlight have at least two important advantages over gas-powered cars.
The energy they use is free and available almost everywhere, and they produce no pollution. The timeline in Table
1.3 shows some of the milestones in the evolution of solar-powered cars.

TABLE 1.3: Evolution of Solar-Powered Cars

Milestone
1954: First modern solar cell

1955: First solar car

1983: First practical solar car

1987: First World Solar Challenge

2008: First Commercial solar car

The ﬁrst modern solar cell was invented in 1954 by a
team of researchers at Bell Labs in the U.S. It could
convert light energy to enough electricity to power
devices.
In 1955, William G. Cobb of General Motors demon-
strated his 15-inch-long “Sunmobile,” the world’s ﬁrst
solar-powered automobile. Its tiny electric motor was
powered by 12 solar cells on top of the car.
In 1983, the ﬁrst drivable solar car was created by Hans
Tholstrup, a Danish inventor who was inﬂuenced by
the earlier Sunmobile. Called the “Quiet Achiever,”
Tholstrup’s car was driven 4000 km across Australia.
However, its average speed was only 23 km/h, despite
having more than 700 solar cells on its top panel.
Inspired by his success with the Quiet Achiever, in
1987 Tholstrup launched the ﬁrst World Solar Chal-
lenge. This was the world’s ﬁrst solar car race. The
race is now held every other year. In that ﬁrst race, the
winner was General Motors’ “Sunraycer,” shown here.
It had an average speed of 67 km/h. Its aerodynamic
shape helped it achieve that speed.
In 2008, the ﬁrst commercial solar car was introduced.
Called the Venturi Astrolab, it has a top speed of 120
km/h. To go this fast while using very little energy,
it is built of ultra-light materials.
Its oversized body
protects the driver in case of collision and provides a
lot of surface area for solar cells.

Q: Why was the invention of the solar cell important to the evolution of solar car technology?
A: The solar car could not exist without the solar cell. This invention provided a way to convert light energy to
electricity that could be used to run a device such as a car.
Q: The 1955 “Sunmobile” was just a model car. It was too small for people to drive. Why was it an important
achievement in the evolution of solar car technology?
A: The car wasn’t practical, but it was a working solar car. It showed people that solar car technology is possible. It
spurred others, including Hans Tholstrup, to work on solar cars that people could actually drive.
Q: How have the World Solar Challenge races inﬂuenced the development of solar cars?
A: The races have drawn a lot of attention to solar car development. The challenge of winning a race has also
stimulated developers to keep improving the performance of solar cars so they can go faster and farther on solar
power alone.

1.13 Technological Design Process

• Deﬁne technological design.
• List the steps of the technological design process.

This giant six-limbed robot is NASA’s Tri-ATHLETE. As the robot’s name suggests, it is very “athletic.” It was
designed to do the heavy lifting in explorations of other planets and moons in the universe. The Tri (“three”) part of
its name refers to the fact that the robot can split into two separate three-limbed robots. These smaller robots can do
things that the larger, six-limbed robot can’t.

What Is Technological Design?

The process in which tri-ATHLETE was created and perfected is called technological design. This is the process
in which most new technologies are developed. Technological design is similar to scientiﬁc investigation. Both
processes rely on evidence and reason, and follow a logical sequence of steps to solve problems or answer questions.
The process of designing a new technology includes much more than just coming up with a good idea. Possible
limitations, or constraints, on the design must be taken into account. These might include factors such as the cost
or safety of the new product or process. Making and testing a model of the design are also important. These steps
ensure that the design actually works to solve the problem. This process also gives the designer a chance to ﬁnd
problems and modify the design if necessary. No solution is perfect, but testing and reﬁning a design assures that
the technology will provide a workable solution to the problem it is intended to solve.

Steps of the Technological Design Process

The technological design process can be broken down into the series of steps shown in the ﬂowchart in Figure 1.14.
Typically, some of the steps have to be repeated, and the steps may not always be done in the sequence shown.

41

1.13. Technological Design Process

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 1.14
This ﬂowchart illustrates the steps of the
technological design process.

Consider the problem of developing a solar-powered car. Many questions would have to be researched in the design
process. For example, what is the best shape for gathering the sun’s rays? How will sunlight be converted to useable
energy to run the car? Will a back-up energy source be needed? After researching the answers, possible designs are
developed. This generally takes imagination as well as sound reasoning. Then a model must be designed and tested.
This allows any problems with the design to be worked out before a ﬁnal design is selected and produced.
Q: Assume you want to design a product that lets a person in a wheelchair carry around small personal items so they
are easy to access. What questions might you research ﬁrst?
A: You might research questions such as: What personal items are people likely to need to carry with them? What
types of carriers or holders are there that might be modiﬁed for use by people in a wheelchair? Where might a carrier
be attached to a wheelchair or person in a wheelchair without interfering with the operation of the chair or hindering
the person?
Q: Suppose you have come up with a possible solution to the problem described in the previous question. How
might you make a model of your idea? How could you test your model?
A: First, you might make a sketch of your idea. Then you could make an inexpensive model using simple materials
such as cardboard, newspaper, tape, or string. You could test your model by trying to carry several personal items
in it while maneuvering around a room in a wheelchair. You would also want to make sure that you could do things
like open doors, turn on light switches, and get in and out of the chair without the carrier getting in the way.

Summary

• Technological design is the process in which new technology is developed.
• Steps of the technological design process include: identify a problem, research the problem, generate possible
solutions, select the best solution, create a model, test the model, reﬁne and retest the model as needed, and
communicate the ﬁnal solution.

1.14 Technological Design Constraints

• Give examples of physical and social constraints on technological design.
• Explain why all technological designs have trade-offs.

Look at the colorful kites in this picture. Did you ever ﬂy a kite? Do you think you could make one? What shape
would you make it? What materials would you use? How would you design it?

Constraints on Design

The development of new technology—whether it’s a simple kite or a complex machine—is called technological
design. The technological design process is a step-by-step approach to ﬁnding a solution to a problem. Often, the
main challenge in technological design is ﬁnding a solution that works within the constraints, or limits, on the design.
All technological designs have constraints.
Q: Assume you want to design a kite. What might be some constraints on your design?
A: Possible constraints might include the shape and size of the kite and the materials you use to make it.

Physical and Social Constraints

Technological design constraints may be physical or social.

• Physical design constraints include factors such as natural laws and properties of materials. A kite, for

example, will ﬂy only if its shape allows air currents to lift it. Otherwise, gravity will keep it on the ground.

• Social design constraints include factors such as ease of use, safety, attractiveness, and cost. For example, a

kite string should be easy to unwind as the wind carries the kite higher.

44

Weighing the Options

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

All technological designs have trade-offs because no design is perfect. For example, a design might be very good at
solving a problem, but it might be too expensive to be practical. Or a design might be very attractive, but it might not
be safe to use. Choosing the best design often involves weighing the pros and cons of different options and deciding
which ones are most important.
Q: What trade-offs might there be on the design of a kite?
A: You might want to make a big kite, but if it’s too big it might be too heavy. Then it would ﬂy only on very windy
days. Or you might want to make a kite using a certain material that you really like, but the material might cost more
than you can afford to spend.

Summary

• All technological designs have constraints, or limits, on the design.
• Physical design constraints include factors such as natural laws and properties of materials. Social design

constraints include factors such as ease of use, safety, attractiveness, and cost.

• All technological designs have trade-offs because no design is perfect. Choosing the best design involves

weighing the pros and cons of different options.

1.15 Technology and Science

• Explain how technology and science are related.
• Give examples of ways that technology and science help each other advance.

This incredible image was made by the Hubble space telescope. The image is called Pillars of Creation. It shows
the actual formation of stars in distant space. The Hubble telescope is a very powerful telescope that orbits Earth
like a satellite. Scientists placed the Hubble telescope into space so it could make clear images like this without
background lights on Earth competing with the dim light from distant stars. It has led to many scientiﬁc discoveries.

How Technology and Science Are Related

The Hubble space telescope shows that technology and science are closely related. Technology uses science to
solve problems, and science uses technology to make new discoveries. However, technology and science have
different goals. The goal of science is to answer questions and increase knowledge. The goal of technology is to ﬁnd
solutions to practical problems. Although they have different goals, science and technology work hand in hand, and
each helps the other advance. Scientiﬁc knowledge is used to create new technologies such as the space telescope.
New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in new ways.

How Technology Revolutionized Science

The Hubble telescope was put into orbit around Earth in the 1990s, but scientists have been using telescopes to make
discoveries for hundreds of years. The ﬁrst telescope was invented in the early 1600s. The inventor was probably

46

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

a Dutch lens maker named Hans Lippershey. He and his telescope are pictured in Figure 1.15. Lippershey used
scientiﬁc knowledge of the properties of light and lenses to design his telescope.

FIGURE 1.15
Hans Lippershey is credited with making
the ﬁrst practical telescope in 1608. He is
pictured here using his invention to view
distant objects. Ofﬁcials of
the Dutch
government recognized the importance of
Lippershey’s invention. They gave him a
generous sum of money for his design.

Lippershey’s new technology quickly spread all over Europe. Almost immediately, the Italian scientist and inventor
Galileo started working to improve Lippershey’s design.
In just two years, Galileo had made a more powerful
telescope. It could make very distant objects visible to the human eye. The Figure 1.16 shows Galileo demonstrating
his powerful telescope. It appears to be focused on the moon. Galileo started using his telescope to explore the night
sky. He soon made some remarkable discoveries. He observed hills and valleys on the moon and spots on the sun.
He discovered that Jupiter has moons and that the sun rotates on its axis. With his discoveries, Galileo was able
to prove that the sun, not Earth, is at the center of the solar system. This discovery played an important role in the
history of science. It led to a scientiﬁc revolution that gave birth to modern Western science. And it all began with
technology!

FIGURE 1.16
Galileo is shown here presenting his tele-
scope to government leaders. They must
have been impressed. They gave him a
life-long job as a university professor and
doubled his salary.

Other Examples

www.ck12.org

There are many other examples that show how technology and science work together. Two are pictured in Figure
1.17. Another example is the microscope.
It may have been invented by Galileo around the same time as the
telescope. Like the invention of the telescope, the invention of the microscope also depended on scientiﬁc knowledge
of light and lenses.
Q: How do you think the invention of the microscope helped science advance?
A: The microscope let scientists view a world of tiny objects they had never seen before. It led to many important
scientiﬁc discoveries, including the discovery of cells, which are the basic building blocks of all living things.

FIGURE 1.17
Seismometers and spectrometers are
both technological devices that led to im-
portant scientiﬁc discoveries.

Summary

• Science and technology help each other advance. Scientiﬁc knowledge is used to create new technologies.

New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in different ways and make new discoveries.

• Examples of technologies that have helped science advance include the telescope and microscope.

1.16 Technology and Society

• Summarize how major advances in technology impact human society.
• Describe how the Industrial Revolution affected people’s lives.

The Mars Rover pictured here is a wheeled robot developed by NASA. Its job is to explore the surface of Mars. The
rover contains a lot of complex modern technology. But how it moves by rolling on wheels is a very old invention.
The wheel was probably invented many times in different cultures, beginning at least 10,000 years ago. In addition
to wheeled carts and chariots, early wheels were used for water wheels, grinding wheels, and wheels for spinning
pottery. Wheels really changed human life. They revolutionized transportation and made it much easier to do many
different kinds of work.

How Technology Affects Society

Important new technologies such as the wheel have had a big impact on human society. Major advances in technol-
ogy have inﬂuenced every aspect of life, including transportation, food production, manufacturing, communication,
medicine, and the arts. That’s because technology has the goal of solving human problems, so new technologies
usually make life better. They may make work easier, for example, or make people healthier. Sometimes, however,
new technologies affect people in negative ways. For example, using a new product or process might cause human
health problems or pollute the environment.
Q: Can you think of a modern technology that has both positive and negative effects on people?
A: Modern methods of transportation have both positive and negative effects on people. They help people and goods
move quickly all over the world. However, most of them pollute the environment. For example, gasoline-powered
cars and trucks add many pollutants to the atmosphere. The pollutants harm people’s health and contribute to global
climate change.

Industrial Revolution

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

Few technologies have impacted society as greatly as the powerful steam engine developed by Scottish inventor
James Watt in 1775 (see Figure 1.18). Watt’s steam engine was soon being used to power all kinds of machines. It
started a revolution in industry. For the ﬁrst time in history, people did not have to rely on human or animal muscle,
wind, or water for power. With the steam engine to power machines, new factories sprang up all over Britain.

FIGURE 1.18
This is a museum model similar to the
steam engine invented by James Watt.

The Industrial Revolution began in Britain the late 1700s. It eventually spread throughout Western Europe, North
America, Japan, and many other countries. It marked a major turning point in human history. Almost every aspect
of daily life was inﬂuenced by it in some way. Average income and population both began to grow faster than ever
before. People ﬂocked to the new factories for jobs, and densely populated towns and cities grew up around the
factories. The new towns and cities were crowded, and soot from the factories polluted the air. You can see an
example of this in the Figure 1.19. This made living conditions very poor. Working conditions in the factories were
also bad, with long hours and the pace set by machines. Even young children worked in the factories, damaging
their health and giving them little opportunity for education or play.
Q: In addition to factory machines, the steam engine was used to power farm machinery, trains, and ships. What
effects might this have had on people’s lives?
A: Farm machinery replaced human labor and allowed fewer people to produce more food. This is why many rural
people migrated to the new towns and cities to look for work in factories. Steam-powered trains and ships made it
easier for people to migrate. Food and factory goods could also be transported on steam-powered trains and ships,
making them available to far more people.

Summary

• Major advances in technology have inﬂuenced every aspect of human society, usually in good ways but

sometimes in bad ways as well.

• Almost every aspect of people’s lives was inﬂuenced by the Industrial Revolution that followed James Watt’s

invention of a powerful steam engine in 1775.

1.17 Technology Careers

• Describe the general career of engineer.
• Identify speciﬁc engineering careers.

Did you ever wonder who thinks up the designs for roller coasters like this one, or how a roller coaster is built? There
are more than 100 large amusement parks in the U.S., and they compete to have the fastest or tallest coasters that
give the most thrilling ride. Each year, many of the parks install new roller coasters. Each new coaster is designed
for its speciﬁc location and the park’s needs. Then it is custom built.

Technology Professionals

Companies that design and build roller coasters employ a range of technology professionals. Technology is the
application of science to real-world problems. Professionals in technology are generally called engineers. Engineers
are creative problem solvers. They use math and science to design and develop just about everything—from roller
coasters to video games.
Q: Whether engineers are designing and developing roller coasters or video games, they need many of the same
skills and the same basic knowledge. What skills and knowledge do you think all engineers might need?
A: All engineers need basic knowledge of math and science, particularly physical science. For example, to design
and build a roller coaster, they would need to know about geometry, as well as forces and motion, which are important
topics in physical science. In addition, all engineers must have skills such as logical thinking and creativity. The
ability to envision three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional drawings is also helpful for most engineers.

Careers in Engineering

Different types of engineers, such as electrical and mechanical engineers, must work together to build roller coasters
and most other engineering projects. You can learn about these and other technology careers at the URLs listed here

1.18 Scientiﬁc Process

• State the role of investigations in science.
• Outline the steps of the scientiﬁc method.

Do you think that the man in this photo is a real scientist? In science ﬁction, scientists may be portrayed as wild-eyed
and zany, randomly mixing chemicals in a lab. But that portrayal couldn’t be farther from the truth. Real scientists
are disciplined professionals, and scientiﬁc investigations are very organized and methodical.

Investigations in Science

Investigations are at the heart of science. They are how scientists add to scientiﬁc knowledge and gain a better
understanding of the world. Scientiﬁc investigations produce evidence that helps answer questions. Even if the
evidence cannot provide answers, it may still be useful. It may lead to new questions for investigation. As more
knowledge is discovered, science advances.

Steps of a Scientiﬁc Investigation

Scientists investigate the world in many ways. In different ﬁelds of science, researchers may use different methods
and be guided by different theories and questions. However, most scientists follow the general steps outlined in the
Figure 1.21. This approach is sometimes called the scientiﬁc method. Keep in mind that the scientiﬁc method is a
general approach and not a strict sequence of steps. For example, scientists may follow the steps in a different order.
Or they may skip or repeat some of the steps.

Using the Scientiﬁc Method: a Simple Example

A simple example will help you understand how the scientiﬁc method works. While Cody eats a bowl of cereal
( Figure 1.22), he reads the ingredients list on the cereal box. He notices that the cereal contains iron. Cody is
studying magnets in school and knows that magnets attract objects that contain iron. He wonders whether there
is enough iron in a ﬂake of the cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet. He thinks that the iron content is
probably too low for this to happen, even if he uses a strong magnet.

FIGURE 1.22
Cody makes an observation that raises a question. Curiosity about
observations is how most scientiﬁc investigations begin.

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

Q: If Cody were doing a scientiﬁc investigation, what would be his question and hypothesis?
A: Cody’s question would be, “Is there enough iron in a ﬂake of cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet?”
His hypothesis would be, “The iron content of a ﬂake of cereal is too low for it to be attracted by a strong magnet.”
Cody decides to do an experiment to test his hypothesis. He gets a strong magnet from his mom’s toolbox and places
a dry ﬂake of cereal on the table. Then he slowly moves the magnet closer to the ﬂake. To his surprise, when the
magnet gets very close to the ﬂake, the ﬂake moves the rest of the way to the magnet.
Q: Based on this evidence, what should Cody conclude?
A: Cody should conclude that his hypothesis is incorrect. There is enough iron in a ﬂake of cereal for it to be
attracted by a strong magnet.
Q: If Cody were a scientist doing an actual scientiﬁc investigation, what should he do next?
A: He should report his results to other scientists.

Summary

• Investigations are at the heart of science. They produce evidence that helps scientists answer questions and

better understand the world.

• Most scientists follow the same general approach to investigation, which is called the scientiﬁc method.
It includes the following steps: ask a question, do background research, construct a hypothesis, test the
hypothesis by doing an experiment, analyze the data and draw a conclusion, and report the results.

1.19 Observation

• Deﬁne observation.
• Identify the role of observation in scientiﬁc investigation.

A scientist observed this orange-colored scum on a pond in her neighborhood. She wondered what the scum is and
why it was there. She decided to do an investigation to ﬁnd answers to her questions. Scientiﬁc investigations often
result when observations like this raise questions.

What Are Observations?

An observation is any information that is gathered with the senses. Our senses include vision, hearing, touch,
smell, and taste. We see with our eyes, hear with our ears, touch with our hands, smell with our nose, and taste
with our tongue. We can also extend our senses and our ability to make observations by using instruments such as
microscopes, telescopes, and thermometers.
Q: How do these instruments extend human senses and our ability to make observations?
A: Microscopes and telescopes extend the sense of vision. They allow us to observe objects that are too small
(microscopes) or too distant (telescopes) for the unaided eye to see. Thermometers extend the sense of touch.
Using our sense of touch, we can only feel how warm or cold something is relative to our own temperature or the
temperature of something else. Thermometers allow us to measure precisely how warm or cold something is.

Using Observations to Gather Evidence

Besides raising questions for investigation, observations play another role in scientiﬁc investigations. They help
scientists gather evidence. For example, to investigate whether a chemical change has occurred, a scientist might
observe whether certain telltale signs are present. In some chemical changes, for example, a substance turns from

one color to another. You can see an example of this in the Figure 1.23. In other chemical changes, an odor is
produced or gas bubbles are released. All of these changes can be observed with the senses.

FIGURE 1.23
Some of these pennies are shiny and copper colored. That’s how pennies
look when they are new. The older pennies are dull and brown. Copper at
the surface of these pennies has combined with air to become a different
substance with different properties. The change in color shows that a
chemical change has occurred.

Q: Some chemical changes release heat. How could this change be observed?
A: The sense of touch—or a thermometer—could be used to observe an increase in temperature.

Summary

• An observation is any information that is gathered with the senses.
• Observations raise questions that lead to scientiﬁc investigations. Observations also help scientists gather

evidence in investigations.

1.20. Hypothesis

1.20 Hypothesis

• State two criteria of a scientiﬁc hypothesis.
• Explain why a hypothesis cannot be proven true.

Although this cartoon pokes fun at scientiﬁc hypotheses, the concept of hypothesis is one of the most important
in science. Scientiﬁc investigations discover evidence that helps science advance, and the purpose of scientiﬁc
investigations generally is to test hypotheses. Finding evidence to support or disprove hypotheses is how science
advances.

What Is a Scientiﬁc Hypothesis?

The word hypothesis can be deﬁned as an "educated guess." For example, it might be an educated guess about why
a natural event occurs. But not all hypotheses—even those about the natural world—are scientiﬁc hypotheses. What
makes a statement a scientiﬁc hypothesis rather than just an educated guess? A scientiﬁc hypothesis must meet two
criteria:

• A scientiﬁc hypothesis must be testable.
• A scientiﬁc hypothesis must be falsiﬁable.

60

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

A Scientiﬁc Hypothesis Must Be Testable

For a hypothesis to be testable means that it is possible to make observations that agree or disagree with it. If a
hypothesis cannot be tested by making observations, it is not scientiﬁc. Consider this statement:

"There are invisible creatures all around us that we can never observe in any way."
This statement may or may not be true, but it is not a scientiﬁc hypothesis. That’s because it can’t be tested. Given
the nature of the hypothesis, there are no observations a scientist could make to test whether or not it is false.

A Scientiﬁc Hypothesis Must Be Falsiﬁable

A hypothesis may be testable, but even that isn’t enough for it to be a scientiﬁc hypothesis. In addition, it must be
possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false. Consider this statement:

“There are other planets in the universe where life exists.”
This statement is testable. If it is true, it is at least theoretically possible to ﬁnd evidence showing that it’s true. For
example, a spacecraft could be sent from Earth to explore the universe and report back if it discovers an inhabited
planet. If such a planet were found, it would prove the statement is true. However, the statement isn’t a scientiﬁc
hypothesis. Why? If it is false, it’s not possible to show that it’s false. The spacecraft may never ﬁnd an inhabited
planet, but that doesn’t necessarily mean there isn’t one. Given the vastness of the universe, we would never be able
to check every planet for life!

Both Testable and Falsiﬁable

Let’s consider one last example, which is illustrated in the Figure 1.24:

"Any two objects dropped at the same time from the same height will reach the ground at the same time (assuming
the absence of air resistance)."
Is this statement testable? Yes. You could drop two objects at the same time from the same height and observe when
they reach the ground. Of course, you would have to drop the objects in the absence of air to prevent air resistance,
but at least such a test is theoretically possible. Is the statement falsiﬁable if it really is false? Again, the answer
is yes. You can easily test many combinations of two objects and if any two objects do not reach the ground at the
same time, then the hypothesis is false. If a hypothesis really is false, it should be relatively easy to disprove it.

Can You Prove a Hypothesis Is True?

If the hypothesis above about falling objects really were false, it is likely that this would be discovered sooner or
later after enough objects had been dropped. It takes just one exception to disprove a hypothesis. But what if the
hypothesis really is true? Can this be demonstrated as well? No; it would require testing all possible combinations
of objects to show that they always reach the ground at the same time. This is impossible. New objects are being
made all the time that would have to be tested. It’s always possible an exception would be found in the future to
disprove the hypothesis. Although you can’t prove conclusively that a hypothesis is true, the more evidence you
gather in support of it, the more likely it is to be true.

Both the elephant and the boy are falling
to the ground because of gravity. The
force of gravity (Fgrav) is greater for the
elephant than it is for the boy because
the elephant
is much more massive.
Nonetheless, both of them will reach the
ground at the same time (assuming they
fall from the same height at the same time
and there is no air resistance.)

Summary

• In science, a hypothesis is an educated guess that can be tested with observations and falsiﬁed if it really is

false.

• You cannot prove conclusively that most hypotheses are true because it’s generally impossible to examine all

possible cases for exceptions that would disprove them.

1.21 Scientiﬁc Experiments

• Deﬁne experiment.
• Contrast manipulated and responding variables in an experiment.
• Explain why other variables in an experiment must be controlled.

It’s exciting to roll down a skateboarding ramp, especially if you’re going fast. The steeper the ramp, the faster you’ll
go. What else besides the steepness of a ramp inﬂuences how fast an object goes down it? You could do experiments
to ﬁnd out.

What Is an Experiment?

An experiment is a controlled scientiﬁc study of speciﬁc variables. A variable is a factor that can take on different
values. For example, the speed of an object down a ramp might be one variable, and the steepness of the ramp might
be another.

Experimental Variables

There must be at least two variables in any experiment: a manipulated variable and a responding variable.

• A manipulated variable is a variable that is changed by the researcher. A manipulated variable is also called

an independent variable.

63

1.21. Scientiﬁc Experiments

www.ck12.org

• A responding variable is a variable that the researcher predicts will change if the manipulated variable

changes. A responding variable is also called a dependent variable.

You can learn how to identify manipulated and responding variables in an experiment by watching this video about
bouncing balls:

Q: If you were to do an experiment to ﬁnd out what inﬂuences the speed of an object down a ramp, what would be
the responding variable? How could you measure it?
A: The responding variable would be the speed of the object. You could measure it indirectly with a stopwatch. You
could clock the time it takes the object to travel from the top to the bottom of the ramp. The less time it takes, the
faster the average speed down the ramp.
Q: What variables might affect the speed of an object down a ramp?
A: Variables might include factors relating to the ramp or to the object. An example of a variable relating to the ramp
is its steepness. An example of a variable relating to the object is the way it moves—it might roll or slide down the
ramp. Either of these variables could be manipulated by the researcher, so you could choose one of them for your
manipulated variable.

Controlling Variables

Assume you are sliding wooden blocks down a ramp in your experiment. You choose steepness of the ramp for your
manipulated variable. You want to measure how changes in steepness affect the time it takes a block to reach the
bottom of the ramp. You decide to test two blocks on two ramps, one steeper than the other, and see which block
reaches the bottom ﬁrst. You use a shiny piece of varnished wood for one ramp and a rough board for the other
ramp. You raise the rough board higher so it has a steeper slope (see sketch below). You let go of both blocks at the
same time and observe that the block on the ramp with the gentler slope reaches the bottom sooner. You’re surprised,
because you expected the block on the steeper ramp to go faster and get to the bottom ﬁrst.

Q: What explains your result?

64

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

A: The block on the steeper ramp would have reached the bottom sooner if all else was equal. The problem is that
all else was not equal. The ramps varied not only in steepness but also in smoothness. The block on the smoother
ramp went faster than the block on the rougher ramp, even though the rougher ramp was steeper.
This example illustrates another important aspect of experiments: experimental controls. A control is a variable that
must be held constant so it won’t inﬂuence the outcome of an experiment. The control can be used as a standard for
comparison between experiments. In the case of your ramp experiment, smoothness of the ramps should have been
controlled by making each ramp out of the same material. For other examples of controls in an experiment, watch
the video at the URL below. It is Part II of the above video on bouncing balls.

Q: What other variables do you think might inﬂuence the outcome of your ramp experiment? How could these other
variables be controlled?
A: Other variables might include variables relating to the block. For example, a smoother block would be expected
to go down a ramp faster than a rougher block. You could control variables relating to the block by using two
identical blocks.

Summary

• An experiment is a controlled scientiﬁc study of speciﬁc variables. A variable is a factor that can take on

different values.

• There must be at least two variables in any experiment: a manipulated variable and a responding variable.
• A control is a variable that must be held constant so it won’t inﬂuence the outcome of an experiment.

• Identify reasons why a ﬁeld study might be done.

The environmental chemist in this photo is “ﬁshing” for a sample of river water. He works for the US Environmental
Protection Agency. He is looking for evidence of pollution in the water.

Doing Science in the Field

Although experiments are the “gold standard” for scientiﬁc investigations, sometimes it’s not possible or desirable
to do experiments. Often it’s important to investigate a problem in the real world instead of in a lab. An investigation
that gathers evidence in the real world—as the environmental chemist above is doing—is called a ﬁeld study.
Q: Why are ﬁeld studies important for environmental scientists?
A: To learn about the environment, scientists need to take measurements and make observations in the real world.
This means gathering evidence in ﬁeld studies; collecting samples of water from a river is one example of this
method.

Case Study: River Water Pollution

The environmental scientist above will gather samples of river water in several different locations. Then he will take
the samples back to a lab to analyze them. He will do tests to identify any pollutants in the samples. Taking samples
from different locations may help him identify the source of any pollution he ﬁnds. Pollution can enter a river from
a single source, such as a waste water pipe from a factory. This is called point-source pollution. Or pollution can

67

1.22. Field Study

enter a river in runoff rainwater that picks up pollutants as it runs over the ground. This type of pollution enters the
river everywhere. This is called nonpoint-source pollution.
Q: Assume that the river is polluted only by nonpoint-source pollution. Describe how the samples of river water
would compare in terms of the pollutants they contain.
A: All of the samples would contain about the same amount and types of pollutants.
Q: How might point-source pollution be identiﬁed?
A: Just one sample might be polluted. This would be the sample taken at, or just downstream from, the single source
of pollution.

Summary

• In a ﬁeld study, a scientist gathers evidence in the real world instead of in a lab.
• Field studies are needed to investigate the environment. An example of a ﬁeld study is collecting samples of

river water to test for evidence of pollution.

1.23 Communication in Science

• Explain why communication is important in science.
• Identify ways that scientists can communicate about their research.

Did you ever participate in a science fair? If you did, then you probably made a poster outlining what you did for
your project and how your project turned out. Scientists often share their research in the same way. The picture
above shows a poster session at a scientiﬁc conference. Posters are a quick and graphic way to communicate about
research.

Importance of Communication in Science

The last step of most scientiﬁc investigations is reporting the results. When scientists communicate their ﬁndings,
they add to the body of scientiﬁc knowledge, and that’s how science advances. Science generally builds on previous
knowledge, sometimes advancing in giant steps but more often in baby steps. The brick building analogy in the
Figure 1.25 may help you better understand why communication is important in science.
When scientists communicate about their research, they may also get useful feedback from other scientists. For
example, comments from other scientists might help them improve their research design or interpret their ﬁndings
in a different way. Other scientists can also repeat the research to see if they get the same results.
Q: Why might it be important for other scientists to repeat an investigation?
A: If an investigation is repeated and different results are obtained, then it throws doubt on the original research. On
the other hand, if the same results are obtained, scientists can place more conﬁdence in them.

FIGURE 1.25
You can think of scientiﬁc knowledge as a
brick building, and the work of a single sci-
entist as an individual brick. Considered
by itself, the work of a single scientist may
not seem that important, yet it may be an
important piece of the overall structure.
But unless a scientist communicates re-
search results, that single brick may never
be added to the building.

How Scientists Communicate

The posters shown in the opening image are just one of several ways that scientists may communicate about their
research. Some of the most common ways scientists communicate are listed below.

• Scientists may present papers about their research at scientiﬁc conferences. This is a good way to quickly

reach an audience of other scientists who are most interested in the research topic.

• Scientists may publish articles about their research in peer-reviewed science journals. Peer review means that
the work is analyzed by peers, in other words, by other scientists. The articles are published only if the other
scientists are convinced that the research is accurate and honest.

• Scientists may testify about their research before congress if their ﬁndings relate to matters of public policy,

such as environmental pollution.

• Scientists may communicate about their research to the general public. For example, they might create a Web

site about their research, blog about it, or write articles for newspapers or magazines.

Q: Why might it be important for scientists to communicate about their research to the general public? Give an
example.
A: Communicating to the general public might be important if the research is directly related to people’s lives. For
example, assume that a scientist has investigated how driving habits are related to car crashes. She might write a
newspaper article to share the research results with the public so they can adopt driving habits that reduce the risk of
crashes.

Summary

• The last step of most scientiﬁc investigations is communicating the results of the research. When scientists
share their ﬁndings, they add to the body of scientiﬁc knowledge. They may also get useful feedback from
other scientists.

• Scientists may communicate about their research in several ways, such as presenting posters or papers at

scientiﬁc conferences and publishing articles in scientiﬁc journals.

1.24 Replication in Science

• Deﬁne replication.
• Explain the importance of replication in science.

Did a math teacher ever tell you to check your work? If you’re adding numbers, that means repeating the calculation
to see if you get the same answer the second time. If you get the same result twice, then the answer is probably
correct. But if you get a different answer the second time, at least one of the results must be incorrect. Then you
have to add the numbers a third time and hope that the third answer will agree with one of the other two.

Replication

Scientists also have to “check their work.” The results of an investigation are not likely to be well accepted unless
the investigation is repeated—usually many times—and the same result is always obtained. Getting the same result
when an experiment is repeated is called replication. If research results can be replicated, it means they are more
likely to be correct. Repeated replication of investigations may turn a hypothesis into a theory. On the other hand, if
results cannot be replicated they are likely to be incorrect.

Why Replication Is Important in Science: An Example

The following example shows why replication is important in science. In 1998, a British researcher published an
article in a medical journal reporting that he had found a link between a common childhood vaccine and autism
(see Figure 1.26). According to the article, children in his study developed autism soon after receiving the vaccine.
Following publication of the article, many parents refused to have their children vaccinated. Several epidemics
occurred as a result, and some children died of the diseases.

73

1.24. Replication in Science

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 1.26
This child is receiving a vaccine.

Soon after the original study was published, other researchers tried to replicate the research. However, it could not
be replicated. No other studies could ﬁnd a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result, scientists became
convinced that the original results were incorrect. Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was
a fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to ﬁnd evidence that the vaccine causes
autism, so he faked his research results. If other scientists had not tried to replicate the research, the truth might
never have come out. You can read more about this case at the URL below.
http://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/medical/autism/2011-01-06-autism06_ST_N.htm

Summary

• Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated is called replication.

If research results can be

replicated, it means they are more likely to be correct.

• Replication is important in science so scientists can “check their work.” The result of an investigation is
not likely to be well accepted unless the investigation is repeated many times and the same result is always
obtained.

1.25 International System of Units

• Describe the International System of Units (SI).
• Convert units between International and English systems.

In 1999, NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter, pictured here, burned up as it passed through Mars’ atmosphere. The
satellite was programmed to orbit Mars at high altitude and gather climate data. Instead, the Orbiter ﬂew too low
and entered the red planet’s atmosphere. Why did the Orbiter ﬂy off course? The answer is human error. The ﬂight
system software on the Orbiter was written using scientiﬁc units of measurement, but the ground crew was entering
data using common English units.

SI Units

The example of the Mars Climate Orbiter shows the importance of using a standard system of measurement in
science and technology. The measurement system used by most scientists and engineers is the International System
of Units, or SI. There are a total of seven basic SI units, including units for length (meter) and mass (kilogram). SI
units are easy to use because they are based on the number 10. Basic units are multiplied or divided by powers of
ten to arrive at bigger or smaller units. Preﬁxes are added to the names of the units to indicate the powers of ten, as
shown in the Table 1.4.

Q: Rod needs to buy a meter of wire for a science experiment, but the wire is sold only by the yard. If he buys a
yard of wire, will he have enough? (Hint: There are 36 inches in a yard.)
A: Rod needs 39.37 inches (a meter) of wire, but a yard is only 36 inches, so if he buys a yard of wire he won’t have
enough.

Summary

1.26 Scientiﬁc Measuring Devices

• State how to read a metric ruler.
• Describe how to measure mass with a triple beam balance.
• Outline how to measure the volume of a liquid with a graduated cylinder.

The device pictured above is called a pH meter. It is a scientiﬁc measuring device that measures the acidity of a
liquid. Being able to use scientiﬁc measuring devices such as this is an important science skill. That’s because doing
science typically involves making many measurements. For example, if you do lab exercises in science, you might
measure an object’s length or mass, or you might ﬁnd the volume of a liquid. Scientists use sensitive measuring
devices to make measurements such as these. The measurements are usually made using SI units of measurement.

Measuring Length with a Metric Ruler

You’ve probably been using a ruler to measure length since you were in elementary school. But you may have
made most of the measurements in English units of length, such as inches and feet. In science, length is most often
measured in SI units, such as millimeters and centimeters. Many rulers have both types of units, one on each edge.
The ruler pictured below has only SI units. It is shown here bigger than it really is so it’s easier to see the small
lines, which measure millimeters. The large lines and numbers stand for centimeters. Count the number of small
lines from the left end of the ruler (0.0). You should count 10 lines because there are 10 millimeters in a centimeter.

Q: What is the length in millimeters of the red line above the metric ruler?
A: The length of the red line is 32 mm.
Q: What is the length of the red line in centimeters?
A: The length of the red line is 3.2 cm.

Measuring Mass with a Balance

Mass is the amount of matter in an object. Scientists often measure mass with a balance. A type of balance called a
triple beam balance is pictured in Figure 1.27. To use this type of balance, follow these steps:

1. Place the object to be measured on the pan at the left side of the balance.
2. Slide the movable masses to the right until the right end of the arm is level with the balance mark. Start by

moving the larger masses and then ﬁne tune the measurement by moving the smaller masses as needed.

3. Read the three scales to determine the values of the masses that were moved to the right. Their combined mass

is equal to the mass of the object.

FIGURE 1.27

The Figure 1.28 is an enlarged version of the scales of the triple beam balance in Figure 1.27. It allows you to read
the scales. The middle scale, which measures the largest movable mass, reads 300 grams. This is followed by the
top scale, which reads 30 grams. The bottom scale reads 5.1 grams. Therefore, the mass of the object in the pan is
335.1 grams (300 grams + 30 grams + 5.1 grams).
Q: What is the maximum mass this triple beam balance can measure?
A: The maximum mass it can measure is 610 grams (500 grams + 100 grams + 10 grams).
Q: What is the smallest mass this triple beam balance can measure?
A: The smallest mass it can measure is one-tenth (0.1) of a gram.
To measure very small masses, scientists use electronic balances, like the one in the Figure 1.29. This type of
balance also makes it easier to make accurate measurements because mass is shown as a digital readout. In the

picture, the balance is being used to measure the mass of a white powder on a plastic weighing tray. The mass of the
tray alone would have to be measured ﬁrst and then subtracted from the mass of the tray and powder together. The
difference between the two masses is the mass of the powder alone.

Measuring Volume with a Graduated Cylinder

At home, you might measure the volume of a liquid with a measuring cup.
In science, the volume of a liquid
might be measured with a graduated cylinder, like the one sketched below. The cylinder in the picture has a scale in
milliliters (mL), with a maximum volume of 100 mL. Follow these steps when using a graduated cylinder to measure
the volume of a liquid:

1. Place the cylinder on a level surface before adding the liquid.
2. After adding the liquid, move so your eyes are at the same level as the top of the liquid in the cylinder.
3. Read the mark on the glass that is at the lowest point of the curved surface of the liquid. This is called the

meniscus.

Q: What is the volume of the liquid in the graduated cylinder pictured above?
A: The volume of the liquid is 67 mL.
Q: What would the measurement be if you read the highest point of the curved surface of the liquid by mistake?
A: The measurement would be 68 mL.

Summary

• In science, length may be measured with a metric ruler using SI units such as millimeters and centimeters.
• Scientists measure mass with a balance, such as a triple beam balance or electronic balance.
• In science, the volume of a liquid might be measured with a graduated cylinder.

1.27 Accuracy and Precision

• Deﬁne accuracy of measurements.
• Deﬁne precision of measurements.

Have you ever played golf, like the boy in this photo? Even if you haven’t played golf before, you probably know
that the goal of the game is to hit the ball into a hole with the fewest strokes of the club. Golf is a good way to
understand two important concepts in scientiﬁc measurement: accuracy and precision.

Accuracy

The accuracy of a measurement is how close the measurement is to the true value. If you were to hit four different
golf balls toward an over-sized hole, all of them might land in the hole. These shots would all be accurate because
they all landed in the hole. This is illustrated in the sketch below.

84

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

Precision

As you can see from the sketch above, the four golf balls did not land as close to one another as they could have. Each
one landed in a different part of the hole. Therefore, these shots are not very precise. The precision of measurements
is how close they are to each other. If you make the same measurement twice, the answers are precise if they are the
same or at least very close to one another. The golf balls in the sketch below landed quite close together in a cluster,
so they would be considered precise. However, they are all far from the hole, so they are not accurate.
Q: If you were to hit four golf balls toward a hole and your shots were both accurate and precise, where would the
balls land?
A: All four golf balls would land in the hole (accurate) and also very close to one another (precise).

Summary

• Accuracy means making measurements that are close to the true value.
• Precision means making measurements that are close in value to each other but not necessarily close to the

true value.

1.28 Calculating Derived Quantities

• Deﬁne derived quantity.
• Explain how to calculate area, volume, and density.
• Identify units of area, volume, and density.

This scientist is using a calculator. Doing science often requires calculations. Converting units—say from inches
to centimeters—is one type of calculation that might be required. Calculations may also be needed to ﬁnd derived
quantities.

What Are Derived Quantities?

Derived quantities are quantities that are calculated from two or more measurements. Derived quantities cannot be
measured directly. They can only be computed. Many derived quantities are calculated in physical science. Three
examples are area, volume, and density.

Calculating Area

The area of a surface is how much space it covers. It’s easy to calculate the area of a surface if it has a regular shape,
such as the blue rectangle in the sketch below. You simply substitute measurements of the surface into the correct
formula. To ﬁnd the area of a rectangular surface, use this formula:

Area (rectangular surface) = length × width (l × w)

87

1.28. Calculating Derived Quantities

www.ck12.org

Q: What is the area of the blue rectangle?
A: Substitute the values for the rectangle’s length and width into the formula for area:

Area = 9 cm × 5 cm = 45 cm2

Q: Can you use this formula to ﬁnd the area of a square surface?
A: Yes, you can. A square has four sides that are all the same length, so you would substitute the same value for
both length and width in the formula for the area of a rectangle.

Calculating Volume

The volume of a solid object is how much space it takes up. It’s easy to calculate the volume of a solid if it has a
simple, regular shape, such as the rectangular solid pictured in the sketch below. To ﬁnd the volume of a rectangular
solid, use this formula:

Volume (rectangular solid) = length × width × height (l × w × h)

Q: What is the volume of the blue rectangular solid?
A: Substitute the values for the rectangular solid’s length, width, and height into the formula for volume:

Volume = 10 cm × 3 cm × 5 cm = 150 cm3

Calculating Density

Density is a quantity that expresses how much matter is packed into a given space. The amount of matter is its mass,
and the space it takes up is its volume. To calculate the density of an object, then, you would use this formula:

88

www.ck12.org

Density =

mass
volume

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

Q: The volume of the blue rectangular solid above is 150 cm3. If it has a mass of 300 g, what is its density?
A: The density of the rectangular solid is:

Density =

300 g
150 cm3 = 2 g/cm3

Q: Suppose you have two boxes that are the same size but one box is full of feathers and the other box is full of
books. Which box has greater density?
A: Both boxes have the same volume because they are the same size. However, the books have greater mass than
the feathers. Therefore, the box of books has greater density.

Units of Derived Quantities

A given derived quantity, such as area, is always expressed in the same type of units. For example, area is always
expressed in squared units, such as cm2 or m2. If you calculate area and your answer isn’t in squared units, then you
have made an error.
Q: What units are used to express volume?
A: Volume is expressed in cubed units, such as cm3 or m3.
Q: A certain derived quantity is expressed in the units kg/m3. Which derived quantity is it?
A: The derived quantity is density, which is mass (kg) divided by volume (m3).

Summary

• Derived quantities are quantities that are calculated from two or more measurements. They include area,

volume, and density.

• The area of a rectangular surface is calculated as its length multiplied by its width.
• The volume of a rectangular solid is calculated as the product of its length, width, and height.
• The density of an object is calculated as its mass divided by its volume.
• A given derived quantity is always expressed in the same type of units. For example, area is always expressed

in squared units, such as cm2.

1.29 Signiﬁcant Figures

• Deﬁne signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
• State rules for counting signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
• Explain how to determine signiﬁcant ﬁgures in calculations.
• Identify rules for rounding numbers.

Jerod has a homework problem that involves ﬁnding the area of a rectangle. He knows that the area of a rectangle
equals its length times its width. The rectangle in question has a length of 6.9 m and a width of 6.5 m, so he
multiplies the two numbers on his calculator. The answer he gets is 44.85 m2, which he records on his homework.
To his surprise, his teacher marks this answer wrong. The reason? The answer has too many signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

What Are Signiﬁcant Figures?

In any measurement, the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures is the number of digits thought to be correct by the person
doing the measuring. It includes all digits that can be read directly from the measuring device plus one estimated
digit.
Look at the sketch of a beaker below. How much blue liquid does the beaker contain? The top of the liquid
falls between the mark for 40 mL and 50 mL, but it’s closer to 50 mL. A reasonable estimate is 47 mL. In this
measurement, the ﬁrst digit (4) is known for certain and the second digit (7) is an estimate, so the measurement has
two signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

91

1.29. Signiﬁcant Figures

www.ck12.org

Now look at the graduated cylinder sketched below. How much blue liquid does it contain? First, it’s important to
note that you should read the amount of liquid at the bottom of its curved surface. This falls about half way between
the mark for 36 mL and the mark for 37 mL, so a reasonable estimate would be 36.5 mL.
Q: How many signiﬁcant ﬁgures does this measurement have?
A: There are three signiﬁcant ﬁgures in this measurement. You know that the ﬁrst two digits (3 and 6) are accurate.
The third digit (5) is an estimate.

Rules for Counting Signiﬁcant Figures

The examples above show that it’s easy to count the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures when you are making a measure-
ment. But what if someone else has made the measurement? How do you know which digits are known for certain

92

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

and which are estimated? How can you tell how many signiﬁcant ﬁgures there are in the measurement? There are
several rules for counting signiﬁcant ﬁgures:

• Leading zeros are never signiﬁcant. For example, in the number 006.1, only the 6 and 1 are signiﬁcant.
• Zeros within a number between nonzero digits are always signiﬁcant. For example, in the number 106.1, the

zero is signiﬁcant, so this number has four signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

• Zeros that show only where the decimal point falls are not signiﬁcant. For example, the number 470,000 has
just two signiﬁcant ﬁgures (4 and 7). The zeros just show that the 4 represents hundreds of thousands and the
7 represents tens of thousands. Therefore, these zeros are not signiﬁcant.

• Trailing zeros that aren’t needed to show where the decimal point falls are signiﬁcant. For example, 4.00 has

three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Q: How many signiﬁcant ﬁgures are there in each of these numbers: 20,080, 2.080, and 2000?
A: Both 20,080 and 2.080 contain four signiﬁcant ﬁgures, but 2000 has just one signiﬁcant ﬁgure.

Determining Signiﬁcant Figures in Calculations

When measurements are used in a calculation, the answer cannot have more signiﬁcant ﬁgures than the measurement
with the fewest signiﬁcant ﬁgures. This explains why the homework answer above is wrong. It has more signiﬁcant
ﬁgures than the measurement with the fewest signiﬁcant ﬁgures. As another example, assume that you want to
calculate the volume of the block of wood shown below.

The volume of the block is represented by the formula:

Volume = length × width × height

Therefore, you would do the following calculation:
Volume = 1.2 cm × 1.0 cm × 1 cm = 1.2 cm3

Q: Does this answer have the correct number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures?
A: No, it has too many signiﬁcant ﬁgures. The correct answer is 1 cm3. That’s because the height of the block has
just one signiﬁcant ﬁgure. Therefore, the answer can have only one signiﬁcant ﬁgure.

93

1.29. Signiﬁcant Figures

Rules for Rounding

www.ck12.org

To get the correct answer in the volume calculation above, rounding was necessary. Rounding is done when one
or more ending digits are dropped to get the correct number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures. In this example, the answer was
rounded down to a lower number (from 1.2 to 1). Sometimes the answer is rounded up to a higher number. How do
you know which way to round? Follow these simple rules:

• If the digit to be rounded (dropped) is less than 5, then round down. For example, when rounding 2.344 to

three signiﬁcant ﬁgures, round down to 2.34.

• If the digit to be rounded is greater than 5, then round up. For example, when rounding 2.346 to three

signiﬁcant ﬁgures, round up to 2.35.

• If the digit to be rounded is 5, round up if the digit before 5 is odd, and round down if digit before 5 is even. For
example, when rounding 2.345 to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures, round down to 2.34. This rule may seem arbitrary,
but in a series of many calculations, any rounding errors should cancel each other out.

Summary

• In any measurement, the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures is the number of digits thought to be correct by the
person doing the measuring. It includes all digits that can be read directly from the measuring device plus one
estimated digit.

• To determine the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in a measurement that someone else has made, follow the rules

for counting signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

• When measurements are used in a calculation, the answer cannot have more signiﬁcant ﬁgures than the

measurement with the fewest signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

• Rounding is done when one or more ending digits are dropped to get the correct number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Simple rules state when to round up and when to round down.

1.30 Scientiﬁc Notation

• State the purpose of scientiﬁc notation.
• Explain how to convert numbers to and from scientiﬁc notation.

Most of the stars pictured in this view of the night sky are hundreds of light years from Earth. A light year is
the distance that light can travel in a year, or about 6 trillion (6,000,000,000,000) miles. As this example shows,
quantities in science may be very large. Many other quantities in science are very small. Both very large and very
small numbers have many zeroes, so they are hard to read and write without making mistakes. That’s where scientiﬁc
notation comes in.

What Is Scientiﬁc Notation?

Scientiﬁc notation is a way of writing very large or very small numbers that uses exponents. Numbers are written
in this format:

a× 10b

The letter a stands for a decimal number, and the letter b stands for an exponent, or power, of 10. For example, the
number 300 is written in scientiﬁc notation as 3.0 × 102. The number 0.03 is written as 3.0 × 10−2. Do you need a
review of exponents? If so, watch the video at this URL:

Using Scientiﬁc Notation

It’s easier to convert numbers to and from scientiﬁc notation than you might think. Refer to the examples on the
chalkboard in the Figure 1.31 as you read the following steps. Follow the steps in the sequence listed here to convert
a number to scientiﬁc notation. Follow the steps in the reverse order to convert a number from scientiﬁc notation.

× 10b.

1. Move the decimal point left or right until you reach the last nonzero digit. This new decimal number is a in a
2. Count how many places you moved the decimal point in Step 1. This number is b in a × 10b.
3. Did you move the decimal point left (ﬁrst example in the Figure 1.31)? If so, b is positive. Did you move the

decimal point right (second example in the Figure 1.31)? If so, b is negative.

FIGURE 1.31
These two examples show how to convert
large and small numbers to scientiﬁc no-
tation.

Q: Apply the steps above to write 450,000 in scientiﬁc notation.
A: The unwritten decimal point in this number follows the last zero. Move the decimal point from this position to
the left and stop just before the last digit, giving you 4.5 for a. The decimal point was moved ﬁve places to the left,
so b is 5. In scientiﬁc notation the number is 4.5 × 105.
Q: Apply the steps in reverse order to write the number that is expressed as 7.2 × 104 in scientiﬁc notation.
A: Add zeroes to 7.2 as you move the decimal point four places to the right. This gives you the number 72,000.

Summary

• Scientiﬁc notation is a way of writing very large or very small numbers that uses exponents. Numbers are
written in the format a × 10b.
• Changing numbers to or from scientiﬁc notation is easy to do by following three simple steps.

1.31. Descriptive Statistics

www.ck12.org

1.31 Descriptive Statistics

• State why descriptive statistics are useful.
• Identify the mean, median, and mode of a sample.
• Describe the range of a sample.

The girls in this picture vary in height. The shortest girl has a height of 52 cm, and the tallest girl has a height of
64 cm. The other two girls fall in between these two extremes. How could you describe the heights of all four girls
with a single number? How could express how they vary in height with another number?

Using Statistics to Describe a Sample

The girls in the picture above make up a small sample—there are only four of them. In scientiﬁc investigations,
samples may include hundreds or even thousands of people or other objects of study. Especially when samples are
very large, it’s important to be able to summarize their overall characteristics with a few numbers. That’s where
descriptive statistics come in. Descriptive statistics are measures that show the central tendency, or center, of a
sample or the variation in a sample.

Describing the Center

The central tendency of a sample can be represented by the mean, median, or mode.

• The mean is the average value. It is calculated by adding the individual measurements and dividing the sum

by the total number of measurements.

• The median is the middle value. To ﬁnd the median, rank all the measurements from smallest to largest and

then ﬁnd the measurement that is in the middle.

• The mode is the most common value. It is the value that occurs most often.

Q: A sample of ﬁve children have the following heights: 60 cm, 58 cm, 54 cm, 62 cm, and 58 cm. What are the
mean, median, and mode of this sample?
A: The mean is (60 cm + 58 cm + 54 cm + 62 cm + 58 cm) ÷ 5 = 58 cm. The median and mode are both 58 cm as
well. The mean, median, and mode are not always the same, as they are for this sample. In fact, sometimes these
three statistics are very different from one another for the same sample.

Describing the Range

Many samples have a lot of variation in measurements. Variation can be described with a statistic called the range.
The range is the total spread of values in a sample. It is calculated by subtracting the smallest value from the largest
value.
Q: What is the range of heights in the sample of children in the previous question?
A: The range is 62 cm –54 cm = 8 cm.

Summary

• Descriptive statistics are measures that summarize the characteristics of a sample.
• The central tendency, or center, of a sample can be represented by the mean, median, or mode.
• The variation in a sample can be represented by the range, or the total spread of values.

• State why graphs are useful in science.
• Describe bar graphs and their uses.
• Describe circle graphs and what they show.
• Describe line graphs and how they are used.

Tornadoes, like the one pictured here, are very powerful storms that can cause incredible destruction. Their winds
may exceed 300 miles per hour, and they can completely level towns and neighborhoods in just minutes. Because
tornadoes can be so serious, they are closely monitored, measured, and counted. As a result, there are a lot of data
on tornadoes. One way to present these data is with graphs.

Using Graphs in Science

Graphs are very useful tools in science. They can help you visualize a set of data. With a graph, you can actually
see what all the numbers in a data table mean. Three commonly used types of graphs are bar graphs, circle graphs,
and line graphs. Each type of graph is suitable for showing a different type of data.

Bar Graphs

The data in Table 1.6 shows the average number of tornadoes per year for the ten U.S. cities that have the most
tornadoes. The data were averaged over the time period 1950–2007.

Bar graphs are especially useful for comparing values for different things, such as the average numbers of tornadoes
for different cities. Therefore, a bar graph is a good choice for displaying the data in the Table 1.6. The bar graph
below shows one way that these data could be presented.

Q: What do the two axes of this bar graph represent?
A: The x-axis represents cities, and the y-axis represents average numbers of tornadoes.
Q: Could you switch what the axes represent? If so, how would the bar graph look?
A: Yes; the x-axis could represent average numbers of tornadoes, and the y-axis could represent cities. The bars of
the graph would be horizontal instead of vertical.

1.32. Scientiﬁc Graphing

Circle Graphs

www.ck12.org

The data in Table 1.7 shows the percent of all U.S. tornadoes by tornado strength for the years 1986 to 1995. In this
table, tornadoes are rated on a scale called the F scale. On this scale, F0 tornadoes are the weakest and F5 tornadoes
are the strongest.

Circle graphs are used to show percents (or fractions) of a whole, such as the percents of F0 to F5 tornadoes out of
all tornadoes. Therefore, a circle graph is a good choice for the data in the table. The circle graph below displays
these data.

Q: What if the Table 1.7 on tornado strength listed the numbers of tornadoes rather than the percents of tornadoes?
Could a circle graph be used to display these data?
A: No, a circle graph can only be used to show percents (or fractions) of a whole. However, the numbers could be
used to calculate percents, which could then be displayed in a circle graph. If you need a refresher on percents and
fractions, go to this URL: http://www.mathsisfun.com/decimal-fraction-percentage.html .

Line Graphs

Consider the data in Table 1.8. It lists the number of tornadoes in the U.S. per month, averaged over the years 2009
to 2011.

Line graphs are especially useful for showing changes over time, or time trends in data, such as how the average
number of tornadoes varies throughout the year. Therefore, a line graph would be a good choice to display the data
in the Table 1.8. The line graph below shows one way this could be done.

Q: Based on the line graph above, describe the trend in tornado numbers by month throughout the course of a year.
A: The number of tornadoes rises rapidly from a low in January to a peak in April. This is followed by a relatively
slow decline throughout the rest of the year.

Summary

• Graphs are very useful tools in science because they display data visually. Three commonly used types of
graphs are bar graphs, circle graphs, and line graphs. Each type of graph is suitable for a different type of data.
• Bar graphs are suitable for comparing values for different things, such as the average numbers of tornadoes

for different cities.

• Circle graphs are used to show percents of a whole, such as the percent of all U.S. tornadoes with different

strengths.

1.33 Scientiﬁc Modeling

• Identify properties of useful models in science.
• Describe examples of simple models in physical science.

Did you ever read a road map like this one? Maybe not, but you’ve probably made a sketch of a house or other object
and played with toy cars or dolls. What do all these activities have in common? They all involve models.

What Is a Model?

A model is a representation of an object, system, or process. For example, a road map is a representation of an
actual system of roads on the ground. Models are very useful in science. They provide a way to investigate things
that are too small, large, complex, or distant to investigate directly. To be useful, a model must closely represent the
real thing in important ways, but it must be simpler and easier to understand than the real thing.
Q: What might be examples of things that would be modeled in physical science because they are difﬁcult to
investigate directly?
A: Examples include extremely small things such as atoms, very distant objects such as stars, and complex systems
such as the electric grid that carries electricity throughout the country.
Q: What are ways that these things might be modeled?
A: Types of models include two-dimensional diagrams, three-dimensional structures, mathematical formulas, and
computer simulations. Examples of simple two-dimensional models in physical science are described below. You
can see examples of other types of physical science models at these URLs:

Simple Models in Physical Science

The diagram below is a simple two-dimensional model of a water molecule. This is the smallest particle of water
that still has the properties of water. The model shows that each molecule of water consists of one atom of oxygen
and two atoms of hydrogen.

Q: What else can you learn about water molecules from this model?
A: The model shows the number of atomic particles—protons, neutrons, and electrons—in each type of atom. It
also shows that each hydrogen atom in a water molecule shares its electron with the oxygen atom.
Q: Do you think this water molecule model satisﬁes the criteria of a useful model? In other words, does it represent
a real water molecule in important ways while being simpler and easier to understand than a real water molecule?
A: The model shows the basic structure of a water molecule and how the atoms in the molecule share electrons.
These features of the water molecule explain important properties of water. The model is also simpler and easier

106

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

to understand than a real water molecule. In a real molecule, electrons spin around the nuclei at the center of the
atoms in a cloud, rather than in neat, circular orbits, as shown in the model. The atoms of a real water molecule also
contain even smaller particles than protons, neutrons, and electrons. For many purposes, however, it’s not necessary
to represent these more complex features of a real water molecule.
The diagram below shows another example of a simple model in physical science. This diagram is a model of an
electric circuit. It represents the main parts of the circuit with simple symbols. Horizontal lines with + and –signs
represent a battery. The parts labeled R1, R2, and R3 are devices that use electricity provided by the battery. For
example, these parts might be a series of three light bulbs.

Q: In the electric circuit diagram, what do the black lines connecting the battery and electric devices represent?
A: The black lines represent electric wires. The wires are necessary to carry electric current from the battery to the
electric devices and back to the battery again.
Q: How is a circuit diagram simpler and easier to understand than an actual electric circuit?
A: A circuit diagram shows only the parts of the circuit that carry electric current, and it uses simple symbols to
represent them.

Summary

• A model is a representation of an object, system, or process that is simpler and easier to understand than the

real thing.

• Examples of simple models in physical science include two-dimensional models of molecules and electric

circuits.

1.34 Safety in Science

• Identify the meaning of lab safety symbols.
• List rules for staying safe in the lab.
• State what to do in case of accidents in the lab or ﬁeld.

Research in physical science can be exciting, but it also has potential dangers. For example, the ﬁeld scientist in this
photo is collecting water samples from treatment ponds. There are many microorganisms in the water that could
make him sick. The water and shore can also be strewn with dangerous objects such as sharp can lids and broken
glass bottles that could cause serious injury. Whether in the ﬁeld or in the lab, knowing how to stay safe in science
is important.

Safety Symbols

Lab procedures and equipment may be labeled with safety symbols. These symbols warn of speciﬁc hazards, such
as ﬂames or broken glass. Learn the symbols so you will recognize the dangers. Then learn how to avoid them.
Many common safety symbols are shown below.

109

1.34. Safety in Science

www.ck12.org

Q: Do you know how you can avoid these hazards?
A: Wearing protective gear is one way to avoid many hazards in science. For example, to avoid being burned by hot
objects, use hot mitts to protect your hands. To avoid eye hazards, such as harsh liquids splashed into the eyes, wear
safety goggles. You can learn more about these and other lab hazards and how to avoid them at this URL: http://w
ww.angelﬁre.com/va3/chemclass/safety.html .

Safety Rules

Following basic safety rules is another important way to stay safe in science. Safe practices help prevent accidents.
Several lab safety rules are listed below. Different rules may apply when you work in the ﬁeld. But in all cases, you
should always follow your teacher’s instructions.
Lab Safety Rules

• Wear long sleeves and shoes that completely cover your feet.
• If your hair is long, tie it back or cover it with a hair net.
• Protect your eyes, skin, and clothing by wearing safety goggles, an apron, and gloves.
• Use hot mitts to handle hot objects.
• Never work in the lab alone.
• Never engage in horseplay in the lab.
• Never eat or drink in the lab.
• Never do experiments without your teacher’s approval.
• Always add acid to water, never the other way around, and add the acid slowly to avoid splashing.
• Take care to avoid knocking over Bunsen burners, and keep them away from ﬂammable materials such as

paper.

110

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physical Science

• Use your hand to fan vapors toward your nose rather than smelling substances directly.
• Never point the open end of a test tube toward anyone—including yourself!
• Clean up any spills immediately.
• Dispose of lab wastes according to your teacher’s instructions.
• Wash glassware and counters when you ﬁnish your work.
• Wash your hands with soap and water before leaving the lab.

In Case of Accident

Even when you follow the rules, accidents can happen. Immediately alert your teacher if an accident occurs. Report
all accidents, whether or not you think they are serious.

Summary

• Lab safety symbols warn of speciﬁc hazards, such as ﬂames or broken glass. Knowing the symbols allows

you to recognize and avoid the dangers.

• Following basic safety rules, such as wearing safety gear, helps prevent accidents in the lab and in the ﬁeld.
• All accidents should be reported immediately.

Introduction

Chapter 2. Matter

What do think this picture shows? Here’s a hint: This illustration mimics a photo taken with a special microscope
that makes images of things that are extremely small. In fact, the gray spheres in the image represent things so small
that trillions of them would ﬁt inside the period at the end of this sentence. Each gray sphere is an atom of lead.
Do you know what atoms are? They are the basic building blocks of matter. Matter, in turn, is all the “stuff” in the
universe. In this unit you will learn much more about matter—from things as simple as atoms to as complex as you!

2.1. Matter, Mass, and Volume

www.ck12.org

2.1 Matter, Mass, and Volume

• Deﬁne matter.
• State what mass measures.
• State what volume measures.

Can you guess what this colorful image shows? Believe it or not, it actually depicts individual atoms of cesium
(reddish-orange) on a surface of gallium arsenide molecules (blue). The image was created with an extremely
powerful microscope, called a scanning tunneling microscope. This is the only type of microscope that can make
images of things as small as atoms, the basic building blocks of matter.

What’s the Matter?

Matter is all the “stuff” that exists in the universe. Everything you can see and touch is made of matter, including
you! The only things that aren’t matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound. In science, matter is deﬁned
as anything that has mass and volume. Mass and volume measure different aspects of matter.

Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in a substance or an object. The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram
(kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass
may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below
may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that
the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass

118

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter

of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that
the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit’s mass is less than 1 kg.
Q: If the fruit were at a lower level than the iron object, what would be the mass of the fruit?
A: The mass of the fruit would be greater than 1 kg.

Mass is commonly confused with weight. The two are closely related, but they measure different things. Whereas
mass measures the amount of matter in an object, weight measures the force of gravity acting on an object. The
force of gravity on an object depends on its mass but also on the strength of gravity. If the strength of gravity is held
constant (as it is all over Earth), then an object with a greater mass also has a greater weight.
Q: With Earth’s gravity, an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of 2.2 lb. How much does a 10 kg object weigh
on Earth?
A: A 10 kg object weighs ten times as much as a 1 kg object:

10 × 2.2 lb = 22 lb

Volume

Volume is a measure of the amount of space that a substance or an object takes up. The basic SI unit for volume is
the cubic meter (m3), but smaller volumes may be measured in cm3, and liquids may be measured in liters (L) or
milliliters (mL). How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state.

• The volume of a liquid is measured with a measuring container, such as a measuring cup or graduated cylinder.
• The volume of a gas depends on the volume of its container: gases expand to ﬁll whatever space is available

to them.

• The volume of a regularly shaped solid can be calculated from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a

rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height.

Q: How could you ﬁnd the volume of air in an otherwise empty room?
A: If the room has a regular shape, you could calculate its volume from its dimensions. For example, the volume of
a rectangular room can be calculated with the formula:

Volume = length × width × height

If the length of the room is 5.0 meters, the width is 3.0 meters, and the height is 2.5 meters, then the volume of the
room is:

Volume = 5.0 m × 3.0 m × 2.5 m = 37.5 m3

Q: What is the volume of the dinosaur in the diagram above?
A: The volume of the water alone is 4.8 mL. The volume of the water and dinosaur together is 5.6 mL. Therefore,
the volume of the dinosaur alone is 5.6 mL – 4.8 mL = 0.8 mL.

Summary

• Matter is all the “stuff” that exists in the universe. It has both mass and volume.
• Mass measures the amount of matter in a substance or an object. The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram

(kg).

• Volume measures the amount of space that a substance or an object takes up. The basic SI unit for volume is

2.2. Physical Properties of Matter

2.2 Physical Properties of Matter

• Deﬁne physical property.
• Give examples of physical properties of matter.

Both of these people are participating in a board sport, but the man on the left is snowboarding in Norway while
the woman on the right is sandboarding in Dubai. Snow and sand are both kinds of matter, but they have different
properties. What are some ways snow and sand differ? One difference is the temperature at which they melt. Snow
melts at 0°C, whereas sand melts at about 1600°C! The temperature at which something melts is its melting point.
Melting point is just one of many physical properties of matter.

What Are Physical Properties?

Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to an entirely
different substance. Physical properties are typically things you can detect with your senses. For example, they may
be things that you can see, hear, smell, or feel.
Q: What differences between snow and sand can you detect with your senses?
A: You can see that snow and sand have a different color. You can also feel that snow is softer than sand. Both color
and hardness are physical properties of matter.

Additional Physical Properties

In addition to these properties, other physical properties of matter include the state of matter. States of matter include
liquid, solid, and gaseous states. For example at 20°C, coal exists as a solid and water exists as a liquid. Additional
examples of physical properties include:

• odor
• boiling point
• ability to conduct heat
• ability to conduct electricity
• ability to dissolve in other substances

Some of these properties are illustrated in the Figures 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4. The video at this URL below compares
physical properties such as these for different classes of matter:

The strong smell of swimming pool water
is the odor of chlorine, which is added to
the water to kill germs and algae. In con-

no chlorine, does not have an odor.

FIGURE 2.2
Coolant is added to the water in a car
radiator to keep the water from boiling and
evaporating. Coolant has a higher boiling
point than water and adding it to the water
increases the boiling point of the solution.

Q: The coolant that is added to a car radiator also has a lower freezing point than water. Why is this physical property
useful?
A: When coolant is added to water in a car radiator, it lowers the freezing point of the water. This prevents the water
in the radiator from freezing when the temperature drops below 0°C, which is the freezing point of pure water.
Q: Besides being able to conduct electricity, what other physical property of copper makes it well suited for electric
wires?

This teakettle is made of aluminum except
for its handle, which is made of plastic.
Aluminum is a good conductor of heat.
It conducts heat from the ﬂames on the
range to the water inside the kettle, so the
water heats quickly. Plastic, on the other
hand, is not a good conductor of heat. It
stays cool enough to touch even when the
rest of the teakettle becomes very hot.

A: Copper, like other metals, is ductile. This means that it can be rolled and stretched into long thin shapes such as
wires.

• Deﬁne density.
• Demonstrate how to calculate density.

The man in this cartoon is ﬁlling balloons with helium gas. What will happen if he lets go of the ﬁlled balloons?
They will rise up into the air until they reach the ceiling. Do you know why? It’s because helium has less density
than air.

Deﬁning Density

Density is an important physical property of matter. It reﬂects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When
particles are packed together more tightly, matter has greater density. Differences in density of matter explain many
phenomena, not just why helium balloons rise. For example, differences in density of cool and warm ocean water
explain why currents such as the Gulf Stream ﬂow through the oceans. You can see a colorful demonstration of
substances with different densities at this URL:

To better understand density, think about a bowling ball and volleyball, pictured in the Figure 2.5. Imagine lifting
each ball. The two balls are about the same size, but the bowling ball feels much heavier than the volleyball. That’s
because the bowling ball is made of solid plastic, which contains a lot of tightly packed particles of matter. The
volleyball, in contrast, is full of air, which contains fewer, more widely spaced particles of matter. In other words,
the matter inside the bowling ball is denser than the matter inside the volleyball.

FIGURE 2.5
A bowling ball is denser than a volleyball.
Although both balls are similar in size, the
bowling ball feels much heavier than the
volleyball.

Q: If you ever went bowling, you may have noticed that some bowling balls feel heavier than others even though
they are the same size. How can this be?
A: Bowling balls that feel lighter are made of matter that is less dense.

Calculating Density

The density of matter is actually the amount of matter in a given space. The amount of matter is measured by its
mass, and the space matter takes up is measured by its volume. Therefore, the density of matter can be calculated
with this formula:

Assume, for example, that a book has a mass of 500 g and a volume of 1000 cm3. Then the density of the book is:

Density =

mass
volume

Density =

500 g
1000 cm3 = 0.5 g/cm3

Q: What is the density of a liquid that has a volume of 30 mL and a mass of 300 g?
A: The density of the liquid is:

Density =

300 g
30 mL

= 10 g/mL

127

2.4 Chemical Properties of Matter

• Deﬁne chemical property.
• Describe examples of chemical properties of matter.

Look at the two garden trowels pictured here. Both trowels were left outside for several weeks. One tool became
rusty, but the other did not. The tool that rusted is made of iron, and the other tool is made of aluminum. The ability
to rust is a chemical property of iron but not aluminum.

What Are Chemical Properties?

Chemical properties are properties that can be measured or observed only when matter undergoes a change to
become an entirely different kind of matter. For example, the ability of iron to rust can only be observed when iron
actually rusts. When it does, it combines with oxygen to become a different substance called iron oxide. Iron is very
hard and silver in color, whereas iron oxide is ﬂakey and reddish brown. Besides the ability to rust, other chemical
properties include reactivity and ﬂammability.

Reactivity

Reactivity is the ability of matter to combine chemically with other substances. Some kinds of matter are extremely
reactive; others are extremely unreactive. For example, potassium is very reactive, even with water. When a pea-
sized piece of potassium is added to a small amount of water, it reacts explosively. You can observe this reaction in
the video at the URL below. (Caution: Don’t try this at home!) In contrast, noble gases such as helium almost never
react with any other substances.

Flammability

Flammability is the ability of matter to burn. When matter burns, it combines with oxygen and changes to different
substances. Wood is an example of ﬂammable matter, as seen in Figure 2.6.

FIGURE 2.6
When wood burns, it changes to ashes,
carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other
gases. You can see ashes in the wood ﬁre
pictured here. The gases are invisible.

Q: How can you tell that wood ashes are a different substance than wood?
A: Ashes have different properties than wood. For example, ashes are gray and powdery, whereas wood is brown
and hard.
Q: What are some other substances that have the property of ﬂammability?
A: Substances called fuels have the property of ﬂammability. They include fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and
petroleum, as well as fuels made from petroleum, such as gasoline and kerosene. Substances made of wood, such as
paper and cardboard, are also ﬂammable.

Summary

• Chemical properties are properties that can be measured or observed only when matter undergoes a change to

become an entirely different kind of matter. They include reactivity, ﬂammability, and the ability to rust.

• Reactivity is the ability of matter to react chemically with other substances.

• Outline the history of elements.
• Relate atoms to elements.

As this mountain of trash suggests, there are many different kinds of matter. In fact, there are millions of different
kinds of matter in the universe. Yet all kinds of matter actually consist of relatively few pure substances.

Pure Substances

A pure substance is called an element. An element is a pure substance because it cannot be separated into any other
substances. Currently, 92 different elements are known to exist in nature, although additional elements have been
formed in labs. All matter consists of one or more of these elements. Some elements are very common; others are
relatively rare. The most common element in the universe is hydrogen, which is part of Earth’s atmosphere and a
component of water. The most common element in Earth’s atmosphere is nitrogen, and the most common element
in Earth’s crust is oxygen. Several other elements are described in the musical video at this URL:

Elemental Properties

Each element has a unique set of properties that is different from the set of properties of any other element. For
example, the element iron is a solid that is attracted by a magnet and can be made into a magnet, like the compass
needle shown in the Figure 2.7. The element neon, on the other hand, is a gas that gives off a red glow when
electricity ﬂows through it. The lighted sign in the Figure 2.8 contains neon.

FIGURE 2.7
The needle of this compass is made of the
element iron.

Q: Do you know properties of any other elements? For example, what do you know about helium?
A: Helium is a gas that has a lower density than air. That’s why helium balloons have to be weighted down so they
won’t ﬂoat away.
Q: Living things, like all matter, are made of elements. Do you know which element is most common in living
things?
A: Carbon is the most common element in living things. It has the unique property of being able to combine with
many other elements as well as with itself. This allows carbon to form a huge number of different substances.

History of Elements

For thousands of years, people have wondered about the substances that make up matter. About 2500 years ago,
the Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that all matter is made up of just four elements, which he identiﬁed as earth,
air, water, and ﬁre. He thought that different substances vary in their properties because they contain different
proportions of these four elements. Aristotle had the right idea, but he was wrong about which substances are
elements. Nonetheless, his four elements were accepted until just a few hundred years ago. Then scientists started

discovering many of the elements with which we are familiar today. Eventually they discovered dozens of different
elements. You can read how and when the different elements were discovered at this URL: http://www.nndc.bnl.
gov/content/origindc.pdf .

Particles of Elements

The smallest particle of an element that still has the properties of that element is the atom. Atoms actually consist
of smaller particles, including protons and electrons, but these smaller particles are the same for all elements. All
the atoms of an element are like one another, and are different from the atoms of all other elements. For example,
the atoms of each element have a unique number of protons.
Consider carbon as an example. Carbon atoms have six protons. They also have six electrons. All carbon atoms are
the same whether they are found in a lump of coal or a teaspoon of table sugar ( Figure 2.9). On the other hand,
carbon atoms are different from the atoms of hydrogen, which are also found in coal and sugar. Each hydrogen atom
has just one proton and one electron.

FIGURE 2.9
Carbon is the main element in coal (left).
Carbon is also a major component of
sugar (right).

Q: Why do you think coal and sugar are so different from one another when carbon is a major component of each
substance?

134

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter

A: Coal and sugar differ from one another because they contain different proportions of carbon and other elements.
For example, coal is about 85 percent carbon, whereas table sugar is about 42 percent carbon. Both coal and sugar
also contain the elements hydrogen and oxygen but in different proportions. In addition, coal contains the elements
nitrogen and sulfur.

Summary

• An element is a pure substance that cannot be separated into any other substances. There are 92 naturally

occurring elements.

• Each element has a unique set of properties that is different from the set of properties of any other element.
• For about 2000 years, people accepted Aristotle’s idea that all matter is made up of just four elements: earth,
air, water, and ﬁre. Starting about 500 years ago, scientists began discovering all of the elements that are
known today.

What is this strange-looking object? Can you guess what it is? It’s a model of a certain type of matter. Some types
of matter are elements, or pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. Many other types of
matter are compounds. The model above represents a compound. The compound it represents is carbon dioxide, a
gas you exhale each time you breathe.

What Is a Compound?

A compound is a unique substance that forms when two or more elements combine chemically. For example, the
compound carbon dioxide forms when one atom of carbon (grey in the model above) combines with two atoms of
oxygen (red in the model). Another example of a compound is water. It forms when two hydrogen atoms combine
with one oxygen atom. You can learn more about compounds and how they form by watching the video at this URL:

A: It could be represented by a model like the one for carbon dioxide in the opening image. You can see a sample
Figure 2.10.

FIGURE 2.10
A model of water.

Two things are true of all compounds:

• A compound always has the same elements in the same proportions. For example, carbon dioxide always has
two atoms of oxygen for each atom of carbon, and water always has two atoms of hydrogen for each atom of
oxygen.

• A compound always has the same composition throughout. For example, all the carbon dioxide in the

atmosphere and all the water in the ocean have these same proportions of elements.

Q: How do you think the properties of compounds compare with the properties of the elements that form them?
A: You might expect the properties of a compound to be similar to the properties of the elements that make up the
compound. But you would be wrong.

Properties of Compounds

The properties of compounds are different from the properties of the elements that form them—sometimes very
different. That’s because elements in a compound combine and become an entirely different substance with its own
unique properties. Do you put salt on your food? Table salt is the compound sodium chloride. It contains sodium
and chlorine. As shown in the Figure 2.11, sodium is a solid that reacts explosively with water, and chlorine is a
poisonous gas. But together in table salt, sodium and chlorine form a harmless unreactive compound that you can
safely eat.

A: Sodium chloride is an odorless white solid that is harmless unless consumed in large quantities. In fact, it is a
necessary component of the human diet.

Structure of Compounds

Compounds like sodium chloride form structures called crystals. A crystal is a rigid framework of many ions locked
together in a repeating pattern. Ions are electrically charged forms of atoms. You can see a crystal of sodium chloride
in the Figure 2.12. It is made up of many sodium and chloride ions.

Some—including lemonade—are mixtures.

What Is a Mixture?

A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in any proportion. This is different from a compound, which
consists of substances in ﬁxed proportions. The substances in a mixture also do not combine chemically to form
a new substance, as they do in a compound. Instead, they just intermingle and keep their original properties. The
lemonade pictured above is a mixture because it doesn’t have ﬁxed proportions of ingredients. It could have more or
less lemon juice, for example, or more or less sugar, and it would still be lemonade.
Q: What are some other examples of mixtures?

Chapter 2. Matter

A: Other examples of liquid mixtures include salt water and salad dressing. Air is a mixture of gases, mainly nitrogen
and oxygen. The rock pictured in the Figure 2.13 is a solid mixture.

FIGURE 2.13
This rock is a mixture of smaller rocks and minerals.

Homogeneous or Heterogeneous?

The lemonade in the opening picture is an example of a homogeneous mixture. A homogeneous mixture has the
same composition throughout. Another example of a homogeneous mixture is salt water. If you analyzed samples
of ocean water in different places, you would ﬁnd that the proportion of salt in each sample is the same: 3.5 percent.
The rock in Figure 2.13 is an example of a heterogeneous mixture. A heterogeneous mixture varies in its composi-
tion. The black nuggets, for example, are not distributed evenly throughout the rock.

Types of Mixtures

Mixtures have different properties depending on the size of their particles. Three types of mixtures based on particle
size are solutions, suspensions, and colloids, all of which are described in Table 2.1. You can watch videos about
the three types of mixtures at these URLs:

TABLE 2.1: Solutions, Suspensions, and Colloids

Description
A solution is a homogeneous mixture with tiny parti-
cles. The particles are too small to see and also too
small to settle or be ﬁltered out of the mixture.
When the salt is thoroughly mixed into the water in this
glass, it will form a solution. The salt will no longer be
visible in the water, and it won’t settle to the bottom of
the glass.

A colloid is a homogeneous mixture with medium-
sized particles. The particles are large enough to see
but not large enough to settle or be ﬁltered out of the
mixture.
The gelatin in this dish is a colloid. It looks red because
you can see the red gelatin particles in the mixture.
However, the particles are too small to settle to the
bottom of the dish.
A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture with large
particles. The particles are large enough to see and also
to settle or be ﬁltered out of the mixture.
It
The salad dressing in this bottle is a suspension.
contains oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices.
If the bottle
sits undisturbed for very long, the mixture will separate
into its component parts. That’s why you should shake
it before you use it.

Q: If you buy a can of paint at a paint store, a store employee may put the can on a shaker machine to mix up the
paint in the can. What type of mixture is the paint?
A: The paint is a suspension. Some of the components of the paint settle out of the mixture when it sits undisturbed
for a long time. This explains why you need to shake (or stir) the paint before you use it.
Q: The milk you buy in the supermarket has gone through a process called homogenization. This process breaks up
the cream in the milk into smaller particles. As a result, the cream doesn’t separate out of the milk no matter how
long it sits on the shelf. Which type of mixture is homogenized milk?
A: Homogenized milk is a colloid. The particles in the milk are large enough to see—that’s why milk is white
instead of clear like water, which is the main component of milk. However, the particles are not large enough to
settle out of the mixture.

Separating Mixtures

The components of a mixture keep their own identity when they combine, so they retain their physical properties.
Examples of physical properties include boiling point, ability to dissolve, and particle size. When components of

142

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter

mixtures vary in physical properties such as these, processes such as boiling, dissolving, or ﬁltering can be used to
separate them.
Look at the Figure 2.14 of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The water in the lake is a solution of salt and water. Do you
see the white salt deposits near the shore? How did the salt separate from the salt water? Water has a lower boiling
point than salt, and it evaporates in the heat of the sun. With its higher boiling point, the salt doesn’t get hot enough
to evaporate, so it is left behind.

FIGURE 2.14

Q: Suppose you have a mixture of salt and pepper. What properties of the salt and pepper might allow you to
separate them?
A: Salt dissolves in water but pepper does not. If you mix salt and pepper with water, only the salt will dissolve,
leaving the pepper ﬂoating in the water. You can separate the pepper from the water by pouring the mixture through
a ﬁlter, such as a coffee ﬁlter.
Q: After you separate the pepper from the salt water, how could you separate the salt from the water?
A: You could heat the water until it boils and evaporates. The salt would be left behind.

Summary

• A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in any proportions. The substances in a mixture do not

combine chemically, so they retain their physical properties.

• A homogeneous mixture has the same composition throughout. A heterogeneous mixture varies in its compo-

sition.

• Mixtures can be classiﬁed on the basis of particle size into three different types: solutions, suspensions, and

colloids.

• The components of a mixture retain their own physical properties. These properties can be used to separate

the components by ﬁltering, boiling, or other physical processes.

2.8 Physical Change

• Deﬁne physical change, and give examples of physical change.
• Explain how physical changes can be reversed.

These stunning rock arches in Utah were carved by wind-blown sand. Repeated scouring by the sand wore away the
rock, bit by tiny bit, like sandpaper on wood. The bits of rock worn away by the sand still contain the same minerals
as they did when they were part of the large rock. They have not changed chemically in any way. Only the size and
shape of the rock have changed, from a single large rock to millions of tiny bits of rock. Changes in size and shape
are physical changes in matter.

What Is a Physical Change?

A physical change is a change in one or more physical properties of matter without any change in chemical
properties. In other words, matter doesn’t change into a different substance in a physical change. Examples of
physical change include changes in the size or shape of matter. Changes of state—for example, from solid to liquid
or from liquid to gas—are also physical changes. Some of the processes that cause physical changes include cutting,
bending, dissolving, freezing, boiling, and melting. Four examples of physical change are pictured in the Figure
2.15. You can learn more about physical changes and why they occur by watching the video at this URL:

FIGURE 2.15

Q: In the Figure 2.15, what physical changes are occurring?
A: The paper is being cut into smaller pieces, which is changing its size and shape. The ice cubes are turning into a
puddle of liquid water because they are melting. This is a change of state. The tablet is disappearing in the glass of
water because it is dissolving into particles that are too small to see. The lighthouse is becoming coated with ice as
ocean spray freezes on its surface. This is another change of state.

Reversing Physical Changes

When matter undergoes physical change, it doesn’t become a different substance. Therefore, physical changes are
often easy to reverse. For example, when liquid water freezes to form ice, it can be changed back to liquid water by
heating and melting the ice.
Q: Salt dissolving in water is a physical change. How could this change be reversed?
A: The salt water could be boiled until the water evaporates, leaving behind the salt. Water vapor from the boiling
water could be captured and cooled. The water vapor would condense and change back to liquid water.

Summary

• A physical change in matter is a change in one or more of matter’s physical properties. In a physical change,

matter may change its size, shape, or state, but its chemical properties do not change.

• Because the chemical properties of matter remain the same in a physical change, a physical change is often

easy to reverse.

• Explain how some chemical changes can be reversed.

Communities often use ﬁreworks to celebrate important occasions. Fireworks certainly create awesome sights and
sounds! Do you know what causes the brilliant lights and loud booms of a ﬁreworks display? The answer is chemical
changes.

What Is a Chemical Change?

A chemical change occurs whenever matter changes into an entirely different substance with different chemical
properties. A chemical change is also called a chemical reaction. Many complex chemical changes occur to produce
the explosions of ﬁreworks. An example of a simpler chemical change is the burning of methane. Methane is the
main component of natural gas, which is burned in many home furnaces. During burning, methane combines with
oxygen in the air to produce entirely different chemical substances, including the gases carbon dioxide and water
vapor. You can watch some very colorful chemical changes occurring in the video at this URL:

Identifying Chemical Changes

Chapter 2. Matter

Most chemical changes are not as dramatic as exploding ﬁreworks, so how can you tell whether a chemical change
has occurred? There are usually clues. You just need to know what to look for. A chemical change has probably
occurred if bubbles are released, there is a change of color, or an odor is produced. Other clues include the release
of heat, light, or loud sounds. Examples of chemical changes that produce these clues are shown in the Figure 2.17.

FIGURE 2.17

Q: In addition to iron rusting, what is another example of matter changing color? Do you think this color change is
a sign that a new chemical substance has been produced?
A: Another example of matter changing color is a penny changing from reddish brown to greenish brown as it
becomes tarnished. The color change indicates that a new chemical substance has been produced. Copper on the
surface of the penny has combined with oxygen in the air to produce a different substance called copper oxide.
Q: Besides food spoiling, what is another change that produces an odor? Is this a chemical change?
A: When wood burns, it produces a smoky odor. Burning is a chemical change.
Q: Which signs of chemical change do ﬁreworks produce?
A: Fireworks produce heat, light, and loud sounds. These are all signs of chemical change. You can learn how
ﬁreworks produce these signs of chemical change at this URL: http://www.scifun.org/chemweek/fireworks/ﬁrewor
ks.htm .

Can Chemical Changes Be Reversed?

Because chemical changes produce new substances, they often cannot be undone. For example, you can’t change
ashes from burning logs back into wood. Some chemical changes can be reversed, but only by other chemical
changes. For example, to undo tarnish on copper pennies, you can place them in vinegar. The acid in the vinegar
combines with the copper oxide of the tarnish. This changes the copper oxide back to copper and oxygen, making
the pennies reddish brown again. You can try this at home to see how well it works.

2.10 Conservation of Mass

• Describe an example of mass remaining the same in a change of matter.
• State the law of conservation of mass.

If you build a campﬁre like this one, you start with a big pile of logs. As the ﬁre burns, the pile of logs slowly
shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that’s left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you
started with? Was it destroyed by the ﬁre?

Where’s the Matter?

It may seem as though burning destroys matter, but the same amount, or mass, of matter still exists after a campﬁre
as before. Look at the sketch in Figure 2.18. It shows that when wood burns, it combines with oxygen and changes
not only to ashes but also to carbon dioxide and water vapor. The gases ﬂoat off into the air, leaving behind just the
ashes. Suppose you had measured the mass of the wood before it burned and the mass of the ashes after it burned.
Also suppose you had been able to measure the oxygen used by the ﬁre and the gases produced by the ﬁre. What
would you ﬁnd? The total mass of matter after the ﬁre would be the same as the total mass of matter before the ﬁre.
Q: What can you infer from this example?
A: You can infer that burning does not destroy matter. It just changes matter into different substances.

Law of Conservation of Mass

This burning campﬁre example illustrates a very important law in science: the law of conservation of mass. This
law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Even when matter goes through a physical or chemical change,
the total mass of matter always remains the same.
Q: How could you show that the mass of matter remains the same when matter changes state?

A: You could ﬁnd the mass of a quantity of liquid water. Then you could freeze the water and ﬁnd the mass of the
ice. The mass before and after freezing would be the same, showing that mass is conserved when matter changes
state.

Summary

• Burning and other changes in matter do not destroy matter. The mass of matter is always the same before and

after the changes occur.

• The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed.

Water, Water Everywhere

The photo above represents water in three common states of matter. States of matter are different phases in which
any given type of matter can exist. There are actually four well-known states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
Plasma isn’t represented in the iceberg photo, but the other three states of matter are. The iceberg itself consists of
water in the solid state, and the lake consists of water in the liquid state.
Q: Where is water in the gaseous state in the above photo?
A: You can’t see the gaseous water, but it’s there. It exists as water vapor in the air.
Q: Water is one of the few substances that commonly exist on Earth in more than one state. Many other substances
typically exist only in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state. Can you think of examples of matter that usually exists in
just one of these three states?
A: Just look around you and you will see many examples of matter that usually exists in the solid state. They include
soil, rock, wood, metal, glass, and plastic. Examples of matter that usually exist in the liquid state include cooking

153

oil, gasoline, and mercury, which is the only metal that commonly exists as a liquid. Examples of matter that usually
exists in the gaseous state include oxygen and nitrogen, which are the chief gases in Earth’s atmosphere.

Phases Are Physical

A given kind of matter has the same chemical makeup and the same chemical properties regardless of its state. That’s
because state of matter is a physical property. As a result, when matter changes state, it doesn’t become a different
kind of substance. For example, water is still water whether it exists as ice, liquid water, or water vapor.

Properties of Solids, Liquids, and Gases

The most common states of matter on Earth are solids, liquids, and gases. How do these states of matter differ?

2.12 Solids

• Identify properties of matter in the solid state.
• Compare crystalline and amorphous solids.

What do you think this picture shows? Could it be a delicate glass sculpture created by a talented artist? It’s delicate
alright, but it’s not glass, nor was it created by an artist. It’s actually made of ice and it’s a work of nature. Now can
you guess what it is? It’s a snowﬂake, as viewed under a microscope.

Snowﬂakes and Other Solids

A snowﬂake is made of ice, or water in the solid state. A solid is one of four well-known states of matter. The other
three states are liquid, gas, and plasma. Compared with these other states of matter, solids have particles that are
much more tightly packed together. The particles are held rigidly in place by all the other particles around them so
they can’t slip past one another or move apart. This gives solids a ﬁxed shape and a ﬁxed volume.

Types of Solids

Not all solids are alike. Some are crystalline solids; others are amorphous solids. Snowﬂakes are crystalline solids.
Particles of crystalline solids are arranged in a regular repeating pattern, as you can see in the sketch in Figure 2.21.
The repeating particles form a geometric shape called a crystal. You can watch a snowﬂake crystal forming at the
following URL: http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/movies/movies.htm . Another crystalline solid is
table salt (sodium chloride). Crystals of table salt are pictured in the Figure 2.21.

Amorphous means “shapeless.” Particles of amorphous solids are arranged more-or-less at random and do not form
crystals, as you can see in the Figure 2.22. An example of an amorphous solid is cotton candy, also shown in the
Figure 2.22.

Q: Look at the quartz rock and plastic bag pictured in the Figure 2.23. Which type of solid do you think each of

Summary

• A solid is a state of matter in which particles of matter are tightly packed together. This holds the particles

rigidly in place and gives solids a ﬁxed shape and ﬁxed volume.

• Crystalline solids have particles that are arranged in a regular repeating pattern. They form crystals. Amor-

• Identify properties of matter in the liquid state.
• Describe surface tension and viscosity of liquids.

Colored by lights at night, an incredible amount of water plunges continuously over the sheer rock wall of Niagara
Falls. If you stand close to the falls, the roar of the water is almost deafening, and the rushing water drenches you
with spray. No wonder Niagara Falls was once named one of the seven natural wonders of the world! It’s amazing
how such a common substance—water—can be so impressive.

Water and Other Liquids

Water is the most common substance on Earth, and most of it exists in the liquid state. A liquid is one of four
well-known states of matter, along with solid, gas, and plasma states. The particles of liquids are in close contact
with each other but not as tightly packed as the particles in solids. The particles can slip past one another and take
the shape of their container. However, they cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container, as
particles of a gas can. If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container, the top surface of the liquid
will be exposed to the air, like the vinegar in the bottle pictured in the Figure 2.25.
Q: Why does most water on Earth’s surface exist in a liquid state? In what other states does water exist on Earth?
A: Almost 97 percent of water on Earth’s surface is found as liquid salt water in the oceans. The temperature over
most of Earth’s surface is above the freezing point (0°C) of water, so relatively little water exists as ice. Even near
the poles, most of the water in the oceans is above the freezing point. And in very few places on Earth’s surface do
temperatures reach the boiling point (100°C) of water. Although water exists in the atmosphere in a gaseous state,
water vapor makes up less than 1 percent of Earth’s total water.

Two unique properties of liquids are surface tension and viscosity. Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at
the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles. Surface tension explains why water forms droplets, like
the water droplet that has formed on the leaky faucet pictured in the Figure 2.26. You can learn more about surface
tension at this URL: http://io9.com/5668221/an-experiment-with-soap-water-pepper-and-surface-tension .

FIGURE 2.26
Water drips from a leaky faucet.

Viscosity is a liquid’s resistance to ﬂowing. You can think of it as friction between particles of liquid. Thicker
liquids are more viscous than thinner liquids. For example, the honey pictured in the Figure 2.27 is more viscous
than the vinegar. You can learn more about viscosity at this URL: http://chemed.chem.wisc.edu/chempaths/GenChe
m-Textbook/Viscosity-840.html .
Q: Which liquid do you think is more viscous: honey or chocolate syrup?
A: The viscosity of honey and chocolate syrup vary by brand and other factors, but chocolate syrup generally is
more viscous than honey.

Summary

• A liquid is a state of matter in which particles can slip past one another and take the shape of their container.

However, the particles cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container.

• Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles.

2.14 Gases

• Identify properties of gases.
• Explain why gases exert pressure.
• Describe how atmospheric pressure changes as altitude increases.

A hiker pauses to view the impressive peak of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. At the top of Mount
Everest, the air is very thin. Climbers may need oxygen tanks to get enough oxygen to breathe, even though oxygen
is the second most plentiful gas in the atmosphere.

What Is a Gas?

A gas is one of four well-known states of matter. (The other three are solid, liquid, and plasma). The particles of a
gas can pull apart from each other and spread out. As a result, a gas does not have a ﬁxed shape or a ﬁxed volume.
In fact, a gas always spreads out to take up whatever space is available to it. If a gas is enclosed in a container, it
spreads out until it has the same volume as the container.
Q: The sketches in the Figure 2.29 represent two identical sealed boxes that contain only air particles (represented
by dots). There are more air particles in box B than box A. Which box contains a greater volume of air?
A: This is a trick question! The air inside each box expands to ﬁll the available space, which is identical for both
boxes. There are more air particles in box B, but the volume of air is exactly the same in both boxes.

Pressure of Gases

Particles of gas are constantly moving in all directions at random. As a result, they are always bumping into each
other and other things. This is modeled in the Figure 2.30. The force of the particles against things they bump into

163

2.14. Gases

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 2.29

creates pressure. Pressure is deﬁned in physics as the amount of force pushing against a given area. How much
pressure a gas exerts depends on the number of gas particles in a given space and how fast they are moving. The
more gas particles there are and the faster they are moving, the greater the pressure they create. To learn more about
gas pressure and how to measure it, go to this URL: http://www.wisc-online.com/objects/ViewObject.aspx?ID=GC
H5004 .

FIGURE 2.30
The arrows show that particles of a gas
move randomly in all directions.

Q: Look at box A and box B in the previous question. Is air pressure the same in both boxes? Why or why not?
A: Air pressure is greater in box B. That’s because there are more air particles in box B to bump into each other and
into the sides of the container. Therefore, the particles in box B exert more force on a given area.

Pressure in the Atmosphere

We live in a “sea” of air called the atmosphere. Can you feel the air in the atmosphere pressing against you? Not
usually, but air actually exerts a lot of pressure because there’s so much of it. The atmosphere rises high above

164

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter

Earth’s surface, so it contains a huge number of gas particles. Most of them are concentrated close to Earth’s surface
because of gravity and the weight of all the air in the atmosphere above them. As a result, air pressure is greatest at
sea level and drops rapidly as you go higher in altitude. The Figure 2.31 shows how air pressure falls from sea level
to the top of the atmosphere. In the graph, air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar (mb). The SI unit of
pressure is newton per square centimeter (N/cm2).

FIGURE 2.31

Q: The top of Mount Everest is almost 9 km above sea level. What is the pressure of the atmosphere at this altitude?
A: Air pressure at the top of Mount Everest is about 260 mb. This is only about 25 percent of air pressure at sea level,
which is 1013.2 mb. No wonder it’s hard for climbers to breathe when they get close to Mount Everest’s summit!

Summary

• Gas is a state of matter in which particles of matter can pull apart from each other and spread out. As a result,

a gas does not have a ﬁxed shape or a ﬁxed volume.

• Gas particles are constantly moving and bumping into things, and this creates force. The amount of force

pushing against a given area is called pressure.

• The pressure of gases in the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases rapidly as altitude increases.

2.15 Plasma

• State properties of matter in the plasma state.
• Identify where plasma is found.

This glowing sphere is matter in a particular state. You’re probably familiar with the states of matter most common
on Earth—solid, liquid, and gas. But the glowing sphere is a state of matter called plasma. The plasma ball pictured
above was made by humans, but plasma is also found in nature. In fact, plasma makes up most of the matter in the
universe.

What Is Plasma?

Plasma is a state of matter that resembles a gas but has certain properties that gases do not have. Like a gas, plasma
consists of particles of matter than can pull apart and spread out, so it lacks a ﬁxed volume and a ﬁxed shape. Unlike
a gas, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to a magnetic ﬁeld. That’s because plasma consists of electrically
charged particles called ions, instead of uncharged particles such as atoms or molecules. This gives plasma other
interesting properties as well. For example, plasma glows with colored light when electricity passes through it. You
can learn more about plasma at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkeSI_B5Ljc

Where Is Plasma Found?

The sun and other stars consist of plasma. Plasma is also found naturally in lightning and in the northern and southern
lights. If you’ve never seen these shimmering colorful lights in the winter night sky, the Figure 2.33 shows what
they can look like. Human-made plasmas are found in ﬂuorescent lights, plasma TV screens, and plasma spheres
like the one pictured in the opening image.

Q: Besides the northern lights, where are other examples of plasma in this picture?
A: The stars consist of plasma.
Q: What properties of plasma do you think explain why this state of matter is used in artiﬁcial lights?
A: Plasma consists of charged particles called ions, so it conducts electric current and glows when electricity passes
through it. These properties explain why plasma is used in artiﬁcial lights.

Summary

• Plasma is a state of matter that lacks a ﬁxed volume and a ﬁxed shape and consists of charged particles called
ions. Because it consists of charged particles, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to a magnetic ﬁeld.
• The sun and other stars consist of plasma. Plasma is also found naturally in lightning and the northern and

2.16 Kinetic Theory of Matter

• State the kinetic theory of matter.
• Relate kinetic energy to state of matter.

This neat row of cola bottles represents matter in three different states—solid, liquid, and gas. The bottles and caps
are solids, the cola is a liquid, and carbon dioxide dissolved in the cola is a gas. It gives cola its ﬁzz. Solids, liquids,
and gases such as these have different properties. Solids have a ﬁxed shape and a ﬁxed volume. Liquids also have a
ﬁxed volume but can change their shape. Gases have neither a ﬁxed shape nor a ﬁxed volume. What explains these
differences in states of matter? The answer has to do with energy.

Moving Matter

Energy is the ability to cause changes in matter. For example, your body uses chemical energy when you lift your
arm or take a step. In both cases, energy is used to move matter—you. Any matter that is moving has energy just
because it’s moving. The energy of moving matter is called kinetic energy. Scientists think that the particles of all
matter are in constant motion. In other words, the particles of matter have kinetic energy. The theory that all matter
consists of constantly moving particles is called the kinetic theory of matter. You can learn more about the theory
at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agk7_D4-deY .

Kinetic Energy and States of Matter

Differences in kinetic energy explain why matter exists in different states. Particles of matter are attracted to each
other, so they tend to pull together. The particles can move apart only if they have enough kinetic energy to overcome

170

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter

this force of attraction. It’s like a tug of war between opposing sides, with the force of attraction between particles
on one side and the kinetic energy of individual particles on the other side. The outcome of the “war” determines
the state of matter.

• If particles do not have enough kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction between them, matter exists
as a solid. The particles are packed closely together and held rigidly in place. All they can do is vibrate. This
explains why solids have a ﬁxed volume and a ﬁxed shape.

• If particles have enough kinetic energy to partly overcome the force of attraction between them, matter exists
as a liquid. The particles can slide past one another but not pull apart completely. This explains why liquids
can change shape but have a ﬁxed volume.

• If particles have enough kinetic energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them, matter
exists as a gas. The particles can pull apart and spread out. This explains why gases have neither a ﬁxed
volume nor a ﬁxed shape.

Look at the Figure 2.35. It sums up visually the relationship between kinetic energy and state of matter. You can
see an animated diagram at this URL:
http://www.tutorvista.com/content/physics/physics-i/heat/kinetic-molecular-theory.php

FIGURE 2.35

Q: How could you use a bottle of cola to demonstrate these relationships between kinetic energy and state of matter?
A: You could shake a bottle of cola and then open it. Shaking causes carbon dioxide to come out of the cola solution
and change to a gas. The gas ﬁzzes out of the bottle and spreads into the surrounding air, showing that its particles
have enough kinetic energy to spread apart. Then you could tilt the open bottle and pour out a small amount of the
cola on a table, where it will form a puddle. This shows that particles of the liquid have enough kinetic energy to
slide over each other but not enough to pull apart completely. If you do nothing to the solid glass of the cola bottle,
it will remain the same size and shape. Its particles do not have enough energy to move apart or even to slide over
each other.

Summary

• According to the kinetic theory, particles of matter are in constant motion. The energy of motion is called

kinetic energy.

• The kinetic energy of particles of matter determines the state of matter. Particles of solids have the least kinetic

energy and particles of gases have the most.

• Deﬁne change of state.
• Identify processes that cause changes of state.
• Explain the role of energy in changes of state.

Both of these photos show the famous Golden Gate Bridge near San Francisco, California. The pictures were taken
from about the same point of view, but they look very different. In the picture on the left, the deck of the bridge is
almost completely hidden by a thick layer of fog. In the picture on the right the fog has disappeared, and the deck of
the bridge—as well as the water below it—is clearly visible. Fog consists of tiny droplets of liquid water. The fog
in the picture is like a cloud at ground level. Where did the fog come from, and where did it go?

What Are Changes of State?

The water droplets of fog form from water vapor in the air. Fog disappears when the water droplets change back to
water vapor. These changes are examples of changes of state. A change of state occurs whenever matter changes
from one state to another. Common states of matter on Earth are solid, liquid, and gas. Matter may change back and
forth between any two of these states.
Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not change matter’s chemical
makeup or chemical properties. For example, when fog changes to water vapor, it is still water and can change back
to liquid water again.

Processes that Cause Changes of State

Several processes are involved in common changes of state. They include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition,
condensation, and evaporation. The Figure 2.36 shows how matter changes in each of these processes.
Q: Which two processes result in matter changing to the solid state?
A: The processes are deposition, in which matter changes from a gas to a solid, and freezing, in which matter changes
from a liquid to a solid.

The Role of Energy in Changes of State

FIGURE 2.37

Q: What happened to the chocolate?
A: The chocolate melted. It changed from a solid to a liquid.
In order for solid chocolate to melt and change to a liquid, the particles of chocolate must gain energy. The chocolate
pictured in the Figure 2.37 gained energy from sunlight. Energy is the ability to cause changes in matter, and it is
always involved in changes of state. When matter changes from one state to another, it either absorbs energy—as
when chocolate melts—or loses energy. For example, if you were to place the melted chocolate in a refrigerator, it
would lose energy to the cold air inside the refrigerator. As a result, the liquid chocolate would change to a solid

again.
Q: Why is energy always involved in changes of state?
A: The energy of particles of matter determines the matter’s state. Particles of a gas have more energy than particles
of a liquid, and particles of a liquid have more energy than particles of a solid. Therefore, in order for matter to
change from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas, particles of matter must absorb energy. In order for matter
to change from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, particles of matter must lose energy.

Summary

• A change of state occurs whenever matter changes from one state to another. Changes of state are physical
changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not change matter’s chemical makeup or chemical
properties.

• Processes involved in changes of state include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and

evaporation.

• Energy is always involved in changes of state. Particles of matter either absorb or lose energy when matter

changes from one state to another.

The man in this photo is climbing a glacier. Ice climbing is a dangerous sport that should be attempted only by
highly experienced climbers. For one thing, ice is very slippery, which makes it harder than rock to grip. Clinging
to the slippery vertical surface takes strength, training, and the right equipment.

From Liquid to Solid

You don’t have to be an ice climber to enjoy ice. Skating and ﬁshing are two other sports that are also done on ice.
What is ice? It’s simply water in the solid state. The process in which water or any other liquid changes to a solid is
called freezing. Freezing occurs when a liquid cools to a point at which its particles no longer have enough energy
to overcome the force of attraction between them. Instead, the particles remain in ﬁxed positions, crowded closely
together, as shown in the Figure 2.38.

Freezing Point

The temperature at which a substance freezes is known as its freezing point. Freezing point is a physical property of
matter. The freezing point of pure water is 0°C. Below this temperature, water exists as ice. Above this temperature,
it exists as liquid water or water vapor. Many other substances have much lower or higher freezing points than

Q: What trend do you see in this table?
A: Substances in the table with freezing points lower than water are gases. Substances in the table with freezing
points higher than water are solids.
Q: Sodium is a solid at room temperature. Given this information, what can you infer about its freezing point?
A: You can infer that the freezing point of sodium must be higher than room temperature, which is about 20°C. The
freezing point of sodium is actually 98°C.

Summary

• Freezing is the process in which a liquid changes to a solid. It occurs when a liquid cools to a point at which

its particles no longer have enough energy to overcome the force of attraction between them.

The ﬁery red-orange “river” ﬂowing downhill in this photo isn’t water. It’s molten (melted) rock, and it’s erupting
from a volcano. Most rocks on Earth’s surface are solid objects. Why is the rock that erupts from a volcano in a
liquid state? How does rock change from a solid to a liquid?

From Solid to Liquid

The process in which rocks or other solids change to liquids is called melting. Melting occurs when particles of a
solid absorb enough energy to partly overcome the force of attraction holding them together. This allows them to
move out of their ﬁxed positions and slip over one another. Melting, like other changes of state, is a physical change
in matter, so it doesn’t change the chemical makeup or chemical properties of matter.
Q: The molten rock that erupts from a volcano comes from deep underground. How is this related to its liquid state?
A: It is always very hot deep underground where molten rock originates. The high temperatures give rock enough
energy to melt and remain in a molten state. Underground rock in this state is called magma.
Q: What happens to magma after it erupts and starts ﬂowing over the surface of the ground?
A: After magma erupts, it is called lava. On the surface, lava eventually cools and hardens to form solid rock.

Other substances that are normally solids on Earth can also be heated until they melt. You can see an example in
the Figure 2.39. The photo shows molten gold being poured into a mold. When the gold cools, it will harden into a
solid gold bar that has the same shape as the mold.

FIGURE 2.39

Melting Point

The temperature at which a substance melts is called its melting point. Melting point is a physical property of matter.
The gold pictured in the Figure 2.39, for example, has a melting point of 1064°C. This is a high melting point, and
most other metals also have high melting points. The melting point of ice, in comparison, is much lower at 0°C.
Many substances have even lower melting points. For example, the melting point of oxygen is -222°C.

Melting and Global Climate Change

Because of global climate change, temperatures all over Earth are rising. However, the melting points of Earth’s
substances, including ice, are constant. The result? Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate. Melting glaciers
cause rising sea levels and the risk of dangerous river ﬂooding on land. You can learn more about these effects of

• Contrast vaporization and evaporation.
• Deﬁne boiling point, and give the boiling point of water.

Why is steam rising from the spring in this picture? It’s because the water is boiling hot. The bubbles in the water
show that it is boiling. The water in the spring is hot enough to boil because it comes from an underground source
near hot molten rock.

Steam actually consists of tiny droplets of liquid water. What you can’t see in the picture is the water vapor that is
also present in the air above the spring. Water vapor is water in the gaseous state. It constantly rises up from the
surface of boiling hot water. Why? At high temperatures, particles of a liquid gain enough energy to completely
overcome the force of attraction between them, so they change to a gas. The gas forms bubbles that rise to the
surface of the liquid because gas is less dense than liquid. The bubbling up of the liquid is called boiling. When the
bubbles reach the surface, the gas escapes into the air. The entire process in which a liquid boils and changes to a
gas that escapes into the air is called vaporization. You can watch an animation of the process at this URL: http://w

Q: Why does steam form over the hot spring pictured above?
A: Steam forms when some of the water vapor from the boiling water cools in the air and condenses to form droplets
of liquid water.

Vaporization vs. Evaporation

www.ck12.org

Vaporization is easily confused with evaporation, but the two processes are not the same. Evaporation also changes
a liquid to a gas, but it doesn’t involve boiling. Instead, evaporation occurs when particles at the surface of a liquid
gain enough energy to escape into the air. This happens without the liquid becoming hot enough to boil.

Boiling Point

The temperature at which a substance boils and changes to a gas is called its boiling point. Boiling point is a physical
property of matter. The boiling point of pure water is 100°C. Other substances may have higher or lower boiling
points. Several examples are listed in the Table 2.5. Pure water is included in the table for comparison.

Q: Assume you want to get the salt (sodium chloride) out of salt water. Based on information in the table, how could
you do it?
A: You could heat the salt water to 101°C. The water would boil and vaporize but the salt would not. Instead, the
salt would be left behind as solid particles.
Q: Oxygen is a gas at room temperature (20°C). What does this tell you about its boiling point?
A: The boiling point of oxygen must be lower than 20°C. Otherwise, it would be a liquid at room temperature.

The clothes on this clothesline are soaking wet, but before too long they will be completely dry. How does this
happen? Where does the water go? And what factors might help the clothes on the line dry more quickly?

From Liquid to Gas Without Boiling

Evaporation explains why clothes dry on a clothesline. Evaporation is the process in which a liquid changes to a gas
without becoming hot enough to boil. It occurs when individual liquid particles at the exposed surface of the liquid
absorb just enough energy to overcome the force of attraction with other liquid particles. If the surface particles are
moving in the right direction, they will pull away from the liquid and move into the air. This is illustrated in the
Figure 2.40.

Factors That Affect the Rate of Evaporation

Many factors inﬂuence how quickly a liquid evaporates. They include:

• temperature of the liquid. A cup of hot water will evaporate more quickly than a cup of cold water.
• exposed surface area of the liquid. The same amount of water will evaporate more quickly in a wide shallow

bowl than in a tall narrow glass.

• presence or absence of other substances in the liquid. Pure water will evaporate more quickly than salt water.
• air movement. Clothes on a clothesline will dry more quickly on a windy day than on a still day.
• concentration of the evaporating substance in the air. Clothes will dry more quickly when air contains little

water vapor.

With the interactive animation at the URL below, you can explore how three of these factors affect the rate of
evaporation of water.

Evaporative Cooling

Did you ever notice that moving air cools you down when you’re hot and sweaty? For example, if you sit in front
of a fan, you feel cooler. That’s because moving air helps to evaporate the sweat on your skin. But why does the
evaporation of sweat cool you down? When a liquid such as sweat evaporates, energetic particles on the surface of
the liquid escape into the air. After these particles leave, the remaining liquid has less energy, so it is cooler. This is
called evaporative cooling.

FIGURE 2.41

Q: On a hot day, high humidity makes you feel even hotter. Can you explain why?
A: Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. When humidity is high, sweat evaporates more
slowly because there is already a lot of water vapor in the air. The slower evaporation rate reduces the potential for
evaporative cooling.

• Describe how condensation occurs.
• Relate dew point to condensation.
• Identify the role of condensation in the water cycle.

This beautiful beaded net is something very common in nature: a spider web. The “beads” on the spider web are
actually drops of water. The drops of water are not raindrops, and they weren’t there on the previous day. Where did
they come from?

From Gas to Liquid

The drops of water on the spider web are dewdrops. They formed overnight when warm moist air came into contact
with the cooler spider web. Contact with the cooler web cooled the air. When air cools, it can hold less water
vapor, so some of the water vapor in the air changed to liquid water. The process in which water vapor—or another
gas—changes to a liquid is called condensation. Another common example of condensation is pictured in the
Figure 2.42. You can read more about condensation at this URL: http://www.kidsgeo.com/geography-for-kids/01
07-condensation.php

Dew Point

When air is very humid, it doesn’t have to cool very much for water vapor in the air to start condensing. The
temperature at which condensation occurs is called the dew point. The dew point varies depending on air temperature
and moisture content. It is always less than or equal to the actual air temperature, but warmer air and moister air
have dew points closer to the actual air temperature. That’s why glasses of cold drinks “sweat” more on a hot, humid
day than they do on a cool, dry day. For more details on the dew point, read the short article at this URL: http://w

Q: What happens when air temperature reaches the dew point?
A: When air temperature reaches the dew point, water vapor starts condensing. It may form dew (as on the spider
web in the opening image), clouds, or fog. Dew forms on solid objects on the ground. Clouds form on tiny particles
in the air high above the ground. Fog is a cloud that forms on tiny particles in the air close to the ground.

condensation in the water cycle Figure 2.44. It changes water vapor in the atmosphere to liquid water that can fall
to Earth again. Without condensation, the water cycle would be interrupted and Earth’s water could not recycle.
Q: In the water cycle, what happens to water after it condenses?
A: After water condenses, it may form clouds that produce precipitation such as rain.

• State conditions under which sublimation of snow or ice occurs.

Rock bands often use special stage effects, like the fake fog in this picture. Real fog forms when water vapor in
the air condenses into tiny droplets of water. The fake fog shown here formed when solid carbon dioxide changed
directly to carbon dioxide gas.

How Sublime!

Solid carbon dioxide is also called dry ice. That’s because when it gets warmer and changes state, it doesn’t change
to a liquid by melting. Instead, it changes directly to a gas without going through the liquid state. The process in
which a solid changes directly to a gas is called sublimation. It occurs when energy is added to a solid such as dry
ice. You can watch dry ice changing directly to a gas in the video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J

• Deﬁne the change of state called deposition
• Describe examples of deposition in nature.

The leaf-like pattern on the glass pictured here is as beautiful as any work of art. It formed on a windowpane on a
very cold winter night. Do you know how it formed? The answer is deposition.

What Is Deposition?

Deposition refers to the process in which a gas changes directly to a solid without going through the liquid state.
For example, when warm moist air inside a house comes into contact with a freezing cold windowpane, water vapor
in the air changes to tiny ice crystals. The ice crystals are deposited on the glass, often in beautiful patterns like the
“leaves” on the window above. Be aware that deposition has a different meaning in Earth science than in chemistry.
In Earth science, deposition refers to the dropping of sediments by wind or water, rather than to a change of state.

Examples of Deposition in Nature

Deposition as a change of state often occurs in nature. For example, when warm moist air comes into contact with
very cold surfaces—such as the ground or objects on the ground—ice crystals are deposited on them. These ice
crystals are commonly called frost. Look at the dead leaf and blades of grass in the Figure 2.46. They are covered
with frost. If you look closely, you can see the individual crystals of ice. You can watch a demonstration of frost

2.24. Deposition

forming on the side of a very cold can at the URL below. (Click on the mulitmedia choice “Ice on a Can.”). The
ice in the can has been cooled to a very low temperature by adding salt to it. If you want to do the demonstration
yourself, follow the procedure at the URL. http://www.middleschoolchemistry.com/lessonplans/chapter2/lesson4

FIGURE 2.46

Q: In places with very cold winters, why might frost be more likely to form on the ground in the fall than in the
winter?
A: Frost forms when the air is warmer than the ground. This is more likely to be the case in the fall. In the winter,
the air is likely to be as cold as the ground.
Deposition also occurs high above the ground when water vapor in the air changes to ice crystals. In the atmosphere,
the ice crystals are deposited on tiny dust particles. These ice crystals form clouds, generally cirrus clouds, which
are thin and wispy. You can see cirrus clouds in the Figure 2.47.

FIGURE 2.47

Q: Cirrus clouds form only at altitudes of 6 kilometers or higher above sea level. Do you know why?
A: At this altitude, the atmosphere is always very cold. Unless the air is cold, water vapor will condense to form
water droplets instead of ice crystals.

Summary

• In chemistry, deposition refers to the process in which a gas changes directly to a solid without going through

the liquid state.

• Examples of deposition in nature include frost forming on the ground and cirrus clouds forming high in the

atmosphere.

2.25 Boyle’s Law

• State how popping bubble wrap demonstrates Boyle’s law.
• Explain why pressure goes up when gas molecules crowd into a smaller space.

Are you one of those people who can’t resist popping the bubbles of bubble wrap? As annoying as it might be to the
people around you, do you just love to squeeze those little plastic bubbles? Before the bubbles pop, the air pressing
against the inside of the bubbles inﬂates them like tiny balloons. When you pop the bubbles, most of the air rushes
out.

Pop Goes the Bubble!

What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientiﬁc law,
called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions.
Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and
pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law, if the
temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa.
That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles’ volume, so the air
pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.

“Father” Boyle

Boyle’s law is named for Robert Boyle, the English scientist who discovered this relationship between gas volume
and pressure. Boyle based the law on his own controlled experiments. He published his results, along with detailed
descriptions of his procedures and observations, in the 1660s. These steps were unheard of in his day. Mainly
because of his careful research and the details he provided about it, Boyle has been called the “father of modern
chemistry.”

It’s Crowded in Here

Chapter 2. Matter

Imagine a container of gas molecules like the one in the Figure 2.49. The container in the sketch has a lid that
can be pushed down to shrink the volume of the gas inside. Notice what happens as the lid is lowered. The gas
molecules crowd closer together because there is less space for them to occupy and they have nowhere else to go.
Gas molecules have a lot of energy. They are always moving and bouncing off each other and anything else in their
path. When gas molecules bump into things, it creates pressure. Pressure is greater when gas molecules occupy a
smaller space, because the greater crowding results in more collisions. In other words, decreasing the volume of a
gas increases its pressure. If you go to the URL below, you can watch a simulation of this.
http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/aboyle.html

FIGURE 2.49

You Go Up and I’ll Go Down

As the volume of gas in the container pictured in the Figure 2.49 gets smaller, the pressure of the gas molecules
becomes greater. When two variables change in opposite directions like this, the variables have an inverse, or
“upside-down,” relationship.
Q: How could you show an inverse relationship with a graph? Sketch a graph to show what the relationship between
gas volume and pressure might look like. Let the x-axis represent volume (V) and the y-axis represent pressure (P).
A: Did you sketch a graph like the one in the Figure 2.50? Let’s see why this graph is correct. Find the point on the
line where volume is smallest. That’s were pressure is highest. Then ﬁnd the point where volume is largest. That’s

197

where pressure is lowest. Whenever you see a graph with this shape, it usually represents variables that have an
inverse relationship, like gas volume and pressure.

FIGURE 2.50

Summary

• Boyle’s law states that if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas

increases its pressure.

• When gas molecules bump into things, it creates pressure. Pressure is greater when gas molecules occupy a
smaller space, because greater crowding results in more collisions. This explains why decreasing the volume

2.26 Charles’ Law

• Describe how the volume of a gas is related to its temperature.
• Explain what happens to gas particles when they are heated.

In the 1700s and 1800s, hot air balloons were very popular. Why wouldn’t they be? Riding in a hot air balloon
allowed people to travel through the air and get a bird’s eye view of the landscape at a time when airplanes did not
yet exist. Do you know why hot air can inﬂate a balloon? Read on to ﬁnd out.

Up, Up, and Away

The popularity of hot air balloons got scientists thinking about gases and what happens to them when they heat
up. In the early 1800s, two French scientists—Jacques Charles and Joseph Gay-Lussac—decided to investigate
how changes in the temperature of a gas affect the amount of space it takes up, or its volume. They heated air and
measured how its volume changed. The two scientists already knew that the pressure of a gas affects it volume.
This had been demonstrated back in the 1660s by the English scientist Robert Boyle. So Charles and Gay-Lussac
controlled the effects of pressure by keeping it constant in their experiments.
Based on the results of the research, Charles developed a scientiﬁc law about gases. It is one of three well-known
gas laws, the others being Boyle’s law and Amontons’ law. According to Charles’ law, when the pressure of a gas is
held constant, increasing its temperature increases its volume. The opposite is also true: decreasing the temperature
of a gas decreases it volume.

Q: What does the graph of the data look like?
A: The graph is a straight line that rises from left to right. This type of graph shows that both variables increase
together at a constant rate.
Q: Could you use the graph to ﬁnd the volume of a gas at a temperature you didn’t choose for your data table?
A: Yes, you could. You could ﬁnd the temperature on the temperature scale, trace straight up from this point to the
graph line, and then trace straight across to the volume scale to ﬁnd the volume for that temperature.

Amazing Motion

Can you guess why the volume of a gas increases when it is heated? Heating a gas gives its particles more energy.
With more energy, the particles move faster. You can see this in the simulation at the URL below. Drag the bar to
increase the temperature, and you’ll be amazed at how fast the particles zigzag around inside the box! If the speedy
particles had more room, they would spread out and the volume of the gas would increase. http://www.colorado.
edu/UCB/AcademicAffairs/ArtsSciences/physics/PhysicsInitiative/Physics2000/bec/temperature.html
Q: Now that you know how a gas behaves when it is heated, can you explain how hot air causes a balloon to inﬂate?
A: As the air heats, its particles spread out and occupy more space, causing the balloon to inﬂate.

Summary

• According to Charles’ law, when the pressure of a gas is held constant, increasing its temperature increases its

volume.

• Heating a gas gives its particles more energy so they move faster. If the speedy particles have room to spread

out, the volume of the gas will increase.

2.27 Amontons’ Law

• State Amontons’ law.
• Explain why the pressure of a ﬁxed volume of gas increases as the gas heats up.

Lawrence checked the air pressure in one of his tires before driving to school on a cold winter day. The tire pressure
gauge registered 32 pounds of force per square inch. After making the 10-mile trip to school, Lawrence checked the
air pressure again. This time the gauge registered 34 pounds of force per square inch. Lawrence didn’t add any air
to the tire in between the two measurements, so why did air pressure in the tire increase?

Keep on Rolling

There was no additional air in the tire the second time Lawrence checked the air pressure, but something did change
between the two measurements. The tires had rolled over 10 miles of road on the trip to school. Any time one
surface moves over another, it causes friction. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are
touching, and friction between two surfaces always generates heat. Quickly rub your hands together and you’ll feel
the heat generated by the friction between them. As the tires moved over the road, friction between the tires and
road generated heat. In short, the tires got warmer and so did the air inside them.

It’s the Law!

The space inside a car tire is more-or-less ﬁxed, so it has a constant volume. What happens when the volume of air
is constant and its temperature increases? Lawrence found out the answer to that question when he measured the air
pressure in his tire. Increasing the temperature of a gas such as air, while holding its volume constant, increases the

203

2.27. Amontons’ Law

www.ck12.org

pressure of the gas. This relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas is called Amontons’ law. It was
ﬁrst proposed by a French scientist named Guillaume Amontons in the late 1600s. Amontons’ gas law is just one of
three commonly known gas laws. The other two are Boyle’s law and Charles’ law.
Q: How does Amontons’ gas law explain the difference in air pressure in Lawrence’s tire?
A: The tire—and the air inside it—got warmer because of friction with the road. The volume of air inside the tire
was more-or-less constant, so the pressure of the air increased when it got warmer.

Particle Pressure

Why does the pressure of a gas increase as it gets warmer? Particles of a gas are constantly moving and bumping
into things. The force of the collisions is measured by pressure. Pressure is the amount of force exerted on a given
area, such as pounds of force per square inch. When gas particles heat up and gain energy, they move faster. This
causes more collisions and greater pressure. Therefore, heating particles of gas in a closed space causes the pressure
of the gas to increase. Explore the behavior of gas particles at different temperatures at the following URL. Change
the temperature of the gas and watch what happens to its particles.
http://www.chm.davidson.edu/vce/kineticmoleculartheory/PT.html
Q: Look at the graph in the simulation above as you change the temperature of the gas. What happens to the pressure
of the gas as its temperature increases?
A: In the graph, the pressure of the gas increases as its temperature increases.

Summary

• According to Amontons’ law, increasing the temperature of a gas while holding its volume constant increases

the pressure of the gas.

• When gas particles heat up and gain energy, they move faster. This increases their collisions with each other

and their container, causing greater pressure.

2.28 Atoms

• Describe atoms and how they are related to elements.
• Identify the three main subatomic particles that make up atoms.

What could this hilly blue surface possibly be? Do you have any idea? The answer is a single atom of the element
Cobalt. The picture was created using a scanning tunneling microscope. No other microscope can make images of
things as small as atoms. How small are atoms? You will ﬁnd out in this lesson.

What Are Atoms?

Atoms are the building blocks of matter. They are the smallest particles of an element that still have the element’s
properties. Elements, in turn, are pure substances—such as nickel, hydrogen, and helium—that make up all kinds
of matter. All the atoms of a given element are identical in that they have the same number of protons, one of
the building blocks of atoms (see below). They are also different from the atoms of all other elements, as atoms
of different elements have different number of protons. For an entertaining introduction to atoms by Bill Nye the

Size of Atoms

www.ck12.org

Unlike bricks, atoms are extremely small. The radius of an atom is well under 1 nanometer, which is one-billionth
of a meter. If a size that small is hard to imagine, consider this: trillions of atoms would ﬁt inside the period at
the end of this sentence. Although all atoms are very small, elements vary in the size of their atoms. The Figure
2.54 compares the sizes of atoms of more than 40 different elements. The elements in the ﬁgure are represented
by chemical symbols, such as H for hydrogen and He for helium. Of course, real atoms are much smaller than the
circles representing them in the Figure 2.54.

FIGURE 2.54

Q: Which element in the Figure 2.54 has the biggest atoms?
A: The element in the ﬁgure with the biggest atoms is cesium (Cs).

Subatomic Particles

Although atoms are very tiny, they consist of even smaller particles. Three main types of particles that make up all
atoms are:

• protons, which have a positive electric charge.
• electrons, which have a negative electric charge.
• neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge.

The model in the Figure 2.55 shows how these particles are arranged in an atom. The particular atom represented
by the model is helium, but the particles of all atoms are arranged in the same way. At the center of the atom is
a dense area called the nucleus, where all the protons and neutrons are clustered closely together. The electrons
constantly move around the nucleus. Helium has two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus and two electrons
moving around the nucleus. Atoms of other elements have different numbers of subatomic particles, but the number
of protons always equals the number of electrons. This makes atoms neutral in charge because the positive and
negative charges “cancel out.”

Q: All atoms of carbon have six protons. How many electrons do carbon atoms have?
A: Carbon atoms must have six electrons to “cancel out” the positive charges of the six protons. That’s because
atoms are always neutral in electric charge.

2.29 Atomic Nucleus

• Identify the nucleus of the atom.
• Describe the size and mass of the nucleus.
• Explain what holds the nucleus together.

An atomic bomb explodes and generates a huge mushroom cloud. The tremendous energy released when the bomb
explodes is incredibly destructive. Where does all the energy come from? The answer is the nucleus of the atom.

At the Heart of It All

The nucleus (plural, nuclei) is a positively charged region at the center of the atom. It consists of two types of
subatomic particles packed tightly together. The particles are protons, which have a positive electric charge, and
neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge. Outside of the nucleus, an atom is mostly empty space, with orbiting
negative particles called electrons whizzing through it. The Figure 2.57 shows these parts of the atom.

Size and Mass of the Nucleus

The nucleus of the atom is extremely small. Its radius is only about 1/100,000 of the total radius of the atom. If an
atom were the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a pea! You can see another sports

Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of mass for their size. As a result, the nucleus
has virtually all the mass of an atom. Given its great mass and tiny size, the nucleus is very dense. If an object the
size of a penny had the same density as the nucleus of an atom, its mass would be greater than 30 million tons! You

Holding It All Together

Particles with opposite electric charges attract each other. This explains why negative electrons orbit the positive
nucleus. Particles with the same electric charge repel each other. This means that the positive protons in the nucleus
push apart from one another. So why doesn’t the nucleus ﬂy apart? An even stronger force—called the strong

Q: Can you guess why an atomic bomb releases so much energy when it explodes?
A: When an atomic bomb explodes, the nuclei of atoms undergo a process called ﬁssion, in which they split apart.
This releases the huge amount of energy that was holding together subatomic particles in the nucleus.

Summary

• The nucleus is a small, dense region at the center of the atom. It consists of positive protons and neutral

neutrons, so it has an overall positive charge.

• The nucleus is just a tiny part of the atom, but it contains virtually all of the atom’s mass.
• The strong nuclear force holds together protons and neutrons in the nucleus and overcomes the electric force

of repulsion between protons.

This glowing sphere represents the sun, which has a diameter of 1.4 × 109 meters. The sun has a special relationship

is the gigantic sun related to the extremely tiny proton? Read on to ﬁnd out.

What Is a Proton?

A proton is one of three main particles that make up the atom. The other two particles are the neutron and electron.
Protons are found in the nucleus of the atom. This is a tiny, dense region at the center of the atom. Protons have
a positive electrical charge of one (+1) and a mass of 1 atomic mass unit (amu), which is about 1.67 × 10−27
kilograms. Together with neutrons, they make up virtually all of the mass of an atom. For an excellent video on

Q: How do you think the sun is related to protons?
A: The sun’s tremendous energy is the result of proton interactions. In the sun, as well as in other stars, protons from
hydrogen atoms combine, or fuse, to form nuclei of helium atoms. This fusion reaction releases a huge amount of
energy and takes place in nature only at the extremely high temperatures of stars such as the sun.

Identical Protons, Different Elements

All protons are identical. For example, hydrogen protons are exactly the same as protons of helium and all other
elements, or pure substances. However, atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons. In fact,
atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all
other elements. For example, a hydrogen atom has just one proton, whereas a helium atom has two protons. The
number of protons in an atom determines the electrical charge of the nucleus. The nucleus also contains neutrons,
but they are neutral in charge. The one proton in a hydrogen nucleus, for example, gives it a charge of +1, and the
two protons in a helium nucleus give it a charge of +2. To learn more about the relationship between protons and
elements, go to this URL:

Q: There are six protons in each atom of carbon. What is the electrical charge of a carbon nucleus?
A: The electrical charge of a carbon nucleus is +6.

What Are Protons Made of?

Protons are made of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons. As you can see in the Figure 2.58, a proton
contains three quarks (colored circles) and three streams of gluons (wavy white lines). Two of the quarks are
called up quarks (u), and the third quark is called a down quark (d). The gluons carry the strong nuclear force
between quarks, binding them together. This force is needed to overcome the electric force of repulsion between
positive protons. Although protons were discovered almost 100 years ago, the quarks and gluons inside them were
discovered much more recently. Scientists are still learning more about these fundamental particles. You can take
an animated tour of the atom, including protons and their fundamental particles, at this URL: http://education.jlab.or

that with the 1.4-million-kilometer diameter of our own sun. Despite its small size, however, this star has greater
mass than the sun, making it incredibly dense. It also has tremendous gravity. In fact, gravity on its surface is about
2 × 1011 times the gravity we feel on Earth! What type of star is it? It’s called a neutron star. That’s because it

What Is a Neutron?

A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom. The other two particles are the proton and electron.
Atoms of all elements—except for most atoms of hydrogen—have neutrons in their nucleus. The nucleus is the
small, dense region at the center of an atom where protons are also found. Atoms generally have about the same
number of neutrons as protons. For example, all carbon atoms have six protons and most also have six neutrons.

The mass of a neutron is slightly greater than the mass of a proton, which is 1 atomic mass unit (amu). (An atomic

Same Element, Different Numbers of Neutrons

All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons. The number of neutrons, however,
may vary for atoms of the same element. For example, almost 99 percent of carbon atoms have six neutrons, but
the rest have either seven or eight neutrons. Atoms of an element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called
isotopes. The nuclei of these isotopes of carbon are shown in the Figure 2.60. The isotope called carbon-14 is used
to ﬁnd the ages of fossils. You can learn how at this URL: http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth

FIGURE 2.60

Q: Notice the names of the carbon isotopes in the diagram. Based on this example, infer how isotopes of an element
are named.
A: Isotopes of an element are named for their total number of protons and neutrons.
Q: The element oxygen has 8 protons. How many protons and neutrons are there in oxygen-17?
A: Oxygen-17—like all atoms of oxygen—has 8 protons. Its name provides the clue that it has a total of 17 protons
and neutrons. Therefore, it must have 9 neutrons (8 + 9 = 17).

Particles in Neutrons

Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons. Each neutron contains three quarks, as
shown in the diagram below. Two of the quarks are called down quarks (d) and the third quark is called an up quark
(u). Gluons (represented by wavy black lines in the diagram) are fundamental particles that are given off or absorbed
by quarks. They carry the strong nuclear force that holds together quarks in a neutron.

Summary

• A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom. It is found in the nucleus and is neutral in
electric charge. It has about the same mass and diameter as a proton. Neutrons are found in all atoms except
for most atoms of hydrogen.

• All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons, but they may vary in their
numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.

electrons.

What Are Electrons?

Electrons are one of three main types of particles that make up atoms. The other two types are protons and neutrons.
Unlike protons and neutrons, which consist of smaller, simpler particles, electrons are fundamental particles that do
not consist of smaller particles. They are a type of fundamental particles called leptons. All leptons have an electric

Properties of Electrons

Chapter 2. Matter

Electrons are extremely small. The mass of an electron is only about 1/2000 the mass of a proton or neutron, so
electrons contribute virtually nothing to the total mass of an atom. Electrons have an electric charge of -1, which is
equal but opposite to the charge of proton, which is +1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons, so
the positive and negative charges “cancel out,” making atoms electrically neutral.

Where Are Electrons?

Unlike protons and neutrons, which are located inside the nucleus at the center of the atom, electrons are found
outside the nucleus. Because opposite electric charges attract each other, negative electrons are attracted to the
positive nucleus. This force of attraction keeps electrons constantly moving through the otherwise empty space
around the nucleus. The Figure 2.61 is a common way to represent the structure of an atom. It shows the electron
as a particle orbiting the nucleus, similar to the way that planets orbit the sun.

FIGURE 2.61

Orbitals

The atomic model in the Figure 2.61 is useful for some purposes, but it’s too simple when it comes to the location
of electrons. In reality, it’s impossible to say what path an electron will follow. Instead, it’s only possible to describe
the chances of ﬁnding an electron in a certain region around the nucleus. The region where an electron is most likely
to be is called an orbital. Each orbital can have at most two electrons. Some orbitals, called S orbitals, are shaped
like spheres, with the nucleus in the center. An S orbital is pictured in Figure 2.62. Where the dots are denser,
the chance of ﬁnding an electron is greater. Also pictured in Figure 2.62 is a P orbital. P orbitals are shaped like

FIGURE 2.62

Q: How many electrons can there be in each type of orbital shown in the Figure 2.62?
A: There can be a maximum of two electrons in any orbital, regardless of its shape.
Q: Where is the nucleus in each orbital?
A: The nucleus is at the center of each orbital. It is in the middle of the sphere in the S orbital and in the pinched
part of the P orbital.

What’s Your Energy Level?

Electrons are located at ﬁxed distances from the nucleus, called energy levels. You can see the ﬁrst three energy
levels in the Figure 2.63. The diagram also shows the maximum possible number of electrons at each energy level.

• Electrons at lower energy levels, which are closer to the nucleus, have less energy. At the lowest energy level,

which has the least energy, there is just one orbital, so this energy level has a maximum of two electrons.

• Only when a lower energy level is full are electrons added to the next higher energy level. Electrons at higher
energy levels, which are farther from the nucleus, have more energy. They also have more orbitals and greater
possible numbers of electrons.

• Electrons at the outermost energy level of an atom are called valence electrons. They determine many of
the properties of an element. That’s because these electrons are involved in chemical reactions with other
atoms. Atoms may share or transfer valence electrons. Shared electrons bind atoms together to form chemical
compounds.

FIGURE 2.63

A: The atom will have two electrons at the ﬁrst energy level, eight at the second energy level, and the remaining two
at the third energy level.
Q: Sometimes, an electron jumps from one energy level to another. How do you think this happens?
A: To change energy levels, an electron must either gain or lose energy. That’s because electrons at higher energy
levels have more energy than electrons at lower energy levels.

Summary

• Electrons are one of three main types of particles that make up the atom. They are extremely small and have

an electric charge of -1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons.

• Negative electrons are attracted to the positive nucleus. This force of attraction keeps electrons constantly

moving around the nucleus. The region where an electron is most likely to be found is called an orbital.

• Electrons are located at ﬁxed distances from the nucleus, called energy levels. Electrons at lower energy levels

have less energy than electrons at higher energy levels

The Search for Fundamental Particles

Scientists have long wanted to ﬁnd the most basic building blocks of the universe. They asked, “what are the
fundamental particles of matter that cannot be subdivided into smaller, simpler particles,” and “what holds these

particles together?” The quest for fundamental particles began thousands of years ago. Scientists thought they had
ﬁnally found them when John Dalton discovered the atom in 1803 (see the timeline in Table 2.7). The word atom
means “indivisible,” and Dalton thought that the atom could not be divided into smaller, simpler particles.

For almost 100 years after Dalton discovered atoms, they were accepted as the fundamental particles of matter. But
starting in the late 1890s with the discovery of electrons, particles smaller and simpler than atoms were identiﬁed.
Within a few decades, protons and neutrons were also discovered. Ultimately, hundreds of subatomic particles were
found. You can learn how such tiny particles are discovered by watching the video at this URL: http://www.ehow.

Leptons and Quarks and Bosons, Oh My!

Today, scientists think that electrons truly are fundamental particles that cannot be broken down into smaller, simpler
particles. They are a type of fundamental particles called leptons. Protons and neutrons, on the other hand, are no
longer thought to be fundamental particles. Instead, they are now thought to consist of smaller, simpler particles of
matter called quarks. Scientists theorize that leptons and quarks are held together by yet another type of fundamental
particles called bosons. All three types of fundamental particles—leptons, quarks, and bosons—are described below.
The following Figure 2.64 shows the variety of particles of each type.

FIGURE 2.64

• There are six types of quarks. In ordinary matter, virtually all quarks are of the types called up and down
quarks. All quarks have mass, and they have an electric charge of either +2/3 or -1/3. For example, up quarks
have a charge of +2/3, and down quarks have a charge of -1/3. Quarks also have a different type of charge,
called color charge, although it has nothing to do with the colors that we see. Quarks are never found alone
but instead always occur in groups of two or three quarks.

• There are also six types of leptons, including electrons. Leptons have an electric charge of either -1 or 0.
Electrons, for example, have a charge of -1. Leptons have mass, although the mass of electrons is extremely
small.

• There are four known types of bosons, which are force-carrying particles. Each of these bosons carries a
different fundamental force between interacting particles. In addition, there is a particle which may exist,
called the "Higgs Boson", which gives objects the masses they have. Some types of bosons have mass; others
are massless. Bosons have an electric charge of +1, -1, or 0.

Q: Protons consist of three quarks: two up quarks and one down quark. Neutrons also consist of three quarks: two
down quarks and one up quark. Based on this information, what is the total electric charge of a proton? Of a neutron?
A: These combinations of quarks give protons a total electric charge of +1 (2/3 + 2/3 –1/3 = 1) and neutrons a total
electric charge of 0 (2/3 –1/3 –1/3 = 0).

Force-Carrying Particles

The interactions of matter particles are subject to four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetic force, weak
nuclear force, and strong nuclear force. All of these forces are thought to be transmitted by bosons, the force-

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter

carrying fundamental particles. The different types of bosons and the forces they carry are shown in Table 2.8.
Consider the examples of gluons, the bosons that carry the strong nuclear force. A continuous exchange of gluons
between quarks binds them together in both protons and neutrons. Note that force-carrying particles for gravity
(gravitons) have not yet been found.

Q: Which type of boson carries force between the negative electrons and positive protons of an atom?
A: Photons carry electromagnetic force. They are responsible for the force of attraction or repulsion between all
electrically charged matter, including the force of attraction between negative electrons and positive protons in an
atom.
Q: Gravitons have not yet been discovered so they have only been hypothesized to exist. What evidence do you think
leads scientists to think that these hypothetical particles affect both leptons and quarks and that they carry force over
all distances?
A: Gravity is known to affect all matter that has mass, and both quarks and leptons have mass. Gravity is also known
to work over long as well as short distances. For example, Earth’s gravity keeps you ﬁrmly planted on the ground
and also keeps the moon orbiting around the planet.

The Standard Model

Based on their knowledge of subatomic particles, scientists have developed a theory called the standard model to
explain all the matter in the universe and how it is held together. The model includes only the fundamental particles
in the Table 2.8. No other particles are needed to explain all kinds of matter. According to the model, all known
matter consists of quarks and leptons that interact by exchanging bosons, which transmit fundamental forces. The
standard model is a good theory because all of its predictions have been veriﬁed by experimental data. However,
the model doesn’t explain everything, including the force of gravity and why matter has mass. Scientists continue
to search for evidence that will allow them to explain these aspects of force and matter as well. You can learn much
more about the standard model at the URL below. Click on “the standard model” and follow the sequence titled
“What is fundamental?”

Summary

• For centuries, scientists searched for the fundamental particles of matter and the “glue” that holds them
together. At ﬁrst, scientists thought that atoms were the fundamental particles. Now they know that there
are smaller, simpler particles than atoms that make up matter and carry the forces that hold matter together.

• Protons and neutrons are made up of fundamental particles of matter called quarks. Electrons are another type
of fundamental particles of matter called leptons. Bosons are fundamental particles that carry forces between
fundamental particles of matter.

• Scientists think that a different type of boson carries each of the four fundamental forces in the universe (strong

and weak nuclear forces, electromagnetic force, and gravity).

• The standard model is a simple theory that explains all the matter in the universe and its interactions (except
for the mass of matter and the force of gravity). According to the standard model, all known matter consists
of quarks and leptons, which interact by exchanging force-carrying particles called bosons.

2.34 Atomic Forces

• Describe electromagnetic forces within the atom.
• Explain how the strong nuclear force holds the nucleus together.
• Outline how the weak nuclear force changes atoms.

You’ve probably used items like those pictured here. What do all of them have in common? They are all used to hold
things together. However, they do so in different ways. Like these different kinds of fasteners, there are different
kinds of “fasteners” that hold together the subatomic particles inside atoms. The “fasteners” are called forces, and
there are three different kinds of them at work inside the atom: electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, and
weak nuclear force. For an introduction to these forces inside the atom, see the colorful tutorial at this URL: http
://www.ric.edu/faculty/ptiskus/Atomic_Force/ .

Electromagnetic Force

Electromagnetic force is a force of attraction or repulsion between all electrically charged particles. This force is
transferred between charged particles of matter by fundamental force-carrying particles called photons. Because of
electromagnetic force, particles with opposite charges attract each other and particles with the same charge repel
each other.

233

2.34. Atomic Forces

www.ck12.org

Inside the atom, two types of subatomic particles have electric charge: electrons, which have an electric charge of
-1, and protons, which have an opposite but equal electric charge of +1. The model of an atom in the Figure 2.65
shows both types of charged particles. Protons are found inside the nucleus at the center of the atom, and they give
the nucleus a positive charge. (There are also neutrons in the nucleus, but they have no electric charge.) Negative
electrons stay in the area surrounding the positive nucleus because of the electromagnetic force of attraction between
them.

FIGURE 2.65

Q: Why do you think protons cluster together in the nucleus of the atom instead of repelling each other because of
their like charges?
A: The electromagnetic force of repulsion between positively charged protons is overcome by a stronger force,
called the strong nuclear force.

Strong Nuclear Force

The strong nuclear force is a force of attraction between fundamental particles called quarks, which have a type of
charge called color charge. The strong nuclear force is transferred between quarks by fundamental force-carrying
particles called gluons. Both protons and neutrons consist of quarks. The exchange of gluons holds quarks together
within a proton or neutron. Excess, or residual, strong force holds together protons and neutrons in the nucleus.
The strong nuclear force is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force of repulsion pushing protons apart.
Both forces are represented in the Figure 2.66.
The strong nuclear force works only over very short distances. As a result, it isn’t effective if the nucleus gets too
big. As more protons are added to the nucleus, the electromagnetic force of repulsion between them gets stronger,
while the strong nuclear force of attraction between them gets weaker. This puts an upper limit on the number of
protons an atom can have and remain stable. If atoms have more than 83 protons, the electromagnetic repulsion
between them is greater than the strong nuclear force of attraction between them. This makes the nucleus unstable,

Weak Nuclear Force

The weak nuclear force is transferred by the exchange of force-carrying fundamental particles called W and Z
bosons. This force is also a very short-range force that works only within the nucleus of the atom. It is much weaker
than the strong force or electromagnetic force that are also at work inside the atom. Unlike these other two forces,
the weak nuclear force does not bind subatomic particles together in an atom. Instead, it changes subatomic particles
from one type to another. The Figure 2.67 shows one way this can happen. In this ﬁgure, an up quark in a proton is
changed by the weak force to a down quark. This changes the proton (uud) to a neutron (udd).

A: The resulting atom represents a different element. That’s because each element has a unique number of protons.
For example, all atoms of helium have two protons. If one of the protons in a helium atom changes to a neutron, the
resulting atom would have just one proton, so the atom would no longer be a helium atom. Instead it would be a
hydrogen atom, because all hydrogen atoms have a single proton.

Summary

• The electromagnetic force of attraction between negative electrons and positive protons in the nucleus keeps

electrons in the area surrounding the nucleus.

• The electromagnetic force of repulsion between positive protons in the nucleus is overcome by the strong

nuclear force between protons and neutrons. This force holds the nucleus together.

• The weak nuclear force changes subatomic particles from one type to another. When protons change to

neutrons, this changes atoms of one element to atoms of a different element.

2.35 Atomic Number

• Deﬁne atomic number.
• Explain what mass number represents.

Athletes wearing the same-colored jerseys are all on the same team. In addition, each player’s jersey has a unique
number to distinguish him from his teammates. Imagine how confusing it would be if members of both teams wore
the same-colored jerseys or all the members of a team had the same number on their jerseys. How could you tell the
athletes apart?

Telling Atoms Apart

It’s often useful to have ways to signify different people or objects like athletes on teams. The same is true of
atoms. It’s important to be able to distinguish atoms of one element from atoms of other elements. Elements are
pure substances that make up all other matter, so each one is given a unique name. The names of elements are also
represented by unique one- or two-letter symbols, such as H for hydrogen, C for carbon, and He for helium. You
can see other examples in the Figure 2.68.
Q: The table shown in the Figure 2.68 is called the periodic table of the elements. Each symbol stands for a different
element. What do you think the symbol K stands for?
A: The symbol K stands for the element potassium. The symbol comes from the Latin name for potassium, which
is kalium.
The symbols in the Figure 2.68 would be more useful if they revealed more information about the atoms they
represent. For example, it would be useful to know the numbers of protons and neutrons in the atoms. That’s where
atomic number and mass number come in.

FIGURE 2.68

Atomic Number

The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. This number is very important because it is unique
for atoms of a given element. All atoms of an element have the same number of protons, and every element has a
different number of protons in its atoms. For example, all helium atoms have two protons, and no other elements
have atoms with two protons. In the case of helium, the atomic number is 2. The atomic number of an element is
usually written in front of and slightly below the element’s symbol, like in the Figure 2.69 for helium.

FIGURE 2.69

Atoms are neutral in electrical charge because they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons.
Therefore, the atomic number of an atom also tells you how many electrons the atom has. This, in turn, determines
many of the atom’s properties.

238

www.ck12.org

Mass Number

Chapter 2. Matter

There is another number in the Figure 2.69 for helium. That number is the mass number, which is the mass of the
atom in a unit called the atomic mass unit (amu). One atomic mass unit is the mass of a proton, or about 1.67 ×
10−27 kilograms, which is an extremely small mass. To better appreciate how small an atomic mass unit is, go to
this URL: http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/periodic_table/atomic_mass.html .
A neutron has just a tiny bit more mass than a proton, so its mass is often assumed to be one atomic mass unit as
well. Because electrons have virtually no mass, just about all the mass of an atom is in its protons and neutrons.
Therefore, the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom determines its mass in atomic mass units.
Consider helium again. Most helium atoms have two neutrons in addition to two protons. Therefore the mass of most
helium atoms is 4 atomic mass units (2 amu for the protons + 2 amu for the neutrons). However, some helium atoms
have more or less than two neutrons. Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are
called isotopes. Because the number of neutrons can vary for a given element, the mass numbers of different atoms
of an element may also vary. For example, some helium atoms have three neutrons instead of two. Therefore, they
have a different mass number than the one given in the Figure 2.69.
Q: What is the mass number of a helium atom that has three neutrons?
A: The mass number is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. For helium atoms with three neutrons,
the mass number is 2 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 5.
Q: How would you represent this isotope of helium to show its atomic number and mass number?
A: You would represent it by the element’s symbol and both numbers, with the mass number on top and the atomic
number on the bottom:

2.36 Ions

• State why atoms are neutral in electric charge.
• Describe ions.
• Explain how ions form.
• Identify properties of ions.

The incredible green lights in this cold northern sky consist of charged particles known as ions. Their swirling
pattern is caused by the pull of Earth’s magnetic north pole. Called the northern lights, this phenomenon of nature
shows that ions respond to a magnetic ﬁeld. Do you know what ions are? Read on to ﬁnd out.

Atoms Are Neutral

The northern lights aren’t caused by atoms, because atoms are not charged particles. An atom always has the same
number of electrons as protons. Electrons have an electric charge of -1 and protons have an electric charge of +1.
Therefore, the charges of an atom’s electrons and protons “cancel out.” This explains why atoms are neutral in
electric charge.
Q: What would happen to an atom’s charge if it were to gain extra electrons?
A: If an atom were to gain extra electrons, it would have more electrons than protons. This would give it a negative
charge, so it would no longer be neutral.

Atoms to Ions

Atoms cannot only gain extra electrons. They can also lose electrons. In either case, they become ions. Ions are
atoms that have a positive or negative charge because they have unequal numbers of protons and electrons. If atoms
lose electrons, they become positive ions, or cations. If atoms gain electrons, they become negative ions, or anions.

2.36. Ions

www.ck12.org

Consider the example of ﬂuorine (see Figure 2.70). A ﬂuorine atom has nine protons and nine electrons, so it is
electrically neutral. If a ﬂuorine atom gains an electron, it becomes a ﬂuoride ion with an electric charge of -1.

FIGURE 2.70

Names and Symbols

Like ﬂuoride, other negative ions usually have names ending in –ide. Positive ions, on the other hand, are just given
the element name followed by the word ion. For example, when a sodium atom loses an electron, it becomes a
positive sodium ion. The charge of an ion is indicated by a plus (+) or minus sign (-), which is written to the right
of and just above the ion’s chemical symbol. For example, the ﬂuoride ion is represented by the symbol F−, and the
sodium ion is represented by the symbol Na+. If the charge is greater than one, a number is used to indicate it. For
example, iron (Fe) may lose two electrons to form an ion with a charge of plus two. This ion would be represented
by the symbol Fe2+. This and some other common ions are listed with their symbols in the Table 2.9.

Q: What is the charge of an oxide ion? How does its number of electrons compare to its number of protons?
A: An oxide ion has a charge of -2. It has two more electrons than protons.

How Ions Form

The process in which an atom becomes an ion is called ionization. It may occur when atoms are exposed to high
levels of radiation. The radiation may give their outer electrons enough energy to escape from the attraction of

the positive nucleus. However, most ions form when atoms transfer electrons to or from other atoms or molecules.
For example, sodium atoms may transfer electrons to chlorine atoms. This forms positive sodium ions (Na+) and
negative chloride ions (Cl−). You can see an animation of this process at the URL below.

Q: Why do you think atoms lose electrons to, or gain electrons from, other atoms?
A: Atoms form ions by losing or gaining electrons because it makes them more stable and this state takes less energy
to maintain. The most stable state for an atom is to have its outermost energy level ﬁlled with the maximum possible
number of electrons. In the case of metals such as lithium, with just one electron in the outermost energy level, a
more stable state can be achieved by losing that one outer electron. In the case of nonmetals such as ﬂuorine, which
has seven electrons in the outermost energy level, a more stable state can be achieved by gaining one electron and
ﬁlling up the outer energy level. You can learn more about why ions form by watching the video at this URL:

Properties of Ions

Ions are highly reactive, especially as gases. They usually react with ions of opposite charge to form neutral
compounds. For example, positive sodium ions and negative chloride ions react to form the neutral compound
sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt. This occurs because oppositely charged ions attract each other.
Ions with the same charge, on the other hand, repel each other. Ions are also deﬂected by a magnetic ﬁeld, as you
saw in the opening image of the northern lights.

Summary

• Atoms have equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons, so they are neutral in electric charge.
• Atoms can gain or lose electrons and become ions, which are atoms that have a positive or negative charge

because they have unequal numbers of protons and electrons.

• The process in which an atom becomes an ion is called ionization. It may occur when atoms are exposed to

high levels of radiation or when atoms transfer electrons to or from other atoms.

• Ions are reactive, attracted or repulsed by other charged particles, and deﬂected by a magnetic ﬁeld.

Is this creature a space alien? It may look alien, but the sketch is actually just a scientist wearing a special suit to
protect himself from harmful radiation. The scientist is working with radioactive chemicals called isotopes. Not all
isotopes are radioactive, but many of them are. To understand why, you ﬁrst need to know what isotopes are.

What Are Isotopes?

All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but some may have different numbers of neutrons.
For example, all carbon atoms have six protons, and most have six neutrons as well. But some carbon atoms have
seven or eight neutrons instead of the usual six. Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons
are called isotopes. Many isotopes occur naturally. Usually one or two isotopes of an element are the most stable
and common. Different isotopes of an element generally have the same physical and chemical properties. That’s
because they have the same numbers of protons and electrons. For a video explanation of isotopes, go to this URL:

An Example: Hydrogen Isotopes

Hydrogen is an example of an element that has isotopes. Three isotopes of hydrogen are modeled in the Figure
2.71. Most hydrogen atoms have just one proton and one electron and lack a neutron. These atoms are just called
hydrogen. Some hydrogen atoms have one neutron as well. These atoms are the isotope named deuterium. Other
hydrogen atoms have two neutrons. These atoms are the isotope named tritium. For animated versions of these
hydrogen isotopes, go to this URL: http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/physics/atomic-structure/revise-it/isotopes .

FIGURE 2.71

Q: The mass number of an atom is the sum of its protons and neutrons. What is the mass number of each isotope of
hydrogen shown in the Figure 2.71?
A: The mass numbers are: hydrogen = 1, deuterium = 2, and tritium = 3.

Naming Isotopes

For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass number. For example, carbon atoms with
the usual 6 neutrons have a mass number of 12 (6 protons + 6 neutrons = 12), so they are called carbon-12. Carbon
atoms with 7 neutrons have an atomic mass of 13 (6 protons + 7 neutrons = 13). These atoms are the isotope called
carbon-13.

246

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter

Q: Some carbon atoms have 8 neutrons. What is the name of this isotope of carbon?
A: Carbon atoms with 8 neutrons have an atomic mass of 14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons = 14), so this isotope of carbon
is named carbon-14.

Stability of Isotopes

Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a stable nucleus. Having too many or too few neutrons
relative to protons results in an unstable, or radioactive, nucleus that will sooner or later break down to a more stable
form. This process is called radioactive decay. Many isotopes have radioactive nuclei, and these isotopes are referred
to as radioisotopes. When they decay, they release particles that may be harmful. This is why radioactive isotopes
are dangerous and why working with them requires special suits for protection. The isotope of carbon known as
carbon-14 is an example of a radioisotope. In contrast, the carbon isotopes called carbon-12 and carbon-13 are
stable.

Summary

• Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Different isotopes of
an element generally have the same physical and chemical properties because they have the same numbers of
protons and electrons.

• Most hydrogen atoms lack a neutron and are just called hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms with one neutron are the

isotope known as deuterium, and those with two neutrons are the isotope named tritium.

• For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass number, which is the number of

protons plus neutrons. For example, carbon with a mass number of 14 is called carbon-14.

• Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a stable nucleus. If they have too many or too few
neutrons relative to protons, they are radioactive and will decay to more stable forms. Isotopes with radioactive
nuclei are called radioisotopes.

and he introduced the idea of the atom as the basic building block of all matter. You can learn about Democritus’

Cutting the Cheese

Democritus lived in Greece from about 460 to 370 B.C.E. Like many other ancient Greek philosophers, he spent a
lot of time wondering about the natural world. Democritus wondered, for example, what would happen if you cut

249

2.38. Democritus’ Idea of the Atom

www.ck12.org

a chunk of matter—such as a piece of cheese into smaller and smaller pieces. He thought that a point would be
reached at which the cheese could not be cut into still smaller pieces. He called these pieces atomos, which means
“uncuttable” in Greek. This is where the modern term atom comes from. In the video at the following URL, Bill
Nye the Science Guy demonstrates how Democritus arrived at his idea of the atom.

FIGURE 2.72
How many times could you cut this piece of cheese in half? How small
would the smallest pieces be?

Just a Guess

Democritus’ idea of the atom has been called “the best guess in antiquity.” That’s because it was correct in many
ways, yet it was based on pure speculation. It really was just a guess. Here’s what Democritus thought about the
atom:

• All matter consists of atoms, which cannot be further subdivided into smaller particles.
• Atoms are extremely small—too small to see.
• Atoms are solid particles that are indestructible.
• Atoms are separated from one another by emptiness, or “void.”

Q: How are Democritus’ ideas about atoms similar to modern ideas about atoms?
A: Modern ideas agree that all matter is made up of extremely small building blocks called atoms.
Q: How are Democritus’ ideas different from modern ideas?
A: Although atoms are extremely small, it is now possible to see them with very powerful microscopes. Atoms also
aren’t the solid, uncuttable particles Democritus thought. Instead, they consist of several kinds of smaller, simpler
particles as well as a lot of empty space. In addition, atoms aren’t really indestructible because they can be changed
to other forms of matter or energy.

Keep on Moving

Did you ever notice dust motes moving in still air where a beam of sunlight passes through it? You can see an
example in the forest scene in the Figure 2.73. This sort of observation gave Democritus the idea that atoms are
in constant, random motion. If this were true, Democritus thought, then atoms must always be bumping into each

250

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter

other. When they do, he surmised, they either bounce apart or stick together to form clumps of atoms. Eventually,
the clumps could grow big enough to be visible matter.

FIGURE 2.73
Dust motes dance in a beam of sunlight.

Q: Which modern theory of matter is similar to Democritus’ ideas about the motion of atoms?
A: The modern kinetic theory of matter is remarkably similar to Democritus’ ideas about the motion of atoms.
According to this theory, atoms of matter are in constant random motion. This motion is greater in gases than in
liquids, and it is greater in liquids than in solids. But even in solids, atoms are constantly vibrating in place.

Why Matter Varies

Democritus thought that different kinds of matter vary because of the size, shape, and arrangement of their atoms.
For example, he suggested that sweet substances are made of smooth atoms and bitter substances are made of sharp
atoms. He speculated that atoms of liquids are slippery, which allows them to slide over each other and liquids to
ﬂow. Atoms of solids, in contrast, stick together, so they cannot move apart. Differences in the weight of matter, he
argued, could be explained by the closeness of atoms. Atoms of lighter matter, he thought, were more spread out
and separated by more empty space.
Q: Democritus thought that different kinds of atoms make up different types of matter. How is this similar to modern
ideas about atoms?
A: The modern view is that atoms of different elements differ in their numbers of protons and electrons and this
gives them different physical and chemical properties.

That’s Ridiculous!

Democritus was an important philosopher, but he was less inﬂuential than another Greek philosopher named Aristo-
tle, who lived about 100 years after Democritus. Aristotle rejected Democritus’ idea of the atom. In fact, Aristotle
thought the idea was ridiculous. Unfortunately, Aristotle’s opinion was accepted for more than 2000 years, and
Democritus’ idea was more or less forgotten. However, the idea of the atom was revived around 1800 by the English
scientist John Dalton. Dalton developed an entire theory about the atom, much of which is still accepted today. He
based his theory on experimental evidence, not on lucky guesses.

2.39 Dalton’s Atomic Theory

• Explain why Dalton reintroduced the idea of the atom.
• State Dalton’s atomic theory.
• Describe Dalton’s billiard ball model of the atom.

You probably know what this sketch represents. It’s a model of an atom, one of the miniscule particles that make
up all matter. The idea that matter consists of extremely tiny particles called atoms was ﬁrst introduced about 2500
years ago by a Greek philosopher named Democritus. However, other philosophers considered Democritus’ idea
ridiculous, and it was more or less forgotten for more than 2000 years.

Reintroducing the Atom

Around 1800, the English chemist John Dalton brought back Democritus’ ancient idea of the atom. You can see a
picture of Dalton 2.74. Dalton grew up in a working-class family. As an adult, he made a living by teaching and just
did research in his spare time. Nonetheless, from his research he developed one of the most important theories in
all of science. Based on his research results, he was able to demonstrate that atoms actually do exist, something that
Democritus had only guessed.

Dalton’s Experiments

Dalton did many experiments that provided evidence for the existence of atoms. For example:

253

2.39. Dalton’s Atomic Theory

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 2.74

• He investigated pressure and other properties of gases, from which he inferred that gases must consist of tiny,

individual particles that are in constant, random motion.

• He researched the properties of compounds, which are substances that consist of more than one element. He
showed that a given compound is always comprised of the same elements in the same whole-number ratio and
that different compounds consist of different elements or ratios. This can happen, Dalton reasoned, only if
elements are made of separate, discrete particles that cannot be subdivided.

Atomic Theory

From his research, Dalton developed a theory about atoms. Dalton’s atomic theory consists of three basic ideas:

• All substances are made of atoms. Atoms are the smallest particles of matter. They cannot be divided into

smaller particles, created, or destroyed.

• All atoms of the same element are alike and have the same mass. Atoms of different elements are different

and have different masses.

• Atoms join together to form compounds, and a given compound always consists of the same kinds of atoms

in the same proportions.

Dalton’s atomic theory was accepted by many scientists almost immediately. Most of it is still accepted today.
However, scientists now know that atoms are not the smallest particles of matter. Atoms consist of several types of
smaller particles, including protons, neutrons, and electrons. For the back story on Dalton’s ideas about atoms and
his place in the history of the atom, watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhWgv0STLZs (9:03).

and used to model compounds.

2.40 Thomson’s Atomic Model

• Explain how J. J. Thomson discovered the electron.
• Describe Thomson’s plum pudding model of the atom.

You probably know that the wires strung between these high towers carry electricity. But do you know what
electricity is? It actually consists of a constant stream of tiny particles called electrons. Electrons are negatively
charged fundamental particles inside atoms. Atoms were discovered around 1800, but almost 100 years went by
before electrons were discovered.

Thomson Discovers Electrons

John Dalton discovered atoms in 1804. He thought they were the smallest particles of matter, which could not be
broken down into smaller particles. He envisioned them as solid, hard spheres. It wasn’t until 1897 that a scientist
named Joseph John (J. J.) Thomson discovered that there are smaller particles within the atom. Thomson was born
in England and studied at Cambridge University, where he later became a professor. In 1906, he won the Nobel Prize
in physics for his research on how gases conduct electricity. This research also led to his discovery of the electron.
You can see a picture of Thomson 2.76. You can take a museum tour of his discovery at this online exhibit: http://w
ww.aip.org/history/electron/ .

Thomson’s Experiments

In his research, Thomson passed current through a cathode ray tube, similar to the one seen in the Figure 2.77. A
cathode ray tube is a glass tube from which virtually all of the air has been removed. It contains a piece of metal
called an electrode at each end. One electrode is negatively charged and known as a cathode. The other electrode is
positively charged and known as an anode. When high-voltage electric current is applied to the end plates, a cathode
ray travels from the cathode to the anode.

257

2.40. Thomson’s Atomic Model

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 2.76

What is a cathode ray? That’s what Thomson wanted to know. Is it just a ray of energy that travels in waves like a
ray of light? That was one popular hypothesis at the time. Or was a cathode ray a stream of moving particles? That
was the other popular hypothesis. Thomson tested these ideas by placing negative and positive plates along the sides
of the cathode ray tube to see how the cathode ray would be affected. The cathode ray appeared to be repelled by
the negative plate and attracted by the positive plate. This meant that the ray was negative in charge and that is must
consist of particles that have mass. He called the particles “corpuscles,” but they were later renamed electrons. For
a video demonstration of Thomson’s experiment, go to this URL: http://ericsaltchemistry.blogspot.com/2010/10/jj
-thomsons-experiments-with-cathode.html .

FIGURE 2.77

Thomson also measured the mass of the particles he had identiﬁed. He did this by determining how much the
cathode rays were bent when he varied the voltage. He found that the mass of the particles was 2000 times smaller
than the mass of the smallest atom, the hydrogen atom. In short, Thomson had discovered the existence of particles
smaller than atoms. This disproved Dalton’s claim that atoms are the smallest particles of matter. From his discovery,
Thomson also inferred that electrons are fundamental particles within atoms.

258

Chapter 2. Matter

Q: Atoms are neutral in electric charge. How can they be neutral if they contain negatively charged electrons?
A: Atoms also contain positively charged particles that cancel out the negative charge of the electrons. However,
these positive particles weren’t discovered until a couple of decades after Thomson discovered electrons.

The Plum Pudding Model

Thomson also knew that atoms are neutral in electric charge, so he asked the same question: How can atoms contain
negative particles and still be neutral? He hypothesized that the rest of the atom must be positively charged in order
to cancel out the negative charge of the electrons. He envisioned the atom as being similar to a plum pudding, like
the one pictured in the Figure 2.78—mostly positive in charge (the pudding) with negative electrons (the plums)
scattered through it.

FIGURE 2.78

Q: How is our modern understanding of atomic structure different from Thomson’s plum pudding model?
A: Today we know that all of the positive charge in an atom is concentrated in a tiny central area called the nucleus,
with the electrons swirling through empty space around it, as in the Figure 2.79. The nucleus was discovered just a
few years after Thomson discovered the electron, so the plum pudding model was soon rejected.

Summary

• In 1897, J. J. Thomson discovered the ﬁrst subatomic particle, the electron, while researching cathode rays.
• To explain the neutrality of atoms, Thomson proposed a model of the atom in which negative electrons are

scattered throughout a sphere of positive charge. He called his atom the plum pudding model.

Thom is shooting baskets. He’s trying to hit the backboard so the ball will bounce off it and into the basket. If only
the backboard was bigger! It would be a lot easier to hit. If the ball misses the backboard, it will just keep going and
Thom will have to run after it. Believe it or not, the research that led to the discovery of the nucleus of the atom was
a little like shooting baskets.

Narrowing Down the Nucleus

In 1804, almost a century before the nucleus was discovered, the English scientist John Dalton provided evidence
for the existence of the atom. Dalton thought that atoms were the smallest particles of matter, which couldn’t be
divided into smaller particles. He modeled atoms with solid wooden balls. In 1897, another English scientist, named
J. J. Thomson, discovered the electron. It was ﬁrst subatomic particle to be identiﬁed. Because atoms are neutral in
electric charge, Thomson assumed that atoms must also contain areas of positive charge to cancel out the negatively
charged electrons. He thought that an atom was like a plum pudding, consisting mostly of positively charged matter
with negative electrons scattered through it.
The nucleus of the atom was discovered next. It was discovered in 1911 by a scientist from New Zealand named
Ernest Rutherford, who is pictured in Figure 2.80. Through his clever research, Rutherford showed that the positive
charge of an atom is conﬁned to a tiny massive region at the center of the atom, rather than being spread evenly
throughout the “pudding” of the atom as Thomson had suggested. You can watch a video about Rutherford and his

FIGURE 2.80

Go for the Gold!

The way Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus is a good example of the role of creativity in science. His quest
actually began in 1899 when he discovered that some elements give off positively charged particles that can penetrate
just about anything. He called these particles alpha (α) particles (we now know they were helium nuclei). Like all
good scientists, Rutherford was curious. He wondered how he could use alpha particles to learn about the structure
of the atom. He decided to aim a beam of alpha particles at a sheet of very thin gold foil. He chose gold because it
can be pounded into sheets that are only 0.00004 cm thick. Surrounding the sheet of gold foil, he placed a screen
that glowed when alpha particles struck it. It would be used to detect the alpha particles after they passed through
the foil. A small slit in the screen allowed the beam of alpha particles to reach the foil from the particle emitter. You
can see the setup for Rutherford’s experiment in the Figure 2.81.
Q: What would you expect to happen when the alpha particles strike the gold foil?
A: The alpha particles would penetrate the gold foil. Alpha particles are positive, so they might be repelled by any
areas of positive charge inside the gold atoms.
Assuming a plum pudding model of the atom, Rutherford predicted that the areas of positive charge in the gold
atoms would deﬂect, or bend, the path of all the alpha particles as they passed through. You can see what really
happened in the Figure 2.81. Most of the alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil as though it wasn’t
there. The particles seemed to be passing through empty space. Only a few of the alpha particles were deﬂected from
their straight path, as Rutherford had predicted. Surprisingly, a tiny percentage of the particles bounced back from
the foil like a basketball bouncing off a backboard! You can see an animation of this experiment at the following
URL: http://www.clickandlearn.org/gr9_sci/atoms/modelsoftheatom.html .
Q: What can you infer from these observations?
A: You can infer that most of the alpha particles were not repelled by any positive charge, whereas a few were
repelled by a strong positive charge.

The Nucleus Takes Center Stage

Rutherford made the same inferences. He concluded that all of the positive charge and virtually all of the mass of
an atom are concentrated in one tiny area and the rest of the atom is mostly empty space. Rutherford called the
area of concentrated positive charge the nucleus. He predicted—and soon discovered—that the nucleus contains
positively charged particles, which he named protons. Rutherford also predicted the existence of neutral nuclear
particles called neutrons, but he failed to ﬁnd them. However, his student James Chadwick discovered them several
years later. You can learn how at this URL: http://www.light-science.com/chadwick.html .

The Planetary Model

Rutherford’s discoveries meant that Thomson’s plum pudding model was incorrect. Positive charge is not spread
evenly throughout an atom. Instead, it is all concentrated in the tiny nucleus. The rest of the atom is empty space
except for the electrons scattered through it. In Rutherford’s model of the atom, which is shown in the Figure 2.82,
the electrons move around the massive nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. That’s why his model is called the
planetary model. Rutherford didn’t know exactly where or how electrons orbit the nucleus. That research would be
undertaken by later scientists, beginning with Niels Bohr in 1913. New and improved atomic models would also
be developed. Nonetheless, Rutherford’s model is still often used to represent the atom. You can see an animated
version of the model at this URL: http://www.clickandlearn.org/gr9_sci/atoms/modelsoftheatom.html .

Summary

• Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus of the atom in 1910. He sent a beam of alpha particles toward gold
foil and observed the way the particles were deﬂected by the gold atoms. From his results, he concluded that
all of the positive charge and virtually all of the mass of an atom are concentrated in one tiny area, called the
nucleus, and the rest of the atom is mostly empty space.

• In Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom, the electrons move through empty space around the tiny positive

nucleus like planets orbiting the sun.

stand on a ladder, you can stand on one rung or another, but you can never stand in between two rungs. A ladder can

Modeling the Atom

The existence of the atom was ﬁrst demonstrated around 1800 by John Dalton. Then, close to a century went by
before J.J. Thomson discovered the ﬁrst subatomic particle, the negatively charged electron. Because atoms are
neutral in charge, Thomson thought that they must consist of a sphere of positive charge with electrons scattered
through it. In 1910, Ernest Rutherford showed that this idea was incorrect. He demonstrated that all of the positive
charge of an atom is actually concentrated in a tiny central region called the nucleus. Rutherford surmised that
electrons move around the nucleus like planets around the sun. Rutherford’s idea of atomic structure was an
improvement on Thomson’s model, but it wasn’t the last word. Rutherford focused on the nucleus and didn’t really
clarify where the electrons were in the empty space surrounding the nucleus.
The next major advance in atomic history occurred in 1913, when the Danish scientist Niels Bohr published a
description of a more detailed model of the atom. His model identiﬁed more clearly where electrons could be found.

265

2.42. Bohr’s Atomic Model

www.ck12.org

Although later scientists would develop more reﬁned atomic models, Bohr’s model was basically correct and much
of it is still accepted today. It is also a very useful model because it explains the properties of different elements.
Bohr received the 1922 Nobel prize in physics for his contribution to our understanding of the structure of the atom.
You can see a picture of Bohr 2.83.

FIGURE 2.83

On the Level

As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position
of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at ﬁxed
distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these ﬁxed distances energy levels,
or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other
words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would
be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy
levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy,
it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back
to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are
illustrated in the Figure 2.84.
Q: How is an atom like a ladder?
A: Energy levels in an atom are like the rungs of a ladder. Just as you can stand only on the rungs and not in between
them, electrons can orbit the nucleus only at ﬁxed distances from the nucleus and not in between them.

Energy by the Spoonful

Bohr’s model of the atom is actually a combination of two different ideas: Rutherford’s atomic model of electrons
orbiting the nucleus and German scientist Max Planck’s idea of a quantum, which Planck published in 1901. A
quantum (plural, quanta) is the minimum amount of energy that can be absorbed or released by matter. It is a
discrete, or distinct, amount of energy. If energy were water and you wanted to add it to matter in the form of a
drinking glass, you couldn’t simply pour the water continuously into the glass. Instead, you could add it only in
small ﬁxed quantities, for example, by the teaspoonful. Bohr reasoned that if electrons can absorb or lose only ﬁxed
quantities of energy, then they must vary in their energy by these ﬁxed amounts. Thus, they can occupy only ﬁxed
energy levels around the nucleus that correspond to quantum increases in energy.

Q: The idea that energy is transferred only in discrete units, or quanta, was revolutionary when Max Planck ﬁrst
proposed it in 1901. However, what scientists already knew about matter may have made it easier for them to accept
the idea of energy quanta. Can you explain?
A: Scientists already knew that matter exists in discrete units called atoms. This idea had been demonstrated by
John Dalton around 1800. Knowing this may have made it easier for scientists to accept the idea that energy exists
in discrete units as well.

Summary

• In Bohr’s atomic model, electrons move around the nucleus only at ﬁxed distances from the nucleus based on

the amount of energy they have. The ﬁxed distances where electrons may orbit are called energy levels.

• Bohr arrived at his model by applying Planck’s idea of energy quanta to Rutherford’s atomic model of electrons

orbiting the nucleus.

• Relate energy levels to orbitals.
• Explain the signiﬁcance of electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom.

Fireworks are a great way to celebrate happy events. Do you know what causes the brilliant, colored lights of
ﬁreworks? The lights are bursts of energy given off by atoms in the ﬁreworks. What do you suppose causes these
bursts of light? The answer has to do with energy levels of atoms.

What Are Energy Levels?

Energy levels (also called electron shells) are ﬁxed distances from the nucleus of an atom where electrons may be
found. Electrons are tiny, negatively charged particles in an atom that move around the positive nucleus at the center.
Energy levels are a little like the steps of a staircase. You can stand on one step or another but not in between the
steps. The same goes for electrons. They can occupy one energy level or another but not the space between energy
levels.
The model in the Figure 2.85 shows the ﬁrst four energy levels of an atom. Electrons in energy level I (also called
energy level K) have the least amount of energy. As you go farther from the nucleus, electrons at higher levels have
more energy, and their energy increases by a ﬁxed, discrete amount. Electrons can jump from a lower to the next
higher energy level if they absorb this amount of energy. Conversely, if electrons jump from a higher to a lower
energy level, they give off energy, often in the form of light. This explains the ﬁreworks pictured above. When the
ﬁreworks explode, electrons gain energy and jump to higher energy levels. When they jump back to their original
energy levels, they release the energy as light. Different atoms have different arrangements of electrons, so they give
off light of different colors. You can see an animation of electrons jumping from one energy level to another at this

FIGURE 2.85

Q: In the atomic model Figure 2.85, where would you ﬁnd electrons that have the most energy?
A: Electrons with the most energy would be found in energy level IV.

Energy Levels and Orbitals

The smallest atoms are hydrogen atoms. They have just one electron orbiting the nucleus. That one electron is in the
ﬁrst energy level. Bigger atoms have more electrons. Electrons are always added to the lowest energy level ﬁrst until
it has the maximum number of electrons possible. Then electrons are added to the next higher energy level until that
level is full, and so on.
How many electrons can a given energy level hold? The maximum numbers of electrons possible for the ﬁrst four
energy levels are shown in the Figure 2.85. For example, energy level I can hold a maximum of two electrons, and
energy level II can hold a maximum of eight electrons. The maximum number depends on the number of orbitals at
a given energy level. An orbital is a volume of space within an atom where an electron is most likely to be found.
As you can see by the images in the Figure 2.86, some orbitals are shaped like spheres (S orbitals) and some are
shaped like dumbbells (P orbitals). There are other types of orbitals as well.

FIGURE 2.86

Regardless of its shape, each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. Energy level I has just one orbital, so
two electrons will ﬁll this energy level. Energy level II has four orbitals, so it takes eight electrons to ﬁll this energy

level. The animation below shows the electrons in the ﬁrst two energy levels for an atom of lithium, which has a
total of three electrons.
http://web.visionlearning.com/custom/chemistry/animations/CHE1.3-an-lithium.shtml
Q: Energy level III can hold a maximum of 18 electrons. How many orbitals does this energy level have?
A: At two electrons per orbital, this energy level must have nine orbitals.

The Outermost Level

Electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom have a special signiﬁcance. These electrons are called valence
electrons, and they determine many of the properties of an atom. An atom is most stable if its outermost energy
level contains as many electrons as it can hold. For example, helium has two electrons, both in the ﬁrst energy level.
This energy level can hold only two electrons, so helium’s only energy level is full. This makes helium a very stable
element. In other words, its atoms are unlikely to react with other atoms.
Consider the elements ﬂuorine and lithium, modeled in the Figure 2.87. Fluorine has seven of eight possible
electrons in its outermost energy level, which is energy level II. It would be more stable if it had one more electron
because this would ﬁll its outermost energy level. Lithium, on the other hand, has just one of eight possible electrons
in its outermost energy level (also energy level II). It would be more stable if it had one less electron because it
would have a full outer energy level (now energy level I).

FIGURE 2.87

Both ﬂuorine and lithium are highly reactive elements because of their number of valence electrons. Fluorine will
readily gain one electron and lithium will just as readily give up one electron to become more stable. In fact, lithium
and ﬂuorine will react together as shown in the Figure 2.88. When the two elements react, lithium transfers its one
“extra” electron to ﬂuorine.
Q: A neon atom has ten electrons. How many electrons does it have in its outermost energy level? How stable do
you think a neon atom is?
A: A neon atom has two electrons in energy level I and its remaining eight electrons in energy level II, which can
hold only eight electrons. This means that is outermost energy level is full. Therefore, a neon atom is very stable.

Summary

• Energy levels (also called electron shells) are ﬁxed distances from the nucleus of an atom where electrons may

be found. As you go farther from the nucleus, electrons at higher energy levels have more energy.

• Identify the electron cloud model of the atom.

The fan pictured here is turned off in the photo on the left and running at high speed in the photo on the right. In the
right-hand photo, the blades are moving too fast for you to see the individual blades. You can’t tell where any given
blade is at any given moment. In some ways, rapidly moving fan blades are similar to electrons moving about the
nucleus of an atom. Like fan blades, electrons move very quickly and we can never tell exactly where they are. If
that’s the case, how can we represent electrons in models of the atom?

Where Are the Electrons?

Up until about 1920, scientists accepted Niels Bohr’s model of the atom. In this model, negative electrons circle the
positive nucleus at ﬁxed distances from the nucleus, called energy levels. You can see the model in Figure 2.89 for
an atom of the element nitrogen. Bohr’s model is useful for understanding properties of elements and their chemical
interactions. However, it doesn’t explain certain behaviors of electrons, except for those in the simplest atom, the
hydrogen atom.

What Are the Chances?

In the mid-1920s, an Austrian scientist named Erwin Schrödinger thought that the problem with Bohr’s model was
restricting the electrons to speciﬁc orbits. He wondered if electrons might behave like light, which scientists already
knew had properties of both particles and waves. Schrödinger speculated that electrons might also travel in waves.
At the URLs below, you can see how some of these waves might look.

Schrödinger developed an equation that could be used to calculate the chances of an electron being in any given

most likely to be. He called these regions orbitals. As you can see in the Figure 2.90, orbitals may be shaped
like spheres, dumbbells, or rings. In each case, the nucleus of the atom is at the center of the orbital. You can see

A Fuzzy Cloud

Schrödinger’s work on orbitals is the basis of the modern model of the atom, which scientists call the quantum
mechanical model. The modern model is also commonly called the electron cloud model. That’s because each
orbital around the nucleus of the atom resembles a fuzzy cloud around the nucleus, like the ones shown in the
Figure 2.91 for a helium atom. The densest area of the cloud is where the electrons have the greatest chances of
being.

FIGURE 2.91

Q: In the model pictured in the Figure 2.91, where are the two helium electrons most likely to be?
A: The two electrons are most likely to be inside the sphere closest to the nucleus where the cloud is darkest.

Summary

• Bohr’s model of the atom, in which electrons circle the nucleus at ﬁxed energy levels, cannot explain all the

behaviors of electrons.

• In the 1920s, Erwin Schrödinger proposed that electrons travel in waves, which means their exact positions
cannot be determined. He developed an equation to calculate the chances of an electron being in any given
place. Using his equation, he identiﬁed regions around the nucleus, called orbitals, where electrons are most
likely to be.

• Orbitals are the basis of the electron cloud model of the atom. This model is still accepted by scientists today.

Look at the left-hand photo above. What a messy closet! Do you have a messy closet too? If you do, then you know
how hard it can be to ﬁnd a speciﬁc item of clothing. If you don’t have a messy closet, just imagine trying to ﬁnd a
particular shirt or pair of jeans in the closet above. It could take a long time, and it would probably make you late
for school! Now look at the closet on the right. It’s very neat and well organized. With a closet like this, it would be
easy to ﬁnd whatever item you wanted.
Q: What do these two closets have to do with science?
A: They show why it’s important to keep things organized, including the elements, which are the pure substances
that make up all kinds of matter.

Organizing Elements

For many years, scientists looked for a good way to organize the elements. This became increasingly important as
more and more elements were discovered. An ingenious method of organizing elements was developed in 1869 by a
Russian scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev, who is pictured 2.92. Mendeleev’s method of organizing elements was
later revised, but it served as a basis for the method that is still used today. You can learn more about Mendeleev
and his work at this URL: http://videos.howstuffworks.com/science-channel/27862-100-greatest-discoveries-the-p
eriodic-table-video.htm .
Mendeleev was a teacher as well as a chemist. He was writing a chemistry textbook and wanted to ﬁnd a way to
organize the 63 known elements so it would be easier for students to learn about them. He made a set of cards of

276

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter

FIGURE 2.92

the elements, similar to a deck of playing cards. On each card, he wrote the name of a different element, its atomic
mass, and other known properties. Mendeleev arranged and rearranged the cards in many different ways, looking
for a pattern. He ﬁnally found it when he placed the elements in order by increasing atomic mass.
Q: What is atomic mass? Why might it be a good basis for organizing elements?
A: Atomic mass is the mass of one atom of an element. It is about equal to the mass of the protons plus the neutrons
in an atom. It is a good basis for organizing elements because each element has a unique number of protons and
atomic mass is an indirect way of organizing elements by number of protons.

Groups and Periods

You can see how Mendeleev organized the elements in the Figure 2.93. From left to right across each row, elements
are arranged by increasing atomic mass. Mendeleev discovered that if he placed eight elements in each row and then
continued on to the next row, the columns of the table would contain elements with similar properties. He called the
columns groups. They are sometimes called families, because elements within a group are similar but not identical
to one another, like people in a family.

FIGURE 2.93

Mendeleev’s table of the elements is called a periodic table because of its repeating pattern. Anything that keeps
repeating is referred to as periodic. Other examples of things that are periodic include the monthly phases of the
moon and the daily cycle of night and day. The term period refers to the interval between repetitions. For example,

277

2.45. Mendeleev’s Periodic Table

www.ck12.org

the moon’s phases repeat every four weeks. In a periodic table of the elements, the periods are the rows of the table.
In Mendeleev’s table, each period contains eight elements, and then the pattern repeats in the next row.

Filling in the Blanks

Did you notice the blanks in Mendeleev’s table? They are spaces that Mendeleev left blank for elements that had
not yet been discovered when he created his table. He predicted that these missing elements would eventually be
discovered. Based on their position in the table, he even predicted their properties. For example, he predicted a
missing element in row 5 of group III. He also predicted that the missing element would have an atomic mass of
68 and be a relatively soft metal like other elements in this group. Scientists searched for the missing element, and
they found it just a few years later. They named the new element gallium. Scientists searched for the other missing
elements in Mendeleev’s table and eventually found all of them.
An important measure of a good model is its ability to make accurate predictions. This makes it a useful model.
Clearly, Mendeleev’s periodic table was a useful model. It helped scientists discover new elements and made sense
of those that were already known.

Summary

• In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev developed a method for organizing elements based on their atomic mass. His

method was later revised, but it served as a basis for the method used today.

The First Periodic Table

In the 1860s, a scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev also saw the need to organize the elements. He created a table in
which he arranged all of the elements by increasing atomic mass from left to right across each row. When he placed
eight elements in each row and then started again in the next row, each column of the table contained elements with
similar properties. He called the columns of elements groups. Mendeleev’s table is called a periodic table and the
rows are called periods. That’s because the table keeps repeating from row to row, and periodic means “repeating.”

The Modern Periodic Table

A periodic table is still used today to organize the elements. You can see a simple version of the modern periodic
table in the Figure 2.94. The modern table is based on Mendeleev’s table, except the modern table arranges the
elements by increasing atomic number instead of atomic mass. Atomic number is the number of protons in an atom,

279

2.46. Modern Periodic Table

www.ck12.org

and this number is unique for each element. The modern table has more elements than Mendeleev’s table because
many elements have been discovered since Mendeleev’s time. Some newer elements have been made artiﬁcially and
added after their existence has been veriﬁed. For example, elements 114 and 116 were added in 2011. In 2015 four
more elements (atomic numbers 113, 115, 117, and 118) were veriﬁed and added. The periodic table continues to
grow.

FIGURE 2.94

Reading the Table

In the Figure 2.94, each element is represented by its chemical symbol, which consists of one or two letters. The
ﬁrst letter of the symbol is always written in upper case, and the second letter—if there is one—is always written in
lower case. For example, the symbol for copper is Cu. It stands for cuprum, which is the Latin word for copper. The
number above each symbol in the table is its unique atomic number. Notice how the atomic numbers increase from
left to right and from top to bottom in the table.
Q: Find the symbol for copper in the Figure 2.94. What is its atomic number? What does this number represent?
A: The atomic number of copper is 29. This number represents the number of protons in each atom of copper.
(Copper is the element that makes up the coil of wire in photo A of the opening sequence of photos.)

Chapter 2. Matter

Periods of the Modern Periodic Table

Rows of the modern periodic table are called periods, as they are in Mendeleev’s table. From left to right across a
period, each element has one more proton than the element before it. Some periods in the modern periodic table are
longer than others. For example, period 1 contains only two elements: hydrogen (H) and helium (He). In contrast,
periods 6 and 7 are so long that many of their elements are placed below the main part of the table. They are the
elements starting with lanthanum (La) in period 6 and actinium (Ac) in period 7. Some elements in period 7 have not
yet been named. They are represented by temporary three-letter symbols, such as Uub. The number of each period
represents the number of energy levels that have electrons in them for atoms of each element in that period.
Q: Find calcium (Ca) in the Figure 2.94. How many energy levels have electrons in them for atoms of calcium?
A: Calcium is in period 4, so its atoms have electrons in them for the ﬁrst four energy levels.

Groups of the Modern Periodic Table

Columns of the modern table are called groups, as they are in Mendeleev’s table. However, the modern table
has many more groups—18 compared with just 8 in Mendeleev’s table. Elements in the same group have similar
properties. For example, all elements in group 18 are colorless, odorless gases, such as neon (Ne). (Neon is the
element inside the light in opening photo C.) In contrast, all elements in group 1 are very reactive solids. They react
explosively with water, as you can see in the video and Figure 2.95.

Classes of Elements

All elements can be classiﬁed in one of three classes: metals, metalloids, or nonmetals. Elements in each class share
certain basic properties. For example, elements in the metals class can conduct electricity, whereas elements in the
nonmetals class generally cannot. Elements in the metalloids class fall in between the metals and nonmetals in their
properties. An example of a metalloid is arsenic (As). (Arsenic is the element in opening photo B.) In the periodic

table above, elements are color coded to show their class. As you move from left to right across each period of the
table, the elements change from metals to metalloids to nonmetals.
Q: To which class of elements does copper (Cu) belong: metal, metalloid, or nonmetal? Identify three other elements
in this class.
A: In the Figure 2.94, the cell for copper is colored blue. This means that copper belongs to the metals class. Other
elements in the metals class include iron (Fe), sodium (Na), and gold (Au). It is apparent from the table that the
majority of elements are metals.

• Identify the metals class of elements.
• Describe properties of metals.
• Explain why metals are good conductors of electricity.

When you think of metals, do you think of solid objects such as iron nails and gold jewelry? If so, it might surprise
you to learn that the shiny liquid pouring out of the pipette in the photo above is also a metal. It’s called mercury,
and it’s the only metal that normally exists on Earth as a liquid. Just what are metals, and what are their properties?
Read on to ﬁnd out.

What Are Metals?

Metals are elements that can conduct electricity. They are one of three classes of elements (the other two classes
are nonmetals and metalloids). Metals are by far the largest of the three classes. In fact, most elements are metals.
All of the elements on the left side and in the middle of the periodic table, except for hydrogen, are metals. There
are several different types of metals, including alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table, alkaline Earth metals in
group 2, and transition metals in groups 3–12. The majority of metals are transition metals.

Properties of Metals

Elements in the same class share certain basic similarities. In addition to conducting electricity, many metals have
several other shared properties, including those listed below. You can dig deeper into the properties of metals at this
URL: http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_gateway_pre_2011/periodictable/metalsrev1.shtml .

• Metals have relatively high melting points. This explains why all metals except for mercury are solids at room

temperature.

• Most metals are good conductors of heat. That’s why metals such as iron, copper, and aluminum are used for

pots and pans.

www.ck12.org

• Metals are generally shiny. This is because they reﬂect much of the light that strikes them. The mercury

pictured above is very shiny.

• The majority of metals are ductile. This means that they can be pulled into long, thin shapes, like the aluminum

electric wires pictured in the Figure 2.96.

• Metals tend to be malleable. This means that they can be formed into thin sheets without breaking. An

example is aluminum foil, also pictured in the Figure 2.96.

FIGURE 2.96

Q: The deﬁning characteristic of metals is their ability to conduct electricity. Why do you think metals have this
property?
A: The properties of metals—as well as of elements in the other classes—depend mainly on the number and
arrangement of their electrons.

Explaining the Properties of Metals

To understand why metals can conduct electricity, consider the metal lithium as an example. An atom of lithium is
modeled below. Look at lithium’s electrons. There are two electrons at the ﬁrst energy level. This energy level can
hold only two electrons, so it is full in lithium. The second energy level is another story. It can hold a maximum of
eight electrons, but in lithium it has just one. A full outer energy level is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Lithium would need to gain seven electrons to ﬁll its outer energy level and make it stable. It’s far easier for lithium
to give up its one electron in energy level 2, leaving it with a full outer energy level (now level 1). Electricity is a
ﬂow of electrons. Because lithium (like most other metals) easily gives up its “extra” electron, it is a good conductor
of electricity. This tendency to give up electrons also explains other properties of metals such as lithium.

• Electricity is a ﬂow of electrons. Atoms of metals tend to give up electrons, explaining why they are good
conductors of electricity. The tendency to give up electrons also explains many of the other properties of
metals.

2.48 Nonmetals

• Identify the nonmetals class of elements.
• List properties of nonmetals.
• Explain why nonmetals vary in their reactivity and cannot conduct electricity.

The three pure substances pictured above have the distinction of being among the top ten elements that make up the
human body. All three of them belong to the class of elements called nonmetals. Most of the elements that comprise
the human body—as well as the majority of other living things—are nonmetals. In fact, seven of the top ten elements
in your own body belong to this class of elements. What do you know about nonmetals? What are their properties,
and how are they different from other elements? In this article, you’ll ﬁnd out.

What Are Nonmetals?

Nonmetals are elements that generally do not conduct electricity. They are one of three classes of elements (the
other two classes are metals and metalloids.) Nonmetals are the second largest of the three classes after metals.
They are the elements located on the right side of the periodic table.
Q: From left to right across each period (row) of the periodic table, each element has atoms with one more proton
and one more electron than the element before it. How might this be related to the properties of nonmetals?
A: Because nonmetals are on the right side of the periodic table, they have more electrons in their outer energy level
than elements on the left side or in the middle of the periodic table. The number of electrons in the outer energy
level of an atom determines many of its properties.

Properties of Nonmetals

As their name suggests, nonmetals generally have properties that are very different from the properties of metals.
Properties of nonmetals include a relatively low boiling point, which explains why many of them are gases at room
temperature. However, some nonmetals are solids at room temperature, including the three pictured above, and one
nonmetal—bromine—is a liquid at room temperature. Other properties of nonmetals are illustrated and described in
the Table 2.10.

Property
Most nonmetals are poor conductors of heat. In fact,
they are such poor conductors of heat that they are often
used for insulation. For example, the down ﬁlling in
this sleeping bag is full of air, which consists primarily
of the nonmetal gases oxygen and nitrogen. These
gases prevent body heat from escaping to the cold
outside air.
Solid nonmetals are generally dull and brittle like these
pieces of iodine. Like other nonmetals, iodine lacks the
luster of metals and will easily crack and crumble.

Reactivity of Nonmetals

Reactivity is how likely an element is to react chemically with other elements. Some nonmetals are extremely
reactive, whereas others are completely nonreactive. What explains this variation in nonmetals? The answer is
their number of valence electrons. These are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that are involved in
interactions with other atoms. Let’s look at two examples of nonmetals, ﬂuorine and neon. Simple atomic models
of these two elements are shown in the Figure 2.97.
Q: Which element, ﬂuorine or neon, do you predict is more reactive?
A: Fluorine is more reactive than neon. That’s because it has seven of eight possible electrons in its outer energy
level, whereas neon already has eight electrons in this energy level.

FIGURE 2.97

Although neon has just one more electron than ﬂuorine in its outer energy level, that one electron makes a huge
difference. Fluorine needs one more electron to ﬁll its outer energy level in order to have the most stable arrangement
of electrons. Therefore, ﬂuorine readily accepts an electron from any element that is equally “eager” to give one
up, such as the metal lithium or sodium. As a result, ﬂuorine is highly reactive. In fact, reactions with ﬂuorine are
often explosive, as you can see in the URL below. Neon, on the other hand, already has a full outer energy level. It

287

2.48. Nonmetals

www.ck12.org

is already very stable and never reacts with other elements. It neither accepts nor gives up electrons. Neon doesn’t
even react with ﬂuorine, which reacts with all other elements except helium.

Why Most Nonmetals Cannot Conduct Electricity

Like most other nonmetals, ﬂuorine cannot conduct electricity, and its electrons explain this as well. An electric
current is a ﬂow of electrons. Elements that readily give up electrons (the metals) can carry electric current because
their electrons can ﬂow freely. Elements that gain electrons instead of giving them up cannot carry electric current.
They hold onto their electrons so they cannot ﬂow.

Summary

• Nonmetals are elements that generally cannot conduct electricity. They are the second largest class of elements

after metals. Examples of nonmetals include hydrogen, carbon, chlorine, and helium.

• Properties of nonmetals include a relatively low boiling point, so many nonmetals are gases. Nonmetals are

also poor conductors of heat, and solid nonmetals are dull and brittle.

• Some nonmetals are very reactive, whereas others are not reactive at all. It depends on the number of electrons

in their outer energy level.

• Reactive nonmetals tend to gain electrons. This explains why they cannot conduct electricity, which is a ﬂow

of electrons.

What is this intricate orb? It is the greatly magniﬁed skeleton of single-celled ocean organisms call radiolarian. The
skeleton is made of an element that is extremely common on Earth. In fact, it is the second most abundant element
in Earth’s crust. It is also one of the most common elements in the entire universe. What is this important element?
Its name is silicon, and it belongs to a class of elements called metalloids.

What Are Metalloids

Metalloids are the smallest class of elements. (The other two classes of elements are metals and nonmetals). There
are just six metalloids. In addition to silicon, they include boron, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium.
Metalloids fall between metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. They also fall between metals and nonmetals in
terms of their properties.
Q: How does the position of an element in the periodic table inﬂuence its properties?
A: Elements are arranged in the periodic table by their atomic number, which is the number of protons in their atoms.
Atoms are neutral in electric charge, so they always have the same number of electrons as protons. It is the number
of electrons in the outer energy level of atoms that determines most of the properties of elements.

Chemical Properties of Metalloids

How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of electrons in
the outer energy level of their atoms. Metalloids have from three to six electrons in their outer energy level. Boron,
pictured in the Figure 2.98, is the only metalloid with just three electrons in its outer energy level. It tends to act
like metals by giving up its electrons in chemical reactions. Metalloids with more than four electrons in their outer

Chapter 2. Matter

energy level (arsenic, antimony, and tellurium) tend to act like nonmetals by gaining electrons in chemical reactions.
Those with exactly four electrons in their outer energy level (silicon and germanium) may act like either metals or
nonmetals, depending on the other elements in the reaction.

FIGURE 2.98

Physical Properties of Metalloids

Most metalloids have some physical properties of metals and some physical properties of nonmetals. For example,
metals are good conductors of both heat and electricity, whereas nonmetals generally cannot conduct heat or
electricity. And metalloids? They fall between metals and nonmetals in their ability to conduct heat, and if they
can conduct electricity, they usually can do so only at higher temperatures. Metalloids that can conduct electricity
at higher temperatures are called semiconductors. Silicon is an example of a semiconductor. It is used to make the
tiny electric circuits in computer chips. You can see a sample of silicon and a silicon chip in the Figure 2.99.

Metalloids tend to be shiny like metals but brittle like nonmetals. Because they are brittle, they may chip like glass
or crumble to a powder if struck. Other physical properties of metalloids are more variable, including their boiling
and melting points, although all metalloids exist as solids at room temperature. You can learn about the properties

Summary

• Metalloids are the smallest class of elements, containing just six elements. They fall between metals and

nonmetals in the periodic table.

• How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of elec-
trons in the outer energy level of their atoms. Metalloids may act either like metals or nonmetals in chemical
reactions.

• Most metalloids have some physical properties of metals and some physical properties of nonmetals. They

Did you ever play the card game called go ﬁsh? Players try to form groups of cards of the same value, such as four
sevens, with the cards they are dealt or by getting cards from other players or the deck. This give and take of cards
is a simple analogy for the way atoms give and take valence electrons in chemical reactions.

What Are Valence Electrons?

Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that can participate in interactions with other
atoms. Valence electrons are generally the electrons that are farthest from the nucleus. As a result, they may be
attracted as much or more by the nucleus of another atom than they are by their own nucleus.

293

2.50. Valence Electrons

Electron Dot Diagrams

www.ck12.org

Because valence electrons are so important, atoms are often represented by simple diagrams that show only their
valence electrons. These are called electron dot diagrams, and three are shown below. In this type of diagram, an
element’s chemical symbol is surrounded by dots that represent the valence electrons. Typically, the dots are drawn
as if there is a square surrounding the element symbol with up to two dots per side. An element never has more than
eight valence electrons, so there can’t be more than eight dots per atom.

Q: Carbon (C) has four valence electrons. What does an electron dot diagram for this element look like?
A: An electron dot diagram for carbon looks like this:

Valence Electrons and the Periodic Table

The number of valence electrons in an atom is reﬂected by its position in the periodic table of the elements (see
the periodic table in the Figure 2.100). Across each row, or period, of the periodic table, the number of valence
electrons in groups 1–2 and 13–18 increases by one from one element to the next. Within each column, or group,
of the table, all the elements have the same number of valence electrons. This explains why all the elements in the
same group have very similar chemical properties.
For elements in groups 1–2 and 13–18, the number of valence electrons is easy to tell directly from the periodic
table. This is illustrated in the simpliﬁed periodic table in the Figure 2.101. It shows just the numbers of valence
electrons in each of these groups. For elements in groups 3–12, determining the number of valence electrons is more
complicated. You can learn more about the valence electrons of elements in these groups at this URL: http://www.c
olorado.edu/physics/2000/periodic_table/transition_elements.html .
Q: Based on both periodic tables above ( Figures 2.100 and 2.101), what are examples of elements that have just one
valence electron? What are examples of elements that have eight valence electrons? How many valence electrons
does oxygen (O) have?
A: Any element in group 1 has just one valence electron. Examples include hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium
(Na). Any element in group 18 has eight valence electrons (except for helium, which has a total of just two electrons).
Examples include neon (Ne), argon (Ar), and krypton (Kr). Oxygen, like all the other elements in group 16, has six
valence electrons.

Valence Electrons and Reactivity

The table salt pictured in the Figure 2.102 contains two elements that are so reactive they are rarely found alone
in nature. Instead, they undergo chemical reactions with other elements and form compounds. Table salt is the

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter

FIGURE 2.100

compound named sodium chloride (NaCl). It forms when an atom of sodium (Na) gives up an electron and an
atom of chlorine (Cl) accepts it. When this happens, sodium becomes a positively charged ion (Na+), and chlorine
becomes a negatively charged ion (Cl−). The two ions are attracted to each and join a matrix of interlocking sodium
and chloride ions, forming a crystal of salt.
Q: Why does sodium give up an electron?
A: An atom of a group 1 element such as sodium has just one valence electron. It is “eager” to give up this electron
in order to have a full outer energy level, because this will give it the most stable arrangement of electrons. You can
see how this happens in the animation at the following URL and in the Figure 2.103. Group 2 elements with two
valence electrons are almost as reactive as elements in group 1 for the same reason.

Q: Why does chlorine accept the electron from sodium?
A: An atom of a group 17 element such as chlorine has seven valence electrons. It is “eager” to gain an extra electron
to ﬁll its outer energy level and gain stability. Group 16 elements with six valence electrons are almost as reactive
for the same reason.
Atoms of group 18 elements have eight valence electrons (or two in the case of helium). These elements already
have a full outer energy level, so they are very stable. As a result, they rarely if ever react with other elements.
Elements in other groups vary in their reactivity but are generally less reactive than elements in groups 1, 2, 16, or

Chapter 2. Matter

A: Calcium is a group 2 element with two valence electrons. Therefore, it is very reactive and gives up electrons in
chemical reactions. It is likely to react with an element with six valence electrons that “wants” to gain two electrons.
This would be an element in group 6, such as oxygen.

Valence Electrons and Electricity

Valence electrons also determine how well—if at all—the atoms of an element conduct electricity. The copper wires
in the cable in the Figure 2.104 are coated with plastic. Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity, so it is used
for wires that carry electric current. Plastic contains mainly carbon, which cannot conduct electricity, so it is used as
insulation on the wires.

FIGURE 2.104

Q: Why do copper and carbon differ in their ability to conduct electricity?
A: Atoms of metals such as copper easily give up valence electrons. Their electrons can move freely and carry
electric current. You can see in detail how this occurs at the URL below. Atoms of nonmetals such as the carbon, on
the other hand, hold onto their electrons. Their electrons can’t move freely and carry current.
http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/conins.html
A few elements, called metalloids, can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals. Examples include silicon
and germanium in group 14. Both become better conductors at higher temperatures. These elements are called
semiconductors.
Q: How many valence electrons do atoms of silicon and germanium have? What happens to their valence electrons
when the atoms are exposed to an electric ﬁeld?
A: Atoms of these two elements have four valence electrons. When the atoms are exposed to an electric ﬁeld, the
valence electrons move away from the atoms and allow current to ﬂow.

Summary

• Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that can participate in interactions with

other atoms.

• Because valence electrons are so important, atoms may be represented by electron dot diagrams that show

only their valence electrons.

• The number of valence electrons in atoms may cause them to be unreactive or highly reactive. For those
atoms that are reactive, the number of valence electrons also determines whether they tend to give up or gain
electrons in chemical reactions.

• Metals, which easily give up electrons, can conduct electricity. Nonmetals, which attract electrons, generally

cannot. Metalloids such as silicon and germanium can conduct electricity but not as well as metals.

2.51 Hydrogen and Alkali Metals

• Identify the elements in group 1 of the periodic table.
• Explain why group 1 elements are very reactive.
• List other properties of alkali metals.

You probably think of water as a substance that can put out ﬁres. But some elements are so reactive that they burn
in water. In fact, they virtually explode in water. That’s what is happening in the photo above. About 3 pounds of
sodium were added to water, and the result was this explosive reaction. Why is sodium such a reactive element? In
this lesson you will ﬁnd out.

The First Group

Sodium (Na) is an element in group 1 of the periodic table of the elements. This group (column) of the table is
shown below. It includes the nonmetal hydrogen (H) and six metals that are called alkali metals. Elements in the
same group of the periodic table have the same number of valence electrons. These are the electrons in their outer
energy level that can be involved in chemical reactions. Valence electrons determine many of the properties of an
element, so elements in the same group have similar properties. All the elements in group 1 have just one valence
electron. This makes them very reactive.
Q: Why does having just one valence electron make group 1 elements very reactive?
A: With just one valence electron, group 1 elements are “eager” to lose that electron. Doing so allows them to
achieve a full outer energy level and maximum stability.

2.51. Hydrogen and Alkali Metals

Reactivity of Group 1 Elements

Hydrogen is a very reactive gas, and the alkali metals are even more reactive. In fact, they are the most reactive
metals and, along with the elements in group 17, are the most reactive of all elements. The reactivity of alkali metals
increases from the top to the bottom of the group, so lithium (Li) is the least reactive alkali metal and francium (Fr)
is the most reactive. Because alkali metals are so reactive, they are found in nature only in combination with other
elements. They often combine with group 17 elements, which are very “eager” to gain an electron. At the URL
below, you can watch a video that shows just how reactive the alkali metals are.

Other Properties of Alkali Metals

Chapter 2. Matter

Besides being very reactive, alkali metals share a number of other properties.

• Alkali metals are all solids at room temperature.
• Alkali metals are low in density, and some of them ﬂoat on water.
• Alkali metals are relatively soft. Some are even soft enough to cut with a knife, like the sodium pictured in

the Figure 2.105.

FIGURE 2.105

A Closer Look

Although all group 1 elements share certain properties, such as being very reactive, they are not alike in every way.
Three different group 1 elements are described in more detail below ( Figures 2.106, 2.107, and 2.108). Notice the
ways in which they differ from one another.

FIGURE 2.106
Hydrogen has the smallest, lightest atoms
of all elements.
Pure hydrogen is a
colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that is
nontoxic but highly ﬂammable. Hydrogen
gas exists mainly as diatomic (“two-atom”)
molecules (H2), as shown in the diagram
on the right. Hydrogen is the most abun-
dant element in the universe and the third
most abundant element on Earth, occur-
ring mainly in compounds such as water.

Q: Why do you think hydrogen gas usually exists as diatomic molecules?

301

2.51. Hydrogen and Alkali Metals

www.ck12.org

A: Each hydrogen atom has just one electron. When two hydrogen atoms bond together, they share a pair of
electrons. The shared electrons ﬁll their only energy level, giving them the most stable arrangement of electrons.

FIGURE 2.107
Potassium is a soft, silvery metal
that
ignites explosively in water. It easily loses
its one valence electron to form positive
potassium ions (K+), which are needed
by all living cells. Potassium is so impor-
tant for plants that it is found in almost
all fertilizers,
like the one shown here.
Potassium is abundant in Earth’s crust in
minerals such as feldspar.

Q: Francium decays too quickly to form compounds with other elements. Which elements to you think it would
bond with if it could?
A: With one valence electron, francium would bond with a halogen element in group 17, which has seven valence
electrons and needs one more to ﬁll its outer energy level. Elements in group 17 include ﬂuorine and chlorine.

Summary

• Group 1 of the periodic table includes hydrogen and the alkali metals.
• Because they have just one valence electron, group 1 elements are very reactive. As a result, they are found in

nature only in combination with other elements.

• Alkali metals are all solids at room temperature. They are relatively soft and low in density.
• From the top to the bottom of group 1, the elements have heavier, more reactive atoms.

Reactivity of Alkaline Earth Metals

All alkaline Earth metals have similar properties because they all have two valence electrons. They readily give up
their two valence electrons to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. As
a result, they are very reactive, although not quite as reactive as the alkali metals in group 1. For example, alkaline
Earth metals will react with cold water, but not explosively as alkali metals do. Because of their reactivity, alkaline
Earth metals never exist as pure substances in nature. Instead, they are always found combined with other elements.
The reactivity of alkaline Earth metals increases from the top to the bottom of the group. That’s because the atoms
get bigger from the top to the bottom, so the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus. When valence electrons
are farther from the nucleus, they are attracted less strongly by the nucleus and more easily removed from the atom.
This makes the atom more reactive.
Q: Alkali metals have just one valence electron. Why are alkaline Earth metals less reactive than alkali metals?
A: It takes more energy to remove two valence electrons from an atom than one valence electron. This makes
alkaline Earth metals with their two valence electrons less reactive than alkali metals with their one valence electron.

305

2.52. Alkaline Earth Metals

Examples of Alkaline Earth Metals

www.ck12.org

For a better understanding of alkaline Earth metals, let’s take a closer look at two of them: calcium (Ca) and
strontium (Sr). Calcium is a soft, gray, nontoxic alkaline Earth metal. Although pure calcium doesn’t exist in nature,
calcium compounds are very common in Earth’s crust and in sea water. Calcium is also the most abundant metal
in the human body, occurring as calcium compounds such as calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. These
calcium compounds are found in bones and make them hard and strong. The skeleton of the average adult contains
about a kilogram of calcium. Because calcium—like barium—absorbs x-rays, bones show up white in x-ray images.
Calcium is an important component of a healthy human diet. Good food sources of calcium are pictured in Figure
2.109.

FIGURE 2.109

Q: What health problems might result from a diet low in calcium?
A: Children who don’t get enough calcium while their bones are forming may develop a deﬁciency disease called
rickets, in which their bones are softer than normal and become bent and stunted. Adults who don’t get enough
calcium may develop a condition called osteoporosis, in which the bones lose calcium and become weak and brittle.
People with osteoporosis are at high risk of bone fractures.
Strontium is a silver-colored alkaline Earth metal that is even softer than calcium. Strontium compounds are quite
common and have a variety of uses—from ﬁreworks to cement to toothpaste. In ﬁreworks, strontium compounds
produce deep red explosions. In toothpaste, like the one pictured in the Figure 2.110, the compound strontium
chloride reduces tooth sensitivity.

Summary

• Elements in group 2 of the periodic table are called alkaline Earth metals. They are silvery or gray in color.

They are also relatively soft and low in density.

• Alkaline Earth metals are very reactive because they readily give up their two valence electrons to achieve a
full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Reactivity increases from the top to
the bottom of the group.

• Examples of alkaline Earth metals include calcium, which is needed for strong bones, and strontium, which is

used for making cement and other products.

2.53 Transition Metals

• Identify transition metals.
• List properties of transition metals.
• Describe the lanthanides and actinides.

What do all of the objects pictured above have in common? All of them are made completely or primarily of copper.
Copper has an amazing variety of uses, including cooking pots, plumbing pipes, rooﬁng tiles, jewelry, musical
instruments, and electric wires. Copper is a good choice for these and many other objects because of its properties.
It can be formed into wires and ﬂat sheets, it’s a great conductor of heat and electricity, it’s hard and strong, and it
doesn’t corrode easily. In all these ways, copper is a typical transition metal.

What Are Transition Metals?

Transition metals are all the elements in groups 3–12 of the periodic table. In the periodic table pictured in Figure
2.111, they are the elements shaded yellow, pink, and purple. The transition metals make up about 60 percent of
all known elements. In addition to copper (Cu), well known examples of transition metals include iron (Fe), zinc
(Zn), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) (Copper (Cu) is pictured in its various applications in the opening image). You can
explore speciﬁc transition metals with the interactive periodic table at this URL: http://www.ptable.com/ .
Q: Transition metals have been called the most typical of all metals. What do you think this means?
A: Unlike some other metals, transition metals have the properties that deﬁne the metals class. They are excellent
conductors of electricity, for example, and they also have luster, malleability, and ductility. You can read more about
these properties of transition metals below.

Properties of Transition Metals

Transition metals are superior conductors of heat as well as electricity. They are malleable, which means they can
be shaped into sheets, and ductile, which means they can be shaped into wires. They have high melting and boiling
points, and all are solids at room temperature, except for mercury (Hg), which is a liquid. Transition metals are
also high in density and very hard. Most of them are white or silvery in color, and they are generally lustrous, or

shiny. The compounds that transition metals form with other elements are often very colorful. You can see several
examples in the Figure 2.112.

FIGURE 2.112

Some properties of transition metals set them apart from other metals. Compared with the alkali metals in group 1

309

2.53. Transition Metals

www.ck12.org

and the alkaline Earth metals in group 2, the transition metals are much less reactive. They don’t react quickly with
water or oxygen, which explains why they resist corrosion.
Other properties of the transition metals are unique. They are the only elements that may use electrons in the next
to highest—as well as the highest—energy level as valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons that form
bonds with other elements in compounds and that generally determine the properties of elements. Transition metals
are unusual in having very similar properties even with different numbers of valence electrons. The transition metals
also include the only elements that produce a magnetic ﬁeld. Three of them have this property: iron (Fe), cobalt
(Co), and nickel (Ni).
Q: How is the number of valence electrons typically related to the properties of elements?
A: The number of valence electrons usually determines how reactive elements are as well as the ways in which they
react with other elements.

Those Elements Down Under

Transition metals include the elements that are most often placed below the periodic table (the pink- and purple-
shaded elements in the Figure 2.111). Those that follow lanthanum (La) are called lanthanides. They are all
relatively reactive for transition metals. Those that follow actinium (Ac) are called actinides. They are all radioactive.
This means that they are unstable, so they decay into different, more stable elements. Many of the actinides do not
occur in nature but are made in laboratories.

Summary

• Transition metals are all the elements in groups 3–12 of the periodic table. More than half of all elements are

transition metals.

• Transition metals are typical metals, with properties such as a superior ability to conduct electricity and heat.
They also have the metallic properties of luster, malleability, and ductility. In addition, transition metals have
high melting and boiling points and high density.

• The lanthanides and actinides are the transition metals that are usually placed below the main part of the

periodic table. Lanthanides are relatively reactive for transition metals, and actinides are radioactive.

2.54 Groups with Metalloids

• Identify elements in groups 13–16 of the periodic table.
• List properties of a metalloid from each of these groups.

This image represents a famous ancient Egyptian named Tutankhamen. Do you see his heavy eyeliner? Most
likely the eyeliner was made of a mineral containing antimony. This metalloid was commonly used for makeup by
Egyptians between four and ﬁve thousand years ago. Today we know that antimony is toxic, although Tutankhamen
probably didn’t know that. Antimony is found in group 15 of the periodic table. Group 15 is one of four groups of
the periodic table that contain metalloids.

Groups 13–16

Groups 13–16 of the periodic table (orange in the Figure 2.113) are the only groups that contain elements classiﬁed
as metalloids. Unlike other groups of the periodic table, which contain elements in just one class, groups 13–16
contain elements in at least two different classes. In addition to metalloids, they also contain metals, nonmetals, or
both. Groups 13–16 fall between the transition metals (in groups 3–12) and the nonmetals called halogens (in group
17).

What Are Metalloids?

Metalloids are the smallest class of elements, containing just six members: boron (B), silicon (Si), germanium
(Ge), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and tellurium (Te). Metalloids have some properties of metals (elements that can
conduct electricity) and some properties of nonmetals (elements that cannot conduct electricity). For example, most
metalloids can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals. Metalloids also tend to be shiny like metals, but brittle
like nonmetals. Chemically, metalloids may behave like metals or nonmetals, depending on their number of valence

electrons. You can learn more about speciﬁc metalloids by clicking on the element symbols in the periodic table at
this URL: http://www.chemicool.com/ .
Q: Why does the chemical behavior of an element depend on its number of valence electrons?
A: Valence electrons are the electrons in an atom’s outer energy level that may be involved in chemical reactions
with other atoms.

Group 13: Boron Group

Group 13 of the periodic table is also called the boron group because boron (B) is the ﬁrst element at the top
of the group (see Figure 2.114). Boron is also the only metalloid in this group. The other four elements in the
group—aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), and thallium (Tl)—are all metals. Group 13 elements have three
valence electrons and are fairly reactive. All of them are solids at room temperature.

Group 14: Carbon Group

Group 14 of the periodic table is headed by the nonmetal carbon (C), so this group is also called the carbon group.
Carbon is followed by silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) ( Figure 2.115), which are metalloids, and then by tin (Sn)
and lead (Pb), which are metals. Group 14 elements group have four valence electrons, so they generally aren’t very

cuits on computer chips.
It is also used
to make ﬁber optic cables—like the one
pictured here—that carry telephone and
other communication signals.

Group 15: Nitrogen Group

Group 15 of the periodic table is also called the nitrogen group. The ﬁrst element in the group is the nonmetal
nitrogen (N), followed by phosphorus (P), another nonmetal. Arsenic (As) ( Figure 2.116) and antimony (Sb) are
the metalloids in this group, and bismuth (Bi) is a metal. All group 15 elements have ﬁve valence electrons, but they
vary in their reactivity. Nitrogen, for example, is not very reactive at all, whereas phosphorus is very reactive and
found naturally only in combination with other substances. All group 15 elements are solids, except for nitrogen,
which is a gas.

The most common form of the metalloid
arsenic is gray and shiny. Arsenic is
extremely toxic, so it is used as rat poison.
Surprisingly, we need it (in tiny amounts)
for normal growth and a healthy nervous
system.

Group 16: Oxygen Group

Group 16 of the periodic table is also called the oxygen group. The ﬁrst three elements—oxygen (O), sulfur (S),
and selenium (Se)—are nonmetals. They are followed by tellurium (Te) ( Figure 2.117), a metalloid, and polonium
(Po), a metal. All group 16 elements have six valence electrons and are very reactive. Oxygen is a gas at room
temperature, and the other elements in the group are solids.

FIGURE 2.117
Tellurium is a silvery white, brittle met-
alloid.
It is toxic and may cause birth
defects. Tellurium can conduct electricity
when exposed to light, so it is used to
make solar panels.
It has several other
uses as well. For example, it makes steel
and copper easier to work with and lends
color to ceramics.

Q: With six valence electrons, group 16 elements need to attract two electrons from another element to have a stable
electron arrangement of eight valence electrons. Which group of elements in the periodic table do you think might
form compounds with elements in group 16?
A: Group 2 elements, called the alkaline Earth metals, form compounds with elements in the oxygen group. That’s
because group 2 elements have two valence electrons that they are “eager” to give up. An example of a group 2 and
group 6 compound is calcium oxide (CaO).

2.55 Halogens

• Identify halogens.
• Describe physical and chemical properties of halogens.
• List some uses of halogens.

You’ve probably seen halogen lights like the ones pictured here. You may even have halogen lights in your home. If
you do, you may have noticed that they get really hot and give off a lot of light for their size. A halogen light differs
from a regular incandescent light bulb in having a small amount of halogen gas inside the bulb. The gas combines
chemically with the metal in the ﬁlament, and this extends the life of the ﬁlament. It allows the lamp to get hotter and
give off more light than a regular incandescent light without burning out quickly. What is halogen gas, and which
elements are halogens? In this article, you’ll ﬁnd out.

Meet the Halogens

Halogens are highly reactive nonmetallic elements in group 17 of the periodic table. As you can see in the periodic
table shown in the Figure 2.118, the halogens include the elements ﬂuorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine
(I), and astatine (At). All of them are relatively common on Earth except for astatine. Astatine is radioactive and
rapidly decays to other, more stable elements. As a result, it is one of the least common elements on Earth.
Q: Based on their position in the periodic table from the Figure 2.118, how many valence electrons do you think
halogens have?
A: The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in group 1. It then increases by one from left to right
across each period (row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18. Therefore, halogens have seven valence
electrons.

Chemical Properties of Halogens

The halogens are among the most reactive of all elements, although reactivity declines from the top to the bottom of
the halogen group. Because all halogens have seven valence electrons, they are “eager” to gain one more electron.
Doing so gives them a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Halogens often
combine with alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table. Alkali metals have just one valence electron, which they
are equally “eager” to donate. Reactions involving halogens, especially halogens near the top of the group, may be
explosive. You can see some examples in the video at the URL below. (Warning: Don’t try any of these reactions at
home!)

Physical Properties of Halogens

www.ck12.org

The halogen group is quite diverse.
It includes elements that occur in three different states of matter at room
temperature. Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine and astatine are solids. Halogens also
vary in color, as you can see in the Figure 2.119. Fluorine and chlorine are green, bromine is red, and iodine and
astatine are nearly black. Like other nonmetals, halogens cannot conduct electricity or heat. Compared with most
other elements, halogens have relatively low melting and boiling points. You can watch a lab demonstration of the
melting and boiling points of halogens at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP0U5rGWqdg .

Chlorine is the active ingredient in household bleach.
It removes stains from clothes. It can also be used to
disinfect countertops and other surfaces.

Use
Bromine is used to purify water in swimming pools and
hot tubs. It reacts with bacteria and other germs and
renders them harmless.

Iodine is added to alcohol and used as an antiseptic. It
reacts with germs on cuts and wounds. Small amounts
of iodine are also needed for good health.
In the
U.S., iodine is added to table salt to prevent iodine
deﬁciencies. Does the salt you use contain iodine?

Q: Can you relate some of these uses of halogens to the properties of these elements?
A: The ability of halogens to kill germs and bleach clothes relates to their highly reactive nature.

Summary

• Halogens are highly reactive nonmetal elements in group 17 of the periodic table.
• Halogens include solids, liquids, and gases at room temperature, and they vary in color.
• Halogens are among the most reactive of all elements. They have seven valence electrons, so they are very

“eager” to gain one electron to have a full outer energy level.

• Halogens have a variety of important uses, such as preventing tooth decay and killing germs.

2.56 Noble Gases

• Identify the noble gases.
• List properties of noble gases.
• Explain the nonreactivity of noble gases and how it is related to the octet rule.

Okay, helium balloons are light, but they’re not that light! This fanciful picture serves to make the point that helium
is one of the lightest elements. Helium belongs to a group of elements called the noble gases.

What Are Noble Gases?

Noble gases are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the periodic table. As you can see in the periodic
table in Figure 2.120, noble gases include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon
(Rn). All noble gases are colorless and odorless. They also have low boiling points, explaining why they are gases
at room temperature. Radon, at the bottom of the group, is radioactive, so it constantly decays to other elements. For
an excellent overview of the noble gases, watch the video at this URL:

FIGURE 2.120

Q: Based on their position in the periodic table ( Figure 2.120), how many valence electrons do you think noble
gases have?
A: The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in group 1. It then increases by one from left to right
across each period (row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18. Therefore, noble gases have eight valence
electrons.

321

2.56. Noble Gases

www.ck12.org

Chemical Properties of Noble Gases

Noble gases are the least reactive of all known elements. That’s because with eight valence electrons, their outer
energy levels are full. The only exception is helium, which has just two electrons. But helium also has a full outer
energy level, because its only energy level (energy level 1) can hold a maximum of two electrons. A full outer energy
level is the most stable arrangement of electrons. As a result, noble gases cannot become more stable by reacting
with other elements and gaining or losing valence electrons. Therefore, noble gases are rarely involved in chemical
reactions and almost never form compounds with other elements.

Noble Gases and the Octet Rule

Because the noble gases are the least reactive of all elements, their eight valence electrons are used as the standard
for nonreactivity and to explain how other elements interact. This is stated as the octet (“group of eight”) rule.
According to this rule, atoms react to form compounds that allow them to have a group of eight valence electrons
like the noble gases. For example, sodium (with one valence electron) reacts with chlorine (with seven valence
electrons) to form the stable compound sodium chloride (table salt). In this reaction, sodium donates an electron and
chlorine accepts it, giving each element an octet of valence electrons.

Some Uses of Noble Gases

Did you ever get helium balloons like those in the opening picture? Unlike a balloon ﬁlled with air, a balloon ﬁlled
with helium needs to be weighted down so it won’t ﬂoat away —although you don’t have to use an elephant!.
Q: Why does a helium balloon ﬂoat away if it’s not weighted down?
A: Helium atoms have just two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons, so they have less mass than any other
atoms except hydrogen. As a result, helium is lighter than air, explaining why a helium balloon ﬂoats up into the air
unless weighted down.
Early incandescent light bulbs, like the one pictured in the Figure 2.121, didn’t last very long. The ﬁlaments quickly
burned out. Although air was pumped out of the bulb, it wasn’t a complete vacuum. Oxygen in the small amount
of air remaining inside the light bulb reacted with the metal ﬁlament. This corroded the ﬁlament and caused dark
deposits on the glass. Filling a light bulb with argon gas prevents these problems. That’s why modern light bulbs are
ﬁlled with argon.
Q: How does argon prevent the problems of early light bulbs?
A: As a noble gas with eight electrons, argon doesn’t react with the metal in the ﬁlament. This protects the ﬁlament
and keeps the glass blub free of deposits.
Noble gases are also used to ﬁll the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure 2.122. Although noble
gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When
this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level,
they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange
light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.

Summary

• Noble gases are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the periodic table.
• Noble gases are the least reactive of all elements. That’s because they have eight valence electrons, which
ﬁll their outer energy level. This is the most stable arrangement of electrons, so noble gases rarely react with
other elements and form compounds.

Yummy! S’mores are on the way! Did you ever toast marshmallows over a campﬁre? The sweet treats singe on the
outside and melt on the inside. Both the ﬁre and the toasted marshmallows are evidence of chemical changes. In
the process of burning, the wood changes to ashes and gases, and the outside of the marshmallow turns brown and
crispy. Neither the wood nor the marshmallows can change back to their original form. That’s because burning is a
chemical change and chemical changes are often impossible to undo. In this unit, you’ll learn about many types of
chemical changes, including how they occur and why you can’t live without them.

• Explain why chemical bonds form.
• Compare and contrast types of chemical bonds.

Did you ever make cupcakes from scratch? You mix together ﬂour, sugar, eggs, and other ingredients to make
the batter, put the batter into cupcake papers, and then put them into the oven to bake. The cupcakes that come
out of the oven after baking are different from any of the individual ingredients that went into the batter. Like
the ingredients that join together to make cupcakes, atoms of different elements can join together to form entirely
different substances called compounds. In cupcakes, the eggs and other wet ingredients cause the dry ingredients to
stick together. What causes elements to stick together in compounds? The answer is chemical bonds.

What Is a Chemical Bond?

A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions. Bonds form when atoms share or transfer valence
electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that may be involved in chemical
interactions. Valence electrons are the basis of all chemical bonds. For a video introduction to chemical bonds, go

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Q: Why do you think that chemical bonds form?
A: Chemical bonds form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons.

Why Bonds Form

To understand why chemical bonds form, consider the common compound known as water, or H2O. It consists of
two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom. As you can see in the on the left side of the Figure 3.1, each
hydrogen atom has just one electron, which is also its sole valence electron. The oxygen atom has six valence
electrons. These are the electrons in the outer energy level of the oxygen atom.

FIGURE 3.1

In the water molecule on the right in the Figure 3.1, each hydrogen atom shares a pair of electrons with the oxygen
atom. By sharing electrons, each atom has electrons available to ﬁll its sole or outer energy level. The hydrogen
atoms each have a pair of shared electrons, so their ﬁrst and only energy level is full. The oxygen atom has a total
of eight valence electrons, so its outer energy level is full. A full outer energy level is the most stable possible
arrangement of electrons. It explains why elements form chemical bonds with each other.

Types of Chemical Bonds

Not all chemical bonds form in the same way as the bonds in water. There are actually three different types of
chemical bonds, called covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds. Each type of bond is described below. You can learn
more about the three types by watching this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEFeLYWTKX0

• A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two nonmetal atoms that share a pair of electrons.
One electron is provided by each atom, and the pair of electrons is attracted to the positive nuclei of both
atoms. The water molecule represented in the Figure 3.1 contains covalent bonds.

• An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together oppositely charged ions. Ionic bonds form crystals

instead of molecules. Table salt contains ionic bonds.

• A metallic bond is the force of attraction between a positive metal ion and the valence electrons that surround
it—both its own valence electrons and those of other ions of the same metal. The ions and electrons form a
lattice-like structure. Only metals, such as the copper pictured in the Figure 3.2, form metallic bonds.

FIGURE 3.2
Metallic bonds explain many of the properties of metals. This coil of wire
is made of the metal copper. Like other metals, copper is shiny, can be
formed into wires, and conducts electricity.

Summary

• A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions. Bonds form when atoms share or transfer

valence electrons.

• Atoms form chemical bonds to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of

electrons.

• There are three different types of chemical bonds: covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds.

• Identify the type of matter called a compound.
• Explain how the same elements can form different compounds.
• List two types of chemical compounds.

Look at all the colors you can make by mixing together just a few colors of paint. In the photo above, the rainbow of
colors on the brush formed from just four paint colors: green, yellow, red, and blue. The same thing is true of matter
in general. By combining just a few different elements, you can form many different chemical compounds.

What Are Compounds?

A compound is a unique substance that forms when two or more elements combine chemically. Compounds form
as a result of chemical reactions. The elements in compounds are held together by chemical bonds. A chemical
bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions that share or transfer valence electrons. For a video introduction

Same Elements, Different Compounds

Look at the Figure 3.4 of water (H2O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and read about these two compounds. Both
compounds consist of hydrogen and oxygen, but they have different ratios of the two elements. As a result, water
and hydrogen peroxide are different compounds with different properties. If you’ve ever used hydrogen peroxide to
disinfect a cut, then you know that it is very different from water!

Q: Read the Figure 3.5 about carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). Both compounds consist of carbon
and oxygen, but in different ratios. How can you tell that carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are different
compounds?
A: You can tell that they are different compounds from their very different properties. Carbon dioxide is a harmless
gas that living things add to the atmosphere during respiration. Carbon monoxide is a deadly gas that can quickly
kill people if it becomes too concentrated in the air.

FIGURE 3.5
Carbon Dioxide: Every time you exhale,
you release carbon dioxide into the air.
It’s an odorless, colorless gas.
Car-
bon dioxide contributes to global climate
change, but it isn’t directly harmful to hu-
man health. Carbon Monoxide: Carbon
monoxide is produced when matter burns.
It’s a colorless, odorless gas that is very
harmful to human health.
In fact, it can
kill people in minutes. Because you can’t
see or smell carbon monoxide, it must be
detected with an alarm.

Types of Compounds

• Covalent compounds consist of atoms that are held together by covalent bonds. These bonds form between
nonmetals that share valence electrons. Covalent compounds exist as individual molecules. Water is an
example of a covalent compound.

• Ionic compounds consist of ions that are held together by ionic bonds. These bonds form when metals transfer
electrons to nonmetals. Ionic compounds exist as a matrix of many ions, called a crystal. Sodium chloride
(table salt) is an example of an ionic compound.

You can make a simple salad dressing using just the two ingredients pictured above: oil and vinegar. Recipes for
oil-and-vinegar salad dressing vary, but they typically include about three parts oil to one part vinegar, or a ratio of
3:1. For example, if you wanted to make a cup of salad dressing, you could mix together 3
4 cup
of vinegar. Chemical compounds also have “ingredients” in a certain ratio. However, unlike oil-and-vinegar salad
dressing, a chemical compound always has exactly the same ratio of elements. This ratio can be represented by a
chemical formula.

4 cup of oil and 1

Representing Compounds

In a chemical formula, the elements in a compound are represented by their chemical symbols, and the ratio of
different elements is represented by subscripts. Consider the compound water as an example. Each water molecule
contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Therefore, the chemical formula for water is:

H2O

The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen in the molecule. The O for oxygen has no
subscript. When there is just one atom of an element in a molecule, no subscript is used in the chemical formula.

3.4 Ionic Bonding

• State how ionic bonds form.
• Explain why ionic bonds form.
• Describe the role of energy in the formation of ionic bonds.

Look at the photos of bar magnets in the opening image. At ﬁrst glance, the two photos look very similar, but they
differ in one important way. In the top photo, the north (blue) poles of both magnets are placed close together. In the
bottom photo, the north pole of one magnet is placed close to the south (red) pole of the other magnet. Now look
closely at the iron ﬁlings in the two photos. The ion ﬁlings show the force of repulsion between the two north poles
in the top photo and the force of attraction between the north and south poles in the bottom photo. Like the poles of
magnets, electric charges repel or attract each other. Two positive or two negative charges repel each other, and two
opposite charges attract each other. The attraction of opposite electric charges explains how ionic bonds form.

How Ionic Bonds Form

An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together positive and negative ions. It forms when atoms of a
metallic element give up electrons to atoms of a nonmetallic element. The Figure 3.6 shows how this happens.
In row 1 of the Figure 3.6, an atom of sodium (Na) donates an electron to an atom of chlorine (Cl).

• By losing an electron, the sodium atom becomes a sodium ion. It now has more protons than electrons and a
charge of +1. Positive ions such as sodium are given the same name as the element. The chemical symbol has
a plus sign to distinguish the ion from an atom of the element. The symbol for a sodium ion is Na+.

342

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

FIGURE 3.6

• By gaining an electron, the chlorine atom becomes a chloride ion. It now has more electrons than protons and
a charge of -1. Negative ions are named by adding the sufﬁx –ide to the ﬁrst part of the element name. The
symbol for chloride is Cl−.

Sodium and chloride ions have equal but opposite charges. Opposite electric charges attract each other, so sodium
and chloride ions cling together in a strong ionic bond. You can see this in row 2 of the Figure 3.6. (Brackets
separate the ions in the diagram to show that the ions in the compound do not actually share electrons.) When ionic
bonds hold ions together, they form an ionic compound. The compound formed from sodium and chloride ions is
named sodium chloride. It is commonly called table salt. You can see an animation of sodium chloride forming at
this URL: http://www.visionlearning.com/library/module_viewer.php?mid=55

Why Ionic Bonds Form

Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals. That’s because metals “want” to give up electrons, and
nonmetals “want” to gain electrons. Find sodium (Na) in the Figure 3.7. Sodium is an alkali metal in group 1. Like
all group 1 elements, it has just one valence electron. If sodium loses that one electron, it will have a full outer
energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Now ﬁnd ﬂuorine (F) in the periodic table Figure
3.7. Fluorine is a halogen in group 17. Like all group 17 elements, ﬂuorine has seven valence electrons. If ﬂuorine
gains one electron, it will also have a full outer energy level and the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Q: Predict what other elements might form ionic bonds.
A: Metals on the left and in the center of the periodic table form ionic bonds with nonmetals on the right of the
periodic table. For example, alkali metals in group 1 form ionic bonds with halogen nonmetals in group 17.

Energy and Ionic Bonds

It takes energy to remove valence electrons from an atom because the force of attraction between the negative
electrons and the positive nucleus must be overcome. The amount of energy needed depends on the element. Less
energy is needed to remove just one or a few valence electrons than many. This explains why sodium and other
alkali metals form positive ions so easily. Less energy is also needed to remove electrons from larger atoms in the
same group. For example, in group 1, it takes less energy to remove an electron from francium (Fr) at the bottom of

FIGURE 3.7

the group than from lithium (Li) at the top of the group (see the Figure 3.7). In bigger atoms, valence electrons are
farther from the nucleus. As a result, the force of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus is weaker.
Q: What do you think happens when an atom gains an electron and becomes a negative ion?
A: Energy is released when an atom gains an electron. Halogens release the most energy when they form ions. As a
result, they are very reactive elements.

Summary

• An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together positive and negative ions. It forms when atoms of

a metallic element give up electrons to atoms of a nonmetallic element.

• Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals. That’s because metals “want” to give up electrons, and

nonmetals “want” to gain electrons.

• It takes energy to remove valence electrons from an atom and form a positive ion. Energy is released when an

atom gains valence electrons and forms a negative ion.

3.5 Ionic Compounds

• Describe ionic compounds and how they form.
• Explain how ionic compounds are named.
• Identify properties and uses of ionic compounds.

The truck pictured above is spreading crystals of the salt calcium chloride on a snowy road to prevent ice from
forming. The crystals lower the freezing point of water so when the snow melts, it won’t turn to ice. Do you know
why calcium chloride lowers the freezing point of water? The answer has to do with the type of compound that
calcium chloride is. Calcium chloride is an ionic compound.

What Are Ionic Compounds?

All compounds form when atoms of different elements share or transfer electrons. Compounds in which electrons
are transferred from one atom to another are called ionic compounds. In this type of compound, electrons actually
move between the atoms, rather than being shared between them. When atoms give up or accept electrons in this
way, they become charged particles called ions. The ions are held together by ionic bonds, which form an ionic
compound. Ionic compounds generally form between elements that are metals and elements that are nonmetals. For
example, the metal calcium (Ca) and the nonmetal chlorine (Cl) form the ionic compound calcium chloride (CaCl2).
In this compound, there are two negative chloride ions for each positive calcium ion. Because the positive and
negative charges cancel out, an ionic compound is neutral in charge.
Q: Now can you explain why calcium chloride prevents ice from forming on a snowy road?
A: If calcium chloride dissolves in water, it breaks down into its ions (Ca2+ and Cl−). When water has ions dissolved
in it, it has a lower freezing point. Pure water freezes at 0°C. With calcium and chloride ions dissolved in it, it won’t
freeze unless the temperature reaches -29°C or lower.

Crystals

Many compounds form molecules, but ionic compounds form crystals instead. A crystal consists of many alternating
positive and negative ions bonded together in a matrix. Look at the crystal of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the Figure
3.8. The sodium and chloride ions are attracted to each other because they are oppositely charged, so they form ionic
bonds.

Sodium chloride crystals are cubic in
shape. Other ionic compounds may have
crystals with different shapes.

Naming Ionic Compounds

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Ionic compounds are named for their positive and negative ions. The name of the positive ion always comes ﬁrst,
followed by the name of the negative ion. For example, positive sodium ions and negative chloride ions form the
compound named sodium chloride. Similarly, positive calcium ions and negative chloride ions form the compound
named calcium chloride.
Q: What is the name of the ionic compound that is composed of positive barium ions and negative iodide ions?
A: The compound is named barium iodide.

Properties of Ionic Compounds

The crystal structure of ionic compounds is strong and rigid. It takes a lot of energy to break all those ionic bonds.
As a result, ionic compounds are solids with high melting and boiling points. You can see the melting and boiling
points of several different ionic compounds in the Table 3.2. To appreciate how high they are, consider that the
melting and boiling points of water, which is not an ionic compound, are 0°C and 100°C, respectively.

Solid ionic compounds are poor conductors of electricity. The strong bonds between their oppositely charged ions
lock them into place in the crystal. Therefore, the charged particles cannot move freely and carry electric current,
which is a ﬂow of charge. But all that changes when ionic compounds dissolve in water. When they dissolve, they
separate into individual ions. The ions can move freely, so they can carry current. Dissolved ionic compounds are
called electrolytes.
The rigid crystals of ionic compounds are brittle. They are more likely to break than bend when struck. As a result,
ionic crystals tend to shatter easily. Try striking salt crystals with a hammer and you’ll ﬁnd that they readily break
into smaller pieces. You can learn more about the properties of ionic compounds by watching the video at this URL:

Uses of Ionic Compounds

Ionic compounds have many uses. Some are shown in the Figure 3.9. Many ionic compounds are used in industry.
The human body needs several ions for good health. Having low levels of the ions can endanger important functions
such as heartbeat. Solutions of ionic compounds can be used to restore the ions.

Summary

• Ionic compounds consist of oppositely charged ions that are held together by ionic bonds. The opposite
charges cancel out so ionic compounds have a net neutral charge. Ionic compounds form when metals transfer
valence electrons to nonmetals.

• Ionic compounds exist as crystals rather than molecules. A crystal consists of many alternating positive and

negative ions bonded together in a matrix.

• Ionic compounds are named for their positive metal ion ﬁrst, followed by their negative nonmetal ion.
• Ionic compounds are solids with high melting and boiling points. They are good conductors of electricity but

only when dissolved in water. Their crystals are rigid and brittle.

• Ionic compounds have many uses in industry. They are also needed by humans and other living things.

3.6 Covalent Bonding

• Deﬁne covalent bond.
• Describe covalent compounds and diatomic elements.
• Explain why covalent bonds form.

In a tennis match, two players keep hitting the ball back and forth. The ball bounces from one player to the other,
over and over again. The ball keeps the players moving together on the court. What if the two players represented
the nuclei of two atoms and the ball represented valence electrons? What would the back and forth movement of the
ball represent? The answer is a covalent bond.

Sharing Electrons

A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two atoms that share a pair of valence electrons. The
shared electrons are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms. This forms a molecule consisting of two or more atoms.
Covalent bonds form only between atoms of nonmetals.

Covalent Compounds and Diatomic Elements

The two atoms that are held together by a covalent bond may be atoms of the same element or different elements.
When atoms of different elements form covalent bonds, a new substance, called a covalent compound, results. Water
is an example of a covalent compound. A water molecule is modeled in the Figure 3.10. A molecule is the smallest
particle of a covalent compound that still has the properties of the compound.

bonds hold the water molecule together?

FIGURE 3.10

A: The oxygen atom shares one pair of valence electrons with each hydrogen atom. Each pair of shared electrons
represents one covalent bond, so two covalent bonds hold the water molecule together.
The diagram in the Figure 3.11 shows an example of covalent bonds between two atoms of the same element, in
this case two atoms of oxygen. The diagram represents an oxygen molecule, so it’s not a new compound. Oxygen
normally occurs in diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules. Several other elements also occur as diatomic molecules:
hydrogen, nitrogen, and all but one of the halogens (ﬂuorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). At the URL below, you

351

3.6. Covalent Bonding

Why Covalent Bonds Form

www.ck12.org

Covalent bonds form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons. Look at the oxygen atoms
in the Figure 3.11. Alone, each oxygen atom has six valence electrons. By sharing two pairs of valence electrons,
each oxygen atom has a total of eight valence electrons. This ﬁlls its outer energy level, giving it the most stable
arrangement of electrons. The shared electrons are attracted to both oxygen nuclei, and this force of attraction holds
the two atoms together in the oxygen molecule.

Summary

• A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two atoms that share a pair of valence electrons.

Covalent bonds form only between atoms of nonmetals.

• The two atoms that are held together in a covalent bond may be atoms of the same element or different

elements. When atoms of different elements bond together, it forms a covalent compound.

• Covalent bonds form because the shared electrons ﬁll each atom’s outer energy level and this is the most stable

arrangement of electrons.

• Deﬁne covalent compound.
• Explain how covalent compounds are named.
• Describe how covalent compounds differ from ionic compounds.

The burner on a gas stove burns with a pretty blue ﬂame like the one pictured in the opening image. The fuel burned
by most gas stoves is natural gas, which consists mainly of methane. Methane is a compound that contains only
carbon and hydrogen. Like many other compounds that consist of just these two elements, methane is used for fuel
because it burns very easily. Methane is an example of a covalent compound.

What Are Covalent Compounds?

Compounds that form from two or more nonmetallic elements, such as carbon and hydrogen, are called covalent
compounds. In a covalent compound, atoms of the different elements are held together in molecules by covalent
bonds. These are chemical bonds in which atoms share valence electrons. The force of attraction between the shared
electrons and the positive nuclei of both atoms holds the atoms together in the molecule. A molecule is the smallest
particle of a covalent compound that still has the properties of the compound.
The largest, most complex covalent molecules have thousands of atoms. Examples include proteins and carbohy-
drates, which are compounds in living things. The smallest, simplest covalent compounds have molecules with just
two atoms. An example is hydrogen chloride (HCl). It consists of one hydrogen atom and one chlorine atom, as you
can see in the Figure 3.12. You can watch an animation of hydrogen chloride forming at the following URL.

Naming and Writing Formulas for Covalent Compounds

To name simple covalent compounds, follow these rules:

• Start with the name of the element closer to the left side of the periodic table.
• Follow this with the name of element closer to the right of the periodic table. Give this second name the sufﬁx

–ide.

• Use preﬁxes to represent the numbers of the different atoms in each molecule of the compound. The most

commonly used preﬁxes are shown in the Table 3.3.

Q: What is the name of the compound that contains three oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms?
A: The compound is named dinitrogen trioxide. Nitrogen is named ﬁrst because it is farther to the left in the periodic
table than oxygen. Oxygen is given the -ide sufﬁx because it is the second element named in the compound. The
preﬁx di- is added to nitrogen to show that there are two atoms of nitrogen in each molecule of the compound. The
preﬁx tri- is added to oxygen to show that there are three atoms of oxygen in each molecule.
In the chemical formula for a covalent compound, the numbers of the different atoms in a molecule are represented
by subscripts. For example, the formula for the compound named carbon dioxide is CO2.
Q: What is the chemical formula for dinitrogen trioxide?
A: The chemical formula is N2O3.

Properties of Covalent Compounds

The covalent bonds of covalent compounds are responsible for many of the properties of the compounds. Because
valence electrons are shared in covalent compounds, rather than transferred between atoms as they are in ionic
compounds, covalent compounds have very different properties than ionic compounds.

354

• Many covalent compounds, especially those containing carbon and hydrogen, burn easily. In contrast, many

ionic compounds do not burn.

• Many covalent compounds do not dissolve in water, whereas most ionic compounds dissolve well in water.
• Unlike ionic compounds, covalent compounds do not have freely moving electrons, so they cannot conduct

electricity.

atoms share pairs of valence electrons. A molecule is the smallest particle of a covalent compound that still
has the properties of the compound.

3.8 Bond Polarity

• Describe polar and nonpolar covalent bonds.
• Explain why some covalent compounds are polar.

Like the north and south poles of a bar magnet, Earth’s north and south magnetic poles—pictured above—are
opposites in terms of their magnetic ﬁelds. Some types of chemical bonds and chemical compounds have “poles”
similar to a bar magnet as well. But in the case of chemical bonds and compounds, the poles are opposites in terms
of their electric charge. These bonds and compounds are described as polar.

Polar and Nonpolar Covalent Bonds

Covalent bonds are chemical bonds between atoms of nonmetals that share valence electrons. In some covalent
bonds, electrons are not shared equally between the two atoms. These are called polar covalent bonds. The Figure
3.13 shows the polar bonds in a water molecule (H2O). The oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly
than the hydrogen atoms do because the nucleus of the oxygen atom has more positively charged protons. As a
result, the oxygen atom becomes slightly negative in charge, and the hydrogen atoms become slightly positive in
charge. For another example of polar bonds, see the video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lnjg

FIGURE 3.13

In other covalent bonds, electrons are shared equally. These bonds are called nonpolar covalent bonds. Neither
atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly. As a result, the atoms remain neutral in charge. The oxygen (O2)
molecule in the Figure 3.14 has two nonpolar bonds. The two oxygen nuclei have an equal force of attraction for
their four shared electrons.

FIGURE 3.14

Polar and Nonpolar Covalent Compounds

A covalent compound is a compound in which atoms are held together by covalent bonds. If the covalent bonds
are polar, then the covalent compound as a whole may be polar. A polar covalent compound is one in which there
is a slight difference in electric charge between opposite sides of the molecule. All polar compounds contain polar
bonds. But having polar bonds does not necessarily result in a polar compound. It depends on how the atoms are

357

3.8. Bond Polarity

www.ck12.org

arranged. This is illustrated in the Figure 3.15. In both molecules, the oxygen atoms attract electrons more strongly
than the carbon or hydrogen atoms do, so both molecules have polar bonds. However, only formaldehyde is a polar
compound. Carbon dioxide is nonpolar.

FIGURE 3.15

Q: Why is carbon dioxide nonpolar?
A: The symmetrical arrangement of atoms in carbon dioxide results in opposites sides of the molecule having the
same charge.

Summary

• In polar covalent bonds, electrons are not shared equally between the two atoms, so one atom is slightly
negative in charge and one is slightly positive in charge. In nonpolar covalent bonds, electrons are shared
equally so the atoms remain neutral in charge.

• Covalent compounds with polar bonds may be polar or nonpolar, depending on their arrangement of atoms.

• Relate hydrogen bonding to melting and boiling points of compounds.

The colorful red and blue model in the opening image represents a water molecule. The molecule’s one oxygen
atom is colored red, and its two hydrogen atoms are colored blue. Can you guess why? The red color represents
negative electric charge, and the blue color represents positive electric charge. The colors show that water is a polar
compound.

What Are Polar Compounds?

Polar compounds, such as water, are compounds that have a partial negative charge on one side of each molecule and
a partial positive charge on the other side. All polar compounds contain polar bonds (although not all compounds
that contain polar bonds are polar.) In a polar bond, two atoms share electrons unequally. One atom attracts the
shared electrons more strongly, so it has a partial negative charge. The other atom attracts the shared electrons less
strongly, so it is has a partial positive charge. In a water molecule, the oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons
more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do. This explains why the oxygen side of the water molecule has a partial
negative charge and the hydrogen side of the molecule has a partial positive charge.
Q: If a molecule is polar, how might this affect its interactions with nearby molecules of the same compound?
A: Opposite charges on different molecules of the same compound might cause the molecules to be attracted to each
other.

Hydrogen Bonding

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Because of water’s polarity, individual water molecules are attracted to one another. You can see this in the Figure
3.16. The positively charged hydrogen side of one water molecule is attracted to the negatively charged oxygen side
of a nearby water molecule. This force of attraction is called a hydrogen bond. You can watch hydrogen bonds
forming between water molecules in the animation at this URL: http://www.northland.cc.mn.us/biology/biology111
1/animations/hydrogenbonds.html .

FIGURE 3.16

Hydrogen bonds are intermolecular (“between-molecule”) bonds, rather than intramolecular (“within-molecule”)
bonds. They occur not only in water but in other polar molecules in which positive hydrogen atoms are attracted to
negative atoms in nearby molecules. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak as chemical bonds go. For example, they
are much weaker than the bonds holding atoms together within molecules of covalent compounds. To learn more
about hydrogen bonding and when it occurs, see the video at this URL:

Hydrogen Bonds and Changes of State

Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows
individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes
of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to
move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds.
This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table 3.5 compares melting
and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.

Q: Which compound in the Table 3.5 do you think is more polar, ammonia or water?
A: Water is more polar than ammonia. Its strong polarity explains why its melting and boiling points are high even
for a polar covalent compound.

Summary

• Polar covalent compounds have molecules with a partial negative charge on one side and a partial positive
charge on the other side. This occurs because the compounds contain polar bonds. In a polar bond, one atom
attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the other atom does.

• In some polar molecules that contain hydrogen atoms, the partial positive charge of the hydrogen atoms of one
molecule are attracted to the partial negative charge of an atom of a nearby molecule. This force of attraction
is called a hydrogen bond.

• Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, but they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from each
other when matter changes state from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. This explains why polar
covalent compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points.

3.10 Metallic Bonding

• Describe metallic bonds.
• Explain how metallic bonds inﬂuence the properties of metals.

The thick, rigid trunk of the oak tree on the left might crack and break in a strong wind. The slim, ﬂexible trunk of
the willow tree on the right might bend without breaking. In one way, metals are like willow trees. They can bend
without breaking. That’s because metals form special bonds called metallic bonds.

What Are Metallic Bonds?

Metallic bonds are forces of attraction between positive metal ions and the valence electrons that are constantly
moving around them (see the Figure 3.17). The valence electrons include their own and those of other, nearby
ions of the same metal. The valence electrons of metals move freely in this way because metals have relatively low
electronegativity, or attraction to electrons. The positive metal ions form a lattice-like structure held together by all
the metallic bonds. For an animated version of metallic bonding, go to this URL:

URL: http://www.ck12.org/ﬂx/render/embeddedobject/5085

Q: Why do metallic bonds form only in elements that are metals? Why don’t similar bonds form in elements that
are nonmetals?
A: Metal atoms readily give up valence electrons and become positive ions whenever they form bonds. When
nonmetals bond together, the atoms share valence electrons and do not become ions. For example, when oxygen
atoms bond together they form oxygen molecules in which two oxygen atoms share two pairs of valence electrons
equally, so neither atom becomes charged.

Metallic Bonds and the Properties of Metals

The valence electrons surrounding metal ions are constantly moving. This makes metals good conductors of
electricity. The lattice-like structure of metal ions is strong but quite ﬂexible. This allows metals to bend without
breaking. Metals are both ductile (can be shaped into wires) and malleable (can be shaped into thin sheets). You can

Q: Look at the metalworker in the Figure 3.18. He’s hammering a piece of hot iron in order to shape it. Why doesn’t
the iron crack when he hits it?
A: The iron ions can move within the “sea” of electrons around them. They can shift a little closer together or farther

hammer hits it.

Summary

• Metallic bonds are the force of attraction between positive metal ions and the valence electrons that are

constantly moving around them. The ions form a lattice-like structure held together by the metallic bonds.

• Metallic bonds explain why metals can conduct electricity and bend without breaking.

3.11 Alloys

• Deﬁne alloy.
• Describe examples of alloys.

Metals such as iron are useful for many purposes because of their unique properties. For example, they can conduct
electricity and bend without breaking. However, pure metals may be less useful than mixtures of metals with other
elements. For example, adding a little carbon to iron makes it much stronger. This mixture is called steel. Steel is
so strong that it can hold up huge bridges, like the one pictured above. Steel is also used to make skyscrapers, cargo
ships, cars, and trains. Steel is an example of an alloy.

What Are Alloys?

An alloy is a mixture of a metal with one or more other elements. The other elements may be metals, nonmetals,
or both. An alloy is formed by melting a metal and dissolving the other elements in it. The molten solution is
then allowed to cool and harden. Alloys generally have more useful properties than pure metals. Several examples
of alloys are described and pictured below. You can learn about another alloy—the amazing alloy called memory
wire—at the following URL. If you have braces on your teeth, you might even have this alloy in your mouth!

Examples of Alloys

Most metal objects are made of alloys rather than pure metals. Objects made of four different alloys are shown in

• An alloy is a mixture of a metal with one or more other elements. An alloy generally has properties that make

it more useful than the pure metal.

3.12 Chemical Reaction Overview

• Deﬁne chemical reaction.
• Describe what happens during chemical reactions.
• Identify types of chemical reactions.
• State the role of energy in chemical reactions.

Does the term chemical reaction bring to mind an image like this one? In the picture, a chemist is mixing chemicals
in a lab. Many chemical reactions take place in labs. However, most chemical reactions do not. Where do they
occur? They happen in the world all around you. They even happen inside your own body. In fact, you are alive
only because of the many chemical reactions that constantly take place inside your cells.

What Is a Chemical Reaction?

A chemical reaction is a process in which some substances change into different substances. Substances that start
a chemical reaction are called reactants. Substances that are produced in the reaction are called products. Reactants
and products can be elements or compounds. Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations, like the
one below, in which reactants (on the left) are connected by an arrow to products (on the right).

Reactants → Products

Chemical reactions may occur quickly or slowly. Look at the two pictures in the Figure 3.20. Both represent
chemical reactions. In the picture on the left, a reaction inside a ﬁre extinguisher causes foam to shoot out of the
extinguisher. This reaction occurs almost instantly. In the picture on the right, a reaction causes the iron tool to turn
to rust. This reaction occurs very slowly. In fact, it might take many years for all of the iron in the tool to turn to
rust.
Q: What happens during a chemical reaction? Where do the reactants go, and where do the products come from?

FIGURE 3.20

A: During a chemical reaction, chemical changes take place. Some chemical bonds break and new chemical bonds
form.

Same Atoms, New Bonds

The reactants and products in a chemical reaction contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction.
As a result, the atoms are in different combinations in the products than they were in the reactants. This happens
because chemical bonds break in the reactants and new chemical bonds form in the products.
Consider the chemical reaction in which water forms from oxygen and hydrogen gases. The Figure 3.21 represents
this reaction. Bonds break in molecules of hydrogen and oxygen, and then new bonds form in molecules of water.
In both reactants and products there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, but the atoms are combined
differently in water. You can see another example at this URL: http://www.avogadro.co.uk/h_and_s/bondenthalpy/b
ondenthalpy.htm .

FIGURE 3.21

Types of Chemical Reactions

The chemical reaction in the Figure 3.21, in which water forms from hydrogen and oxygen, is an example of a
synthesis reaction. In this type of reaction, two or more reactants combine to synthesize a single product. There
are several other types of chemical reactions, including decomposition, replacement, and combustion reactions. The
Table 3.6 compares these four types of chemical reactions. You can see demonstrations of each type at this URL:

Q: The burning of wood is a chemical reaction. Which type of reaction is it?
A: The burning of wood—or of anything else—is a combustion reaction. In the combustion example in the table,
the fuel is methane gas (CH4).

Energy In and Energy Out

All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new
bonds form in products. In terms of energy, there are two types of chemical reactions: endothermic reactions and
exothermic reactions.

• In exothermic reactions, more energy is released when bonds form in products than is used to break bonds in

reactants. These reactions release energy to the environment, often in the form of heat or light.

• In endothermic reactions, more energy is used to break bonds in reactants than is released when bonds form

in products. These reactions absorb energy from the environment.

Q: When it comes to energy, which type of reaction is the burning of wood? Is it an endothermic reaction or an
exothermic reaction? How can you tell?
A: The burning of wood is an exothermic reaction. You can tell by the heat and light energy given off by a wood
ﬁre.

Summary

• A chemical reaction is a process in which some substances, called reactants, change into different substances,
called products. During the reaction, chemical bonds break in the reactants and new chemical bonds form in
the products.

• Types of chemical reactions include synthesis, decomposition, replacement, and combustion reactions.
• All chemical reactions involve energy. Exothermic reactions release more energy than they use. Endothermic

reactions use more energy than they release.

From Reactants to Products

All chemical reactions—including a candle burning—involve reactants and products.

• Reactants are substances that start a chemical reaction.
• Products are substances that are produced in the reaction.

When a candle burns, the reactants are fuel (the candlewick and wax) and oxygen (in the air). The products are
carbon dioxide gas and water vapor.

373

3.13. Reactants and Products

Relating Reactants and Products

www.ck12.org

The relationship between reactants and products in a chemical reaction can be represented by a chemical equation
that has this general form:

Reactants → Products

The arrow (→) shows the direction in which the reaction occurs. In many reactions, the reaction also occurs in the
opposite direction. This is represented with another arrow pointing in the opposite direction (←).
Q: Write a general chemical equation for the reaction that occurs when a fuel such as candle wax burns.
A: The burning of fuel is a combustion reaction. The general equation for this type of reaction is:

Fuel + O2 → CO2 + H2O

Q: How do the reactants in a chemical reaction turn into the products?
A: Bonds break in the reactants, and new bonds form in the products.

Breaking and Making Chemical Bonds

The reactants and products in a chemical reaction contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction.
As a result, the atoms end up in different combinations in the products. This makes the products new substances that
are chemically different from the reactants.
Consider the example of water forming from hydrogen and oxygen. Both hydrogen and oxygen gases exist as
diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules. These molecules are the reactants in the reaction. The Figure 3.22 shows that
bonds must break to separate the atoms in the hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Then new bonds must form between
hydrogen and oxygen atoms to form water molecules. The water molecules are the products of the reaction.

3.14 Reversible Reactions

• Give examples of irreversible and reversible chemical reactions.
• Describe a reversible reaction that is in equilibrium.

This diagram represents a chemical reaction. In the reaction, two molecules of hydrogen gas (2 H-H) combine one
molecule of oxygen gas (O=O) to produce two molecules of water (2 H-O-H). Look at the arrow in the diagram.
What does it represent? It shows that the reaction normally occurs in that direction, that is, from the two gases to
water. Does the opposite reaction ever occur? Can water change back to hydrogen and oxygen gases? In other
words, is the reaction reversible? Read on to ﬁnd out.

Irreversible Reactions

Some chemical reactions can occur in only one direction. These reactions are called irreversible reactions. The
reactants can change to the products, but the products cannot change back to the reactants. These reactions are like
making a cake. The ingredients of a cake—such as eggs and ﬂour—are the reactants. They are mixed together and
baked to form the cake, which is the product (see Figure 3.23). The cake can’t be “unbaked” and “unmixed” to
change it back to the raw eggs, ﬂour, and other ingredients. So making a cake is irreversible.

FIGURE 3.23

Combustion reactions are generally irreversible. Combustion occurs whenever a fuel burns. In this type of reaction,
the fuel may combine with oxygen (in the air) and produces carbon dioxide and water vapor. The chemical equation
for a combustion reaction is:

376

www.ck12.org

Fuel + O2 → CO2 + H2O

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

In a complete combustion reaction, fuel and oxygen are the reactants and the products are carbon dioxide and water.
These two products cannot react to reform the fuel and oxygen, so the reaction is irreversible. The one-way arrow
in the equation shows that the reaction can go in only one direction.

Reversible Reactions

Many chemical reactions can occur in both directions. These reactions are called reversible reactions. Not only
can the reactants change to the products, but the products can change back to the reactants, at least under certain
conditions. Consider again the reaction in which hydrogen gas and oxygen gas combine to produce water. This
reaction is reversible if an electric current is applied to the water that is produced. You can see how this is done in
the Figure 3.24. The current causes the water molecules to break down to individual hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
Then these atoms recombine to form molecules of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas.

FIGURE 3.24

Q: In a chemical equation, a reversible reaction is represented with two arrows, one pointing in each direction. This
shows that the reaction can go both ways. How would you represent the reversible reaction in which hydrogen and
oxygen gases combine to produce water?

Balancing Act

www.ck12.org

In a reversible reaction, both forward and reverse directions of the reaction generally occur at the same time. While
reactants are reacting to produce products, products are reacting to produce reactants. Often, a point is reached
at which forward and reverse directions of the reaction occur at the same rate. When this happens, there is no
overall change in the amount of reactants and products, even though the reactions keep occurring in both directions.
This point is called equilibrium. The term equilibrium means “state of balance,” and it is used to refer to a state of
balance between any opposing changes. You can see an animation of a chemical reaction reaching equilibrium at this

Summary

• Irreversible chemical reactions can occur in only one direction. The reactants can change to the products, but

the products cannot change back to the reactants.

• Reversible chemical reactions can occur in both directions. The reactants can change to the products, and the

products can also change back to the reactants.

• Equilibrium occurs when forward and reverse directions of a reversible reaction occur at the same rate so there

is no overall change in the amounts of reactants and products.

Look at the girl’s hair in the photo above. It has obviously changed color. The process in which this occurred
involved chemical reactions. How do you know that chemical reactions have occurred? The change in color is the
most obvious clue.

What’s Your Sign?

A change in color is just one of several potential signs that a chemical reaction has occurred. Other potential signs
include:

• Change in temperature-Heat is released or absorbed during the reaction.
• Production of a gas-Gas bubbles are released during the reaction.
• Production of a solid-A solid settles out of a liquid solution. The solid is called a precipitate.

Examples of Chemical Reactions

3.16 Chemical Equations

• Describe the general form of a chemical equation.
• Show how to write a simple chemical equation.
• Explain what it means for a chemical equation to be balanced.

Look at this rusty bike. It has been left outside in damp weather too many times, so the iron in the metal parts has
rusted. Iron rusts when it combines with oxygen in the air. Iron rusting is an example of a chemical reaction. In
a chemical reaction, substances change into entirely different substances. For example, the iron in the bike and the
oxygen in the air have changed into rust.
Q: How could you represent this reaction, besides just describing it in words?
A: Scientists use a standard method to represent a chemical reaction, called a chemical equation.

What Is a Chemical Equation?

A chemical equation is a shorthand way to sum up what occurs in a chemical reaction. The general form of a
chemical equation is:

Reactants → Products

The reactants in a chemical equation are the substances that begin the reaction, and the products are the substances
that are produced in the reaction. The reactants are always written on the left side of the equation and the products

382

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

on the right. The arrow pointing from left to right shows that the reactants change into the products during the
reaction. This happens when chemical bonds break in the reactants and new bonds form in the products. As a result,
the products are different chemical substances than the reactants that started the reaction. For a good overview of
chemical equations and how to write them, watch the video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zC6v
5gU0k4 .
Q: What is the general equation for the reaction in which iron rusts?
A: Iron combines with oxygen to produce rust, which is the compound named iron oxide. This reaction could
be represented by the general chemical equation below. Note that when there is more than one reactant, they are
separated by plus signs (+). If more than one product were produced, plus signs would be used between them as
well.

Iron + Oxygen → Iron Oxide

Using Chemical Symbols and Formulas

When scientists write chemical equations, they use chemical symbols and chemical formulas instead of names to
represent reactants and products. Look at the chemical reaction illustrated in the Figure 3.28. In this reaction, carbon
reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide. Carbon is represented by the chemical symbol C. The chemical
symbol for oxygen is O, but pure oxygen exists as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules, represented by the chemical
formula O2. A molecule of the compound carbon dioxide consists of one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen,
so carbon dioxide is represented by the chemical formula CO2.

FIGURE 3.28

Q: What is the chemical equation for this reaction?
A: The chemical equation is:

C + O2 → CO2

Q: How have the atoms of the reactants been rearranged in the products of the reaction? What bonds have been
broken, and what new bonds have formed?
A: Bonds between the oxygen atoms in the oxygen molecule have been broken, and new bonds have formed between
the carbon atom and the two oxygen atoms.

Is It Balanced?

All chemical equations, like equations in math, must balance. This means that there must be the same number of
each type of atom on both sides of the arrow. That’s because matter is always conserved in a chemical reaction. This

383

3.16. Chemical Equations

www.ck12.org

is the law of conservation of mass.
Look at the equation above for the reaction between carbon and oxygen in the formation of carbon dioxide. Count
the number of atoms of each type. Are the numbers the same on both sides of the arrow? The answer is yes, so the
equation is balanced.

Coefﬁcients

Let’s return to the chemical reaction in which iron (Fe) combines with oxygen (O2) to form rust, or iron oxide
(Fe2O3). The equation for this reaction is:

4Fe+ 3O2 → 2Fe2O3

This equation illustrates the use of coefﬁcients to balance chemical equations. A coefﬁcient is a number placed in
front of a chemical symbol or formula that shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the
reaction. From the equation for rusting, you can see that four atoms of iron combine with three molecules of oxygen
to form two molecules of iron oxide.
Q: Is the equation for the rusting reaction balanced? How can you tell?
A: Yes, the equation is balanced. You can tell because there is the same number of each type of atom on both sides
of the arrow. First count the iron atoms. There are four iron atoms in the reactants. There are also four iron atoms
in the products (two in each of the two iron oxide molecules). Now count the oxygen atoms. There are six on each
side of the arrow, conﬁrming that the equation is balanced in terms of oxygen as well as iron.

Summary

• Scientists use chemical equations to summarize what happens in chemical reactions. Reactants are placed on
the left side of the equation and products are placed on the right. An arrow is used to indicate the direction in
which the reaction occurs. Plus signs (+) are placed between multiple reactants or products.

• In chemical equations, reactants and products are represented by chemical symbols and formulas. Numbers
called coefﬁcients are placed in front of the symbols and formulas to show how much of each substance is
involved in the reaction.

• Chemical equations must be balanced. A balanced equation has the same number of each type of atom on

both sides of the equation.

3.17 Balancing Chemical Equations

• Describe a balanced chemical equation.
• Explain the meaning of coefﬁcients in chemical equations.
• Outline how to balance chemical equations.

The little boy on this seesaw weighs more than the little girl on the other side. That’s why his side of the seesaw
is on the ground and her side is up in the air. For a seesaw to balance, the two riders must be the same weight. A
chemical equation that represents a chemical reaction is a little bit like a seesaw. For a chemical equation to balance,
there must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation.

Writing Chemical Equations

A chemical equation represents the changes that occur during a chemical reaction. A chemical equation has the
general form:

Reactants → Products

An example of a simple chemical reaction is the reaction in which hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) combine to
produce water (H2O). In this reaction, the reactants are hydrogen and oxygen and the product is water. To write the
chemical equation for this reaction, you would start by writing the reactants on the left and the product on the right,
with an arrow between them to show the direction in which the reaction occurs:
Equation 1:
H2 + O2 → H2O
Q: Look closely at equation 1. There’s something wrong with it. Do you see what it is?
A: All chemical equations must be balanced. This means that there must be the same number of each type of atom
on both sides of the arrow. That’s because mass is always conserved in chemical reactions. Count the number of

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

hydrogen and oxygen atoms on each side of the arrow. There are two hydrogen atoms in both reactants and products.
There are two oxygen atoms in the reactants but only one in the product. Therefore, equation 1 is not balanced.

Using Coefﬁcients

Coefﬁcients are used to balance chemical equations. A coefﬁcient is a number placed in front of a chemical symbol
or formula. It shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction. For example, two
molecules of hydrogen would be written as 2 H2, and two molecules of water would be written 2 H2O. A coefﬁcient
of 1 usually isn’t written. Coefﬁcients can be used to balance equation 1 (above) as follows:
Equation 2:
2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O
Equation 2 shows that two molecules of hydrogen react with one molecule of oxygen to produce two molecules of
water. The two molecules of hydrogen each contain two hydrogen atoms and so do the two molecules of water.
Therefore, there are now four hydrogen atoms in both reactants and products.
Q: Is equation 2 balanced?
A: Count the oxygen atoms to ﬁnd out. There are two oxygen atoms in the one molecule of oxygen in the reactants.
There are also two oxygen atoms in the products, one in each of the two water molecules. Therefore, equation 2 is
balanced.

Steps in Balancing a Chemical Equation

Balancing a chemical equation involves a certain amount of trial and error. In general, however, you should follow
these steps:

1. Count each type of atom in reactants and products. Does the same number of each atom appear on both sides

of the arrow? If not, the equation is not balanced, and you need to go to step 2.

2. Place coefﬁcients, as needed, in front of the symbols or formulas to increase the number of atoms or molecules
of the substances. Use the smallest coefﬁcients possible. Warning! Never change the subscripts in chemical
formulas. Changing subscripts changes the substances involved in the reaction. Change only the coefﬁcients.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the equation is balanced.

Q: Balance this chemical equation for the reaction in which nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) combine to form
ammonia (NH3):

N2 + H2 → NH3

A: First count the nitrogen atoms on both sides of the arrow. There are two nitrogen atoms in the reactants so there
must be two in the products as well. Place the coefﬁcient 2 in front of NH3 to balance nitrogen:

N2 + H2 → 2 NH3

Now count the hydrogen atoms on both sides of the arrow. There are six hydrogen atoms in the products so there
must also be six in the reactants. Place the coefﬁcient 3 in front of H2 to balance hydrogen:

N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3

leaves change color because of chemical reactions.

Chemical Reactions and Balanced Equations

A chemical reaction occurs when some substances change chemically to other substances. Chemical reactions are
represented by chemical equations. Consider a simple chemical reaction, the burning of methane. In this reaction,
methane (CH4) combines with oxygen (O2) in the air and produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O).
The reaction is represented by the following chemical equation:

CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O

This equation shows that one molecule of methane combines with two molecules of oxygen to produce one molecule
of carbon dioxide and two molecules of water vapor. All chemical equations must be balanced. This means that the
same number of each type of atom must appear on both sides of the arrow.
Q: Is the chemical equation for the burning of methane balanced? Count the atoms of each type on both sides of the
arrow to ﬁnd out.
A: Yes, the equation is balanced. There is one carbon atom on both sides of the arrow. There are also four hydrogen
atoms and four oxygen atoms on both sides of the arrow.

3.18. Conservation of Mass in Chemical Reactions

www.ck12.org

Following the Law

Why must chemical equations be balanced? It’s the law! Matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions.
This is the law of conservation of mass. In every chemical reaction, the same mass of matter must end up in the
products as started in the reactants. Balanced chemical equations show that mass is conserved in chemical reactions.

Lavoisier and Conservation of Mass

How do scientists know that mass is always conserved in chemical reactions? Careful experiments in the 1700s by a
French chemist named Antoine Lavoisier led to this conclusion. Lavoisier carefully measured the mass of reactants
and products in many different chemical reactions. He carried out the reactions inside a sealed jar, like the one in
the Figure 3.29. In every case, the total mass of the jar and its contents was the same after the reaction as it was
before the reaction took place. This showed that matter was neither created nor destroyed in the reactions. Another
outcome of Lavoisier’s research was the discovery of oxygen. You can learn more about Lavoisier and his important
research at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9iZq3ZxbO8 .

Antoine Lavoisier.

Q: Lavoisier carried out his experiments inside a sealed glass jar. Why was sealing the jar important for his results?
What might his results have been if he hadn’t sealed the jar?
A: Sealing the jar was important so that any gases produced in the reactions were captured and could be measured. If
he hadn’t sealed the jar, gases might have escaped detection. Then his results would have shown that there was less
mass after the reactions than before. In other words, he would not have been able to conclude that mass is conserved
in chemical reactions.

3.19 Synthesis Reactions

• Deﬁne synthesis reaction.
• Describe an example of a synthesis reaction.

In this photo of Los Angeles, California, the air over the city is brown with smog. A major component of smog is
nitrogen dioxide, which is a toxic gas with a sharp odor. Nitrogen dioxide can irritate the eyes and throat and trigger
asthma attacks. Where does this poisonous gas come from? It forms when nitric oxide—from sources such as car
exhaust—reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction is a synthesis reaction.

What Is a Synthesis Reaction?

A synthesis reaction occurs when two or more reactants combine to form a single product. A synthesis reaction can
be represented by the general equation:

A + B → C

In this equation, the letters A and B represent the reactants that begin the reaction, and the letter C represents the
product that is synthesized in the reaction. The arrow shows the direction in which the reaction occurs.
Q: What is the chemical equation for the synthesis of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen
(O2)?
A: The equation for this synthesis reaction is:

2NO + O2 → 2NO2

Examples of Synthesis Reactions

Another example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) to produce sodium
chloride (NaCl). This reaction is represented by the chemical equation:

2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl

Sodium is a highly reactive metal, and chlorine is a poisonous gas. Both elements are pictured in the Figure 3.30.
The compound they synthesize has very different properties. Sodium chloride is commonly called table salt, which is
neither reactive nor poisonous. In fact, salt is a necessary component of the human diet. You can see more examples

3.20 Decomposition Reactions

• Write the general chemical equation for a decomposition reaction.
• Describe examples of decomposition reactions.

Hydrogen peroxide is a widely used disinfectant for minor cuts and scrapes. You may have a bottle of hydrogen
peroxide like the one pictured here in your medicine cabinet at home. Did you ever notice that hydrogen peroxide
is always kept in a dark brown bottle like this one? Do you know why? The reason is that hydrogen peroxide needs
to be protected from light. If it isn’t, it will gradually break down to water and oxygen. This is a decomposition
reaction.

What Is a Decomposition Reaction?

A decomposition reaction occurs when one reactant breaks down into two or more products. It can be represented
by the general equation:

AB → A + B

In this equation, AB represents the reactant that begins the reaction, and A and B represent the products of the
reaction. The arrow shows the direction in which the reaction occurs.

acid breaks down to produce water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). This occurs when you open a can of soft
drink and some of the carbon dioxide ﬁzzes out. The equation for this reaction is:

H2CO3 → H2O + CO2

• Another decomposition reaction occurs when water (H2O) breaks down to produce hydrogen (H2) and oxygen
(O2) gases (see Figure 3.31). This happens when an electric current passes through the water, as illustrated
below. The equation for this reaction is:

2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2

Q: What ratio of hydrogen molecules (H2) to oxygen molecules (O2) is produced in the decomposition of water?

What a job! The man hanging from the burning helicopter in the photo above is a stunt man. He ﬁlls in for the
lead actor in the movie in dangerous scenes like this one. Like other stunt workers, he has special training to do
such dangerous work as safely as possible. Replacing actors with stunt workers is common in action movies. Some
chemical reactions also involve replacements. More reactive elements replace less reactive elements in compounds.
These reactions are called replacement reactions.

What Is a Replacement Reaction?

A replacement reaction occurs when elements switch places in compounds. This type of reaction involves ions
(electrically charged versions of atoms) and ionic compounds. These are compounds in which positive ions of a
metal and negative ions of a nonmetal are held together by ionic bonds. Generally, a more reactive element replaces
an element that is less reactive, and the less reactive element is set free from the compound. There are two types of
replacement reactions: single and double. Both types are described below.
Q: Can you predict how single and double replacement reactions differ?
A: One way they differ is that a single replacement reaction involves one reactant compound, whereas a double
replacement reaction involves two reactant compounds. Keep reading to learn more about these two types of
reactions.

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Single Replacement Reactions

A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces another in a single compound. This type of reaction
has the general equation:
A + BC → B + AC

In this equation, A represents a more reactive element and BC represents the original compound. During the reaction,
A replaces B, forming the product compound AC and releasing the less reactive element B.
An example of a single replacement reaction occurs when potassium (K) reacts with water (H2O). A colorless solid
compound named potassium hydroxide (KOH) forms, and hydrogen gas (H2) is set free. The equation for the
reaction is:

2K + 2H2O → 2KOH + H2

In this reaction, a potassium ion replaces one of the hydrogen atoms in each molecule of water. Potassium is a highly
reactive group 1 alkali metal, so its reaction with water is explosive. You can watch the reaction occurring at this
URL: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv
Q: Find potassium in the periodic table of the elements. What other element might replace hydrogen in water in a
similar replacement reaction?
A: Another group 1 element, such as lithium or sodium, might be involved in a similar replacement reaction with
water.

Double Replacement Reactions

A double replacement reaction occurs when two ionic compounds exchange ions. This produces two new ionic
compounds. A double replacement reaction can be represented by the general equation:

AB + CD → AD + CB

AB and CD are the two reactant compounds, and AD and CB are the two product compounds that result from the
reaction. During the reaction, the ions B and D change places.
Q: Could the product compounds be DA and BC?
A: No, they could not. In an ionic compound, the positive metal ion is always written ﬁrst, followed by the negative
nonmetal ion. Therefore, A and C must always come ﬁrst, followed by D or B.
An example of a double replacement reaction is sodium chloride (NaCl) reacting with silver ﬂuoride (AgF). This
reaction is represented by the equation:
NaCl + AgF → NaF + AgCl
During the reaction, chloride and ﬂuoride ions change places, so two new compounds are formed in the products:
sodium ﬂuoride (NaF) and silver chloride (AgCl). To better understand how and why double replacement reactions
occur, watch the video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eck_s_J6nKo
Q: When iron sulﬁde (FeS) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) react together, a double replacement reaction occurs. What
are the products of this reaction? What is the chemical equation for this reaction?
A: The products of the reaction are iron chloride (FeCl2) and hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S). The chemical equation for this
reaction is:
FeS + 2HCl → H2S + FeCl2

Don’t try this at home! This performer isn’t really eating ﬁre, but he still puts on an impressive show. You know that
ﬁre is dangerous. It’s hot, it can burn you, and it can easily get out of control. But do you know what ﬁre is? Fire is
the result of a chemical reaction. Whenever something burns, a type of reaction called a combustion reaction occurs.

What Is a Combustion Reaction?

A combustion reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen (O2). For example, in the Figure
3.32, charcoal is combining with oxygen. Combustion is commonly called burning, and the substance that burns is
usually referred to as fuel. The products of a complete combustion reaction include carbon dioxide (CO2) and water
vapor (H2O). The reaction typically gives off heat and light as well. The general equation for a complete combustion
reaction is:

Fuel + O2 → CO2 + H2O

Combustion of Hydrocarbons

The fuel that burns in a combustion reaction contains compounds called hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are compounds
that contain only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). The charcoal pictured in the Figure 3.32 consists of hydrocarbons.
So do fossil fuels such as natural gas. Natural gas is a fuel that is commonly used in home furnaces and gas stoves.
The main component of natural gas is the hydrocarbon called methane (CH4). You can see a methane ﬂame in the
Figure 3.33. The combustion of methane is represented by the equation:

CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O

FIGURE 3.33
The combustion of methane gas heats a
pot on a stove.

Q: Sometimes the ﬂame on a gas stove isn’t just blue but has some yellow or orange in it. Why might this occur?
A: If the ﬂame isn’t just blue, the methane isn’t getting enough oxygen to burn completely, leaving some of the
carbon unburned. The ﬂame will also not be as hot as a completely blue ﬂame for the same reason.

• Deﬁne endothermic reaction.
• Describe the role of energy in endothermic reactions.
• Give examples of endothermic reactions.

Did you ever use an instant ice pack like this one? You don’t have to pre-cool it in the freezer. All you need to do is
squeeze the pack and it starts to get cold. How does this happen? The answer is an endothermic chemical reaction.

What Is an Endothermic Reaction

All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new
bonds form in products. In some chemical reactions, called exothermic reactions, more energy is released when
new bonds form in the products than is needed to break bonds in the reactants. The opposite is true of endothermic
reactions. In an endothermic reaction, it takes more energy to break bonds in the reactants than is released when
new bonds form in the products.

Energy Change in Endothermic Reactions

The word endothermic literally means “taking in heat.” A constant input of energy, often in the form of heat, is
needed to keep an endothermic reaction going. This is illustrated in the Figure 3.34. Energy must be constantly
added because not enough energy is released when the products form to break more bonds in the reactants. The
general equation for an endothermic reaction is:

Q: Now can you guess how an instant cold pack works?
A: Squeezing the cold pack breaks an inner bag of water, and the water mixes with a chemical inside the pack. The
chemical and water combine in an endothermic reaction. The energy needed for the reaction to take place comes
from the water, which gets colder as the reaction proceeds.

Photosynthesis

One of the most important series of endothermic reactions is photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, plants make the
simple sugar glucose (C6H12O6) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). They also release oxygen (O2) in the
process. The reactions of photosynthesis are summed up by this chemical equation:

6 CO2 + 6 H2O → C6H12O6 + 6 O2

The energy for photosynthesis comes from light. Without light energy, photosynthesis cannot occur. As you can see
in the Figure 3.35, plants can get the energy they need for photosynthesis from either sunlight or artiﬁcial light.

Summary

• An endothermic reaction is a chemical reaction in which more energy is needed to break bonds in the reactants

than is released when new bonds form in the products.

• A constant input of energy, often in the form of heat, is needed to keep an endothermic reaction going.
• One of the most important series of endothermic reactions is photosynthesis. The energy needed for photo-

synthesis comes from light.

• Deﬁne exothermic reaction.
• Describe the role of energy in exothermic reactions.
• Give examples of exothermic reactions.

This mushroom cloud was produced in a 1953 nuclear bomb test in Nevada. There’s no doubt that the explosion
gave off a huge amount of energy. Although not as impressive as nuclear reactions, many chemical reactions also
give off energy. These reactions are called exothermic reactions.

What Is an Exothermic Reaction?

All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new
bonds form in products. In some chemical reactions, called endothermic reactions, less energy is released when
new bonds form in the products than is needed to break bonds in the reactants. The opposite is true of exothermic
reactions. In an exothermic reaction, it takes less energy to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new
bonds form in the products.

Energy Change in Exothermic Reactions

The word exothermic means “releasing heat.” Energy, often in the form of heat, is released as an exothermic reaction
proceeds. This is illustrated in the Figure 3.36. The general equation for an exothermic reaction is:

Reactants → Products + Energy

FIGURE 3.36
Note: ∆H represents the change in en-
ergy.

If the energy produced in an exothermic reaction is released as heat, it results in a rise in temperature. As a result,
the products are likely to be warmer than the reactants. That’s what happens in the exothermic reaction at the URL
below.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_aqa/chemreac/energychangesrev1.shtml
Q: You turn on the hot water faucet, and hot water pours out. How does the water get hot? Do you think that an
exothermic reaction might be involved?
A: A hot water heater increases the temperature of water in most homes. Many hot water heaters burn a fuel such as
natural gas. The burning fuel causes the water to get hot because combustion is an exothermic reaction.

Combustion as an Exothermic Reaction

All combustion reactions are exothermic reactions. During a combustion reaction, a substance burns as it combines
with oxygen. When substances burn, they usually give off energy as heat and light. Look at the big bonﬁre in the
Figure 3.37. The combustion of wood is an exothermic reaction that releases a lot of energy as heat and light. You
can see the light energy the ﬁre is giving off. If you were standing near the ﬁre, you would also feel its heat.

Summary

• An exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction in which less energy is needed to break bonds in the reactants

than is released when new bonds form in the products.

• During an exothermic reaction, energy is constantly given off, often in the form of heat.
• All combustion reactions are exothermic reactions. During combustion, a substance burns as it combines with

oxygen, releasing energy in the form of heat and light.

3.25 Conservation of Energy in Chemical Reac-

tions

• Summarize the role of energy in chemical reactions.
• State the law of conservation of energy.
• Explain how energy is conserved in chemical reactions.

The blue ﬂame in this photo is burning inside a home furnace. The fuel is natural gas, and it combines with oxygen
when it burns. This chemical reaction, called a combustion reaction, gives off a lot of energy.

Energy and Chemical Reactions

All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new
bonds form in products. Like the combustion reaction in a furnace, some chemical reactions require less energy to
break bonds in reactants than is released when bonds form in products. These reactions, called exothermic reactions,
release energy. In other chemical reactions, it takes more energy to break bonds in reactants than is released when
bonds form in products. These reactions, called endothermic reactions, absorb energy.

Conservation of Energy

Whether a chemical reaction absorbs or releases energy, there is no overall change in the amount of energy during
the reaction. That’s because energy cannot be created or destroyed. This is the law of conservation of energy.
Energy may change form during a chemical reaction—for example, from chemical energy to heat energy when gas
burns in a furnace—but the same amount of energy remains after the reaction as before. This is true of all chemical
reactions. You can learn more about the law of conservation of energy at this URL: http://www.fi.edu/guide/hugh
es/energyconservation.html .

410

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Q: If energy can’t be destroyed during a chemical reaction, what happens to the energy that is absorbed in an
endothermic reaction?
A: The energy is stored in the bonds of the products as chemical energy. In an endothermic reaction, the products
have more stored chemical energy than the reactants. This is represented by the graph on the left in the Figure 3.38.
In an exothermic reaction, the opposite is true. The products have less stored chemical energy than the reactants.
You can see this in the graph on the right in the Figure 3.38.

FIGURE 3.38
Note: ∆H represents the change in en-
ergy.

Q: What happens to the excess energy in the reactants of an exothermic reaction?
A: The excess energy is generally released to the surroundings when the reaction occurs. In a home heating system,
for example, the energy that is released during combustion in the furnace is used to heat the home.

Summary

• All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when
new bonds form in products. Endothermic reactions absorb energy, and exothermic reactions release energy.
• The law of conservation of energy states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Whether a chemical

reaction absorbs or releases energy, there is no overall change in the amount of energy during the reaction.

3.26. Activation Energy

www.ck12.org

3.26 Activation Energy

• Deﬁne activation energy.
• Explain why all chemical reactions require activation energy.

These cheerleaders have a lot of energy! Their role is to get the fans as excited as they are so everyone will cheer for
the team. They use their energy to activate the crowd.

Getting Started

Chemical reactions also need energy to be activated. They require a certain amount of energy just to get started.
This energy is called activation energy. For example, activation energy is needed to start a car engine. Turning the
key causes a spark that activates the burning of gasoline in the engine. The combustion of gas won’t occur without
the spark of energy to begin the reaction.
Q: Why is activation energy needed? Why won’t a reaction occur without it?
A: A reaction won’t occur unless atoms or molecules of reactants come together. This happens only if the particles
are moving, and movement takes energy. Often, reactants have to overcome forces that push them apart. This takes
energy as well. Still more energy is needed to start breaking bonds in reactants.

Activating Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions

Some chemical reactions need a constant input of energy to take place. They are called endothermic reactions.
Other chemical reactions release energy when they occur, so they can keep going without any added energy. They
are called exothermic reactions.

412

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Q: It makes sense that endothermic reactions need activation energy. But do exothermic reactions also need
activation energy?
A: All chemical reactions need energy to get started, even exothermic reactions. Look at the Figure 3.39. They
compare energy changes that occur during endothermic and exothermic reactions. From the graphs, you can see that
both types of reactions need the same amount of activation energy in order to get started. Only after it starts does the
exothermic reaction produce more energy than it uses.

FIGURE 3.39

A Common Example

You have probably used activation energy to start a chemical reaction. For example, if you’ve ever struck a match to
light it, then you provided the activation energy needed to start a combustion reaction. When you struck the match
on the box, the friction started the match head burning. Combustion is exothermic. Once a match starts to burn, it
releases enough energy to activate the next reaction, and the next, and so on. However, the match won’t burst into
ﬂames on its own.

Summary

• All chemical reactions, including exothermic reactions, need activation energy to get started.
• Activation energy is needed so reactants can move together, overcome forces of repulsion, and start breaking

bonds.

3.27 Chemical Reaction Rate

• Deﬁne chemical reaction rate.
• Identify factors that inﬂuence the rate of chemical reactions.

Sodium reacts violently with water. That’s what is happening in the picture above. Why does sodium have such
explosive reactions? It’s because the reactions occur so quickly.

How Fast Does It Go?

How fast a chemical reaction occurs is called the reaction rate. Several factors affect the rate of a given chemical
reaction. They include the:

• temperature of reactants.
• concentration of reactants.
• surface area of reactants.
• presence of a catalyst.

At the following URL, you can see animations showing how these factors affect the rate of chemical reactions.
http://www.kentchemistry.com/links/Kinetics/FactorsAffecting.htm

Temperature of Reactants

When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of
reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to

415

3.27. Chemical Reaction Rate

www.ck12.org

collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster
at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure 3.40). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator
or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure 3.40). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.

FIGURE 3.40
Left image: Bread after 1 month on a
warm countertop. Right image: Bread
after 1 month in a cold refrigerator.

Concentration of Reactants

Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. When the concentration of reactants is
higher, the reaction rate is faster. At higher concentrations, particles of reactants are crowded closer together, so they
are more likely to collide and react. Did you ever see a sign like the one in the Figure 3.41? You might see it where
someone is using a tank of pure oxygen for a breathing problem. Combustion, or burning, is a chemical reaction in
which oxygen is a reactant. A greater concentration of oxygen in the air makes combustion more rapid if a ﬁre starts
burning.

FIGURE 3.41

Q: It is dangerous to smoke or use open ﬂames when oxygen is in use. Can you explain why?
A: Because of the higher-than-normal concentration of oxygen, the ﬂame of a match, lighter, or cigarette could
spread quickly to other materials or even cause an explosion.

416

www.ck12.org

Surface Area of Reactants

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to
other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the
surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure 3.42.
Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater
surface area, so they will rust faster.

FIGURE 3.42

Presence of a Catalyst

Some reactions need extra help to occur quickly. They need another substance called a catalyst. A catalyst is a
substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction. A catalyst isn’t a reactant, so it isn’t changed or used up in
the reaction. Therefore, it can catalyze many other reactions.

Summary

• How fast a chemical reaction occurs is called the reaction rate.
• Several factors affect the rate of a chemical reaction, including the temperature, concentration, and surface

area of reactants, and the presence of a catalyst.

What Is a Catalyst?

A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction. The presence of a catalyst is one of several
factors that inﬂuence the rate of chemical reactions.
(Other factors include the temperature, concentration, and
surface area of reactants.) A catalyst isn’t a reactant in the chemical reaction it speeds up. As a result, it isn’t
changed or used up in the reaction, so it can go on to catalyze many more reactions.
Q: How is a catalyst like a tunnel through a mountain?
A: Like a tunnel through a mountain, a catalyst provides a faster pathway for a chemical reaction to occur.

How Catalysts Work

Catalysts interact with reactants so the reaction can occur by an alternate pathway that has a lower activation energy.
Activation energy is the energy needed to start a reaction. When activation energy is lower, more reactant particles
have enough energy to react so the reaction goes faster. Many catalysts work like the one in the Figure 3.43. (You
can see an animated version at the following URL.) The catalyst brings the reactants together by temporarily bonding
with them. This makes it easier and quicker for the reactants to react together. Notice how the catalyst is released by
the product molecule at the end of the reaction.

Q: In the Figure 3.43, look at the energy needed in the catalytic and non-catalytic pathways of the reaction. How
does the amount of energy compare? How does this affect the reaction rate along each pathway?
A: The catalytic pathway of the reaction requires far less energy. Therefore, the reaction will occur faster by this
pathway because more reactants will have enough energy to react.

Catalysts in Living Things

Chemical reactions constantly occur inside living things. Many of these reactions require catalysts so they will occur
quickly enough to support life. Catalysts in living things are called enzymes. Enzymes may be extremely effective.
A reaction that takes a split second to occur with an enzyme might take many years without it!
More than 1000 different enzymes are necessary for human life. Many enzymes are needed for the digestion of food.
An example is amylase, which is found in the mouth and small intestine. Amylase catalyzes the breakdown of starch
to sugar. You can see how it affects the rate of starch digestion in the Figure 3.44.
Q: If you chew a starchy food such as a soda cracker for a couple of minutes, you may notice that it starts to taste
slightly sweet. Why does this happen?
A: The starches in the cracker start to break down to sugars with the help of the enzyme amylase. Try this yourself
and see if you can taste the reaction.

Summary

• A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction.
• A catalyst provides an alternate pathway for the reaction that has a lower activation energy. When activation

energy is lower, more reactant particles have enough energy to react, so the reaction occurs faster.

• Chemical reactions constantly occur inside living things, and many of them require catalysts to occur quickly

enough to support life. Catalysts in living things are called enzymes.

Spiral structures like the one pictured here could replace batteries in the future because they can store energy like

many compounds? Read on to ﬁnd out. If you ﬁrst want to learn more about carbon nanotubes, go to this URL: http

Carbon, Carbon Everywhere

Carbon is a very common “ingredient” of matter because it can combine with itself and with many other elements.
It can form a great diversity of compounds, ranging in size from just a few atoms to thousands of atoms. There are
millions of known carbon compounds, and carbon is the only element that can form so many different compounds.

Valence Electrons in Carbon

Carbon is a nonmetal in group 14 of the periodic table. Like other group 14 elements, carbon has four valence
electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that are involved in chemical
bonds. The valence electrons of carbon are shown in the electron dot diagram in the Figure 3.45.

421

3.29. Carbon Bonding

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 3.45

Q: How many more electrons does carbon need to have a full outer energy level?
A: Carbon needs four more valence electrons, or a total of eight valence electrons, to ﬁll its outer energy level. A
full outer energy level is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Q: How can carbon achieve a full outer energy level?
A: Carbon can form four covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are chemical bonds that form between nonmetals. In a
covalent bond, two atoms share a pair of electrons. By forming four covalent bonds, carbon shares four pairs of
electrons, thus ﬁlling its outer energy level and achieving stability.

How Carbon Forms Bonds

A carbon atom can form covalent bonds with other carbon atoms or with the atoms of other elements. Carbon often
forms bonds with hydrogen. Compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons. Methane
(CH4), which is modeled in the Figure 3.46, is an example of a hydrocarbon. In methane, a single carbon atom
forms covalent bonds with four hydrogen atoms. The diagram on the left in the Figure 3.46 shows all the shared
valence electrons. The diagram on the right in the Figure 3.46, called a structural formula, represents each pair of
shared electrons with a dash (–).

pairs of electrons. Examples of compounds with these types of bonds are represented by the structural formulas in

Q: How many bonds do the carbon atoms share in each of these compounds?
A: In ethane, the two carbon atoms share a single bond. In ethene they share a double bond, and in ethyne they share

• Carbon forms covalent bonds with atoms of carbon or other elements. There is a great diversity of carbon

compounds, ranging in size from just one to thousands of atoms.

• Carbon has four valence electrons, so it can achieve a full outer energy level by forming four covalent bonds.

When it bonds only with hydrogen, it forms compounds called hydrocarbons.

3.30 Carbon Monomers and Polymers

• Deﬁne polymer and monomer.
• Identify natural and synthetic carbon polymers.

You probably recognize this image as the great seal of the United States. The motto on the seal, E pluribus unum, is
Latin for “out of many, one.” It refers to the formation of one country out of many states. Large carbon compounds
could have the same motto. Can you guess why? In this lesson, you’ll ﬁnd out.

Out of Many, One

Carbon has a unique ability to form covalent bonds with many other atoms. It can bond with other carbon atoms
as well as with atoms of other elements. Because of this ability, carbon often forms polymers. A polymer is a
large molecule that is made out of many smaller molecules that are joined together by covalent bonds. The smaller,
repeating molecules are called monomers. (The preﬁx mono- means “one” and the preﬁx poly- means “many.”)
Polymers may consist of just one type of monomer or of more than one type. Polymers are similar to the strings of
beads pictured in the Figure 3.48. Like beads on a string, monomers in a polymer may be all the same or different
from one another.

Natural Carbon Polymers

Many polymers of carbon occur naturally. Two examples are rubber and cellulose.

• Rubber is a natural polymer of the monomer named isoprene (C5H8). This polymer comes from rubber trees,
which grow in tropical areas. Structural formulas for rubber and isoprene are shown in the Figure 3.49. Note
that just a small section of the rubber polymer is represented by the structural formula.

glucose are also shown in the Figure 3.49). As you can see from the structural formula for cellulose, when
two glucose monomers bond together, a molecule of water (H2O) is released.

Summary

• Carbon has a unique ability to form many covalent bonds, so it often forms polymers. A polymer is a large
molecule that is made up of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers, which are joined together
by covalent bonds.

• Natural polymers include rubber and cellulose. Synthetic polymers include plastics such as polyethylene.

3.31 Crystalline Carbon

• Identify and describe crystalline forms of carbon.

How annoying! Just as you start to write in your notebook, your pencil lead breaks. Actually, pencil “leads” aren’t
made of lead at all. They are made of a form of carbon called graphite. How carbon atoms are arranged in graphite
explains why it’s suitable for writing—and also why it breaks so easily.
Q: Graphite is one of several forms of carbon. How can a single element exist in different forms?
A: Carbon can exist in different forms because atoms of carbon can combine in different ways.

What Are the Forms of Carbon?

Graphite is one of three forms of crystalline, or crystal-forming, carbon. Carbon also exists in an amorphous, or
“shapeless,” form in substances such as coal and charcoal. Different forms of the same element are called allotropes.
Besides graphite, the other allotropes of crystalline carbon are diamond and fullerenes. All three forms exist as
crystals rather than molecules. In a crystal, many atoms are bonded together in a repeating pattern that may contains
thousands of atoms. The arrangement of atoms in the crystal differs for each form of carbon and explains why
the different forms have different properties. For an entertaining, video-game introduction to the three forms of
crystalline carbon, go to this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIHmfBsHsCY .

Q: How do you think the properties of diamond might differ from the properties of graphite?
A: Diamond is clear whereas graphite is black. Diamond is also very hard, so it doesn’t break easily. Graphite, in
contrast, is soft and breaks very easily.

Diamond

Diamond is a form of carbon in which each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms. This
forms a strong, rigid, three-dimensional structure (see Figure 3.52). Diamond is the hardest natural substance, and
no other natural substance can scratch it. This property makes diamonds useful for cutting and grinding tools as well
as for rings and other jewelry (see Figure 3.53).

FIGURE 3.52

Graphite

Graphite is a form of crystalline carbon in which each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms.
The carbon atoms are arranged in layers, with strong bonds within each layer but only weak bonds between layers

429

3.31. Crystalline Carbon

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 3.53

(see Figure 3.54). The weak bonds between layers allow the layers to slide over one another, so graphite is relatively
soft and slippery. This makes it useful as a lubricant.

FIGURE 3.54

Q: Why do graphite’s properties make it useful for pencil “leads”?
A: Being slippery, graphite slides easily over paper when you write. Being soft, it rubs off on the paper, allowing
you to leave marks. Graphite’s softness also allows you to sharpen it easily. (Imagine trying to sharpen a diamond!)

Fullerene

A fullerene (also called a Bucky ball) is a form of carbon in which carbon atoms are arranged in a hollow sphere
resembling a soccer ball (see Figure 3.55). Each sphere contains 60 carbon atoms, and each carbon atom is bonded to
three others by single covalent bonds. The bonds are relatively weak, so fullerenes can dissolve and form solutions.
Fullerenes were ﬁrst discovered in 1985 and have been found in soot and meteorites. Possible commercial uses of
fullerenes are under investigation.

Summary

• Different forms, or allotropes, of carbon are diamond, graphite, and fullerenes.

• In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms, forming a rigid structure that makes

diamond very hard.

• In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms, and the atoms forms layers that are only

weakly bonded together. This makes graphite soft and slippery.

• In a fullerene, carbon atoms are bonded to three other atoms in a soccer ball pattern. The bonds are weak, so

fullerenes can dissolve and form solutions.

3.32 Hydrocarbons

• Deﬁne hydrocarbon.
• Identify the two classes of hydrocarbons.
• Describe uses and sources of hydrocarbons.

Look at all of the pictures above. Each one shows an item that you might have used or seen used by someone else.
All of the items have something in common. Can you guess what it is? They all involve carbon compounds known
as hydrocarbons.

What Are Hydrocarbons?

Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. Hydrocarbons are the simplest type of
carbon-based compounds, but they can vary greatly in size. The smallest hydrocarbons have just one or two carbon
atoms. The largest hydrocarbons may have thousands of carbon atoms.
Q: How are hydrocarbons involved in each of the photos pictured above?
A: The main ingredient of mothballs is the hydrocarbon naphthalene. The main ingredient in nail polish remover is
the hydrocarbon acetone. The lawn mower runs on a mixture of hydrocarbons called gasoline, and the camp stove
burns a hydrocarbon fuel named isobutane.

Properties of Hydrocarbons

The size of hydrocarbon molecules inﬂuences their properties, including their melting and boiling points. As a result,
some hydrocarbons are gases at room temperature, while others are liquids or solids. Hydrocarbons are generally

433

3.32. Hydrocarbons

www.ck12.org

nonpolar, which means that their molecules do not have oppositely charged sides. Therefore, they do not dissolve in
water, which is a polar compound. In fact, hydrocarbons tend to repel water. That’s why they are used in ﬂoor wax
and similar products.

Classes of Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons are placed in two different classes: saturated hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons. This
classiﬁcation is based on the number of bonds between carbon atoms.

• Saturated hydrocarbons have only single bonds between carbon atoms, so the carbon atoms are bonded to as

many hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, they are saturated with hydrogen atoms.

• Unsaturated hydrocarbons have at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms, so the carbon atoms
are not bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, they are unsaturated with hydrogen
atoms.

Uses of Hydrocarbons

It is hard to overstate the importance of hydrocarbons to modern life. Hydrocarbons have even been called the
“driving force of western civilization.” You saw some ways they are used in the opening image. Several other
ways are pictured in the Figure 3.56. The most important use of hydrocarbons is for fuel. Gasoline, natural gas,
fuel oil, diesel fuel, jet fuel, coal, kerosene, and propane are just some of the commonly used hydrocarbon fuels.
Hydrocarbons are also used to make things, including plastics and synthetic fabrics such as polyester.

Sources of Hydrocarbons

The main source of hydrocarbons is fossil fuels—coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Fossil fuels formed over hundreds
of millions of years, as dead organisms were covered with sediments and put under great pressure. Giant ferns in
ancient swamps turned into coal deposits. The Figure 3.57 shows one way that coal deposits are mined. Dead
organisms in ancient seas gradually formed deposits of petroleum and natural gas. You can read more about these
sources of hydrocarbons at the URL below.
http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/story/chapter08.html

Summary

• Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. Hydrocarbons are the simplest type of

carbon-based compounds.

• Hydrocarbons vary greatly in size, which inﬂuences properties such as melting and boiling points. At room
temperature, hydrocarbons may be gases, liquids, or solids. They are generally nonpolar and do not dissolve
in water.

3.33 Saturated Hydrocarbons

• Deﬁne saturated hydrocarbon.
• Explain how saturated hydrocarbons are named.
• Identify shapes of saturated hydrocarbon molecules.

You can tell that this sponge is saturated with water because when it is squeezed, the water pours out. When
something is saturated with water, it already holds as much water as possible. Compounds called hydrocarbons,
which contain only carbon and hydrogen, can also be saturated, but not with water.

What Are Saturated Hydrocarbons?

Saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. They are the
simplest class of hydrocarbons. They are called saturated because each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen
atoms as possible. In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen. You can see an example of a
saturated hydrocarbon in the Figure 3.58. In this compound, named ethane, each carbon atom is bonded to three
hydrogen atoms. In the structural formula, each dash (-) represents a single covalent bond, in which two atoms share
one pair of valence electrons.
Q: What is the chemical formula for ethane?
A: The chemical formula is C2H6.

What’s in a Name?

Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes. The name of speciﬁc alkanes always ends in –ane.
The ﬁrst part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is
methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and
properties of methane, ethane, and other small alkanes are listed in the Table 3.7. The boiling and melting points of
alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally
boil and melt at higher temperatures.

Q: The Table 3.7 shows only alkanes that have relatively few carbon atoms. Some alkanes have many more carbon
atoms. What properties might larger alkanes have?
A: Alkanes with more carbon atoms have higher boiling and melting points, so some of them are solids at room
temperature.

Shapes of Alkanes
438
Structural formulas are often used to represent hydrocarbon compounds because the molecules can have different
shapes and a structural formula shows how the atoms are arranged. Hydrocarbons may form straight chains,

the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule,

3.34 Isomers

• Describe isomers of hydrocarbons.
• Contrast properties of isomers of the same hydrocarbon.
• Relate the number of isomers to the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon.

Look at the desks in the photos above. Both pictures show the same classroom with the same number of desks, but
the desks are arranged differently in each picture. The different arrangements work better for different classroom
activities. Desks in rows facing the front of the classroom are better for watching the teacher do demonstrations.
Desks facing each other in small groups are better for working on group projects. What does the arrangement of
desks in a classroom have to do with chemistry? Like desks in a classroom, atoms in a hydrocarbon molecule can
be arranged in different ways, and the different arrangements give them different properties.

Same Atoms, Different Shapes

Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms. The smallest hydrocarbon, methane
(CH4), contains just one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. Larger hydrocarbons contain many more. Hydro-
carbons with four or more carbon atoms can have different shapes. Although they have the same chemical formula,
with the same numbers of carbon and hydrogen atoms, they form different compounds, called isomers. Isomers are
compounds whose properties are different because their atoms are bonded together in different arrangements.

Examples of Isomers

The smallest hydrocarbon that has isomers is butane, which has just four carbon atoms. In the Figure 3.60 you
can see structural formulas for normal butane (or n-butane) and its only isomer, named iso-butane. Both molecules
have four carbon atoms as well as ten hydrogen atoms (C4H10), but the atoms are arranged differently in the two
compounds. In n-butane, all four carbon atoms are lined up in a straight chain. In iso-butane, one of the carbon
atoms branches off from the main chain. You can see three-dimensional models of these two isomers at the URLs
below. Rotate the molecule models to get a better idea of their shapes.
http://www.worldofmolecules.com/3D/butane_3d.htm
http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.6120.html
The next smallest hydrocarbon is pentane, which has ﬁve carbon atoms and twelve hydrogen atoms (C5H12). Pentane
has three isomers: n-pentane, iso-pentane, and neo-pentane. Their structural formulas are shown in the images below.
Look at the carbon atoms in each isomer. In n-pentane (see Figure 3.61), the carbon atoms form a straight chain. In
iso-pentane (see Figure 3.62), one carbon atom branches off from the main chain. In neo-pentane (see Figure 3.63),
two carbon atoms branch off from the main chain.

FIGURE 3.63

How Many Isomers?

Butane has only two isomers and pentane has just three, but some hydrocarbons have many more isomers than
these. As you increase the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon, the number of isomers quickly increases. For
example, heptane, with seven carbon atoms, has nine isomers; and dodecane, with twelve carbon atoms, has 355
isomers. Some hydrocarbons with many more carbon atoms have billions of isomers!
Q: Why does the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon determine how many isomers it has?
A: The more carbon atoms there are, the greater the number of possible arrangements of carbon atoms.

Properties of Isomers

Because isomers are different compounds, they have different properties. Generally, branched-chain isomers have
lower boiling and melting points than straight-chain isomers. For example, the boiling and melting points of iso-
butane are -12 °C and -160 °C, respectively, compared with 0 °C and -138 °C for n-butane. The more branching
there is, the lower the boiling and melting points are.
Q: The boiling point of n-pentane is 36 °C. Predict the boiling points of iso-pentane and neo-pentane.
A: The boiling point of iso-pentane is 28 °C, and the boiling point of neo-pentane is 10 °C.

Summary

• Hydrocarbons with the same numbers of atoms but different shapes form different compounds called isomers.
• Hydrocarbons with four or more carbon atoms have isomers. The more carbon atoms a hydrocarbon has, the

greater the number of isomers.

3.35 Unsaturated Hydrocarbons

• Deﬁne unsaturated hydrocarbon.
• Describe alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and alkynes.

Look at the difference between cooking oil and butter. Fats can be either liquid, like oil, or solid, like butter, at
room temperature depending on their chemical structure. Saturated fats are straight in structure and tightly packed
together to form a solid at room temperature. Double and triple bonds in unsaturated fats make them easier to break
down at lower temperatures.

What Are Unsaturated Hydrocarbons?

Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. The carbon atoms in hydrocarbons may share
single, double, or triple covalent bonds. Unsaturated hydrocarbons contain at least one double or triple bond
between carbon atoms. They are classiﬁed on the basis of their bonds as alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, or alkynes.
Q: Why do you suppose hydrocarbons with double or triple bonds are called unsaturated?
A: A carbon atom always forms four covalent bonds. Carbon atoms with double or triple bonds are unable to bond
with as many hydrogen atoms as they could if they were joined only by single bonds. This makes them unsaturated
with hydrogen atoms.

Alkenes

Unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. The name of a speciﬁc alkene
always ends in –ene and has a preﬁx indicating the number of carbon atoms. The structural formula in the Figure
3.64 represents the smallest alkene, named ethene, which has two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms (C2H4).
Ethene is produced by most fruits and vegetables. It speeds up ripening. The Figure 3.64 show the effects of ethene
on bananas.
Alkenes can have different shapes. They can form straight chains, branched chains, or rings. Alkenes with the same
atoms but different shapes are called isomers. Smaller alkenes have relatively high boiling and melting points, so

a special bag that absorbs ethene. The
bananas on the right were stored without
a bag.

they are gases at room temperature. Larger alkenes have lower boiling and melting points, so they are liquids or
waxy solids at room temperature.

Aromatic Hydrocarbons

Unsaturated hydrocarbons called aromatic hydrocarbons are cyclic hydrocarbons that have double bonds. These
compounds have six carbon atoms in a ring with alternating single and double bonds. The smallest aromatic
hydrocarbon is benzene, which has just one ring. Its structural formula is shown in the Figure 3.65. Larger aromatic
hydrocarbons consist of two or more rings, which are joined together by bonds between their carbon atoms. The
name of aromatic hydrocarbons comes from their strong aroma, or scent. That’s why they are used in air fresheners
and mothballs. You can learn more about these interesting hydrocarbons at this URL:

URL: http://www.ck12.org/ﬂx/render/embeddedobject/5091

Q: How many bonds does each carbon atom in benzene form?
A: Each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds. Carbon atoms always form four covalent bonds, regardless of the
atoms to which it bonds.

Alkynes

Unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more triple bonds are called alkynes. The names of speciﬁc alkynes
always end in –yne and have a preﬁx for the number of carbon atoms. The structural formula in the Figure 3.66
represents the smallest alkyne, named ethyne, which has two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms (C2H2). Ethyne
is also called acetylene. It is burned in acetylene torches, like the one pictured in the Figure 3.67. The ﬂame of an
acetylene torch is so hot that it can melt metal.
Alkynes may form straight or branched chains. They rarely occur in ring shapes. In fact, alkynes of all shapes are
relatively rare in nature.

functions. Only slight variations in the molecule exist between closely related species, as you can see in the Figure
3.68. The molecule is identical in humans and their closest relatives, the chimpanzees. And even between humans
and the single-celled tetrahymena (pictured in the Figure 3.68), the cytochrome c molecule is nearly 50 percent the
same.

Structure of Biochemical Molecules

All biochemical molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen as well as carbon. They may also contain nitrogen,
phosphorus, and/or sulfur. Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers. Polymers are large molecules that
consist of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers. Glucose is a monomer of biochemical compounds
called starches. In starches and all other biochemical polymers, monomers are joined together by covalent bonds, in
which atoms share pairs of valence electrons.

Size of Biochemical Molecules

Most biochemical molecules are macromolecules. The preﬁx macro- means “large,” and many biochemical molecules
are very large indeed. They may contain thousands of monomer molecules. The largest known biochemical molecule
is called titin. It plays an important role in muscle contraction. The human form of the molecule contains more than
34,000 monomers.
Its chemical name contains almost
190,000 letters, and it has been called the longest word in any language. Its chemical name is read rapidly in the
video at the following URL—and the video lasts more than 8 minutes!

Q: In which class of biochemical compounds would you place glucose?
A: Glucose is a sugar in the class carbohydrates. Like other carbohydrates, it contains only carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen. It provides energy to the cells of living things.
Q: Look back at the chemical formula for titin. In which class of biochemical compounds should it be placed?
A: Titin is a protein. You can tell because it contains sulfur, and proteins are the only biochemical compounds that
contain this element.

biochemical compounds between living things provides evidence for the evolution of species from common
ancestors.

• Deﬁne carbohydrate.
• Describe sugars and their role in living things.
• Identify starches and their sources.
• Outline the structure and functions of cellulose.

The ﬂuffy white ﬁbers on this plant look like cotton balls because that’s what they are. The plant is a cotton plant,
and the ﬁbers are used to make cotton fabric. Cotton ﬁbers consist of one of the most common compounds on
Earth: cellulose. Cellulose is a biochemical compound found in all plants. It belongs to the class of biochemical
compounds called carbohydrates.

What are Carbohydrates?

Carbohydrates are one of four classes of biochemical compounds. The other three classes are proteins, lipids, and
nucleic acids. In addition to cellulose, carbohydrates include sugars and starches. Carbohydrate molecules contain
atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Living things use carbohydrates mainly for energy. For more in-depth
information on carbohydrates, you may want to watch the videos at these URLs:

Q: Which carbohydrates do you use for energy?

453

3.37. Carbohydrate Classiﬁcation

www.ck12.org

A: You may eat a wide variety of carbohydrates—from sugars in fruits to starches in potatoes. However, body cells
use only sugars for energy.

Sugars

Sugars are simple carbohydrates. Molecules of sugars have relatively few carbon atoms. Glucose (C6H12O6) is one
of the smallest sugar molecules. Plants and some other organisms make glucose in the process of photosynthesis.
Living things that cannot make glucose obtain it by consuming plants or these other organisms.
In the Figure 3.69, you can see structural formulas for glucose and two other sugars, named fructose and sucrose.
Fructose is a sugar that is found in fruits. It is an isomer of glucose. Isomers are compounds that have the same
atoms but different arrangements of atoms. Do you see how the atoms are arranged differently in fructose than in
glucose? You’re probably most familiar with the sugar sucrose, because sucrose is table sugar. It’s the sugar that
you spoon onto your cereal or into your iced tea.

FIGURE 3.69
Note: Each unlettered point where lines
intersect represents a carbon atom.

Q: Compare the structure of sucrose with the structures of glucose and fructose. How is sucrose related to the other
two sugars?
A: Sucrose consists of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose bonded together.

Starches

Starches are complex carbohydrates. They are polymers of glucose. A polymer is a large molecule that consists
of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers. The monomers are joined together by covalent bonds.
Starches contain hundreds of glucose monomers. Plants make starches to store extra glucose. Consumers get
starches by eating plants. Common sources of starches in the human diet are pictured in the Figure 3.70. Our
digestive system breaks down starches to sugar, which our cells use for energy.

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

FIGURE 3.70
Foods that are good sources of starches.

Cellulose

Cellulose is another complex carbohydrate that is a polymer of glucose. However, glucose molecules are bonded
together differently in cellulose than they are in starches. Cellulose molecules bundle together to form long, tough
ﬁbers, as you can see in the Figure 3.71. Have you ever eaten raw celery? If you have, then you probably noticed that
the stalks contain long, stringy ﬁbers. The ﬁbers are mostly cellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant biochemical
compound. It makes up the cell walls of plants and gives support to stems and tree trunks. Cellulose also provides
needed ﬁber in the human diet. We can’t digest cellulose, but it helps keep food wastes moving through the digestive
tract.

Summary

• Carbohydrates are biochemical compounds that include sugars, starches, and cellulose. They contain carbon,

hydrogen, and oxygen, and they are used mainly for energy by living things.

• Sugars are simple carbohydrates such as glucose, which the cells of living things use for energy.
• Starches are complex carbohydrates that are polymers of glucose. Starches are used by plants to store energy.

3.38 Protein Classiﬁcation

• Identify the class of biochemical compounds named proteins.
• Describe the structure of proteins.
• List functions of proteins.

These pretty, colorful “ribbons” aren’t leftover ribbons from birthday gifts. The “ribbons” are a model of a molecule
called hemoglobin, which is coursing through your blood vessels right now. Hemoglobin is a compound that is
found in red blood cells and has the crucial job of carrying oxygen to cells throughout the body. Your life depends
on hemoglobin.

Meet the Proteins

Hemoglobin is a compound in the class of compounds called proteins. Proteins are one of four classes of biochemi-
cal compounds, which are compounds in living things. (The other three classes are carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic
acids.) Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Protein molecules consist of one or more
chains of small molecules called amino acids.

457

3.38. Protein Classiﬁcation

Protein Structure

www.ck12.org

Amino acids are the “building blocks” of proteins. There are 20 different amino acids. The structural formula of the
simplest amino acid, called glycine, is shown in the Figure 3.72. Other amino acids have slightly different structures.
A protein molecule is made from one or more long chains of amino acids, each linked to its neighbors by covalent
bonds. If a protein has more than one chain, the chains are held together by weaker bonds, such as hydrogen bonds.

FIGURE 3.72

The sequence of amino acids in chains and the number of chains in a protein determine the protein’s shape. The
shape of a protein, in turn, determines its function. Shapes may be very complex. You can learn more about the

Protein Functions

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Proteins are the most numerous and diverse biochemical compounds, and they have many different functions. Some
of their functions include:

• making up tissues as components of muscle.
• speeding up biochemical reactions as enzymes.
• regulating life processes as hormones.
• helping to defend against infections as antibodies.
• carrying materials around the body as transport proteins (see the example of hemoglobin in the Figure 3.73).

FIGURE 3.73
The blood protein hemoglobin binds with
oxygen and carries it from the lungs to

the body’s cells. Heme is a small
molecule containing iron that is part of
the larger hemoglobin molecule. Oxygen
binds to the iron in heme.

3.39 Lipid Classiﬁcation

• Identify the class of biochemical compounds called lipids.
• Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.
• Explain the role of phospholipids in the cell membranes of living things.

You’ve probably seen dozens of nutrition facts labels like the one in the opening image. The labels show the nutrients
that foods contain. Many people read nutrition facts labels to see how much fat there is in particular foods. That’s
because eating too much fat, especially saturated fat, can be unhealthy and contribute to weight gain. Fats are a type
of biochemical compound called lipids.

What Are Lipids?

Lipids are one of four classes of biochemical compounds, which are compounds that make up living things and
carry out life processes. (The other three classes of biochemical compounds are carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic
acids.) Living things use lipids to store energy. Lipids are also the major components of cell membranes in living
things. Types of lipids include fats and oils.

• Fats are solid lipids that animals use to store energy.
• Oils are liquid lipids that plants use to store energy.

Q: Can you name some lipids that are fats? What are some lipids that are oils?
A: Lipids that are fats include butter and the fats in meats. Lipids that are oils include olive oil and vegetable oil.
Examples of both types of lipids are pictured in the Figure 3.74.

FIGURE 3.74
(A) The white bands on these lamb chops
are fat. (B) The yellow liquid in this bottle
is olive oil.

Fatty Acids

Lipids consist only or mainly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Both fats and oils are made up of long chains
of carbon atoms that are bonded together. These chains are called fatty acids. Fatty acids may be saturated or
unsaturated. In the Figure 3.75 you can see structural formulas for two small fatty acids, one saturated and one
unsaturated.

• Saturated fatty acids have only single bonds between carbon atoms. As a result, the carbon atoms are bonded
In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogens.

to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.
Saturated fatty acids are found in fats.

• Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond between carbon atoms. As a result, some carbon atoms
are not bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. They are unsaturated with hydrogens. Unsaturated
fatty acids are found in oils.

FIGURE 3.75

Q: Both of these fatty acid molecules have six carbon atoms and two oxygen atoms. How many hydrogen atoms
does each fatty acid molecule contain? What else is different about the two molecules?
A: The saturated fatty acid molecule has 12 hydrogen atoms. This is as many hydrogen atoms as can possibly be
bonded to carbon atoms in this molecule. The unsaturated fatty acid molecule has 10 hydrogen atoms, or two less
than the maximum possible number. The saturated fatty acid has only single bonds between its carbon atoms. The
unsaturated fatty acid has a double bond between two of its carbon atoms.

Phospholipids

Some lipids contain the element phosphorus as well as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These lipids are called
phospholipids. Two layers of phospholipid molecules make up the cell membranes of living things. In the Figure
3.76, you can see how phospholipid molecules are arranged in a cell membrane.

• One end of each phospholipid molecule is polar, so it has a partial electric charge. Water is also polar and has

462

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

electrically charged ends, so it is attracted to the oppositely charged end of a phospholipid molecule. This end
of the phospholipid molecule is described as hydrophilic, which means “water loving.”

• The other end of each phospholipid molecule is nonpolar and has no electric charge. This end of the phospho-

lipid molecule repels polar water and is described as hydrophobic, or “water hating.”

FIGURE 3.76

In the Figure 3.76, the hydrophilic ends of the phospholipid molecules are on the outsides of the cell membrane,
and the hydrophobic ends are on the inside of the cell membrane. This arrangement of phospholipids allows some
substances to pass through the cell membrane while keeping other substances out. You can see how this works in
the video at the URL below.

• Describe the structure of nucleic acids.
• Identify the functions of nucleic acids.

Did you ever see a spiral staircase like the one in the opening image? The steps connect the two sides of the staircase,
which winds around a central axis. A spiral staircase can be used as a model for a DNA molecule. DNA is a nucleic
acid.
Q: DNA is such a well-known molecule that you probably know something about it already. What do you know
about DNA, and why do you think this molecule is so “famous”?
A: You many know that DNA contains genes. It is so “famous” because it explains how we inherit traits from our
parents and pass them on to our offspring.

What Are Nucleic Acids?

Nucleic acids are one of four classes of biochemical compounds.
(The other three classes are carbohydrates,
proteins, and lipids.) Nucleic acids include RNA (ribonucleic acid) as well as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Both
types of nucleic acids contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus.
Q: Which of the elements in DNA is not identiﬁed with any other class of biochemical compounds?

465

3.40. Nucleic Acid Classiﬁcation

www.ck12.org

A: All biochemical compounds contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; and proteins as well as nucleic acids contain
nitrogen. Phosphorus is the only element that is identiﬁed with nucleic acids.

Nucleotides

Nucleic acids consist of chains of small molecules called nucleotides, which are held together by covalent bonds.
The structure of a nucleotide is shown in the Figure 3.77. Each nucleotide consists of:

1. a phosphate group, which contains phosphorus and oxygen (PO4).
2. a sugar, which is deoxyribose (C5H8O4) in DNA and ribose (C5H10O5) in RNA.
3. one of four nitrogen-containing bases. (A base is a compound that is not neither acidic nor neutral.) In DNA,
the bases are adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. RNA has the base uracil instead of thymine, but the
other three bases are the same.

FIGURE 3.77

The Double Helix

RNA consists of just one chain of nucleotides. DNA consists of two chains. Nitrogen bases on the two chains
of DNA form hydrogen bonds with each other. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak bonds that form between a
positively charged hydrogen atom in one molecule and a negatively charged atom in another molecule. Hydrogen
bonds form only between adenine and thymine, and between guanine and cytosine. These bonds hold the two chains
together and give DNA is characteristic double helix, or spiral, shape.
You can see the shape of the DNA molecule in the Figure 3.78. Sugars and phosphate groups form the “backbone”
of each chain of DNA. The bonded bases are called base pairs. Determining the structure of DNA was a huge
scientiﬁc breakthrough. You can read the interesting story of its discovery and why it was so important at the URL
below.

Functions of Nucleic Acids

DNA stores genetic information in the cells of all living things. It contains the genetic code. This is the code that
instructs cells how to make proteins. The instructions are encoded in the sequence of nitrogen bases in the nucleotide
chains of DNA. RNA copies and interprets the genetic code in DNA and is also involved in the synthesis of proteins
based on the code. You can watch these events unfolding at the following URL. http://www.youtube.com/watch

Q: DNA is found only in the nucleus of cells, but proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm of cells, outside of
the nucleus. How do you think the instructions encoded in DNA reach the cytoplasm so they can be used to make
proteins?
A: After RNA copies the instructions in DNA, it carries them from the nucleus to a site of protein synthesis in the
cytoplasm, where the instructions are translated into a protein.

3.41 Biochemical Reaction Chemistry

• Deﬁne biochemical reaction.
• Distinguish between catabolic and anabolic reactions.
• Explain the importance of enzymes in biochemical reactions.
• Relate the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.

This marathon runner has just ﬁnished running a 26.2-mile race! Running that far nonstop takes a lot of energy—you
can tell how drained she is from her face. But you don’t have to run a marathon to use energy. All living things need
energy all the time just to stay alive. Whether it’s running a marathon or simply taking a breath, energy is required.
Where does all that energy come from? The answer is chemical reactions.

Chemical Reactions in Living Things

Chemical reactions that take place inside living things are called biochemical reactions (bio- means “life”). It’s not
just for energy that living things depend on biochemical reactions. Every function and structure of a living organism
depends on thousands of biochemical reactions taking place in each cell. The sum of all these biochemical reactions
is called metabolism.

Catabolic and Anabolic Reactions

Biochemical reactions of metabolism can be divided into two general categories: catabolic reactions and anabolic
reactions. You can watch an animation showing how the two categories of reactions are related at this URL: http://c
lasses.midlandstech.edu/carterp/courses/bio225/chap05/lecture1.htm

• Catabolic reactions involve breaking bonds. Larger molecules are broken down to smaller ones. For example,
complex carbohydrates are broken down to simple sugars. Catabolic reactions release energy, so they are
exothermic.

469

3.41. Biochemical Reaction Chemistry

www.ck12.org

• Anabolic reactions involve forming bonds. Smaller molecules are combined to form larger ones. For example,
simple sugars are combined to form complex carbohydrates. Anabolic reactions require energy, so they are
endothermic.

Q: Imagine! Each of the trillions of cells in your body is continuously performing thousands of catabolic and
anabolic reactions. That’s an amazing number of biochemical reactions—far more than the number of reactions that
might take place in a lab or factory. How can so many biochemical reactions take place simultaneously in our cells?
A: So many reactions can occur because biochemical reactions are amazingly fast.
Q: In a lab or factory, reactants can be heated to very high temperatures or placed under great pressure so they
will react very quickly. These ways of speeding up chemical reactions can’t occur inside the delicate cells of living
things. So how do cells speed up biochemical reactions?
A: The answer is enzymes.

The Importance of Enzymes

Enzymes are proteins that increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed
for reactants to start reacting. Enzymes are synthesized in the cells that need them, based on instructions encoded
in the cell’s DNA. Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed
up the same reaction over and over again. Enzymes are highly speciﬁc for certain chemical reactions, so they are
very effective. A reaction that would take years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the
enzyme. Enzymes are also very efﬁcient, so waste products rarely form.

Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration

Some of the most important biochemical reactions are the reactions involved in photosynthesis and cellular respi-
ration. Together, these two processes provide energy to almost all of Earth’s organisms. The two processes are
closely related, as you can see in the Figure 3.79. In photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is converted to stored
chemical energy in glucose. In cellular respiration, stored energy is released from glucose and stored in smaller
amounts that cells can use.

FIGURE 3.79

470

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Q: What are the reactants and products in photosynthesis and cellular respiration?
A: In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are the reactants. They combine using energy from
light to produce oxygen (O2) and glucose (C6H12O6). Oxygen and glucose, in turn, are the reactants in cellular
respiration. They combine to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy.

Summary

• Biochemical reactions are chemical reactions that take place inside living things. Thousands of biochemical
reactions continuously take place inside each cell. The sum of all these biochemical reactions is called
metabolism.

• Biochemical reactions of metabolism can be divided into two general categories: catabolic reactions, which

break bonds and release energy, and anabolic reactions, which form bonds and absorb energy.

• Enzymes are proteins that greatly increase the rate of biochemical reactions, allowing thousands of reactions

to occur simultaneously in living cells.

• The chemical reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration together provide energy to virtually all living

things on Earth.

3.42 Photosynthesis Reactions

• Summarize the process of photosynthesis.
• State the importance of photosynthesis.
• Identify photosynthetic organisms.

Look at the amazing meat-eating plants pictured here! Called pitcher plants, they use their “pitchers” to capture
and digest insects. But even these pitcher plants—like all other plants—make food by photosynthesis. They “eat”
insects just to get extra nutrients.

Food from Light

Most of the energy used by living things comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. That’s because sunlight
provides the energy for photosynthesis. This is the process in which plants and certain other organisms synthesize
glucose (C6H12O6). The process uses carbon dioxide and water and also produces oxygen. The overall chemical
equation for photosynthesis is:
6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2
Photosynthesis changes light energy to chemical energy. The chemical energy is stored in the bonds of glucose
molecules. Glucose, in turn, is used for energy by the cells of almost all living things. Photosynthetic organisms
such as plants make their own glucose. Other organisms get glucose by consuming plants (or organisms that consume
plants).
Q: How do living things get energy from glucose?
A: They break bonds in glucose and release the stored energy in the process of cellular respiration.

The organisms pictured in the Figures 3.80, 3.81, and 3.82 all use sunlight to make glucose in the process of
photosynthesis. In addition to plants, they include bacteria and algae. All of these organisms contain the green
pigment chlorophyll, which is needed to capture light energy.

Summary

• Photosynthesis is the process in which certain living things use energy in sunlight to synthesize glucose from

carbon dioxide and water. Oxygen is also produced in this process.

• Chemical energy that is stored in the bonds of glucose molecules is used by the cells of almost all living things

for energy.

3.43 Cellular Respiration Reactions

• Give the overall chemical equation for cellular respiration.
• Describe the energy changes that occur during cellular respiration.

“Now, take a deep breath so I can listen to your lungs.” Did your doctor ever tell you that, while listening to your
back or chest with a stethoscope? Breathing is often referred to as respiration. When you breathe, you take oxygen
into your lungs as you inhale, and you release carbon dioxide and water vapor as you exhale. Inside all the cells of
your body, a different kind of respiration takes place. This kind of respiration is called cellular respiration.

What is Cellular Respiration?

Cellular Respiration is the process in which the cells of living things break down the organic compound glucose
with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. The overall chemical equation for cellular respiration is:
C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O
As the Figure 3.83 shows, cellular respiration occurs in the cells of all kinds of organisms, including those that make
their own food (autotrophs) as well as those that get their food by consuming other organisms (heterotrophs).
Q: How is cellular respiration related to breathing?

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

FIGURE 3.83

A: Breathing consists of inhaling and exhaling, and its purpose is to move gases into and out of the body. Oxygen
needed for cellular respiration is brought into the body with each inhalation. Carbon dioxide and water vapor
produced by cellular respiration are released from the body with each exhalation.

Energy Changes in Cellular Respiration

The reactions of cellular respiration are catabolic reactions.
In catabolic reactions, bonds are broken in larger
molecules and energy is released. In cellular respiration, bonds are broken in glucose, and this releases the chemical
energy that was stored in the glucose bonds. Some of this energy is converted to heat. The rest of the energy is used
to form many small molecules of a compound called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. ATP molecules contain just
the right amount of stored chemical energy to power biochemical reactions inside cells. You can see these energy
changes in cellular respiration in the video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyMfKP1D7OE .

3.44 Enzymes as Catalysts

• Deﬁne enzyme.
• Explain why chemical reactions in living cells require enzymes.
• Describe how enzymes work.
• Identify two human digestive enzymes.

An enzyme cleaner like the one pictured here contains proteins called enzymes. The enzymes attach themselves to
particular stains and help break them down. Different enzymes work on different types of stains, such as grease
stains or bloodstains. Removing stains isn’t the only use of enzymes. Enzymes are also essential to life.

Why Living Things Need Enzymes

Chemical reactions constantly occur inside the cells of living things. However, under the conditions inside cells,
most biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to maintain life. That’s where enzymes come in. Enzymes are
catalysts in living things. Like other catalysts, they speed up chemical reactions. Enzymes are proteins that are
synthesized in the cells that need them, based on instructions encoded in the cells’ DNA.

How Enzymes Work

Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants
to start reacting. One way this can happen is modeled in the Figure 3.84. Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in
the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again. Each enzyme
is highly speciﬁc for the particular reaction is catalyzes, so enzymes are very effective. A reaction that would take
many years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme. Enzymes are also very
efﬁcient, so waste products rarely form.

Q: This model of enzyme action is called the lock-and-key model. Explain why.
A: The substrates (reactants) ﬁt precisely into the active site of the enzyme like a key into a lock. Being brought
together in the enzyme in this way helps the reactants react more easily. After the product is formed, it is released
by the enzyme. The enzyme is now ready to pick up more reactants and catalyze another reaction. You can see an
animated version of this model at the following URL.

3.45 Solutions

• Describe solutions.
• Identify the parts of a solution.
• Deﬁne soluble and insoluble.
• Give examples of solutions in different states of matter.

It can be really exciting to explore a big underground cave like the one in this picture. Do you know how caves
form? Believe it or not, water is the answer. Water slowly dissolves rocks, especially certain types of rocks such as
limestone. When rocks or other substances dissolve in water, they form a solution.

What Is a Solution?

A solution is a mixture of two or more substances, but it’s not just any mixture. A solution is a homogeneous
mixture. In a homogeneous mixture, the dissolved particles are spread evenly through the mixture. The particles
of the solution are also too small to be seen or to settle out of the mixture. To put solutions in context as a type of
mixture, watch the video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2vM-G5I92U .

Parts of a Solution

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

All solutions have two parts: the solute and the solvent. The solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent
is the substance that dissolves the solute. Particles of solvent pull apart particles of solute, and the solute particles
spread throughout the solvent. Salt water, such as the ocean water in the Figure 3.86, is an example of a solution.
In a saltwater solution, salt is the solute and water is the solvent.

FIGURE 3.86

Q: A scientist obtained a sample of water from the Atlantic Ocean and determined that the sample was about 3.5
percent dissolved salt. Predict the percent of dissolved salt in a sample of water from the Paciﬁc Ocean.
A: As a solution, ocean water is a homogeneous mixture. Therefore, no matter where the water sample is obtained,
its composition will be about 3.5 percent dissolved salt.

Soluble or Insoluble?

Not only salt, but many other solutes can dissolve in water. In fact, so many solutes can dissolve in water that water
has been called the universal solvent. Even rocks can dissolve in water, which explains the cave that opened this
article. A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, is said to be soluble in that solvent. Conversely,
a solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent.
Although most solutes can dissolve in water, some solutes are insoluble in water. Oil is an example. Did you ever
try to mix oil with water? No matter how well you mix the oil into the water, after the mixture stands for a while,
the oil separates from the water and rises to the top. You can see how oil ﬂoats on ocean water in the Figure 3.87.

Solutions and States of Matter

Like salt water in the ocean, many solutions are normally in the liquid state. However, matter in any state can form
a solution. An alloy, which is a mixture of a metal with one or more other substances, is a solid solution at room
temperature. For example, the alloy bronze is a solution of copper and tin. Matter in the gaseous state can also form
solutions.
Q: What is an example of a gaseous solution?
A: Air in the atmosphere is a gaseous solution. It is a mixture that contains mainly nitrogen and oxygen gases,
with very small amounts of several other gases. The circle graph in the Figure 3.88 shows the composition of air.

483

3.45. Solutions

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 3.87
Oil from an oil spill ﬂoats on ocean water.

Because air is a solution, it is homogeneous. In other words, no matter where you go, the air always contains the
same proportion of gases that are shown in the graph.

FIGURE 3.88

Summary

• A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances in which the dissolved particles are too small

to be seen or to settle out of the mixture.

• In a solution, the substance that dissolves is the solute, and the substance that dissolves the solute is the solvent.
• A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent is said to be soluble in that solvent. A solute that cannot dissolve

in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent.

• Solutions may be liquids such as salt water, solids such as alloys, or gases such as air.

This giant Buddha statue, which is a national treasure in Japan, is made of bronze. Bronze consists mainly of copper
but also contains some tin. Bronze is an example of a solution. A solution is a type of mixture that has the same
composition throughout.

How a Solution Forms

A solution forms when one substance is dissolved by another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The
substance that dissolves it is called the solvent. The solute is present in a lesser amount that the solvent. When the
solute dissolves, it separates into individual particles, which spread throughout the solvent.
Q: In bronze, what are the solute and solvent?
A: Because bronze consists mainly of copper, copper is the solvent and tin is the solute. The two metals are combined
in a hot, molten state, but they form a solid solution at room temperature.

What’s Your State?

In the example of bronze, a solid (tin) is dissolved in another solid (copper). However, matter in any state can be the
solute or solvent in a solution. For example, in a saltwater solution, a solid (salt) is dissolved in a liquid (water). The

Water as a Solvent

Salt isn’t the only solute that dissolves in water. In fact, so many things dissolve in water that water is sometimes
called the universal solvent. Water is such a good solvent because it is a very polar compound. A polar compound
has positively and negatively charged ends. Solutes that are also charged are attracted to the oppositely charged ends
of water molecules. This allows the water molecules to pull the solute particles apart.
On the other hand, there are some substances that don’t dissolve in water. Did you ever try to clean a paintbrush
with water after painting with an oil-based paint? It doesn’t work. Oil-based paint is nonpolar, so its particles aren’t
charged. As a result, oil-based paint doesn’t dissolve in water. (You can see how to dissolve oil-based paint in the
Figure 3.89.)

FIGURE 3.89
To dissolve a nonpolar solute such as oil-based paint, a nonpolar solvent
such as paint thinner must be used.

Like Dissolves Like

These examples illustrate a general rule about solutes and solvents: like dissolves like. In other words, polar solvents
dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes. You can see a student’s video demonstrating
solutes that do and solutes that don’t dissolve in water at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek6CVVJk4

Ionic and Covalent Solutes

All solutes separate into individual particles when they dissolve, but the particles are different for ionic and covalent
compounds. Ionic solutes separate into individual ions. Covalent solutes separate into individual molecules.
Salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), is an ionic compound. When it dissolves in water, it separates into positive sodium
ions (Na+) and negative chloride ions (Cl−). You can see how this happens in the Figure 3.90. The negative oxygen
ends of water molecules attract the positive sodium ions, and the positive hydrogen ends of water molecules attract
the negative chloride ions. These forces of attraction pull the ions apart. You can watch this happening in animations
at these URLs:

3.47 Rate of Dissolving

• Identify factors that affect the rate of dissolving.

If you’re like Tanya in this picture, you prefer your iced tea sweetened with sugar. Sweetened iced tea is a solution
in which solid sugar (the solute) is dissolved in cold liquid tea, which is mostly water (the solvent). When you add
sugar to tea, particles of water pull apart particles of sugar. The particles of sugar spread throughout the tea, making
all of it taste sweet.

Factors That Affect the Rate of Dissolving

Did you ever get impatient and start drinking a sweetened drink before all the sugar has dissolved? As you drink the
last few drops, you notice that some of the sugar is sitting on the bottom of the container.
Q: What could you do to dissolve the sugar faster?
A: The rate of dissolving is inﬂuenced by several factors, including stirring, temperature of solvent, and size of
solute particles. You can see videos demonstrating these factors at the following URLs:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF55VAk1Nlk

Stirring

Stirring a solute into a solvent speeds up the rate of dissolving because it helps distribute the solute particles
throughout the solvent. For example, when you add sugar to iced tea and then stir the tea, the sugar will dissolve
faster. If you don’t stir the iced tea, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer.

Temperature

The temperature of the solvent is another factor that affects how fast a solute dissolves. Generally, a solute dissolves
faster in a warmer solvent than it does in a cooler solvent because particles have more energy of movement. For
example, if you add the same amount of sugar to a cup of hot tea and a cup of iced tea, the sugar will dissolve faster
in the hot tea.

Particle Size

A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the size of solute particles. For a given amount of solute, smaller
particles have greater surface area. With greater surface area, there can be more contact between particles of solute
and solvent. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of iced tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the
same amount of sugar in a cube (see Figure 3.92). That’s because all those tiny particles of granulated sugar have
greater total surface area than a single sugar cube.

• Give examples of freezing point depression and boiling point elevation.

Why hasn’t the ocean water in this photo turned to ice? The water in the glacier on shore is frozen solid, but the
water in the ocean is still in a liquid state.
Q: What is it about ocean water that keeps it from freezing when the temperature falls below the freezing point of
pure water?
A: Ocean water is salty.

How Solutes Affect Solvents

Salt water in the ocean is a solution. In a solution, one substance, called the solute, dissolves in another substance,
called the solvent. In ocean water, salt is the solute and water is the solvent. When a solute dissolves in a solvent,
it changes the physical properties of the solvent. In particular, the solute generally lowers the freezing point of the
solvent, which is called freezing point depression, and raises the boiling point of the solvent, which is called boiling
point elevation. For example, adding either salt to water lowers the freezing point and raises the boiling point of the
water. To learn the why these effects occur, watch the excellent video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch
?v=z9LxdqYntlU .

Freezing Point Depression

Pure water freezes at 0 °C, but the salt water in the ocean freezes at -2.2 °C because of freezing point depression.
We take advantage of the freezing point depression of salt in water by putting salt on ice to melt it. That’s why the
truck in the Figure 3.93 is spreading salt on an icy road.

FIGURE 3.93

Did you ever see anyone add a ﬂuid to their car radiator? The ﬂuid might be antifreeze, like in the Figure 3.94.
Antifreeze lowers the temperature of the water in the car radiator so it won’t freeze, even when the temperature falls
far below 0 °C. For example, a 50 percent antifreeze solution won’t freeze unless the temperature goes below -37
°C.

FIGURE 3.94

Boiling Point Elevation

Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator.
Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C,
which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously
damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50
percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin
the engine.

3.49 Solubility

• Deﬁne solubility.
• Describe how temperature and pressure affect solubility.

Rhonda wanted to see if salt or sugar dissolves faster in water. She added the same amount of salt and sugar to a
half liter of room temperature (20 °C) water in separate glasses. Then she stirred both mixtures. All of the sugar
dissolved in less than a minute, but after 5 minutes of stirring, some of the salt still hadn’t dissolved. Even if she had
kept stirring the saltwater mixture all day, the remaining salt would not dissolve. Do you know why? The answer is
their solubility.

What Is Solubility?

Solubility is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature. In a solution,
the solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that does the dissolving. For a given solvent,
some solutes have greater solubility than others. For example, sugar is much more soluble in water than is salt. But
even sugar has an upper limit on how much can dissolve. In a half liter of 20 °C water, the maximum amount is 1000
grams. If you add more sugar than this, the extra sugar won’t dissolve. You can compare the solubility of sugar, salt,
and some other solutes in the Table 3.11. For a video about solubility, go to this URL: http://www.youtube.com/w

Q: How much salt do you think Rhonda added to the half-liter of water in her experiment?
A: The solubility of salt is 180 grams per half liter of water at 20 °C. If Rhonda had added less than 180 grams of
salt to the half-liter of water, then all of it would have dissolved. Because some of the salt did not dissolve, she must
have added more than 180 grams of salt to the water.

Factors That Affect Solubility

Certain factors can change the solubility of a solute. Temperature is one such factor. How temperature affects
solubility depends on the state of the solute, as you can see in the Figure 3.95. You can learn more about temperature
and other factors that affect solubility at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKimraU21ws .

FIGURE 3.95

• If a solute is a solid or liquid, increasing the temperature increases its solubility. For example, more sugar can

dissolve in hot water than in cold water.

• If a solute is a gas, increasing the temperature decreases its solubility. For example, less carbon dioxide can

dissolve in warm water than in cold water.

The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the force pushing against a given area. Increasing the
pressure on a gas increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it ﬁzzes out of the can?
Soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide. Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas in solution, so it is less
soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air.
Q: Which do you think will ﬁzz more when you open it, a can of warm soda or a can of cold soda?

498

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

A: A can of warm soda will ﬁzz more because increasing the temperature decreases the solubility of a gas. Therefore,
less carbon dioxide can remain dissolved in warm soda than in cold soda.

Summary

• Solubility is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature. Some

solutes have greater solubility than others.

• Temperature affects the solubility of solutes in all three states. Pressure also affects the solubility of gases.

3.50. Saturation

3.50 Saturation

• Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated solutions.
• Decide whether a given solution is saturated or unsaturated.

You could add all the sugar in this scoop to the water in the measuring container, and all the sugar would dissolve,
forming a sugar-water solution. A solution is a mixture of two or more substances in which the substances are mixed
evenly throughout. The substance that dissolves in a solution is the solute. In this case the solute is sugar. The
substance that does the dissolving—in this case, the water—is the solvent. Sugar is one of the most soluble solutes
in water. This means that more of it can dissolve in water than is true of many other solutes. However, there is a
limit on how much of any solute—even sugar—will dissolve in water or other given solvent.

Saturated vs. Unsaturated Solutions

The maximum amount of sugar that will dissolve in a liter of 20 °C water is 2000 grams. A sugar-water solution
that contains 1 liter of water and 2000 grams of sugar is said to be saturated. A saturated solution is a solution that
contains as much solute as can dissolve in a given solvent at a given temperature. If you add more than 2000 grams
of sugar to a liter of 20 °C water, the extra sugar won’t dissolve. On the other hand, a solution containing less than
2000 g of sugar in 1 liter of 20 °C water can hold more sugar. A solution that contains less solute than can dissolve at
a given temperature is called an unsaturated solution. You can learn more about saturated and unsaturated solutions
by watching the video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKimraU21ws .

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Saturation Depends on the Solute

The Figure 3.96 shows the amounts of several different solutes that will dissolve in a liter of water at 20 °C. As you
can see from the graph, solutes vary greatly in how soluble they are in water. For example, you can dissolve almost
20 times as much sugar as baking soda in the same amount of water at this temperature.

FIGURE 3.96

Q: Assume that a solution contains 150 grams of Epsom salt in 1 liter of water at 20 °C. Is the solution saturated or
unsaturated?
A: A saturated solution of Epsom salt in 1 liter of 20 °C water would contain 250 grams of Epsom salt. Therefore,
this solution is unsaturated. It can hold another 100 grams of Epsom salt.
Q: What do you think would happen if you added more than 250 grams of Epsom salt to a liter of 20 °C water?
A: Any Epsom salt over 250 grams would not dissolve in the solution.

Summary

• A saturated solution is a solution that contains as much solute as can dissolve in a given solvent at a given
temperature. An unsaturated solution is a solution that contains less solute than can dissolve in a given solvent
at a given temperature.

• Solutes differ in their solubility in a given solvent. Therefore, a saturated solution of one solute might contain

more or less solute than a saturated solution of a different solute.

• Deﬁne the concentration of a solution.
• Contrast concentrated and dilute solutions.
• Show how to calculate the concentration of a solution.

Dante was shopping for juice and saw a bottle of juice concentrate. He read the label and learned that some of the
water had been removed from the juice before it was bottled, so the concentrate had to be mixed with water before
drinking. Next to the bottle of juice was a can of juice. The canned juice was ready to drink. Juice concentrate is an
example of a concentrated solution. Ready-to-drink juice is an example of a dilute solution.

Concentrated and Dilute Solutions

A solution is a mixture of two or more substances in which dissolved particles are distributed evenly throughout the
solution. The substance that dissolves in a solution is called the solute, and the substance that does the dissolving is
called the solvent. The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute in a given amount of solution. A solution
with a lot of dissolved solute has a high concentration and is called a concentrated solution. A solution with little
dissolved solute has a low concentration and is called a dilute solution.

Calculating the Concentration of a Solution

The concentration of a solution represents the percentage of the solution that is the solute. You can calculate the
concentration of a solution using this formula:

Concentration = Mass (or volume) of Solute

Mass (or volume) of Solution × 100%

For example, if a 100-gram solution of salt water contains 3 grams of salt, then its concentration is:

Concentration = 3g

100g × 100% = 3%

more concentrated, brand A or brand B?
A: Concentration(A) = 250 mL
Concentration(B) = 200 mL
You can conclude that brand B is more concentrated.

• The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute in a given amount of solution. A concentrated solution

has more solute in a given amount of solvent than a dilute solution.
• The concentration of a solution can be calculated with this formula:

Concentration = Mass (or volume) of Solute

• Identify properties of acids.
• Describe how to detect and measure the strength of acids.
• List some uses of acids.

Look at the boy in the photo above. You can tell by the expression on his face that lemon juice tastes sour. Lemon
juice is an acid, and all acids taste sour. They share certain other properties as well. You will learn more about acids
and their properties in this article. For a musical introduction to acids and related concepts, watch the video at this
URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTLiJE-j1-I

What Are Acids?

Acids are ionic compounds that produce positive hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water. Ionic compounds
are compounds that contain positive metal ions and negative nonmetal ions held together by ionic bonds. (Ions
are atoms that have become charged particles by gaining or losing electrons.) An example of an acid is hydrogen
chloride (HCl). When it dissolves in water, it separates into positive hydrogen ions and negative chloride ions (Cl−).
This is represented by the chemical equation:

HCl H2O→ H+ + Cl−

505

3.52. Properties of Acids

Properties of Acids

www.ck12.org

You already know that a sour taste is one property of acids. (Warning: Never taste an unknown substance to see
whether it is an acid!) Acids have certain other properties as well. For example, acids can conduct electricity
when dissolved in water because they consist of charged particles in solution. (Electric current is a ﬂow of charged
particles.) Acids can also react with metals, and when they do they produce hydrogen gas. An example of this type
of reaction is hydrochloric acid reacting with the metal zinc (Zn). The reaction is pictured in the Figure 3.97. It can
be represented by the chemical equation:

Zn + 2HCl → H2 + ZnCl2

FIGURE 3.97
Hydrochloric acid reacting with the metal
zinc.

Q: What sign indicates that a gas is being produced in this reaction?
A: The bubbles are hydrogen gas rising through the acid.
Q: Besides hydrogen gas, what else is produced in this reaction?
A: This reaction also produces zinc chloride ZnCl2, which is a neutral ionic compound called a salt.

Detecting Acids

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Certain compounds, called indicators, change color when acids come into contact with them, so indicators can be
used to detect acids. An example of an indicator is the compound called litmus. It is placed on small strips of paper
that may be red or blue. If you place a few drops of acid on a strip of blue litmus paper, the paper will turn red. You
can see this in the Figure 3.98. Litmus isn’t the only indicator for detecting acids. Red cabbage juice also works
well, as you can see in this entertaining video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOUdoS2BtQ .

Strength of Acids

The strength of acids is measured on a scale called the pH scale. The pH value of a solution represents its
concentration of hydrogen ions. A pH value of 7 indicates a neutral solution, and a pH value less than 7 indicates
an acidic solution. The lower the pH value is, the greater is the concentration of hydrogen ions and the stronger the
acid. The strongest acids, such as battery acid, have pH values close to zero.

Uses of Acids

Acids have many important uses, especially in industry. For example, sulfuric acid is used to manufacture a variety
of different products, including paper, paint, and detergent. Some other uses of acids are be seen in the Figure 3.99.

Summary

• Acids are ionic compounds that produce positive hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water.
• Acids taste sour, conduct electricity when dissolved in water, and react with metals to produce hydrogen gas.
• Certain indicator compounds, such as litmus, can be used to detect acids. Acids turn blue litmus paper red.
• The strength of acids is measured on the pH scale. A pH value less than 7 indicates an acid, and the lower the

number is, the stronger the acid.

• List some uses of bases.

These blocks of baking chocolate may make your mouth water, but if you were to taste them, you would be in for
an unpleasant surprise. The blocks are unsweetened chocolate. Without any added sugar, chocolate tastes bitter.
Chocolate tastes bitter because it’s a base.

What Are Bases?
Bases are ionic compounds that produce negative hydroxide ions (OH−) when dissolved in water. An ionic com-
pound contains positive metal ions and negative nonmetal ions held together by ionic bonds. (Ions are atoms that
have become charged particles because they have either lost or gained electrons.) An example of a base is sodium
hydroxide (NaOH). When it dissolves in water, it produces negative hydroxide ions and positive sodium ions (Na+).
This can be represented by the equation:

NaOH H2O→ OH− + Na+

Properties of Bases

All bases share certain properties, including a bitter taste. (Warning: Never taste an unknown substance to see
whether it is a base!) Bases also feel slippery. Think about how slippery soap feels. That’s because it’s a base.
In addition, bases conduct electricity when dissolved in water because they consist of charged particles in solution.
(Electric current is a ﬂow of charged particles.)

Q: Bases are closely related to compounds called acids. How are their properties similar? How are they different?
A: A property that is shared by bases and acids is the ability to conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Some
ways bases and acids are different is that acids taste sour whereas bases taste bitter. Also, acids but not bases react
with metals. For other differences between bases and acids, as well as why they differ in these ways, read the short
article at this URL: http://www.chem4kids.com/ﬁles/react_acidbase.html

Detecting Bases

Certain compounds, called indicators, change color when bases come into contact with them, so they can be used to
detect bases. An example of an indicator is a compound called litmus. It is placed on small strips of paper that may
be red or blue. If you place a few drops of a base on a strip of red litmus paper, the paper will turn blue. You can
see this in the Figure 3.100. Litmus isn’t the only detector of bases. Red cabbage juice can also detect bases, as you

Strength of Bases

The strength of bases is measured on a scale called the pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14. On this scale, a pH
value of 7 indicates a neutral solution, and a pH value greater than 7 indicates a basic solution. The higher the pH
value is, the stronger the base. The strongest bases, such as drain cleaner, have a pH value close to 14.

Uses of Bases

Bases are used for a variety of purposes. For example, soaps contain bases such as potassium hydroxide (KOH).
Other uses of bases can be seen in the Figure 3.101.

3.54 pH Concept

• Explain why some acids and bases are stronger than others.
• Deﬁne pH.
• Show how to use the pH scale.
• Explain why pH is important to living things.

This scientist is collecting and testing samples of water from the river. One of the properties of the water she is
testing is acidity. She wants to know how acidic the water is because water that is too acidic can harm the health of
water organisms.

Strength of Acids and Bases

Acids are ionic compounds that produce positively charged hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water. Acids taste
sour and react with metals. Bases are ionic compounds that produce negatively charged hydroxide ions (OH−) when
dissolved in water. Bases taste bitter and do not react with metals. Examples of acids are vinegar and battery acid.
The acid in vinegar is weak enough to safely eat on a salad. The acid in a car battery is strong enough to eat through
skin. Examples of bases include those in antacid tablets and drain cleaner. Bases in antacid tablets are weak enough
to take for an upset stomach. Bases in drain cleaner are strong enough to cause serious burns.
Q: What do you think causes these differences in the strength of acids and bases?
A: The strength of an acid or a base depends on how much of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water.

Concentration of Ions

The strength of an acid depends on how many hydrogen ions it produces when it dissolves in water. A stronger
acid produces more hydrogen ions than a weaker acid. For example, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which is found in car

513

3.54. pH Concept

batteries, is a strong acid because nearly all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. On the other hand,
acetic acid (CH3CO2H), which is the acid in vinegar, is a weak acid because less than 1 percent of it breaks down
into ions in water.
The strength of a base depends on how many hydroxide ions it produces when it dissolves in water. A stronger base
produces more hydroxide ions than a weaker base. For example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a base in drain cleaner,
is a strong base because all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a
base in antacids, is a weak base because only a small percentage of it breaks down into ions in water.

The pH Scale

The strength of acids and bases is measured on a scale called the pH scale, which is shown in the Figure 3.102.
By deﬁnition, pH represents the acidity, or hydrogen ion (H+) concentration, of a solution. Pure water, which is
neutral, has a pH of 7. With a higher the concentration of hydrogen ions, a solution is more acidic and has a lower
pH. Acids have a pH less than 7, and the strongest acids have a pH close to zero. Bases have a pH greater than 7,
and the strongest bases have a pH close to 14. It’s important to realize that the pH scale is based on powers of ten.
For example, a solution with a pH of 8 is 10 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7, and a solution with a
pH of 9 is 100 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7.
Q: How much more acidic is a solution with a pH of 4 than a solution with a pH of 7?
A: A solution with a pH of 4 is 1000 (10 × 10 × 10, or 103) times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 7.

FIGURE 3.102

Q: Which solution on the pH scale in the Figure 3.102 is the weakest acid? Which solution is the strongest base?
A: The weakest acid on the scale is milk, which has a pH value between 6.5 and 6.8. The strongest base on the scale
is liquid drain cleaner, which has a pH of 14.

Why pH Matters

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Acidity is an important factor for living things. For example, many plants grow best in soil that has a pH between 6
and 7. Fish may also need a pH between 6 and 7. Certain air pollutants form acids when dissolved in water droplets
in the air. This results in acid fog and acid rain, which may have a pH of 4 or even lower. The pH chart in the Figure
3.102 and the Figure 3.103 reveal some of the adverse effects of acid fog and rain. Acid rain not only kills trees. It
also lowers the pH of surface waters such as ponds and lakes. As a result, the water may become too acidic for ﬁsh
and other water organisms to survive.

FIGURE 3.103
Acid fog and acid rain killed the trees in
this forest.

Even normal (clean) rain is somewhat acidic. That’s because carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air dissolves in raindrops,
producing a weak acid called carbonic acid (H2CO3), which has a pH of about 5.5. When rainwater soaks into
the ground, it can slowly dissolve rocks, particularly those containing calcium carbonate. This is how water forms
underground caves.
Q: How do you think acid rain might affect buildings and statues made of stone?
A: Acid rain dissolves and damages stone buildings and statues. The Figure 3.104 shows a statue that has been
damaged by acid rain.

Summary

• The strength of an acid or base is called acidity. It depends on how much of the substance breaks down into

ions when it dissolves in water.

• Acidity is measured by pH, which is the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
• Acidity is an important factor for living things because most can survive only within a relatively narrow range

of acidity.

3.55 Acid-Base Neutralization

• Identify the ions produced when acids and bases dissolve in water.
• Describe neutralization reactions and the formation of salts.

What is one of the most important characteristics of a referee? A referee must be neutral. He can’t favor one team
over the other. In chemistry, being neutral means not being an acid or a base. Pure water is an example of a neutral
substance. In some chemical reactions, an acid and a base combine to form neutral products, including water. You’ll
see how this happens when you read this article.

Acids, Bases, and Ions

An acid is a compound that produces positive hydrogen ions (H+) and negative nonmetal ions when it dissolves in
water. (Ions are atoms that have become charged by losing or gaining electrons.) Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is an
example of an acid. When it dissolves in water, it produces positive hydrogen ions and negative chloride ions (Cl−).
This can be represented by the chemical equation:

HCl H2O→ H+ + Cl−

A base is a compound that produces negative hydroxide ions (OH−) and positive metal ions when it dissolves in
water. For example, when the base sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolves in water, it produces negative hydroxide
ions and positive sodium ions (Na+). This can be represented by the chemical equation:

NaOH H2O→ OH− + Na+

Q: If you were to combine acid and base solutions, what products do you think would be produced?
A: Combining acid and base solutions produces water and a neutral ionic compound.

517

3.55. Acid-Base Neutralization

Reactions of Acids and Bases

www.ck12.org

When an acid and a base react, the reaction is called a neutralization reaction. That’s because the reaction produces
neutral products. Water is always one product, and a salt is also produced. A salt is a neutral ionic compound. You
can learn more about salts and how they form at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjIVJh4JLNo .
Let’s see how a neutralization reaction produces both water and a salt, using as an example the reaction between
solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. The overall equation for this reaction is:

NaOH + HCl → H2O and NaCl

Now let’s break this reaction down into two parts to see how each product forms.

• Positive hydrogen ions from HCl and negative hydroxide ions from NaOH combine to form water. This part

of the reaction can be represented by the equation:

H+ + OH− → H2O

• Positive sodium ions from NaOH and negative chloride ions from HCL combine to form the salt sodium

chloride (NaCl), commonly called table salt. This part of the reaction can be represented by the equation:

Na+ + Cl− → NaCl

Another example of a neutralization reaction can be seen in the Figure 3.105.

FIGURE 3.105
These antacid tablets contain the base
calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The base
reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the
stomach. The reaction neutralizes the
acid to relieve acid indigestion.

Q: What products are produced when antacid tablets react with hydrochloric acid in the stomach?
A: The products are water and the salt calcium chloride (CaCl2). Carbon dioxide (CO2) is also produced. The
reaction is represented by the chemical equation:

CaCO3 + 2HCl → H2O + CaCl2 + CO2

Summary

• When acid and base solutions react, they produce water and a neutral ionic compound called a salt. The

reaction is called a neutralization reaction.

3.56 Radioactivity

• Deﬁne radioactivity and radiation.
• Give examples of radioactive elements.
• Outline the discovery of radioactivity.

The man in this old illustration was an alchemist. Alchemists, who lived during the Middle Ages, were people who
strived to turn lead into gold. They tried all sorts of chemical reactions involving lead, but they were never able
to produce gold. Today, scientists know that one element cannot be changed into another by chemical processes.
However, there is a way that some elements can change into others. You’ll ﬁnd out what it is when you read this
article.

Elements and Protons

For an atom of one element to change into a different element, the number of protons in its nucleus must change.
That’s because each element has a unique number of protons. For example, lead atoms always have 82 protons, and
gold atoms always have 79 protons.
Q: So how can one element change into another?
A: The starting element must be radioactive, and its nuclei must gain or lose protons.

Radioactive Elements

Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from its nucleus. The
charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation. Only unstable nuclei emit radiation. They
are unstable because they have too much energy, too many protons, or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. For

520

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

example, all elements with more than 83 protons—such as uranium, radium, and polonium—have unstable nuclei.
They are called radioactive elements. The nuclei of these elements must lose protons to become more stable. When
they do, they become different elements.

How Radioactivity Was Discovered

Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by a French physicist named Antoine Henri Becquerel, who is pictured 3.106.
Becquerel was experimenting with uranium, which was known to glow after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel
wanted to see if the glow was caused by rays of energy, like rays of light or X-rays. He placed a bit of uranium on
a photographic plate after exposing the uranium to sunlight. The plate was similar to the ﬁlm that is used today to
take X-rays, and Becquerel expected the uranium to leave an image on the plate. The next day, there was an image
on the plate, just as Becquerel expected. This meant that uranium gives off rays after being exposed to sunlight.

FIGURE 3.106

Becquerel was a good scientist, so he wanted to repeat his experiment to conﬁrm his results. He placed more uranium
on another photographic plate. However, the day had turned cloudy, so he tucked the plate and uranium in a drawer
to try again another day. He wasn’t expecting the uranium to leave an image on the plate without ﬁrst being exposed
to sunlight. To his surprise, there was an image on the plate in the drawer the next day. Becquerel had discovered
that uranium gives off rays of energy on its own. He had discovered radioactivity, for which he received a Nobel
prize. To learn more about the importance of Becquerel’s research, go to this URL: http://nobelprize.org/nobel_priz
es/physics/laureates/1903/becquerel-bio.html
Another scientist, who worked with Becquerel, actually came up with the term radioactivity. The other scientist was

521

the French chemist Marie Curie. She went on to discover the radioactive elements polonium and radium. She won

Summary

• Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit charged particles and energy from its nucleus. The charged

particles and energy are called by the general term radiation.

• Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by Antoine Henri Becquerel when he found that uranium leaves an
image like an X-ray on a photographic plate. Besides uranium, radioactive elements include radium and
polonium, both of which were discovered by Marie Curie.

3.57 Radioisotopes

• Describe radioisotopes, and give an example of a radioisotope.
• Explain why radioisotopes have unstable nuclei.
• Identify radioactive elements.

This fossil skull came from an ancient human ancestor. Scientists used carbon-14 dating to estimate its age. Carbon-
14 is one of several radioisotopes that scientists use to estimate the ages of fossils and other ancient materials.

What Are Radioisotopes?

All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus, but they may have different
numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Many
elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive. These isotopes are called radioisotopes. Their nuclei are
unstable, so they break down, or decay, and emit radiation.
Q: What makes the nucleus of a radioisotope unstable?
A: The nucleus may be unstable because it has too many protons or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. For a
nucleus with a small number of protons to be stable, the ratio of protons to neutrons should be 1:1. For a nucleus
with a large number of protons to be stable, the ratio should be about 1:1.5.

An Example: Carbon-14

Find carbon in the Figure 3.107, and you’ll see that its atomic number is 6. This means that all carbon atoms have
6 protons per nucleus. Almost all carbon atoms also have 6 neutrons per nucleus. These carbon atoms are called

523

3.57. Radioisotopes

www.ck12.org

carbon-12, where 12 is the number of protons (6) plus neutrons (6). This gives carbon-12 nuclei a 1:1 ratio of protons
to neutrons, so carbon-12 nuclei are stable.
Some carbon atoms have more than 6 neutrons, either 7 or 8. Carbon atoms with 8 neutrons are called carbon-14 (6
protons + 8 neutrons). The nuclei of carbon-14 atoms are unstable because they have too many neutrons relative to
protons, so they gradually decay.
Q: What is the proton-to-neutron ratio of carbon-14 nuclei?
A: With six protons and 8 neutrons, the ratio is 6:8, or 1:1.3.
Q: How is carbon-14 used to estimate the ages of fossils? A: Living things take in carbon, including tiny amounts of
carbon-14, throughout life. The carbon-14 constantly decays, but more carbon-14 is taken in all the time to replace
it. After living things die, no new carbon-14 is taken in, and the carbon-14 they already have keeps decaying. The
older a fossil is, the less carbon-14 it still has, so the remaining amount can be measured to estimate the fossil’s age.

3.58 Dangers and Uses of Radiation

• Identify sources of environmental radiation.
• Describe the dangers of radiation.
• List uses of radiation.

You may have seen this sign before—maybe in a hospital. The sign means there is danger of radiation in the area.
Radiation consists of particles and energy that are given off by radioactive isotopes, which have unstable nuclei.
But you don’t have to go to a hospital to be exposed to radiation. There is radiation in the world all around you.

Radiation in the Environment

A low level of radiation occurs naturally in the environment. This is called background radiation. One source of
background radiation is rocks, which may contain small amounts of radioactive elements such as uranium. Another
source is cosmic rays. These are charged particles that arrive on Earth from outer space. Background radiation is
generally considered to be safe for living things. You can learn more about background radiation with the animation
at this URL: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/dirtybomb/sources.html

Dangers of Radiation

Long-term or high-dose exposure to radiation can harm both living and nonliving things. Radiation knocks electrons
out of atoms and changes them to ions. It also breaks bonds in DNA and other compounds in living things. One
source of radiation that is especially dangerous to people is radon. Radon is a radioactive gas that forms in rocks
underground. It can seep into basements and get trapped inside buildings. Then it may build up and become harmful
to people who breathe it. Long-term exposure to radon can cause lung cancer.
Exposure to higher levels of radiation can be very dangerous, even if the exposure is short-term. A single large
dose of radiation can burn the skin and cause radiation sickness. Symptoms of this illness include extreme fatigue,

526

www.ck12.org

destruction of blood cells, and loss of hair. To learn more about the harmful health effects of radiation, go to this

Nonliving things can also be damaged by radiation. For example, high levels of radiation can weaken metals by
removing electrons. This is a problem in nuclear power plants and space vehicles because they are exposed to very
high levels of radiation.
Q: Can you tell when you are being exposed to radiation? For example, can you sense radon in the air?
A: Radiation can’t be detected with the senses. This adds to its danger. However, there are other ways to detect it.

Detecting Radiation

You generally can’t see, smell, taste, hear, or feel radiation. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters
that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure 3.108, contains atoms of a gas that is
ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current.
The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can
see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below.
http://vimeo.com/10379389

FIGURE 3.108

Using Radiation

Despite its dangers, radioactivity has several uses. For example, it can be used to determine the ages of ancient
rocks and fossils. It can also be used as a source of power to generate electricity. Radioactivity can even be used
to diagnose and treat diseases, including cancer. Cancer cells grow rapidly and take up a lot of glucose for energy.

527

3.58. Dangers and Uses of Radiation

Glucose containing radioactive elements can be given to patients. Cancer cells take up more of the glucose than
normal cells do and give off radiation. The radiation can be detected with special machines like the one in the
Figure 3.109. The radiation may also kill cancer cells. You can learn more about medical uses of radiation at this

Summary

• A low level of radiation occurs naturally in the environment. This background radiation is generally assumed

to be safe for living things.

• Long-term or high-dose exposure to radiation can harm living things and damage nonliving materials such as

metals.

• One reason radiation is dangerous is that it generally can’t be detected with the senses. It can be detected only

with devices such as Geiger counters.

• Radiation has several important uses, including diagnosing and treating cancer.

3.59 Radioactive Decay

• Deﬁne radioactive decay.
• Describe three types of radioactive decay.
• Explain how radioactive decay changes one element to another.
• Outline the dangers of radioactive decay.

This diagram could almost illustrate a pinball game. It actually illustrates the process of radioactive decay. This is a
process that occurs all around you. It may even occur inside your body.
Q: Based on the diagram, what happens during radioactive decay?
A: The nucleus of a radioactive atom gives off radiation in the form of energy and a particle of matter.

Introducing Radioactive Decay

Radioactive decay is the process in which the nuclei of radioactive atoms emit charged particles and energy, which
are called by the general term radiation. Radioactive atoms have unstable nuclei, and when the nuclei emit radiation,
they become more stable. Radioactive decay is a nuclear—rather than chemical—reaction because it involves only
the nuclei of atoms. In a nuclear reaction, one element may change into another. For a fun introduction to radioactive
decay, watch the short video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-9yt7OAYmE

Types of Radioactive Decay

There are several types of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay. In all three types, nuclei emit
radiation, but the nature of the radiation differs. The Table 3.13 shows the radiation emitted in each type of decay.
You can watch a video about the three types at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3koOwozY4oc .

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Radiation Emitted

Both alpha and beta decay change the number of protons in an atom’s nucleus, thereby changing the atom to a
different element. In alpha decay, the nucleus loses two protons. In beta decay, the nucleus either loses a proton
or gains a proton. In gamma decay, no change in proton number occurs, so the atom does not become a different
element.
Q: If the radioactive element polonium (Po) undergoes alpha decay, what element does it become?
A: From the periodic table, the atomic number of polonium is 84, so it has 84 protons. If it loses two protons through
alpha decay, it will have 82 protons. Atoms with 82 protons are the element lead (Pb).

Dangers of Radioactive Decay

The charged particles and energy emitted during radioactive decay can harm living things, but the three types of
radioactive decay aren’t equally dangerous. That’s because they differ in how far they can travel and what they can
penetrate. You can see this in the Figure 3.110 and in the animation at the following URL: http://teachnuclear.ca/c
ontents/cna_radiation/gamma_rays/

FIGURE 3.110
Alpha particles can travel only a few centimeters through air. They can
burn the skin but not penetrate it. Beta particles can travel up to a meter
through air. They can penetrate and damage skin. Gamma rays can travel
thousands of meters through air. They can penetrate and damage cells

• Radioactive decay is the process in which unstable nuclei of radioactive atoms become stable by emitting

charged particles and energy.

• There are three types of radioactive decay: alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay. Alpha and beta decay

change one element into another. Gamma decay does not.

• Radioactive decay can damage living things. Alpha decay is the least damaging, and gamma decay is the most

damaging.

3.60 Alpha Decay

• Explain how and why alpha decay occurs.
• Show how to write a balanced nuclear equation for alpha decay.
• Describe the dangers of alpha decay.

You probably associate the term decay with images like the one above. But when it comes to atoms, decay has a
different meaning. Decay in chemistry refers to changes in the nuclei of certain atoms.

Why Some Nuclei Decay

Radioactive elements and isotopes have unstable nuclei. To become more stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive
decay. In radioactive decay, the nuclei give off, or emit, radiation in the form of energy and often particles as well.
There are several types of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay. Energy is emitted in all three
types of decay, but only alpha and beta decay also emit particles.

What Is Alpha Decay?

Alpha decay occurs when a nucleus is unstable because it has too many protons. The Figure 3.111 shows what
happens during alpha decay. The nucleus emits an alpha particle and energy. An alpha particle consists of two
protons and two neutrons, which is actually a helium nucleus. Losing the protons and neutrons makes the nucleus
more stable.

Equations for Alpha Decay

Radioactive nuclei and particles are represented by nuclear symbols that indicate their numbers of protons and
neutrons. For example, an alpha particle (helium nucleus) is represented by the symbol 4
2He, where He is the

533

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 3.111

chemical symbol for helium, the subscript 2 is the number of protons, and the superscript 4 is the mass number (2
protons + 2 neutrons).
Nuclear symbols are used to write nuclear equations for radioactive decay. Let’s consider an example. Uranium-238
undergoes alpha decay to become thorium-234. (The numbers following the chemical names refer to the number
of protons plus neutrons.) In this reaction, uranium-238 loses two protons and two neutrons to become the element
thorium-234. The reaction can be represented by this nuclear equation:

238

92 U → 234

90 Th + 4

2He + Energy

If you count the number of protons (subscripts) as well as the number of protons plus neutrons (superscripts), you’ll
see that the total numbers are the same on both sides of the arrow. This means that the equation is balanced. The
thorium-234 produced in this reaction is also unstable, so it will undergo radioactive decay as well. The alpha
particle (4
2He) produced in the reaction can join with two free electrons to form the element helium. This is how
most of Earth’s helium formed.
Q: Fill in the missing subscript and superscript to balance the following nuclear equation for alpha decay of
Polonium-210.
84 Po → ?

2He + Energy

?Pb + 4

210

A: The subscript of Pb is 82, and the superscript is 206. This means that the new element produced in the reaction
has 82 protons. You can ﬁnd the element with this number of protons in the periodic table. It is the element lead
(Pb). The new element also has 124 neutrons (206 –82 protons = 124 neutrons).

How Dangerous Is Alpha Decay?

All types of radioactive decay pose risks to living things, but alpha decay is the least dangerous. That’s because
alpha particles are relatively heavy, so they can travel only a few centimeters through the air. They also are not very
penetrating. For example, they can’t pass through a sheet of paper or thin layer of clothing. They may burn the skin,
but they can’t penetrate to the tissues underneath the skin. However, if alpha particles are emitted inside the body,
they can do more damage. One way this can happen is by inhaling cigarette smoke. People who smoke actually
inhale the radioactive element polonium-210. It undergoes alpha decay in the lungs. Over time, exposure to alpha
particles may cause lung cancer.

Summary

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

• Alpha decay is one of three types of nuclear decay in which unstable nuclei emit energy with or without a

particle of matter.

• In alpha decay, energy and an alpha particle are emitted by a nucleus that is unstable because it has too many

protons. An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, so it is actually a helium nucleus.

• Alpha decay is represented by a nuclear equation. The equation is balanced if the total numbers of protons

and neutrons are the same on both sides of the arrow.

• All radioactive decay is dangerous to living things, but alpha decay is the least dangerous.

3.61 Beta Decay

• Explain how and why beta decay occurs.
• Contrast beta-minus and beta-plus decay.
• Show how to write a balanced nuclear equation for beta decay.
• Describe dangers of beta decay.

If you hear the word decay while your dentist is checking your teeth, it’s probably bad news. But if you’re an
unstable atomic nucleus, decay is good news. When the nucleus of an atom decays, it becomes more stable.

Which Nuclei Decay

Atoms with unstable nuclei are radioactive. To become more stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive decay.
In
radioactive decay, the nuclei emit energy and usually particles of matter as well. There are several types of
radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay. Energy is emitted in all three types of decay, but only
alpha and beta decay also emit particles.

What Is Beta Decay?

Beta decay occurs when an unstable nucleus emits a beta particle and energy. A beta particle is either an electron
or a positron. An electron is a negatively charged particle, and a positron is a positively charged electron (or anti-
electron). When the beta particle is an electron, the decay is called beta-minus decay. When the beta particle is
a positron, the decay is called beta-plus decay. Beta-minus decay occurs when a nucleus has too many neutrons
relative to protons, and beta-plus decay occurs when a nucleus has too few neutrons relative to protons.
Q: Nuclei contain only protons and neutrons, so how can a nucleus emit an electron in beta-minus decay or a positron
in beta-plus decay?

536

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

FIGURE 3.112

A: Beta decay begins with a proton or neutron. You can see how in the Figure 3.112.
Q: How does beta decay change an atom to a different element?
A: In beta-minus decay an atom gains a proton, and it beta-plus decay it loses a proton. In each case, the atom
becomes a different element because it has a different number of protons.

Equations for Beta Decay

Radioactive nuclei and particles are represented by nuclear symbols.. For example, a beta-minus particle (electron) is
represented by the symbol 0−1e. The subscript -1 represents the particle’s charge, and the superscript 0 shows that the
particle has virtually no mass (no protons or neutrons). Another example is the radioactive nucleus of thorium-234.
It is represented by the symbol 234
90 Th, where the subscript 90 stands for the number of protons and the superscript
234 for the number of protons plus neutrons.
Nuclear symbols are used to write nuclear equations for radioactive decay. Let’s consider the example of the beta-
minus decay of thorium-234 to protactinium-234. This reaction is represented by the equation:

234

90 Th → 234

91 Pa + 0−1e + energy

The equation shows that thorium-234 becomes protactinium-234 and loses a beta particle and energy. The protactinium-
234 produced in the reaction is also radioactive, so it will decay as well.
A nuclear equation is balanced if the total numbers of protons and neutrons are the same on both sides of the arrow.
If you compare the subscripts and superscripts on both sides of the equation above, you’ll see that they are the same.
Q: What happens to the electron produced in the reaction above?
A: Along with another electron, it can combine with an alpha particle to form a helium atom. An alpha particle,
which is emitted during alpha decay, consists of two protons and two neutrons.

Dangers of Beta Decay

www.ck12.org

Beta particles can travel about a meter through air. They can pass through a sheet of paper or a layer of cloth but not
through a sheet of aluminum or a few centimeters of wood. They can also penetrate the skin and damage underlying
tissues. They are even more harmful if they are ingested or inhaled.

Summary

• Beta decay occurs when a nucleus is unstable because it has too many or too few neutrons relative to protons.
The nucleus emits a beta particle and energy. A beta particle is either an electron (beta-minus decay) or a
positron (beta-plus decay).

• In beta-minus decay, a neutron breaks down to a proton and an electron, and the electron is emitted from the
nucleus. In beta-plus decay, a proton breaks down to a neutron and a positron, and the positron is emitted from
the nucleus.

• Balanced nuclear equations show how the numbers of protons and neutrons change in beta decay.
• Beta radiation is harmful to living things.

3.62 Gamma Decay

• Describe gamma rays.
• State how and why gamma decay occurs.
• Explain why gamma rays are the most harmful type of radiation.

This stunning image is an artist’s rendition of a gamma ray burst. A gamma ray burst is a sudden, intense ﬂash of
gamma rays given off by an extremely energetic explosion. The bursts have been observed in distant galaxies. But
gamma rays also occur on Earth.

What Are Gamma Rays?

Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are waves of electric and magnetic energy that
travel through space at the speed of light. The energy travels in tiny “packets” of energy, called photons. Photons of
gamma energy are called gamma particles. Other electromagnetic waves include microwaves, light rays, and X rays.
Gamma rays have the greatest amount of energy of all electromagnetic waves. You can learn more about gamma
radiation at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyynBaSOtA

3.62. Gamma Decay

www.ck12.org

Gamma Rays and Radioactive Decay

Gamma rays are produced when radioactive elements decay. Radioactive elements are elements with unstable nuclei.
To become more stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive decay. In this process, the nuclei give off energy and may
also emit charged particles of matter. Types of radioactive decay include alpha, beta, and gamma decay. In alpha
and beta decay, both particles and energy are emitted. In gamma decay, only energy, in the form of gamma rays, is
emitted.
Alpha and beta decay occur when a nucleus has too many protons or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. When
the nucleus emits a particle, it gains or loses one or two protons, so the atom becomes a different element. Gamma
decay, in contrast, occurs when a nucleus is in an excited state and has too much energy to be stable. This often
happens after alpha or beta decay has occurred. Because only energy is emitted during gamma decay, the number of
protons remains the same. Therefore, an atom does not become a different element during this type of decay.
Q: The Figure 3.113 shows how helium-3 (He-3) decays by emitting a gamma particle. How can you tell that the
atom is still the same element after gamma decay occurs?
A: The nucleus of the atom has two protons (red) before the reaction occurs. After the nucleus emits the gamma
particle, it still has two protons, so the atom is still the same element.

FIGURE 3.113

Dangers of Gamma Radiation

Gamma rays are the most dangerous type of radiation. They can travel farther and penetrate materials more deeply
than can the charged particles emitted during alpha and beta decay. Gamma rays can be stopped only by several
centimeters of lead or several meters of concrete. It’s no surprise that they can penetrate and damage cells deep
inside the body. You can learn more about the effects of gamma radiation on people at this URL: http://library.think
quest.org/3471/radiation_effects_body.html .

Summary

• Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves that carry photons of energy called gamma particles. They are the

most energetic of all electromagnetic waves.

• Gamma rays are produced during gamma decay of an excited nucleus. During gamma decay, the nucleus

emits a “packet” of energy called a gamma particle.

• Gamma rays are more dangerous than the particles of matter emitted during alpha or beta decay.

3.63 Radioactive Half-life

• Deﬁne the half-life of a radioisotope.
• Explain variation in half-lives.

Assume that you cut a sheet of paper down the center to get two halves. Then you cut each half down the center to
get four pieces. If you keep cutting the pieces of paper in half, you would soon a reach a point where the pieces are
too small to cut again. A radioactive isotope is a little like that sheet of paper.

What Is a Radioactive Isotope?

A radioactive isotope, or radioisotope, has atoms with unstable nuclei. The unstable nuclei naturally decay, or break
down, by losing energy and particles of matter to become more stable. If they gain or lose protons as they decay,
they become different elements. Over time, as the nuclei continue to decay, less and less of the original radioisotope
remains.

Rate of Radioactive Decay

A radioisotope decays and changes to a different element at a constant rate. The rate is measured in a unit called
the half-life. This is the length of time it takes for half of a given amount of the radioisotope to decay. This rate is
always the same for a given radioisotope, regardless of temperature, pressure, or other conditions outside the nuclei
of its atoms.
Q: How is repeatedly cutting paper in half like the decay of a radioisotope?
A: As a radioisotope decays, the amount of the radioisotope decreases by half during each half-life, just as a piece
of paper decreases in size by half each time you cut it down the center. You can see a video of this half-life analogy
at the following URL. http://blip.tv/chemteam/an-analogy-for-half-life-4507204

Half-Life Example

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

The concept of half-life is illustrated in the Figure 3.114 for the decay of phosphorus-32 to sulfur-32. The half-life
of phosphorus-32 is 14 days. After 14 days, half of the original amount of phosphorus-32 has decayed, so only half
remains. After another 14 days, half of the remaining amount (or a quarter of the original amount) is still left, and
so on.

FIGURE 3.114

Q: What fraction of the original amount of phosphorus-32 remains after three half-lives?
A: After three half-lives, or 42 days, 1/8 (1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2) of the original amount of phosphorus-32 remains.

Variation in Half-Lives

Different radioisotopes may vary greatly in their rate of decay. That’s because they vary in how unstable their nuclei
are. The more unstable the nuclei, the faster they break down. As you can see from the examples in the Table
3.14, the half-life of a radioisotope can be as short as a split second or as long as several billion years. You can
simulate radioactive decay of radioisotopes with different half-lives at the URL below. http://www.colorado.edu/

Q: If you had 1 gram of carbon-14, how many years would it take for radioactive decay to reduce it to 1/4 gram?
A: 1 gram would decay to 1
4 gram in 2 half-lives. One half-life is 5,700 years, so two half-lives are 11,400 years.

Summary

• A radioisotope decays and changes to a different element at a certain constant rate called the half-life. This is

the length of time it takes for half of a given amount of the radioisotope to decay.

• Different radioisotopes may vary greatly in their rate of decay. The more unstable their nuclei are, the faster

they decay.

• Explain how carbon-14 dating can be used to date the remains of living things.

The Grand Canyon, pictured above, was carved by the rushing waters of the Colorado River over millions of years.
The exposed rocks at the bottom of the canyon are almost 2 billion years old. The youngest rocks near the top are
about 230 million years old. Therefore, from top to bottom, the rocks provide a continuous record of more than 1.5
billion years of geological history in this region.
Q: How have scientists been able to determine the ages of rocks in the Grand Canyon?
A: The ages are based on the gradual decay, or break down, of radioactive isotopes.

What Is Radioactive Dating?

Radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes, can be used to estimate the ages of not only of rocks, but also of fossils and
artifacts made long ago by human beings. Even the age of Earth has been estimated on the basis of radioisotopes. The

545

3.64. Half-life and Radioactive Dating

www.ck12.org

general method is called radioactive dating. To understand how radioactive dating works, you need to understand
radioisotopes and radioactive decay.

Radioisotopes and Radioactive Decay

A radioisotope has atoms with unstable nuclei. Unstable nuclei naturally decay, or break down. They lose energy
and particles and become more stable. As nuclei decay, they gain or lose protons, so the atoms become different
elements. This is illustrated in the Figure 3.115. The original, unstable nucleus is called the parent nucleus. After it
loses a particle (in this case a type of particle called an alpha particle), it forms a daughter nucleus, with a different
number of protons.

FIGURE 3.115

The nucleus of a given radioisotope decays at a constant rate that is unaffected by temperature, pressure, or other
conditions outside the nucleus. This rate of decay is called the half-life. The half-life is the length of time it takes
for half of the original amount of the radioisotope to decay to another element.
Q: How can the half-life of a radioisotope be used to date a rock?
A: After a rock forms, nuclei of a radioisotope inside the rock start to decay. As they decay, the amount of the
original, or parent, isotope decreases, while the amount of its stable decay product, or daughter isotope, increases.
By measuring the relative amounts of parent and daughter isotopes and knowing the rate of decay, scientists can
determine how long the parent isotope has been decaying. This provides an estimate of the rock’s age.

Different Isotopes, Different Half-Lives

Different radioisotopes decay at different rates. You can see some examples in the Table 3.15. Radioisotopes
with longer half-lives are used to date older rocks or other specimens, and those with shorter half-lives are used
to date younger ones. For example, the oldest rocks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon were dated by measuring
the amounts of potassium-40 in the rocks. Carbon-14 dating, in contrast, is used to date specimens that are much

younger than the rocks in the Grand Canyon. You can read more carbon-14 dating below.

Focus on Carbon-14 Dating

One of the most familiar types of radioactive dating is carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 forms naturally in Earth’s
atmosphere when cosmic rays strike atoms of nitrogen-14. Living things take in and use carbon-14, just as they do
carbon-12. The carbon-14 in living things gradually decays to nitrogen-14. However, as it decays, it is constantly
replaced because living things keep taking in carbon-14. As a result, there is a constant ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-
12 in organisms as long as they are alive. This is illustrated in the top part of the Figure 3.116.
After organisms die, the carbon-14 they already contain continues to decay, but it is no longer replaced (see the
bottom part of the Figure 3.116). Therefore, the carbon-14 in a dead organism constantly declines at a ﬁxed rate
equal to the half-life of carbon-14. Half of the remaining carbon-14 decays every 5,700 years. If you measure how
much carbon-14 is left in a fossil, you can determine how many half-lives (and how many years) have passed since
the organism died. Carbon-14 dating is illustrated in the video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u
dkQwW6aLik .
Q: Why can’t carbon-14 dating be used to date specimens older than about 60,000 years?
A: Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5700 years. After about 60,000 years, too little carbon-14 is left in a specimen to be
measured.

Summary

• The age of a rock or other specimen can be estimated from the remaining amount of a radioisotope it contains
and the radioisotope’s known rate of decay, or half-life. This method of dating specimens is called radioactive
dating.

• Radioisotopes with longer half-lives are used to date older specimens, and those with shorter half-lives are

used to date younger ones.

• Carbon-14 dating is used to date specimens younger than about 60,000 years old. It is commonly used to date

fossils of living things and human artifacts.

Nuclear ﬁssion is the splitting of the nucleus of a radioactive atom into two smaller nuclei. This type of reaction
releases a great deal of energy from a very small amount of matter. Fission of a tiny pellet of radioactive uranium-
235, like the one pictured in the Figure 3.117, releases as much energy as burning 1,000 kilograms of coal!

Q: What causes the nucleus of uranium-235 atom to ﬁssion?
A: Another particle collides with it.

How Nuclear Fission Occurs

The Figure 3.118 shows how nuclear ﬁssion of uranium-235 occurs. It begins when a uranium nucleus gains a
neutron. This can happen naturally when a free neutron strikes it, or it can occur deliberately when a neutron is
crashed into it in a nuclear power plant. In either case, the nucleus of uranium-235 becomes extremely unstable
with the extra neutron. As a result, it splits into two smaller nuclei, krypton-92 and barium-141. The reaction also
releases three neutrons and a great deal of energy. It can be represented by this nuclear equation:

235

92 U + 1 neutron → 92

36Kr + 141

56 Ba + 3 neutrons + energy

Note that the subscripts of the element symbols represent numbers of protons and the superscripts represent numbers
of protons plus neutrons.

.

Nuclear Chain Reaction

The neutrons released when uranium-235 ﬁssions may crash into other uranium nuclei and cause them to ﬁssion as
well. This can start a nuclear chain reaction. You can see how this happens in the Figure 3.119. In a chain reaction,
one ﬁssion reaction leads to others, which lead to others, and so on. A nuclear chain reaction is similar to a pile of
wood burning. If you start one piece of wood burning, enough heat is produced by the burning wood to start the rest
of the pile burning without any further help from you. You can see another example of a chain reaction at this URL:

Using Energy from Nuclear Fission

If a nuclear chain reaction is uncontrolled, it produces a lot of energy all at once. This is what happens in an atomic
bomb. However, if a nuclear chain reaction is controlled, it produces energy much more slowly. This is what occurs
in a nuclear power plant. The reaction is controlled by inserting rods of nonﬁssioning material into the ﬁssioning
material. You can see this in the Figure 3.120. The radiation from the controlled ﬁssion is used to heat water and
turn it to steam. The steam is under pressure and causes a turbine to spin. The spinning turbine runs a generator,
which produces electricity.

Pros and Cons of Nuclear Energy

www.ck12.org

In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution
that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming.
In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The
main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems
associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like
fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.
The main concern over the use of nuclear energy is the risk of radiation. Accidents at nuclear power plants can
release harmful radiation that endangers people and other living things. Even without accidents, the used fuel that is
left after nuclear ﬁssion reactions is still radioactive and very dangerous. It takes thousands of years for it to decay
until it no longer releases harmful radiation. Therefore, used fuel must be stored securely to protect people and other
living things. You can learn more about the problem of radioactive waste at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/w

Summary

• Nuclear ﬁssion is the splitting of the nucleus of an atom into two smaller nuclei. This type of reaction releases
a great deal of energy from a very small amount of matter. It begins when the nucleus of a radioactive atom
gains a neutron.

• In uncontrolled nuclear ﬁssion, one ﬁssion reaction starts a chain reaction, in which neutrons produced in one

reaction cause other reactions, which cause more reactions, and so on.

• Energy released by nuclear ﬁssion is used to produce electrical energy in nuclear power plants. Production of

nuclear energy doesn’t produce air pollution but it poses the risk of accidents that release harmful radiation.

3.66 Nuclear Fusion

• Describe how and where nuclear fusion occurs.
• Outline the pros and cons of using nuclear fusion to produce energy.

What causes the sun to glow so brightly? The answer is nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is a type of nuclear reaction,
and it releases a huge amount of energy.

What Is Nuclear Fusion?

In nuclear fusion, two or more small nuclei combine to form a single, larger nucleus. You can see an example in
the Figure 3.121. In this example, nuclei of two hydrogen isotopes (tritium and deuterium) fuse to form a helium
nucleus. A neutron and a tremendous amount of energy are also released.

The Power of Stars

Nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium occurs naturally in the sun and other stars. It takes place only at extremely
high temperatures. That’s because a great deal of energy is needed to overcome the force of repulsion between the
positively charged nuclei. The sun’s energy comes from fusion in its core, shown in the Figure 3.122. In the core,
temperatures reach millions of degrees Kelvin. The video at the following URL relates nuclear fusion to energy and
high temperatures in the sun.

3.66. Nuclear Fusion

www.ck12.org

A: Nuclear fusion doesn’t occur naturally on Earth because it requires temperatures far higher than Earth tempera-
tures.

Using Nuclear Fusion

Scientists are searching for ways to create controlled nuclear fusion reactions on Earth. Their goal is develop nuclear
fusion power plants, where the energy from fusion of hydrogen nuclei can be converted to electricity. You can see
how this might work in the Figure 3.123. In the thermonuclear reactor, radiation from fusion is used to heat water
and produce steam. The steam can then be used to turn a turbine and generate electricity.

FIGURE 3.123

The use of nuclear fusion for energy has several pros. Unlike nuclear ﬁssion, which involves dangerous radioactive
elements, nuclear fusion involves just hydrogen and helium. These elements are harmless. Hydrogen is also very
plentiful. There is a huge amount of hydrogen in ocean water. The hydrogen in just a gallon of water could produce
as much energy by nuclear fusion as burning 1,140 liters (300 gallons) of gasoline! The hydrogen in the oceans
would generate enough energy to supply all the world’s people for a very long time.
Unfortunately, using energy from nuclear fusion is far from a reality. Scientists are a long way from developing the
necessary technology. One problem is raising temperatures high enough for fusion to take place. Another problem is
that matter this hot exists only in the plasma state. There are no known materials that can contain plasma, although
a magnet might be able to do it. That’s because plasma consists of ions and responds to magnetism. You can learn
more about research on nuclear fusion at the URL below.

3.67 Conservation of Mass and Energy in Nu-

clear Reactions

• Explain the meaning of Einstein’s famous equation, E = mc2.
• Relate Einstein’s equation to the conservation of mass and energy in nuclear reactions.

It’s so simple that a baby can understand it! Well, not really, but Einstein’s famous equation is pretty simple: E =
mc2. Do you know what it means and why it’s so famous?

Einstein’s Equation

Einstein’s equation is possibly the best-known equation of all time.
There’s reason for that. The equation is incredibly important. It changed how scientists view energy and matter,
which are two of the most basic concepts in all of science. The equation shows that energy and matter are two
forms of the same thing. This new idea turned science upside down when Einstein introduced it in the early 1900s.
Amazingly, the idea has withstood the test of time as more and more evidence has been gathered to support it. You
can listen to a recording of Einstein explaining his famous equation at this URL:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7Sg41Bp-U
Q: What do the letters in Einstein’s equation stand for?
A: E stands for energy, m stands for mass, and c stands for the speed of light.
The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second, so c2 is a very big number. Therefore, the
amount of energy in even a small mass of matter is tremendous. Suppose, for example, that you have 1 gram of
matter. That’s about the mass of a paperclip. Multiplying this mass by c2 would yield enough energy to power 3,600
homes for a year!

Chapter 3. Chemical Interactions

Mass and Energy in Nuclear Reactions

Einstein’s equation helps scientists understand what happens in nuclear reactions and why they produce so much
energy. When the nucleus of a radioisotope undergoes ﬁssion or fusion in a nuclear reaction, it loses a tiny amount
of mass. What happens to the lost mass? It isn’t really lost at all. It is converted to energy. How much energy? E =
mc2. The change in mass is tiny, but it results in a great deal of energy.
Q: In a nuclear reaction, mass decreases and energy increases. What about the laws of conservation of mass and
conservation of energy? Are mass and energy not conserved in nuclear reactions? Do we need to throw out these
laws when it comes to nuclear reactions?
A: No, the laws still apply. However, it’s more correct to say that the sum of mass and energy is always conserved
in a nuclear reaction. Mass changes to energy, but the total amount of mass and energy combined remains the same.

Summary

Einstein’s equation, E = mc2, shows that matter and energy are two forms of the same thing. It also shows that there
is a tremendous amount of energy (E) in a small mass (m) of matter.

• In nuclear reactions, matter changes to energy, but the total amount of mass and energy together does not

change.

Introduction

It’s a bird! It’s plane! It’s a super skateboarder! This boy appears to be ﬂying high in the sky, but he can’t stay
airborne for long. Gravity will soon pull him back to the ground. How was he able to overcome the force of gravity
and rise into the air? In this unit, you’ll learn about forces such as gravity and motions such as skateboarding,
including how skateboarders can seem to defy gravity. Along the way, you can also pick up some cool skateboarding
tips!

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

4.1 Motion

• Deﬁne motion.
• Explain how frame of reference is related to motion.

The wings of this hummingbird are moving so fast that they’re just a blur of motion. You can probably think of many
other examples of things in motion. If you can’t, just look around you. It’s likely that you’ll see something moving,
and if nothing else, your eyes will be moving. So you know from experience what motion is. No doubt it seems like
a fairly simple concept. However, when you read this article, you’ll ﬁnd out that it’s not quite as simple as it seems.

Deﬁning Motion

In science, motion is deﬁned as a change in position. An object’s position is its location. Besides the wings of
the hummingbird in the opening image, you can see other examples of motion in the Figure 4.1. In each case, the
position of something is changing.
Q: In each picture in the Figure 4.1, what is moving and how is its position changing?
A: The train and all its passengers are speeding straight down a track to the next station. The man and his bike
are racing along a curving highway. The geese are ﬂying over their wetland environment. The meteor is shooting
through the atmosphere toward Earth, burning up as it goes.

Frame of Reference

There’s more to motion than objects simply changing position. You’ll see why when you consider the following
example. Assume that the school bus pictured in the Figure 4.2 passes by you as you stand on the sidewalk. It’s
obvious to you that the bus is moving, but what about to the children inside the bus? The bus isn’t moving relative

567

to them, and if they look at the other children sitting on the bus, they won’t appear to be moving either. If the ride
is really smooth, the children may only be able to tell that the bus is moving by looking out the window and seeing
you and the trees whizzing by.

FIGURE 4.2

This example shows that how we perceive motion depends on our frame of reference. Frame of reference refers to
something that is not moving with respect to an observer that can be used to detect motion. For the children on the
bus, if they use other children riding the bus as their frame of reference, they do not appear to be moving. But if they
use objects outside the bus as their frame of reference, they can tell they are moving. The video at the URL below
illustrates other examples of how frame of reference is related to motion.

Q: What is your frame of reference if you are standing on the sidewalk and see the bus go by? How can you tell that
the bus is moving?
A: Your frame of reference might be the trees and other stationary objects across the street. As the bus goes by, it
momentarily blocks your view of these objects, and this helps you detect the bus’ motion.

Summary

• Motion is deﬁned as a change of position.
• How we perceive motion depends on our frame of reference. Frame of reference refers to something that is

not moving with respect to an observer that can be used to detect motion.

4.2. Distance

www.ck12.org

4.2 Distance

• Deﬁne distance.
• Identify the SI unit for distance.
• Demonstrate how to use the scale on a map to measure distance.

Do you participate in track like the boys pictured here? If not, you may have attended a track meet. The boys in the
picture are running a 100-meter sprint. Running events in track are named for their distance.

What Is Distance?

Distance is the length of the route between two points. The distance of a race, for example, is the length of the track
between the starting and ﬁnishing lines. In a 100-meter sprint, that distance is 100 meters.

SI Unit for Distance

The SI unit for distance is the meter (m). Short distances may be measured in centimeters (cm), and long distances
may be measured in kilometers (km). For example, you might measure the distance from the bottom to the top of a
sheet of paper in centimeters and the distance from your house to your school in kilometers.

Using Maps to Measure Distance

Maps can often be used to measure distance. The map in the Figure 4.3 shows the route from Jordan’s house to his
school. You can use the scale at the bottom of the map to measure the distance between these two points.
Q: What is the distance from Jordan’s house to his school?
A: The distance is 2 kilometers.

4.3. Direction

www.ck12.org

4.3 Direction

• State the importance of direction as a component of motion.
• Use a compass rose to determine direction on a map.
• Show how to represent direction and distance with vectors

Imagine traveling several miles in one of the directions indicated by this sign. Now suppose that a friend travels
the same distance in another direction indicated by the sign. You and your friend would end up in very different
locations. Obviously, direction is an important component of motion.

Introducing Direction

Direction can be described in relative terms, such as up, down, in, out, left, right, forward, backward, or sideways.
Direction can also be described with the cardinal directions: north, south, east, or west. On maps, cardinal directions
are indicated with a compass rose. You can see one in the bottom left corner of the map in the Figure 4.4. You can
use the compass rose to ﬁnd directions on the map. For example, to go to the school from Jordan’s house, you would
travel from east to west. If you wanted to go on to the post ofﬁce, you would change direction at the school and then
travel from south to north.

Why Direction Is Important

Look again at the map in the Figure 4.4. The distance from Jordan’s house to the post ofﬁce is 3 km. But if Jordan
told a friend how to reach the post ofﬁce from his house, he couldn’t just say “go 3 kilometers.” The friend might
end up at the park instead of the post ofﬁce. Jordan would have to include direction as well as distance. He could
say, “go west for 2 kilometers and then go north for 1 kilometer.”

Motion and Vectors

When both distance and direction are considered, motion can be represented by a vector. A vector is a measurement
that has both size and direction. It may be represented by an arrow. If you are representing motion with an arrow,
the length of the arrow represents distance, and the way the arrow points represents direction. The red arrows on the
map in the Figure 4.4 are vectors for Jordan’s route from his house to the school and from the school to the post
ofﬁce. If you want to learn more about vectors, watch the video at this URL:

4.4 Speed

• Deﬁne speed, and give the SI unit for speed.
• Show how to calculate average speed from distance and time.
• Describe instantaneous speed.
• Show how to calculate distance or time from speed when the other variable is known.

Did you ever play fast-pitch softball? If you did, then you probably have some idea of how fast the pitcher throws
the ball. For a female athlete like the one in the opening image, the ball may reach a speed of 120 km/h (about 75
mi/h). For a male athlete, the ball may travel even faster. A fast-pitch pitcher uses a “windmill” motion to throw the
ball. This is a different technique than other softball pitches, and it explains why the ball travels so fast.

Introducing Speed

How fast or slow something moves is its speed. Speed determines how far something travels in a given amount of
time. The SI unit for speed is meters per second (m/s). Speed may be constant, but often it varies from moment to
moment.

Average Speed

Even if speed varies during the course of a trip, it’s easy to calculate the average speed by using this formula:

speed =

distance

time

For example, assume you go on a car trip with your family. The total distance you travel is 120 miles, and it takes 3
hours to travel that far. The average speed for the trip is:

575

4.4. Speed

speed =

Q: Terri rode her bike very slowly to the top of a big hill. Then she coasted back down the hill at a much faster
speed. The distance from the bottom to the top of the hill is 3 kilometers. It took Terri 1
4 hour to make the round trip.
What was her average speed for the entire trip? (Hint: The round-trip distance is 6 km.)
A: Terri’s speed can be calculated as follows:

speed =

6 km
0.25 h

= 24 km/h

Instantaneous Speed

When you travel by car, you usually don’t move at a constant speed. Instead you go faster or slower depending on
speed limits, trafﬁc lights, the number of vehicles on the road, and other factors. For example, you might travel 65
miles per hour on a highway but only 20 miles per hour on a city street (see the pictures in the Figure 4.5.) You
might come to a complete stop at trafﬁc lights, slow down as you turn corners, and speed up to pass other cars.
Therefore, your speed at any given instant, or your instantaneous speed, may be very different than your speed at
other times. Instantaneous speed is much more difﬁcult to calculate than average speed. If you want to learn more
about calculating speed, watch the video at this URL:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8tIBrj84II

FIGURE 4.5
Cars race by in a blur of motion on an
open highway but crawl at a snail’s pace
when they hit city trafﬁc.

Calculating Distance or Time from Speed

If you know the average speed of a moving object, you can calculate the distance it will travel in a given period of
time or the time it will take to travel a given distance. To calculate distance from speed and time, use this version of
the average speed formula given above:
distance = speed × time
For example, if a car travels at an average speed of 60 km/h for 5 hours, then the distance it travels is:
distance = 60 km/h × 5 h = 300 km
To calculate time from speed and distance, use this version of the formula:

576

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

time =

distance
speed

Q: If you walk 6 km at an average speed of 3 km/h, how much time does it take?
A: Use the formula for time as follows:

time =

=

distance
speed
6 km
3 km/h

= 2 h

Summary

• How fast or slow something moves is its speed. The SI unit for speed is meters per second (m/s).
• Average speed is calculated with this formula:

speed =

distance

time

• Speed may be constant, but often it varies from moment to moment. Speed at any given instant is called

instantaneous speed. It is much more difﬁcult to calculate than average speed.

• Distance or time can be calculated by solving the average speed formula for distance or time.

4.5 Position-Time Graphs

• Describe how to draw a position-time graph.
• Explain how a position-time graph shows the velocity of a moving object.
• Show how to calculate the average velocity of a moving object from a position-time graph of its motion.

Drawing line graphs can help you understand motion. In this article, you’ll learn how to draw position-time graphs
and how they show velocity.
Q: What’s missing from the graph being drawn in the picture above?
A: The x- and y-axes are missing.

Graphing Position and Time

The motion of an object can be represented by a position-time graph like Graph 1 in the Figure 4.6. In this type of
graph, the y-axis represents position relative to the starting point, and the x-axis represents time. A position-time
graph shows how far an object has traveled from its starting position at any given time since it started moving.
Q: In the Figure 4.6, what distance has the object traveled from the starting point by the time 5 seconds have
elapsed?
A: The object has traveled a distance of 50 meters.

Slope Equals Velocity

In a position-time graph, the velocity of the moving object is represented by the slope, or steepness, of the graph
line. If the graph line is horizontal, like the line after time = 5 seconds in Graph 2 in the Figure 4.7, then the slope

578

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

FIGURE 4.6

is zero and so is the velocity. The position of the object is not changing. The steeper the line is, the greater the slope
of the line is and the faster the object’s motion is changing.

FIGURE 4.7

Calculating Average Velocity from a Position-Time Graph

It’s easy to calculate the average velocity of a moving object from a position-time graph. Average velocity equals
the change in position (represented by ∆d) divided by the corresponding change in time (represented by ∆t):

velocity =

∆d
∆t

For example, in Graph 2 in the Figure 4.7, the average velocity between 0 seconds and 5 seconds is:

Summary

• Motion can be represented by a position-time graph, which plots position relative to the starting point on the

y-axis and time on the x-axis.

• The slope of a position-time graph represents velocity. The steeper the slope is, the faster the motion is

changing.

• Average velocity can be calculated from a position-time graph as the change in position divided by the

corresponding change in time.

Ramey and her mom were driving down this highway at 45 miles per hour, which is the speed limit on this road. As
they approached this sign, Ramey’s mom put on the brakes and started to slow down so she could safely maneuver
the upcoming curves in the road. This speed limit sign actually represents two components of motion: speed and
direction.

Speed and Direction

Speed tells you only how fast or slow an object is moving. It doesn’t tell you the direction the object is moving. The
measure of both speed and direction is called velocity. Velocity is a vector. A vector is measurement that includes
both size and direction. Vectors are often represented by arrows. When using an arrow to represent velocity, the
length of the arrow stands for speed, and the way the arrow points indicates the direction. If you’re still not sure of
the difference between speed and velocity, watch the cartoon at this URL:

Using Vector Arrows to Represent Velocity

The arrows in the Figure 4.8 represent the velocity of three different objects. Arrows A and B are the same length
but point in different directions. They represent objects moving at the same speed but in different directions. Arrow
C is shorter than arrow A or B but points in the same direction as arrow A. It represents an object moving at a slower
speed than A or B but in the same direction as A.

FIGURE 4.8

Differences in Velocity

Objects have the same velocity only if they are moving at the same speed and in the same direction. Objects moving
at different speeds, in different directions, or both have different velocities. Look again at arrows A and B from the
Figure 4.8. They represent objects that have different velocities only because they are moving in different directions.
A and C represent objects that have different velocities only because they are moving at different speeds. Objects
represented by B and C have different velocities because they are moving in different directions and at different
speeds.
Q: Jerod is riding his bike at a constant speed. As he rides down his street he is moving from east to west. At the
end of the block, he turns right and starts moving from south to north, but he’s still traveling at the same speed. Has
his velocity changed?
A: Although Jerod’s speed hasn’t changed, his velocity has changed because he is moving in a different direction.
Q: How could you use vector arrows to represent Jerod’s velocity and how it changes?
A: The arrows might look like this:

Calculating Average Velocity

You can calculate the average velocity of a moving object that is not changing direction by dividing the distance the
object travels by the time it takes to travel that distance. You would use this formula:

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

velocity =

distance

time

This is the same formula that is used for calculating average speed. It represents velocity only if the answer also
includes the direction that the object is traveling.
Let’s work through a sample problem. Toni’s dog is racing down the sidewalk toward the east. The dog travels 36
meters in 18 seconds before it stops running. The velocity of the dog is:

velocity =

=

distance

time
36 m
18 s

= 2 m/s east

Note that the answer is given in the SI unit for velocity, which is m/s, and it includes the direction that the dog is
traveling.
Q: What would the dog’s velocity be if it ran the same distance in the opposite direction but covered the distance in
24 seconds?
A: In this case, the velocity would be:

velocity =

=

distance

time
36 m
24 s

= 1.5 m/s west

Summary

• Velocity is a measure of both speed and direction of motion. Velocity is a vector, which is a measurement that

includes both size and direction.

• Velocity can be represented by an arrow, with the length of the arrow representing speed and the way the arrow

points representing direction.

• Objects have the same velocity only if they are moving at the same speed and in the same direction. Objects

moving at different speeds, in different directions, or both have different velocities.

• The average velocity of an object moving in a constant direction is calculated with the formula: velocity =

distance
time . The SI unit for velocity is m/s, plus the direction the object is traveling.

4.7 Acceleration

• Deﬁne acceleration.
• Give examples of acceleration.
• Describe how it feels to accelerate.

Imagine the thrill of riding on a roller coaster like this one! The coaster slowly crawls to the top of the track and
then ﬂies down the other side. It also zooms around twists and turns at breakneck speeds. These changes in speed
and direction are what make a roller coaster ride so exciting. Changes in speed or direction are called acceleration.

Deﬁning Acceleration

Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity
changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reﬂect
a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any
measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but
a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in
direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well.
Q: Can you think of an example of acceleration that doesn’t involve a change in speed?
A: Driving at a constant speed around a bend in a road is one example. Use your imagination to think of others.

585

4.7. Acceleration

Examples of Acceleration

www.ck12.org

You can see several examples of acceleration in the pictures from the Figure 4.9. In each example, velocity is
changing but in different ways. For example, direction may be changing but not speed, or vice versa. Figure out
what is moving and how it’s moving in each of the photos.

FIGURE 4.9

Q: Describe how velocity is changing in each of the motions you identiﬁed from the Figure 4.9.
A: You should describe how both direction and speed are changing. For example, the boy on the carousel is moving
up and down and around in a circle, so his direction is constantly changing, but his speed changes only at the
beginning and end of the ride. The skydiver is falling straight down toward the ground so her direction isn’t changing,
but her speed keeps increasing as she falls until she opens her parachute. For a better understanding of the changing
velocity of a skydiver, watch the animation at this URL:
http://www.waowen.screaming.net/revision/force%26motion/skydiver.htm

Feeling Acceleration

If you are accelerating, you may be able to feel the change in velocity. This is true whether the change is in speed,
direction, or both. You often feel acceleration when you ride in a car. As the car speeds up, you feel as though you
are being pressed against the seat. When the car slows down, you feel like you are being pushed forward, especially
if the change in speed is sudden. If the car changes direction and turns right, you feel as though you are being pushed
to the left. With a left turn, you feel a push to the right. The next time you ride in a car, notice how it feels as the car
accelerates in each of these ways. You can also simulate acceleration at this URL: http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simu

This cyclist is in constant motion as he competes in an off-road mountain bike race. Both his speed and his direction
keep changing. Velocity is a measure that represents both speed and direction. Changes in velocity are measured by
acceleration. Acceleration reﬂects how quickly velocity is changing. It may involve a change in speed, a change in
direction, or both. You can see off-road bikers accelerating in these ways in the exciting mountain bike race at this
URL: http://vimeo.com/1630019

Calculating Average Acceleration in One Direction

Calculating acceleration is complicated if both speed and direction are changing or if you want to know acceleration
at any given instant in time. However, it’s relatively easy to calculate average acceleration over a period of time
when only speed is changing. Then acceleration is the change in velocity (represented by ∆v) divided by the change
in time (represented by ∆t):

acceleration =

∆v
∆t

Accelerating on a Bike

Look at the cyclist in the Figure 4.10. With the help of gravity, he speeds up as he goes downhill on a straight part
of the trail. His velocity changes from 1 meter per second at the top of the hill to 6 meters per second by the time he

588

www.ck12.org

reaches the bottom. If it takes him 5 seconds to reach the bottom, what is his average acceleration as he races down
the hill?

∆v

acceleration =

=

=

5 m/s
5 s

=
= 1 m/s2

In words, this means that for each second the cyclist travels downhill, his velocity (in this case, his speed) increases
by 1 meter per second on average. Note that the answer to this problem is expressed in m/s2, which is the SI unit for
acceleration.

FIGURE 4.10

Q: The cyclist slows down at the end of the race. His velocity changes from 6 m/s to 2 m/s during a period of 4
seconds without any change in direction. What was his average acceleration during these 4 seconds?
A: Use the equation given above for acceleration:

The sprinter in this image is just taking off from the starting blocks to run a short race down a straight track. She
starts in a burst of speed and will pick up even more speed during the ﬁrst few seconds of the race. She’ll keep
running at top speed until she crosses the ﬁnish line. Only then will she slow down. Velocity is a measure of both
speed and direction of motion. A change in velocity is called acceleration. In the case of the sprinter, she accelerates
as she runs down the track because her speed is changing even though her direction stays the same. If you need a

Plotting Velocity Against Time

The changing velocity of the sprinter—or of any other moving person or object—can be represented by a velocity-
time graph like the one in the Figure 4.11 for the sprinter. A velocity-time graph shows how velocity changes over
time. The sprinter’s velocity increases for the ﬁrst 4 seconds of the race, it remains constant for the next 3 seconds,
and it decreases during the last 3 seconds after she crosses the ﬁnish line.

4.9. Velocity-Time Graphs

FIGURE 4.11

Acceleration and Slope

In a velocity-time graph, acceleration is represented by the slope, or steepness, of the graph line. If the line slopes
upward, like the line between 0 and 4 seconds in the Figure 4.11, velocity is increasing, so acceleration is positive. If
the line is horizontal, as it is between 4 and 7 seconds, velocity is constant and acceleration is zero. If the line slopes
downward, like the line between 7 and 10 seconds, velocity is decreasing and acceleration is negative. Negative
acceleration is called deceleration.
Q: Assume that another sprinter is running the same race. The other runner reaches a top velocity of 9 m/s by
4 seconds after the start of the race. How would the ﬁrst 4 seconds of the velocity-time graph for this runner be
different from the Figure 4.11?
A: The graph line for this runner during seconds 0–4 would be steeper (have a greater slope). This would show that
acceleration is greater during this time period for the other sprinter.

• A velocity-time graph shows changes in velocity of a moving object over time.
• The slope of a velocity-time graph represents acceleration of the moving object.

Carson has been riding a scooter for almost as long as he can remember. As you can see, he’s really good at it. He
can even do tricks in the air. It takes a lot of practice to be able to control a scooter like this. Carson automatically
applies just the right forces to control his scooter.

Deﬁning Force

Force is deﬁned as a push or pull acting on an object. There are several fundamental forces in the universe, including
the force of gravity, electromagnetic force, and weak and strong nuclear forces. When it comes to the motion of
everyday objects, however, the forces of interest include mainly gravity, friction, and applied force. Applied force is
force that a person or thing applies to an object.
Q: What forces act on Carson’s scooter?
A: Gravity, friction, and applied forces all act on Carson’s scooter. Gravity keeps pulling both Carson and the scooter
toward the ground. Friction between the wheels of the scooter and the ground prevent the scooter from sliding but
also slow it down. In addition, Carson applies forces to his scooter to control its speed and direction.

594

www.ck12.org

Force and Motion

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

Forces cause all motions. Everytime the motion of an object changes, it’s because a force has been applied to it.
Force can cause a stationary object to start moving or a moving object to change its speed or direction or both. A
change in the speed or direction of an object is called acceleration. Look at Carson’s brother Colton in the Figure
4.12. He’s getting his scooter started by pushing off with his foot. The force he applies to the ground with his foot
starts the scooter moving in the opposite direction. The harder he pushes against the ground, the faster the scooter
will go.

FIGURE 4.12

How much an object accelerates when a force is applied to it depends not only on the strength of the force but also
on the object’s mass. For example, a heavier scooter would be harder to accelerate. Colton would have to push with
more force to start it moving and move it faster. You can explore the how force, mass, and acceleration are related
by doing the activity at this URL:
http://www.harcourtschool.com/activity/newton/
Q: What units do you think are used to measure force?
A: The SI unit for force is the Newton (N). A Newton is the force needed to cause a mass of 1 kilogram to accelerate
at 1 m/s2, so a Newton equals 1 kg • m/s2. The Newton was named for the scientist Sir Isaac Newton, who is famous
for his laws of motion and gravity.

595

4.10. Force

Force as a Vector

www.ck12.org

Force is a vector, or a measure that has both size and direction. For example, Colton pushes on the ground in the
opposite direction that the scooter moves, so that’s the direction of the force he is applies. He can give the scooter
a strong push or a weak push. That’s the size of the force. Like other vectors, a force can be represented with an
arrow. You can see some examples in the Figure 4.13. The length of each arrow represents the strength of the force,
and the way the arrow points represents the direction of the force.

FIGURE 4.13

Q: How could you use arrows to represent the forces that start Colton’s scooter moving?
A: Colton pushes against the ground behind him (to the right in the Figure 4.12). The ground pushes back with
equal force to the left, causing the scooter to move in that direction. Force arrows A and B in example 2 in the
Figure 4.12) could represent these forces.

Summary

• Force is deﬁned as a push or pull acting on an object. Forces include gravity, friction, and applied force.
• Force causes changes in the speed or direction of motion. These changes are called acceleration.
• The SI unit for force is the Newton (N).
• Force is a vector because it has both size and direction. Like other vectors, it can be represented by an arrow.

• Calculate the net force acting on an object and determine the direction it will move.

It’s boys against girls in this friendly tug of war. The two teams are pulling the rope in opposite directions. Which
team do you think will win? It depends on which side pulls on the rope with the greatest force. As this example
shows, more than one force may act on an object at the same time. Would it surprise you to learn that at least two
different forces are acting on you as you read this article? Can you guess what they are?

Pulling Down and Pushing Up

One force acting on you—and all the other objects on Earth—is gravity. Look at the physics book in the Figure
4.14. Gravity pulls the book downward with a force of 20 Newtons. Why doesn’t the book fall to the ground? The
table pushes upward on the book with the same amount of force. The combined force, or net force, acting on the
book is 0 Newtons. That’s because upward and downward forces are balanced, so they cancel out. You can learn
more about net force at this URL:
http://www.mansfieldct.org/schools/mms/staff/hand/lawsunbalancedforce.htm

Forces Acting in Opposite Directions

In general, whenever forces act on an object in opposite directions—like the book on the table—the net force is equal
to the difference between the two forces. In other words, one force is subtracted from the other to calculate the net
force. If the opposing forces are equal, or balanced, the net force is zero, as it is for the book. That’s why the book
doesn’t fall to the ground but instead remains resting on the table. However, if the opposing forces are unbalanced,
the net force is greater than zero, although it will be less than either of the individual forces. In this case, the object
will move in the same direction as the net force.

Look at the dogs playing tug-of-war in the Figure 4.15. The dogs are pulling the rope in opposite directions, but one
dog is pulling with more force than the other. The net force acting on the rope is 2 Newtons to the right, so the rope
will move to the right.

FIGURE 4.15

Q: The boys in the Figure 4.16 are about to kick the soccer ball in opposite directions. What will be the net force
on the ball? In which direction will the ball move?
A: The net force on the ball will be 50 N to the left (125 N –75 N = 50 N), so the ball will move to the left.

Forces Acting in the Same Direction

If two forces act on an object in the same direction, the net force is equal to the sum of the two forces. This always
results in a stronger force than either of the individual forces alone. In the Figure 4.17, after the man on the left
picks up the couch, he will push the couch to the right with a force of 25 Newtons, and the man on the right will pull
the couch to the right with a force of 20 Newtons. The net force on the couch is 45 Newtons to the right, so that’s
the way the couch will move.

Did you ever rub your hands together to warm them up, like the young man in the opening image? Why does this

What Is Friction?

Friction is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. Friction can work for or against us.
For example, putting sand on an icy sidewalk increases friction so you are less likely to slip. On the other hand, too
much friction between moving parts in a car engine can cause the parts to wear out. Other examples of friction are
illustrated in the two Figures 4.19 and 4.20. You can see an animation showing how friction opposes motion at this

FIGURE 4.20
These photos show two ways that friction
can cause problems

Why Friction Occurs

Friction occurs because no surface is perfectly smooth. Even surfaces that look smooth to the unaided eye make look
rough or bumpy when viewed under a microscope. Look at the metal surfaces in the Figure 4.21. The aluminum
foil is so smooth that it’s shiny. However, when highly magniﬁed, the surface of metal appears to be very bumpy. All
those mountains and valleys catch and grab the mountains and valleys of any other surface that contacts the metal.
This creates friction.

Factors That Affect Friction

Rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces. That’s why we put sand on icy sidewalks
and roads. You can’t slide as far across ice with shoes as you can on the blades of skates (see Figure 4.22). The
rougher surface of the soles of the shoes causes more friction and slows you down.
Q: Heavier objects also have more friction. Can you explain why?

603

4.12. Friction

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 4.21

FIGURE 4.22

A: Heavier objects press together with greater force, and this causes greater friction between them. Did you ever try
to furniture across the ﬂoor? It’s harder to overcome friction between a heavier piece of furniture and the ﬂoor than
between lighter pieces and the ﬂoor.

Friction Produces Heat

You know that friction produces heat. That’s why rubbing your hands together makes them warmer. But do you
know why? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, so they have more energy. This gives
them a higher temperature, and they feel warmer. Heat from friction can be useful. It not only warms your hands. It
also lets you light a match as shown in the Figure 4.23. On the other hand, heat from friction between moving parts
inside a car engine can be a big problem. It can cause the car to overheat.
Q: How is friction reduced between the moving parts inside a car engine?
A: To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. The oil coats the surfaces of the moving parts and makes them
slippery. They slide over each other more easily, so there is less friction.

down toward the ground. Another force helps you to climb the vertical rock wall by keeping your hands and feet
from slipping. That force is friction.

Four Types of Friction

Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are in contact. There are four types of friction:
static, sliding, rolling, and ﬂuid friction. Static, sliding, and rolling friction occur between solid surfaces. Fluid
friction occurs in liquids and gases. All four types of friction are described below. You can see a video demonstration
of the different types at this URL:

Static Friction

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

Static friction acts on objects when they are resting on a surface. For example, if you are hiking in the woods, there
is static friction between your shoes and the trail each time you put down your foot (see Figure 4.24). Without
this static friction, your feet would slip out from under you, making it difﬁcult to walk. In fact, that’s exactly what
happens if you try to walk on ice. That’s because ice is very slippery and offers very little friction.

FIGURE 4.24

Q: Can you think of other examples of static friction?
A: One example is the friction that helps the people climb the rock wall in the opening picture above. Static friction
keeps their hands and feet from slipping.

Sliding Friction

Sliding friction is friction that acts on objects when they are sliding over a surface. Sliding friction is weaker than
static friction. That’s why it’s easier to slide a piece of furniture over the ﬂoor after you start it moving than it is to
get it moving in the ﬁrst place. Sliding friction can be useful. For example, you use sliding friction when you write
with a pencil. The pencil “lead” slides easily over the paper, but there’s just enough friction between the pencil and
paper to leave a mark.
Q: How does sliding friction help you ride a bike?
A: There is sliding friction between the brake pads and bike rims each time you use your bike’s brakes. This friction
slows the rolling wheels so you can stop.

Rolling Friction

Rolling friction is friction that acts on objects when they are rolling over a surface. Rolling friction is much weaker
than sliding friction or static friction. This explains why most forms of ground transportation use wheels, including
bicycles, cars, 4-wheelers, roller skates, scooters, and skateboards. Ball bearings are another use of rolling friction.
You can see what they look like in the Figure 4.25. They let parts of a wheel or other machine roll rather than slide
over on another.

Fluid Friction

Fluid friction is friction that acts on objects that are moving through a ﬂuid. A ﬂuid is a substance that can ﬂow and
take the shape of its container. Fluids include liquids and gases. If you’ve ever tried to push your open hand through
the water in a tub or pool, then you’ve experienced ﬂuid friction. You can feel the resistance of the water against

your hand. Look at the skydiver in the Figure 4.26. He’s falling toward Earth with a parachute. Resistance of the
air against the parachute slows his descent. The faster or larger a moving object is, the greater is the ﬂuid friction
resisting its motion. That’s why there is greater air resistance against the parachute than the skydiver’s body.

Summary

• Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are in contact. There are four types of

friction: static, sliding, rolling, and ﬂuid friction.

• Static, sliding, and rolling friction occur between solid surfaces. Static friction is strongest, followed by sliding

friction, and then rolling friction, which is weakest.

• Fluid friction occurs in ﬂuids, which are liquids or gases.

4.15 Newton’s Law of Gravity

• Describe Newton’s law of universal gravitation, and explain why it was so important.
• Identify factors that affect the strength of gravity between two objects.

You may have heard a story about Isaac Newton coming up with the idea of gravity when an apple fell out of a tree
and hit him in the head. The story isn’t true, but seeing how things like apples fall to Earth helped Newton form his
ideas about gravity, the force of attraction between things that have mass. Of course, people had known about the
effects of gravity for thousands of years before Newton came along. After all, they constantly experienced gravity
in their daily lives. They observed over and over again that things always fall toward the ground. However, it wasn’t
until Newton developed his law of gravity in the late 1600s that people knew gravity applies to everything in the
universe that has mass.

Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

Newton was the ﬁrst one to suggest that gravity is universal and affects all objects in the universe. That’s why
Newton’s law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation. Universal gravitation means that the force that
causes an apple to fall from a tree to the ground is the same force that causes the moon to keep moving around
Earth. Universal gravitation also means that while Earth exerts a pull on you, you exert a pull on Earth. In fact, there
is gravity between you and every mass around you—your desk, your book, your pen. Even tiny molecules of gas
are attracted to one another by the force of gravity. You can learn more about Newton’s law of gravity and how he
developed it in the video at this URL:
http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/interactive/2012/mar/12/newton-law-gravity-audio-slideshow
Q: Newton’s law of universal gravitation had a huge impact on how people thought about the universe. Why do you
think it was so important?
A: Newton’s law was the ﬁrst scientiﬁc law that applied to the entire universe. It explains the motion of objects not
only on Earth but in outer space as well.

619

4.15. Newton’s Law of Gravity

www.ck12.org

Factors That Inﬂuence the Strength of Gravity

Newton’s law also states that the strength of gravity between any two objects depends on two factors: the masses of
the objects and the distance between them.

• Objects with greater mass have a stronger force of gravity between them. For example, because Earth is so
massive, it attracts you and your desk more strongly that you and your desk attract each other. That’s why you
and the desk remain in place on the ﬂoor rather than moving toward one another.

• Objects that are closer together have a stronger force of gravity between them. For example, the moon is closer
to Earth than it is to the more massive sun, so the force of gravity is greater between the moon and Earth than
between the moon and the sun. That’s why the moon circles around Earth rather than the sun. You can see
this in the Figure 4.28.

FIGURE 4.28

Summary

• Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that the force of gravity affects everything with mass in the

universe.

• Newton’s law also states that the strength of gravity between any two objects depends on the masses of the

objects and the distance between them.

4.16 Einstein’s Concept of Gravity

• Identify limitations of Newton’s law of gravity.
• Describe Einstein’s theory of gravity and how it differs from Newton’s law.

Why is jumping on a trampoline so much fun? Its springy surface helps you jump higher than you ever could on the
hard ground. But even on a trampoline, you can’t keep jumping higher and higher. Gravity always pulls you back
down. You’ve probably known about gravity since you were in elementary school. It’s the force that pulls all objects
on Earth down toward the ground. Is that all there is to gravity? Absolutely not!

It Started with Newton

In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton introduced his law of gravity, which identiﬁes gravity as a force of attraction between
all objects with mass in the universe. The law also states that the strength of gravity between two objects depends on
their mass and distance apart. Newton’s law of gravity was accepted for more than two centuries. It can predict the
motion of most objects and was even used by NASA to land astronauts on the moon. It’s still used for most practical
purposes. However, Newton’s law doesn’t explain why gravity occurs. It only describes how gravity seems to affect
objects. There are also some cases in which Newton’s law doesn’t even describe what happens.
Q: Newton expressed his ideas about gravity as a law. A law in science is a description of what always occurs in
nature. For example, according to Newton’s law, objects on Earth always fall down, not up. What is needed to
explain gravity?
A: A theory is needed to explain gravity. In science, a theory is a broad explanation that is supported by a great deal
of evidence.

622

www.ck12.org

Einstein Explained It All

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

In the early 1900s, Albert Einstein came up with a theory of gravity that actually explains gravity rather than simply
describing its effects. Einstein showed mathematically that gravity is not really a force that of attraction between all
objects with mass, as Newton thought. Instead, Einstein showed that gravity is a result of the warping, or curving,
of space and time, which made up the same space-time “fabric.” These ideas about space-time and gravity became
known as Einstein’s theory of general relativity. If you watch the video at the URL below, you can see how Einstein
developed his theory. The video may also help you understand how Einstein’s theory differs from Newton’s law.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-p8yZYxNGc

Visualizing Einstein’s Ideas

Einstein derived his theory using mathematics. However, you can get a good grasp of it with the help of a simple
visual analogy. Imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a trampoline. The surface of the trampoline would curve
downward instead of being ﬂat. Now imagine placing a lighter ball at the edge of the trampoline. What will happen?
It will roll down toward the bowling ball. This apparent attraction to the bowling ball occurs because the trampoline
curves downward, not because the two balls are actually attracted to one another by an invisible force called gravity.
Einstein theorized that the sun and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a way that
is similar to the effect of the bowling ball on the trampoline. The more massive a body is, the more it causes
space-time to curve. This idea is represented by the Figure 4.29. According to Einstein, objects move toward one
another because of the curves in space-time, not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction.
Einstein’s theory is supported by evidence and widely accepted today, although Newton’s law is still used for many
calculations. You can see an animation of the warping of space-time at the following URL.

Summary

• Newton’s law of gravity can predict the motion of most but not all objects. It also doesn’t explain gravity. It

only describes its effects on the motion of objects.

4.17 Acceleration Due to Gravity

• Describe the acceleration of falling objects due to gravity.
• Explain why falling objects with different masses accelerate at the same rate.

It’s a good thing this mountain climber’s safety gear is working, because it’s a long way down to the ground! If
he were to fall, he’d be moving really fast by the time he got there. The higher any object starts falling from
above Earth’s surface, the faster it’s traveling by the time it reaches the ground. Do you know why? The reason is
gravity.

Speeding up While Falling Down

Gravity is a force that pulls objects down toward the ground. When objects fall to the ground, gravity causes them
to accelerate. Acceleration is a change in velocity, and velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of
motion. Gravity causes an object to fall toward the ground at a faster and faster velocity the longer the object falls.
In fact, its velocity increases by 9.8 m/s2, so by 1 second after an object starts falling, its velocity is 9.8 m/s. By 2
seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 19.6 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s), and so on. The acceleration of a falling
object due to gravity is illustrated in the Figure 4.30. For a more detailed explanation of acceleration due to gravity,

Mass and Acceleration Due to Gravity

What if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the same distance above the ground?
The bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball, so the pull of gravity on it is greater. Would it fall to the
ground faster? No, the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time. The reason? The
more massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass, so it ends up moving at the same
acceleration as the soccer ball. This is true of all falling objects. They all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity,
unless air resistance affects one object more than another. For example, a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance
more than a falling acorn because of the leaf’s greater surface area. You can simulate the effect of air resistance on
acceleration due to gravity by doing the interactive animation at this URL: http://www.science-animations.com/su
pport-ﬁles/freefall.swf
Q: If a leaf and an acorn were to fall to the ground in the absence of air (that is, in a vacuum), how would this affect
their acceleration due to gravity?
A: They would both accelerate at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time.

Summary

• When gravity pulls objects toward the ground, it always causes them to accelerate at a rate of 9.8 m/s2.
• Regardless of differences in mass, all objects accelerate at the same rate due to gravity unless air resistance

affects one more than another.

4.18 Projectile Motion

• Describe projectile motion and state when it occurs.
• Give examples of projectile motion.

The archer in the opening image is aiming his arrow a little bit above the bull’s eye of the target, rather than directly
at it. Why doesn’t he aim at the bull’s eye instead? The answer is projectile motion.

Combining Forces

When the archer releases the bowstring, the arrow will be ﬂung forward toward the top of the target where she’s
aiming. But another force will also act on the arrow in a different direction. The other force is gravity, and it will
pull the arrow down toward Earth. The two forces combined will cause the arrow to move in the curved path shown
in the Figure 4.31. This type of motion is called projectile motion. It occurs whenever an object curves down
toward the ground because it has both a horizontal force and the downward force of gravity acting on it.
Because of projectile motion, to hit the bull’s eye of a target with an arrow, you actually have to aim for a spot above
the bull’s eye. You can see in the Figure 4.32 what happens if you aim at the bull’s eye instead of above it.

Another Example of Projectile Motion

You can probably think of other examples of projectile motion. One is shown in the Figure 4.33. The cannon shoots
a ball straight ahead, giving it horizontal motion. At the same time, gravity pulls the ball down toward the ground.

4.19 Orbital Motion

• Deﬁne orbital motion and explain why it occurs.
• Describe the orbits of Earth around the sun and the moon around Earth.

As you can see in this NASA photo, Earth is tiny compared with the massive sun. The sun’s gravity is relatively
strong because the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to their masses. Gravity between the
sun and Earth pulls Earth toward the sun, but Earth never falls into the sun. Instead, it constantly revolves around
the sun, making one complete revolution every 365 days.
Q: Why doesn’t the sun’s gravity pull Earth down to the surface of the sun?
A: Earth has enough forward velocity to partly counter the force of the sun’s gravity.

What Is Orbital Motion?

Earth and many other bodies—including asteroids, comets, and the other planets—move around the sun in curved
paths called orbits. Generally, the orbits are elliptical, or oval, in shape. You can see the shape of Earth’s orbit in the
Figure 4.34. Because of the sun’s relatively strong gravity, Earth and the other bodies constantly fall toward the sun,
but they stay far enough away from the sun because of their forward velocity to fall around the sun instead of into
it. As a result, they keep orbiting the sun and never crash to its surface. The motion of Earth and the other bodies
around the sun is called orbital motion. Orbital motion occurs whenever an object is moving forward and at the
same time is pulled by gravity toward another object. You can explore orbital motion and gravity in depth with the
animation at this URL:

Orbital Motion of the Moon

Just as Earth orbits the sun, the moon also orbits Earth. The moon is affected by Earth’s gravity more than it is by
the gravity of the sun because the moon is much closer to Earth. The gravity between Earth and the moon pulls
the moon toward Earth. At the same time, the moon has forward velocity that partly counters the force of Earth’s
gravity. So the moon orbits Earth instead of falling down to the surface of the planet.
The Figure 4.35 shows the forces involved in the moon’s orbital motion around Earth. In the diagram, v represents
the forward velocity of the moon, and a represents the acceleration due to gravity between Earth and the moon. The
line encircling Earth shows the moon’s actual orbit, which results from the combination of v and a. You can see an

Summary

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

• Orbital motion occurs whenever an object is moving forward and at the same time is pulled by gravity toward

another object.

• The forward velocity of the object combines with acceleration due to gravity toward the other object. The

result is a circular or oval path called an orbit, in which one object keeps moving around the other.

• Because of the relatively great gravity of the sun, Earth orbits the sun. The moon orbits Earth rather than the

sun because it is much closer to Earth.

4.20 Elastic Force

• Deﬁne elasticity and elastic force.
• Give examples of the use of elastic force.

What will happen to this bungee jumper when he reaches the end of the bungee cord? He won’t come to an abrupt
stop. If he did, he might be seriously hurt. Instead, the cord will stretch while slowing his fall.
Q: What will happen next?
A: The cord will only stretch so far, and then it will snap back to its original shape, causing the jumper to bounce
back up. Bungee cords are useful for this purpose because they are elastic.

Elasticity and Elastic Force

Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called
elasticity. As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts
a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force. The farther the material is stretched or
compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic
force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaICwFMHcaY
Q: What force stretches the bungee cord after the jumper jumps? When does the bungee cord snap back to its
original shape?
A: After the bungee jumper jumps, he accelerates toward the ground due to gravity. His weight stretches the bungee
cord. As the bungee cord stretches, it exerts elastic force upward against the jumper, which slows his descent and
brings him to a momentary stop. Then the bungee cord springs back to its original shape, and the jumper bounces
upward.

Using Elastic Force

Elastic force can be very useful and not just for bungee jumping. In fact, you probably use elastic force every day.
A few common uses of elastic force are shown in the Figure 4.36. Do you use elastic force in any of these ways?

Q: How does the resistance band work? How does it use elastic force?

635

4.20. Elastic Force

www.ck12.org

A: When you pull on the band, it stretches but doesn’t break. The resistance you feel when you pull on it is elastic
force. The farther you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is. The resistance of the band to stretching is what
gives your muscles a workout. After you stop pulling on the band, it returns to its original shape, ready for the next
stretch.
Springs like the spring toy pictured in the Figure 4.37 also have elastic force when they are stretched or compressed.
And like stretchy materials, they return to their original shape when the stretching or compressing force is released.
Springs are used in scales to measure weight. They also cushion the ride in a car.

FIGURE 4.37

Q: Can you think of other uses of springs?
A: Bedsprings provide springy support beneath a mattress. The spring in a door closer pulls the door shut. The
spring in a retractable ballpoint pen retracts the point of the pen. The spring in a pogo stick bounces the rider up off
the ground.

Summary

• Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. When
an elastic material is stretched or compressed, it exerts elastic force. This force increases the more the material
is stretched or compressed.

• Elastic force has many uses, from hair scrunchies to bed springs.

4.21 Newton’s First Law

• Use skateboarding to explain Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion.

There’s no doubt from Corey’s face that he loves skateboarding! Corey and his friends visit Newton’s Skate Park
every chance they get. They may not know it, but while they’re having fun on their skateboards, they’re actually
applying science concepts such as forces and motion.

Starting and Stopping

Did you ever ride a skateboard? Even if you didn’t, you probably know that to start a skateboard rolling over a level
surface, you need to push off with one foot against the ground. That’s what Corey’s friend Nina is doing in this
picture 4.38.
Do you know how to stop a skateboard once it starts rolling? Look how Nina’s friend Laura does it in the Figure
4.39. She steps down on the back of the skateboard so it scrapes on the pavement. This creates friction, which stops
the skateboard.
Even if Laura didn’t try to stop the skateboard, it would stop sooner or later. That’s because there’s also friction
between the wheels and the pavement. Friction is a force that counters all kinds of motion. It occurs whenever two
surfaces come into contact.

Laws of the Park: Newton’s First Law

If you understand how a skateboard starts and stops, then you already know something about Newton’s ﬁrst law of
motion. This law was developed by English scientist Isaac Newton around 1700. Newton was one of the greatest
scientists of all time. He developed three laws of motion and the law of gravity, among many other contributions.
Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will stay in
motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force. Without an unbalanced force, a moving object will not only
keep moving, but its speed and direction will also remain the same. Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion is often called the
law of inertia because inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion. If an object is already at
rest, inertia will keep it at rest. If an object is already in motion, inertia will keep it moving.

Do You Get It?

Q: How does Nina use Newton’s ﬁrst law to start her skateboard rolling?
A: The skateboard won’t move unless Nina pushes off from the pavement with one foot. The force she applies when
she pushes off is stronger than the force of friction that opposes the skateboard’s motion. As a result, the force on
the skateboard is unbalanced, and the skateboard moves forward.
Q: How does Nina use Newton’s ﬁrst law to stop her skateboard?
A: Once the skateboard starts moving, it would keep moving at the same speed and in the same direction if not for
another unbalanced force. That force is friction between the skateboard and the pavement. The force of friction
is unbalanced because Nina is no longer pushing with her foot to keep the skateboard moving. That’s why the
skateboard stops.

Changing Direction

Corey’s friend Jerod likes to skate on the ﬂat banks at Newton’s Skate Park. That’s Jerod in the Figure 4.40. As he
reaches the top of a bank, he turns his skateboard to go back down. To change direction, he presses down with his
heels on one edge of the skateboard. This causes the skateboard to turn in the opposite direction.

Q: How does Jerod use Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion to change the direction of his skateboard?
A: Pressing down on just one side of a skateboard creates an unbalanced force. The unbalanced force causes the
skateboard to turn toward the other side. In the picture, Jerod is pressing down with his heels, so the skateboard
turns toward his toes.

Summary

• Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain

in motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.

• Using unbalanced forces to control the motion of a skateboard demonstrates Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion.

4.22 Inertia

• Deﬁne inertia.
• Describe how inertia affects motion.
• State the relationship between inertia and mass.
• Explain how to overcome inertia.

At Newton’s Skate Park, Lauren is pushing her twin cousins, Jonathan and Cody, on her skateboard. She has to push
hard to get the skateboard started, but once it begins moving, it takes much less effort to keep it rolling over the
smooth, ﬂat pavement. In fact, if Lauren tries to stop the rolling skateboard, it may take as much effort to stop it as
it did to start it rolling in the ﬁrst place.
Q: Why is it harder to start and stop the skateboard than it is to keep it rolling?
A: The reason is inertia.

What Is Inertia?

Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion. All objects have inertia, whether they are
stationary or moving. Inertia explains Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion, which states that an object at rest will remain at
rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force. That’s why Newton’s
ﬁrst law of motion is sometimes called the law of inertia. You can see an animation of inertia at this URL:
http://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/newtlaws/cci.cfm
Q: You probably don’t realize it, but you experience inertia all the time, and you don’t have to ride a skateboard. For
example, think about what happens when you are riding in a car that stops suddenly. Your body moves forward on
the seat and strains against the seat belt. Why does this happen?
A: The brakes stop the car but not your body, so your body keeps moving forward because of inertia.

643

4.22. Inertia

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 4.42
Inertia explains why it’s important to always wear a seat belt.

Inertia and Mass

The inertia of an object depends on its mass. Objects with greater mass also have greater inertia. It would be easier
for Lauren to push just one of her cousins on her skateboard than both of them. With just one twin, there would be
only about half as much mass on the skateboard, so there would be less inertia to overcome.

Overcoming Inertia

To change the motion of an object, inertia must be overcome by an unbalanced force acting on the object. The
unbalanced force that starts Lauren’s cousins rolling along on the skateboard is applied by Lauren when she gives
it a push. Once an object starts moving, inertia keeps it moving without any additional force being applied. In fact,
it won’t stop moving unless another unbalanced force opposes its motion. For example, Lauren can stop the rolling
skateboard by moving to the other end and pushing in the opposite direction.
Q: What if Lauren didn’t stop the skateboard in this way? If it remained on a smooth, ﬂat surface, would it just keep
rolling forever?
A: The inertia of the moving skateboard would keep it rolling forever if no other unbalanced force opposed its
motion. However, another unbalanced force does act on the skateboard
Q: What other force is acting on the skateboard?
A: The other force is rolling friction between the skateboard’s wheels and the ground. The force of friction opposes
the motion of the rolling skateboard and would eventually bring it to a stop without any help from Lauren. Friction
opposes the motion of all moving objects, so—like the skateboard—all moving objects eventually stop moving even
if no other forces oppose their motion.
Later that day, Jonathan rode his skateboard and did some jumps. You can see him in the picture 4.43. When he’s in
the air, there is no rolling friction between his wheels and the ground, but another unbalanced force is acting on the
skateboard and changing its motion.
Q: What force is acting on the skateboard when it is in the air above the ground? And how will this force change the
skateboard’s motion?
A: The force of gravity is acting on the skateboard. It will pull the skateboard back down to the ground. Once it’s
on the ground, friction will slow its motion.

4.23 Newton’s Second Law

• State Newton’s second law of motion.
• Compare and contrast the effects of force and mass on acceleration.

These boys are racing around the track at Newton’s Skate Park. The boy who can increase his speed the most will
win the race. Tony, who is closest to the camera in this picture, is bigger and stronger than the other two boys, so he
can apply greater force to his skates.
Q: Does this mean that Tony will win the race?
A: Not necessarily, because force isn’t the only factor that affects acceleration.

Force, Mass, and Acceleration

Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration occurs whenever an
unbalanced force acts on an object. Two factors affect the acceleration of an object: the net force acting on the object
and the object’s mass. Newton’s second law of motion describes how force and mass affect acceleration. The law
states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the object’s mass. This
can be represented by the equation:
Acceleration = Net force
Mass
or a = F
m
Q: While Tony races along on his rollerblades, what net force is acting on the skates?

647

4.23. Newton’s Second Law

www.ck12.org

A: Tony exerts a backward force against the ground, as you can see in the Figure 4.45, ﬁrst with one skate and then
with the other. This force pushes him forward. Although friction partly counters the forward motion of the skates, it
is weaker than the force Tony exerts. Therefore, there is a net forward force on the skates.

FIGURE 4.45

Direct and Inverse Relationships

Newton’s second law shows that there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration. The greater the force
that is applied to an object of a given mass, the more the object will accelerate. For example, doubling the force on
the object doubles its acceleration.
The relationship between mass and acceleration is different. It is an inverse relationship. In an inverse relationship,
when one variable increases, the other variable decreases. The greater the mass of an object, the less it will accelerate
when a given force is applied. For example, doubling the mass of an object results in only half as much acceleration
for the same amount of force.
Q: Tony has greater mass than the other two boys he is racing (pictured in the opening image). How will this affect
his acceleration around the track?
A: Tony’s greater mass will result in less acceleration for the same amount of force.

Summary

• Newton’s second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the

object divided by the object’s mass.

• According to the second law, there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration and an inverse

relationship between mass and acceleration.

Xander goes airborne on his scooter as he exits a half-pipe at Newton’s Skate Park. How did he gain enough speed in
the half-pipe to ﬂy into the air when he got to the top? His increase in speed was due partly to the force of gravity.

Acceleration, Force, and Mass

A change in an object’s motion—such as Xander speeding up on his scooter—is called acceleration. Acceleration
occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force. The greater the net force acting on the object, the
greater its acceleration will be, but the mass of the object also affects its acceleration. The smaller its mass is, the
greater its acceleration for a given amount of force. Newton’s second law of motion summarizes these relationships.
According to this law, the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on it divided by its mass. This can be
represented by the equation:
Acceleration = Net force

Mass or a = F
m

www.ck12.org

Calculating Acceleration

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

m = 25 N

50 kg = 0.5 N
kg

This equation for acceleration can be used to calculate the acceleration of an object that is acted on by a net force. For
example, Xander and his scooter have a total mass of 50 kilograms. Assume that the net force acting on Xander and
the scooter is 25 Newtons. What is his acceleration? Substitute the relevant values into the equation for acceleration:
a = F
The Newton is the SI unit for force. It is deﬁned as the force needed to cause a 1-kilogram mass to accelerate at 1
m/s2. Therefore, force can also be expressed in the unit kg • m/s2. This way of expressing force can be substituted
for Newtons in Xander’s acceleration so the answer is expressed in the SI unit for acceleration, which is m/s2:
a = 0.5 N
Q: Why are there no kilograms in the ﬁnal answer to this problem?
A: The kilogram units in the numerator and denominator of the fraction cancel out. As a result, the answer is
expressed in the correct SI units for acceleration.

= 0.5 m/s2

kg =

0.5 kg·m/s2

kg

Calculating Force

It’s often easier to measure the mass and acceleration of an object than the net force acting on it. Mass can be
measured with a balance, and average acceleration can be calculated from velocity and time. However, net force
may be a combination of many unseen forces, such as gravity, friction with surfaces, and air resistance. Therefore, it
may be more useful to know how to calculate the net force acting on an object from its mass and acceleration. The
equation for acceleration above can be rewritten to solve for net force as:
Net Force = Mass × Acceleration, or
F = m × a
Look at Xander in the Figure 4.46. He’s riding his scooter down a ramp. Assume that his acceleration is 0.8 m/s2.
How much force does it take for him to accelerate at this rate? Substitute the relevant values into the equation for
force to ﬁnd the answer:
F = m × a = 50 kg × 0.8 m/s2 = 40 kg • m/s2, or 40 N

4.25 Mass vs Weight

• Deﬁne weight.
• Show how to calculate the weight of an object from its mass.

This is Sam at Newton’s Skate Park. He’s standing on the back end of his skateboard to keep it from tipping over the
edge of a half-pipe. The force of his weight pressing down on the skateboard prevents gravity from pulling it over
the edge and down the side of the half-pipe.

Weight, Mass, and Acceleration

Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object. It depends on the object’s mass, which is how
much matter the object contains. It also depends on the downward acceleration of the object due to gravity, which is
the same all over Earth. Weight can be represented by the equation:
F = m × a
This is the general equation that relates force to mass and acceleration. When it relates weight to mass and
acceleration, the letter F represents the object’s weight in Newtons (N), which is the SI unit for weight. The letter
m in the equation represents the object’s mass in kilograms, and the letter a represents the downward acceleration
due to gravity. As this equation shows, weight is directly related to mass. As an object’s mass increases, so does

653

4.25. Mass vs Weight

its weight. For example, if mass doubles, weight doubles as well. You can learn more about weight, mass, and
acceleration at this URL:
http://www.nasa.gov/mov/192448main_018_force_equals_mass_time.mov

Calculating Weight

All objects on Earth accelerate downward due to gravity at a rate of 9.8 m/s2. Therefore, if you know the mass of an
object, you can calculate its weight using this equation:
F = m × 9.8 m/s2
Q: Sam has a mass of 50 kilograms. What is his weight in Newtons?
A: You can calculate Sam’s weight in Newtons by substituting his mass in kilograms into the weight formula:
F = m × 9.8 m/s2 = 50 kg × 9.8 m/s2 = 490 kg *bull; m/s2, or 490 N
You’re probably more familiar with weight in pounds (lb) than in Newtons. One Newton equals 0.225 pounds. In
other words, there are 0.225 pounds per Newton. You can use this ratio to convert Newtons to pounds.
Q: What is Sam’s weight in pounds?
A: In pounds, Sam’s weight is 490 N x 0.225 lb/N = 110 lb.

Summary

• Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object. It depends on the object’s mass and the
acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.8 m/s2 on Earth.
• The formula for calculating weight is F = m × 9.8 m/s2, where F is the object’s weight in Newtons (N) and m
is the object’s mass in kilograms. The Newton is the SI unit for weight, and 1 Newton equals 0.225 pounds.

4.26 Newton’s Third Law

• State Newton’s Third Law of Motion.
• Describe action and reaction forces.
• Explain why action and reaction forces are not balanced forces.

This is a sketch of Jerod on his skateboard. He’s on his way to Newton’s Skate Park. When he pushes his foot against
the ground, what happens next? He moves on his skateboard in the opposite direction. How does this happen?

Action and Reaction

Newton’s third law of motion explains how Jerod starts his skateboard moving. This law states that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always act in pairs. First an action occurs—Jerod pushes
against the ground with his foot. Then a reaction occurs—Jerod moves forward on his skateboard. The reaction is
always equal in strength to the action but in the opposite direction.
Q: If Jerod pushes against the ground with greater force, how will this affect his forward motion?
A: His action force will be greater, so the reaction force will be greater as well. Jerod will be pushed forward with
more force, and this will make him go faster and farther.

Equal and Opposite Forces

The forces involved in actions and reactions can be represented with arrows. The way an arrow points shows the
direction of the force, and the size of the arrow represents the strength of the force. Look at the skateboarders in the
Figure 4.49. In the top row, the arrows represent the forces with which the skateboarders push against each other.
This is the action. In the bottom row, the arrows represent the forces with which the skateboarders move apart. This

656

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

is the reaction. Compare the top and bottom arrows. They point in different directions, but they are the same size.
This shows that the reaction forces are equal and opposite to the action forces.

FIGURE 4.49

Equal and Opposite but Not Balanced

Because action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, you might think they would cancel out, as balanced forces
do. But you would be wrong. Balanced forces are equal and opposite forces that act on the same object. That’s
why they cancel out. Action-reaction forces are equal and opposite forces that act on different objects, so they don’t
cancel out. In fact, they often result in motion. Think about Jerod again. He applies force with his foot to the ground,
whereas the ground applies force to Jerod and the skateboard, causing them to move forward.
Q: Actions and reactions occur all the time. Can you think of an example in your daily life?
A: Here’s one example. If you lean on something like a wall or your locker, you are applying force to it. The wall or
locker applies an equal and opposite force to you. If it didn’t, you would go right through it or else it would tip over.

• Newton’s third law of motion states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This means that

forces always act in pairs.

• Action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, but they are not balanced forces because they act on different

objects so they don’t cancel out.

4.27 Momentum

• Deﬁne momentum.
• Relate momentum to mass and velocity.
• Calculate momentum from mass and velocity.

Cody seems a little reluctant to launch himself down this ramp at Newton’s Skate Park. It will be his ﬁrst time down
the ramp, and he knows from watching his older brother Jerod that he’ll be moving fast by the time he gets to the
bottom. The faster he goes, the harder it will be to stop. That’s because of momentum.

What Is Momentum?

Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop. The more mass it has or the faster it’s
moving, the greater its momentum. Momentum equals mass times velocity and is represented by the equation:
Momentum = Mass × Velocity
Q: What is Cody’s momentum as he stands at the top of the ramp?
A: Cody has no momentum as he stands there because he isn’t moving. In other words, his velocity is zero. However,
Cody will gain momentum as he starts moving down the ramp and picks up speed.
Q: Cody’s older brother Jerod is pictured in the Figure 4.50. If Jerod were to travel down the ramp at the same
velocity as Cody, who would have greater momentum? Who would be harder to stop?

659

4.27. Momentum

A: Jerod obviously has greater mass than Cody, so he would have greater momentum. He would also be harder to
stop.

Calculating Momentum

To calculate momentum with the equation above, mass is measured in (kg), and velocity is measured in meters per
second (m/s). For example, Cody and his skateboard have a combined mass of 40 kg. If Cody is traveling at a
velocity of 1.1 m/s by the time he reaches the bottom of the ramp, then his momentum is:
Momentum = 40 kg × 1.1 m/s = 44 kg • m/s
Note that the SI unit for momentum is kg • m/s.
Q: The combined mass of Jerod and his skateboard is 68 kg. If Jerod goes down the ramp at the same velocity as
Cody, what is his momentum at the bottom of the ramp?
A: His momentum is:
Momentum = 68 kg × 1.1 m/s = 75 kg • m/s

Summary

• Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop. It equals the object’s mass times its

velocity.

• To calculate the momentum of a moving object, multiply its mass in kilograms (kg) by its velocity in meters

per second (m/s). The SI unit of momentum is kg • m/s.

4.28 Law of Conservation of Momentum

• State the law of conservation of momentum.
• Describe an example of momentum being transferred and conserved.

These skaters are racing each other at Newton’s Skate Park. The ﬁrst skater in line, the one on the left, is distracted
by something he sees. He starts to slow down without realizing it. The skater behind him isn’t paying attention and
keeps skating at the same speed.
Q: Can you guess what happens next?
A: Skater 2 runs into skater 1.

Conserving Momentum

When skater 2 runs into skater 1, he’s going faster than skater 1 so he has more momentum. Momentum is a
property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop. It’s a product of the object’s mass and velocity. At the
moment of the collision, skater 2 transfers some of his momentum to skater 1, who shoots forward when skater 2
runs into him. Whenever an action and reaction such as this occur, momentum is transferred from one object to the
other. However, the combined momentum of the objects remains the same. In other words, momentum is conserved.
This is the law of conservation of momentum.

Modeling Momentum

The Figure 4.51 shows how momentum is conserved in the two colliding skaters. The total momentum is the same
after the collision as it was before. However, after the collision, skater 1 has more momentum and skater 2 has less

momentum than before.

4.29 Pressure in Fluids

• Explain why ﬂuids exert pressure.
• Relate pressure to force and area.
• Identify the SI unit for pressure.
• Show how to calculate pressure.
• Name factors that affect ﬂuid pressure.

Did you ever use a bicycle pump like the one seen in the opening image? When you push down on the handle, it
forces air out through the hose, and the air enters the tire through a tiny opening. Like other ﬂuids (liquids and
gases), air can ﬂow and take the shape of its container. The air that enters the tire from the pump quickly spreads out
to ﬁll the entire tire evenly. As the tire ﬁlls with air, it feels ﬁrmer. That’s because the air exerts pressure against the
inside surface of the tire.

Why Fluids Exert Pressure

All ﬂuids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of ﬂuids are constantly moving in all directions
at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These
collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together
in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles ﬁrst entering a tire, they quickly spread out to ﬁll all the
available space. That’s because particles of ﬂuids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower
pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly ﬁlls the entire tire.

665

4.29. Pressure in Fluids

Pressure, Force, and Area

www.ck12.org

Pressure is deﬁned as the amount of force acting on a given area. Therefore, pressure can be represented by this
equation:
Pressure = Force
Area
Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area. The smaller the area to which force is applied, the
greater the pressure is. Think about pressing a pushpin, like the one in the Figure 4.53, into a bulletin board. You
apply force with your thumb to the broad head of the pushpin. However, the force that the pushpin applies to the
bulletin board acts only over the tiny point of the pin. This is a much smaller area, so the pressure the point applies
to the bulletin board is much greater than the pressure you apply with your thumb. As a result, the pin penetrates the
bulletin board with ease.

FIGURE 4.53

SI Unit for Pressure

In the above equation for pressure, force is expressed in Newtons (N) and area is expressed in square meters (m2).
Therefore, pressure is expressed in N/m2, which is the SI unit for pressure. This unit is also called the Pascal (Pa).
It is named for the scientist Blaise Pascal whose discoveries about pressure in ﬂuids led to a law of the same name.
Pressure may also be expressed in the kilopascal (kPa), which equals 1000 Pascals. For example, the correct air
pressure inside a mountain bike tire is usually about 200 kPa.

Calculating Pressure or Force

0.5 m2 = 10000 N/m2 = 10000 Pa, or 10 kPa

When you know how much force is acting on a given area, you can calculate the pressure that is being applied to the
area using the equation for pressure given above. For example, assume that a rock weighs 5000 N and is resting on
the ground on an area of 0.5 m2. The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is:
Pressure = 5000 N
Sometimes pressure but not force is known. To calculate force, the equation for pressure can be rewritten as:
Force = Pressure × Area
For example, suppose another rock exerts 10 kPa of pressure over an area of 0.4 m2. How much does the rock
weigh? Change 10 kPa (10,000 Pa) to 10,000 N/m2. Then substitute this value for pressure in the force equation as
follows:
Force (Weight) = 10,000 N/m2 × 0.4 m2 = 4,000 N
Q: The break-dancer in the Figure 4.54 has a weight of 800 N. He is balancing on the palm of one hand. If the palm
of his hand has an area of 0.02 m2, how much pressure is he exerting on the ground?
A: Use the equation for pressure:
Pressure = 800 N

0.02 m2 = 40000 Pa, or 40 kPa

FIGURE 4.54

Q: If the break-dancer lies down on the ground on his back, his weight is spread over an area of 0.75 m2. How much
pressure does he exert on the ground in this position?
A: On his back, the pressure he exerts is:
Pressure = 800 N
0.75 m2 = 1100 Pa, or 1.1 kPa

Factors That Affect Fluid Pressure

Two factors inﬂuence the pressure of ﬂuids. They are the depth of the ﬂuid and its density.

• A ﬂuid exerts more pressure at greater depths. Deeper in a ﬂuid, all of the ﬂuid above it results in more weight
pressing down. This causes greater pressure the deeper you go. You can watch a video demonstration of depth
and ﬂuid pressure at this URL:

• Denser ﬂuids such as water exert more pressure than less dense ﬂuids such as air. The particles of denser ﬂuids
are closer together, so there are more collisions of particles in a given area. The difference in density of water
and air is illustrated in the Figure 4.55.

4.30 Oceanic Pressure

• Explain how and why water pressure changes with depth in the ocean.
• Describe how water pressure affects ocean exploration.

In 2012, the ﬁlm director James Cameron, who directed the ﬁlm Titanic, made headlines when he traveled to
Challenger Deep. This is the deepest known point on the ocean ﬂoor, almost 11,000 meters below the surface.
Cameron was the ﬁrst person to travel there alone, and he made the trip in a deep-sea diving vehicle named Deepsea
Challenger. The vehicle pictured above is another deep-sea diving vehicle, named Alvin. Alvin is no longer used for
ocean exploration, but by the time it was retired, it had made thousands of dives. Alvin was even used to explore the
Titanic on the North Atlantic Ocean ﬂoor.
Q: Why must divers use special diving machines such as Alvin and Deepsea Challenger to go deep below the surface
of the ocean? Why can’t they just use scuba diving gear?
A: The pressure of the water is too great that far below the surface. It would crush divers long before they could
reach the bottom.

Water Pressure and Depth

Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area. As you go deeper in the ocean, the pressure exerted by the
water increases steadily. That’s because there is more and more water pressing down on you from above. The Figure
4.56 shows how pressure changes with depth. For each additional meter below the surface, pressure increases by
10 kPa. At 30 meters below the surface, the pressure is double the pressure at the surface. At a depth greater than
500 meters, the pressure is too great for humans to withstand without special equipment to protect them. At nearly

669

11,000 meters below the surface, the pressure is tremendous. You can see a video showing changes in water pressure

FIGURE 4.56

Adjusting to Changing Pressure

Scuba divers can dive without special vehicles because they don’t go very deep below the surface of the water.
Nonetheless, because of the pressure of the water, scuba divers who go deeper than about 40 meters must return to
the surface slowly. They must stop for several minutes at one or more points in their ascent. That’s what the divers in
the Figure 4.57 are doing. The stops are needed to let the pressure inside their body adjust to the decreasing pressure
of the water as they swim closer to the surface. If they were to rise to the surface too quickly, the gases dissolved in
their blood would form bubbles and cause serious health problems.
Q: Why would dissolved gases form bubbles as pressure decreases?
A: Less gas can dissolve in a ﬂuid at lower pressure. Therefore, as pressure decreases, gases come out of solution
and form bubbles.

Summary

• As you go deeper in the ocean, the pressure exerted by the water increases. For each additional meter below

the surface, pressure increases by 10 kPa.

4.31 Air Pressure and Altitude

• Explain how and why the pressure of the atmosphere changes with increasing altitude.
• Describe some ways that we use air pressure.

Rays of sunlight pour into this old room and reﬂect off dust particles in the air. Did you ever see dust particles in the
air like these? If so, you may have noticed that they constantly move about at random.
Q: Why do dust particles move randomly in the air?
A: Invisible particles of gases in the air are constantly moving and bumping into them.

Pressure of Gas Particles

Because gas particles in the air—like particles of all ﬂuids—are constantly moving and bumping into things, they
exert pressure. The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greater close to Earth’s surface and decreases as
you go higher above the surface. You can see this in the Figure 5.70.
Q: Denver, Colorado, is called the “mile-high city” because it is located 1 mile (1.6 km) above sea level. What is the
average atmospheric pressure that high above sea level?
A: From the Figure 5.70, the average atmospheric pressure 1.6 km above sea level is about 85 kPa.

Explaining Changes in Air Pressure with Altitude

There are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases: density and depth of the atmosphere.

• Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity, so gas particles are denser
near the surface. With more gas particles in a given volume, there are more collisions of particles and therefore
greater pressure.

672

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

FIGURE 4.58

• The depth (distance from top to bottom) of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases at higher
altitudes. With greater depth of the atmosphere, more air is pressing down from above. Therefore, air pressure
is greatest at sea level and falls with increasing altitude. On top of Mount Everest, which is the tallest mountain
on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level.

How We Use Air Pressure

The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows us to do many things, from sipping through a straw to simply breathing.
You can see in the Figures 4.59 and 4.60 how we use air pressure in both of these ways.

FIGURE 4.59
When you ﬁrst suck on a straw, you remove air from the straw, so the air
pressure in the straw is lower that the air pressure on the surface of the
drink. A ﬂuid always ﬂows from an area of higher pressure to an area of
lower pressure, so the drink moves up the straw and into your mouth.

Did you ever watch someone make balloon animals like this turkey? When you blow up a balloon, you force air
inside the balloon through a small opening. The air spreads out and presses against the inside of the balloon, forcing
it to expand. Pressure always spreads throughout a contained ﬂuid like air in a balloon.

Pressure and Force

Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area. It is represented by the equation:
Pressure = Force
Area
The pressure exerted by a ﬂuid increases if more force is applied or if the same force is applied over a smaller area.
The equation for pressure can be rewritten as:
Force = Pressure × Area
This equation shows that the same pressure applied to a greater area increases the force.

Pascal and His Law

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

Some of the earliest scientiﬁc research on pressure in ﬂuids was conducted by a French mathematician and physicist
named Blaise Pascal (1623–1662). The SI unit of pressure, the Pascal (Pa), is named for him because of his important
research. One of Pascal’s major contributions is known as Pascal’s law. This law states that a change in pressure at
any point in an enclosed ﬂuid is transmitted equally throughout the ﬂuid. To see a video about Pascal’s law, go to

A Simple Example

A simple example may help you understand Pascal’s law. Toothpaste is a ﬂuid that is enclosed in a tube with a small
opening at one end. Look at the toothpaste tube in the Figure 4.61. When any part of the tube is squeezed, toothpaste
squirts out the open end. The pressure applied to the tube is transmitted equally throughout the toothpaste. When
the pressure reaches the open end, it forces toothpaste out through the opening.

FIGURE 4.61

Using Fluid Pressure

The ability of ﬂuids to transmit pressure in this way can be very useful—besides getting toothpaste out of a tube!
For example, hydraulic brakes in a car use ﬂuid to transmit pressure, and when they do, they also increase force.
You can see how hydraulic brakes work in the Figure 4.62.
Q: In this diagram, how can you tell that the force applied by the brake cylinder is greater than the force applied by
the brake pedal mechanism?
A: The arrows representing the force applied by the break cylinder are larger than the arrow representing the force
applied by the brake pedal mechanism. A larger arrow indicates greater force.
Q: How do hydraulic brakes increase the force that is applied to the brake shoes?

Hydraulic Brakes

A: The pressure exerted by the ﬂuid on the brake shoes is applied over a larger area. When pressure acts over a larger
area, it increases the force (Force = Pressure × Area).
Hydraulic car lifts also use ﬂuid to transmit pressure and increase force. The lifts are used to raise cars, which are
very heavy, so mechanics can work on them from underneath. Controls in airplanes use ﬂuids to transmit pressure
and increase force so a ﬂick of a switch can raise or lower heavy landing gear. To see animations of hydraulic

• State Bernoulli’s law.
• Relate Bernoulli’s law to ﬂight.

Look at the large bar (labeled “TELMEX”) across the back of this racecar. The bar is called a spoiler. It causes air
pressure to push the car toward the ground. This increases friction between the wheels and the pavement, helping
the car to hug the track. How does a spoiler work? Bernoulli’s law has the answer.

What Is Bernoulli’s Law?

Bernoulli’s law states that the pressure of a moving ﬂuid such as air is less when the ﬂuid is moving faster. Pressure
is the amount of force applied per given area. The law is named for Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician who
discovered it during the 1700s. Bernoulli used mathematics to arrive at his law. For an animation of the law, go to

Using Air Pressure to Fly

Did you ever wonder how the wings of airplanes or birds allow them to ﬂy? Bernoulli’s law provides the answer.
Look at the wings of the plane and hawk in the Figure 4.64. The shape of the wings causes air to ﬂow more slowly
below them than above them. This causes air pressure to be greater below the wings than above them. The difference
in air pressure lifts the plane or bird above the ground.
Q: How does a spoiler on a racecar use Bernoulli’s law?
A: A spoiler on a racecar is like an upside-down wing. Its shape causes air to ﬂow more slowly—and air pressure to
be greater—above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, helping it to stay on
the track.

4.34 Buoyancy

• Deﬁne buoyant force.
• Explain how weight and buoyant force determine whether an object ﬂoats.
• Relate the density of an object to its ability to ﬂoat.

What could be more refreshing than ﬂoating in cool water on a hot summer day? Water and other ﬂuids have a
special force that allows people and things to ﬂoat in them. The force is called buoyant force.

What Is Buoyant Force?

Buoyant force is an upward force that ﬂuids exert on any object that is placed in them. The ability of ﬂuids to exert
this force is called buoyancy. What explains buoyant force? A ﬂuid exerts pressure in all directions, but the pressure
is greater at greater depth. Therefore, the ﬂuid below an object, where the ﬂuid is deeper, exerts greater pressure on
the object than the ﬂuid above it. You can see in the Figure 4.65 how this works. Buoyant force explains why the
girl pictured above can ﬂoat in water.
Q: You’ve probably noticed that some things don’t ﬂoat in water. For example, if you drop a stone in water, it will
sink to the bottom rather than ﬂoating. If buoyant force applies to all objects in ﬂuids, why do some objects sink
instead of ﬂoat?
A: The answer has to do with their weight.

Weight and Buoyant Force

Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object, whereas buoyant force pushes up on an object.
Which force is greater determines whether an object sinks or ﬂoats. Look at the Figure 4.66. On the left, the object’s

682

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

FIGURE 4.65

FIGURE 4.66

683

4.34. Buoyancy

www.ck12.org

weight is the same as the buoyant force acting on it, so the object ﬂoats. On the right, the object’s weight is greater
than the buoyant force acting on it, so the object sinks.
Because of buoyant force, objects seem lighter in water. You may have noticed this when you went swimming and
could easily pick up a friend or sibling under the water. Some of the person’s weight was countered by the buoyant
force of the water.

Density and Buoyant Force

Density, or the amount of mass in a given volume, is also related to the ability of an object to ﬂoat. That’s because
density affects weight. A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense
substance. For example, ice is less dense than liquid water. This explains why the giant ice berg in the Figure 4.67
is ﬂoating in the ocean. You can see other examples of density and buoyant force at this URL:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDSYXmvjg6M

FIGURE 4.67

Q: Can you think of more examples of substances that ﬂoat in a ﬂuid because they are low in density?
A: Oil is less dense than water, so oil from a spill ﬂoats on ocean water. Helium is less dense than air, so balloons
ﬁlled with helium ﬂoat in air.

Summary

• Buoyant force is an upward force that ﬂuids exert on any object that is placed in them. Buoyant force occurs

because the ﬂuid below an object exerts greater pressure on the object than the ﬂuid above it.

• If an object’s weight is less than the buoyant force acting on it, then the object ﬂoats. If an object’s weight is

greater than the buoyant force acting on it, then the object sinks.

• A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance. Therefore,

density of an object also affects whether it sinks or ﬂoats.

• Explain how a heavy object such as a big ship can ﬂoat in water.

Do you see the man sitting on top of this tanker truck? He gives you a sense of how big the truck is. What’s behind
the truck? Is it a huge apartment complex? It’s just as massive as a very large building, but it’s not even resting
on land. It’s a giant cruise ship, and it’s ﬂoating on water. The ship weighs about 100,000 metric tons. How can
such a tremendous weight ﬂoat on water? Why doesn’t it sink to the bottom of the ocean instead? Archimedes’ law
explains why.

Archimedes Takes a Bath

Did you ever notice when you get into a bathtub of water that the level of the water rises? More than 2000 years ago,
a Greek mathematician named Archimedes noticed the same thing. He observed that both a body and the water in a
tub can’t occupy the same space at the same time. As a result, some of the water is displaced, or moved out of the
way. How much water is displaced? Archimedes determined that the volume of displaced water equals the volume
of the submerged object. So more water is displaced by a bigger body than a smaller one.
Q: If you jump into swimming pool, how much water does your body displace?
A: The water displaced by your body is equal to your body’s volume. Depending on your size, this volume might be
about 0.07 m3.

Displacement and Buoyant Force

Objects such as ships may ﬂoat in a ﬂuid like water because of buoyant force. This is an upward force that a ﬂuid
exerts on any object that is placed in it. Archimedes discovered that the buoyant force acting on an object equals the

686

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

weight of the ﬂuid displaced by the object. This is known as Archimedes’ law (or Archimedes’ principle). For an

Floating Objects and Archimedes’ Law

Archimedes’ law explains why some objects ﬂoat in ﬂuids even though they are very heavy. It all depends on how
much ﬂuid they displace. The cruise ship pictured in the opening image is extremely heavy, yet it stays aﬂoat. If a
steel ball with the same weight as the ship were placed in water, it would sink to the bottom. This is modeled in the
Figure 4.68. The reason the ball sinks is that its shape is very compact, so it displaces relatively little water. The
volume of water displaced by the steel ball weighs less than the ball itself, so the buoyant force is not as great as the
force of gravity pulling down on the ball. Thus, the ball sinks.

FIGURE 4.68

Now look at the ship’s hull in the Figure 4.68. Its shape causes the ship to displace much more water than the ball.
In fact, the weight of the displaced water is greater than the weight of the ship. As a result, the buoyant force is
greater than the force of gravity acting on the ship, so the ship ﬂoats.
Q: Why might you be more likely to ﬂoat in water if you stretch out your body rather than curl up into a ball?

687

4.35. Archimedes’ Law

www.ck12.org

A: You would displace more water by stretching out your body, so there would be more buoyant force acting on it.
Therefore, you would be more likely to ﬂoat in this position.

Summary

• Archimedes determined that an object displaces the same volume of ﬂuid as its own volume.
• According to Archimedes’ law, the buoyant force acting on an object equals the weight of the ﬂuid that the

object displaces.

• The shape of an object may affect how much ﬂuid it displaces and therefore the buoyant force acting on it.
This explains why one object may sink while another object with the same weight but a different shape may
ﬂoat.

4.36 Work

• Deﬁne work.
• Relate work to force and distance.

The teens in the picture on the left are having fun playing basketball. The teen in the picture on the right is working
hard studying for an exam. It’s obvious who is doing work—or is it? Would it surprise you to learn that the teens
who are working are the ones who are having fun playing basketball, while the teen who is studying isn’t doing any
work at all? The reason why has to do with how work is deﬁned in physics.

Deﬁning Work

Work is deﬁned differently in physics than in everyday language. In physics, work means the use of force to move
an object. The teens who are playing basketball in the picture above are using force to move their bodies and the
basketball, so they are doing work. The teen who is studying isn’t moving anything, so she isn’t doing work. Not all
force that is used to move an object does work. For work to be done, the force must be applied in the same direction
that the object moves. If a force is applied in a different direction than the object moves, no work is done. The
Figure 4.69 illustrates this point.

A: Regardless of the weight of the box, the man does no work on it as he holds it while walking across the room.
However, he does more work when he ﬁrst lifts a heavier box to chest height.

Work, Force, and Distance

Work is directly related to both the force applied to an object and the distance the object moves. It can be represented
by the equation:
Work = Force × Distance
This equation shows that the greater the force that is used to move an object or the farther the object is moved, the
more work that is done. You can see a short video introduction to work as the product of force and distance at this

To see the effects of force and distance on work, compare the weight lifters in the Figure 4.70. The two weight
lifters on the left are lifting the same amount of weight, but the one on the bottom is lifting the weight a greater
distance. Therefore, this weight lifter is doing more work. The two weight lifters on the bottom right are both lifting
the weight the same distance, but the weight lifter on the left is lifting a heavier weight, so she is doing more work.

Clarissa is cutting the grass in her grandmother’s yard using an old-fashioned push mower. The mower has no motor,
so Clarissa is doing all the work. How much work does Clarissa do pushing the mower around the yard? The amount
of work depends on how much force she uses and how far she pushes the mower.

Work, Force, and Distance

Work is the use of force to move an object. It is directly related to both the force applied to the object and the
distance the object moves. Work can be calculated with this equation:
Work = Force x Distance.

How Much Work?

The equation for work can be used to calculate work if force and distance are known. To use the equation, force
is expressed in Newtons (N), and distance is expressed in meters (m). For example, assume that Clarissa uses 100
Newtons of force to push the mower and that she pushes it for a total of 200 meters as she cuts the grass in her
grandmother’s yard. Then, the amount of work Clarissa does is:

692

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

Work = 100 N × 200 m = 20,000 N • m
Notice that the unit for work in the answer is the Newton • meter (N • m). This is the SI unit for work, also called
the joule (J). One joule equals the amount of work that is done when 1 N of force moves an object over a distance
of 1 m.
Q: After Clarissa mows her grandmother’s lawn, she volunteers to mow a neighbor’s lawn as well. If she pushes the
mower with the same force as before and moves it over a total of 234 meters, how much work does she do mowing

A: The work Clarissa does can be calculated as:
Work = 100 N × 234 m = 23,400 N • m, or 23,400 J

• Identify the SI unit for power.
• Show how to calculate power from work and time.
• Describe the unit called the horsepower.

Did you ever sweep a ﬂoor with a broom, like the woman in the picture on the left? It can take a lot of effort to do
the job. But if you use an electric vacuum cleaner, like the woman in the picture on the right, you can do the same
work more easily and quickly. That’s because the vacuum cleaner provides more power.

What Is Power?

Power is a measure of the amount of work that can be done in a given amount of time. Power can be represented by
the equation:
Power = Work
Time
In this equation, work is measured in joules (J) and time is measured in seconds (s), so power is expressed in joules
per second (J/s). This is the SI unit for power, also known as the watt (W). A watt equals 1 joule of work per second.
You’re probably already familiar with watts. Light bulbs and small appliances such as microwave ovens are labeled
with the watts of power they provide. For example, the package of light bulbs in the Figure 4.72 is labeled “14
watts.”
Q: Assume you have two light bulbs of the same type, such as two compact ﬂuorescent light bulbs like the one
pictured in the Figure 4.72. If one light bulb is a 25-watt bulb and the other is a 60-watt bulb, which bulb produces
brighter light?
A: The 60-watt bulb is more powerful, so it produces brighter light.

695

4.38. Power

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 4.72

Compared with a less powerful device, a more powerful device can either do more work in the same time or do the
same work in less time. For example, compared with a low-power microwave oven, a high-power microwave oven
can cook more food in the same time or the same amount of food in less time.

Calculating Power from Work and Time

Time = 24000 J

30 s = 800 J/s, or 800 W

Power can be calculated using the formula above if the amount of work and time are known. For example, assume
that a microwave oven does 24,000 joules of work in 30 seconds. Then the power of the microwave is:
Power = Work
Q: Another microwave oven does 5,000 joules of work in 5 seconds. What is its power?
A: The power of the other microwave oven is:
Power = 5000 J
Q: Which microwave oven will heat the same amount of food in less time?
A: The 1000-watt microwave oven has more power, so it will heat the same amount of food in less time.

5 s = 1000 J/s, or 1000 W

Calculating Work from Power and Time

You can also calculate work if you know power and time by rewriting the power equation above as:
Work = Power × Time
For example, if you use a 1000-watt microwave oven for 20 seconds, how much work does it do? First express 1000
watts in J/s and then substitute this value for power the work equation:

696

Horsepower

Sometimes power is measured in a unit called the horsepower. For example, the power of car engines is usually
expressed in horsepowers. One horsepower is the amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute. It equals 745 watts of
power. Compare the horsepowers in the Figure 4.73 to the other Figure 4.74.

This team of three horses provides 3 horsepowers of power.

FIGURE 4.74
This big tractor provides 180 horsepowers of power.

Q: If the team of horses and the tractor do the same amount of work plowing a ﬁeld, which will get the job done
faster?
A: The tractor will get the job done faster because it has more power. In fact, because the tractor has 30 times the
power of the six-horse team, ideally it can do the same work 30 times faster!

Summary

• Power is a measure of the amount of work that can be done in a given amount of time. Power equals work (J)

divided by time (s).

• The SI unit for power is the watt (W), which equals 1 joule of work per second (J/s).
• Power can be calculated from work and time using the equation: .
• Power may be measured in a unit called the horsepower. One horsepower is the amount of work a horse can

do in 1 minute, which equals 745 watts of power.

4.39 Simple Machines

• Deﬁne machine.
• Describe three ways that machines make work easier, and give examples of machines that work each way.

When you hear the word machine, do you think of power tools or construction equipment, like the ones pictured
above? While both of these examples are machines, you might be surprised to learn that devices as simple as
hammers and screws are also machines.
Q: Why are simple tools considered to be machines?
A: Like all machines, they change forces and make work easier.

What Is a Machine?

A machine is any device that makes work easier by changing a force. Work is done whenever a force moves an
object over a distance. The amount of work done is represented by the equation:
Work = Force x Distance
When you use a machine, you apply force to the machine. This force is called the input force. The machine, in turn,
applies force to an object. This force is called the output force. The output force may or may not be the same as the
input force. The force you apply to the machine is applied over a given distance, called the input distance. The force
applied by the machine to the object is also applied over a distance, called the output distance. The output distance
may or may not be the same as the input distance.

How Machines Make Work Easier

Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the
work is done. Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance
over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. For a humorous introduction
to machines and how they make work easier, watch video chapters 1–3 at the following URL:
http://schoolmediainteractive.com/view/object/clip/B658CEF884C8088A6B48EAA7DDA81CB8
Q: If a machine increases the force applied, what does this tell you about the distance over which the force is applied
by the machine:

699

4.39. Simple Machines

www.ck12.org

A: The machine must apply the force over a shorter distance. That’s because a machine doesn’t change the amount
of work and work equals force times distance. Therefore, if force increases, distance must decrease. For the same
reason, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.

Increasing Force

Examples of machines that increase force are steering wheels and pliers (see Figure 4.75). Read below to ﬁnd out
how both of these machines work. In each case, the machine applies more force than the user applies to the machine,
but the machine applies the force over a shorter distance.

FIGURE 4.75

Increasing Distance

Examples of machines that increase the distance over which force is applied are leaf rakes and hammers (see Figure
4.76). Read below to ﬁnd out how these two machines work. In each case, the machine increases the distance over
which the force is applied, but it reduces the strength of the force.

Changing the Direction of Force

Some machines change the direction of the force applied by the user. They may or may not also change the strength
of the force or the distance over which the force is applied. Two examples of machines that work this way are the
claw ends of hammers and ﬂagpole pulleys. You can see in the Figure 4.77 how each of these machines works. In
both cases, the direction of the force applied by the user is reversed by the machine.
Q: If the pulley only changes the direction of the force, how does it make the work of raising the ﬂag easier?
A: The pulley makes it easier to lift the ﬂag because it allows a person to pull down on the rope and add his or her
own weight to the effort, rather than simply lifting the load.

more complex and consist of many simple machines. Examples include washing machines and cars.

4.40 Efﬁciency

• Explain why all machines must overcome friction.
• Deﬁne the efﬁciency of a machine.
• Show how to calculate the efﬁciency of a machine.

This man is pushing heavy boxes on a dolly. If he were to push the boxes across the ground without the dolly,
it would take a lot more force because he would have to overcome the sliding friction between the boxes and the
ground. Using a dolly reduces the friction because rolling friction between the wheels and the ground is much less
than sliding friction.

Machines and Friction

A dolly is a machine because it changes a force to make work easier. What is work? In physics, work is deﬁned as
the use of force to move an object over a distance. It is represented by the equation:
Work = Force x Distance
All machines make work easier, but they don’t increase the amount of work that is done. You can never get more
work out of a machine than you put into it. In fact, a machine always does less work on an object than the user does
on the machine. That’s because a machine must use some of the work put into it to overcome friction. Friction is
the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. All machines involve motion, so they all have
friction. How much work is needed to overcome friction in a machine depends on the machine’s efﬁciency.

704

www.ck12.org

Machine Efﬁciency

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

Efﬁciency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user (input work) that becomes work done by the
machine (output work). The output work is always less than the input work because some of the input work is used
to overcome friction. Therefore, efﬁciency is always less than 100 percent. The closer to 100 percent a machine’s
efﬁciency is, the better it is at reducing friction. Look at the ramp in the Figure 4.79. A ramp is a type of simple
machine called an inclined plane. It is easier to push the heavy piece of furniture up the ramp to the truck than to lift
it straight up off the ground, but pushing the furniture over the surface of the ramp creates a lot of friction. Some of
the force applied to moving the furniture must be used to overcome the friction with the ramp.

FIGURE 4.79

Q: Why would it be more efﬁcient to use a dolly to roll the furniture up the ramp?
A: There would be less friction to overcome if you used a dolly because of the wheels. So the efﬁciency of the ramp
would be greater with the dolly.

Calculating Efﬁciency

Efﬁciency can be calculated with the equation:

Efﬁciency =

Input work × 100%
Output work

Consider a machine that puts out 6000 joules of work. To produce that much work from the machine requires the
user to put in 8000 joules of work. To ﬁnd the efﬁciency of the machine, substitute these values into the equation for
efﬁciency:
8000 J × 100% = 75%
6000 J
Q: Rani puts 7500 joules of work into pushing a box up a ramp, but only 6700 joules of work actually go into moving
the box. The rest of the work overcomes friction between the box and the ramp. What is the efﬁciency of the ramp?
A: The efﬁciency of the ramp is:
7500 J × 100% = 90%
6700 J

Summary

• A machine always does less work on an object than the user does on the machine, because the machine must

use some of the work to overcome friction.

• Efﬁciency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user (input work) that becomes work done by the

machine (output work). It is a measure of how well a machine reduces friction.

4.41 Mechanical Advantage

• Deﬁne actual and ideal mechanical advantage.
• Show how to calculate actual and ideal mechanical advantage.
• Identify the mechanical advantage of different types of machines.

Did you ever use a hammer to break open a piggy bank? When you use a hammer to hit something, you apply force
to the end of the handle. The head of the hammer, in turn, applies force to the piggy bank or whatever object you are
striking. The head of the hammer moves farther than you move the handle with your hand. For all machines—not
just hammers—the user applies force (input force) to the machine over a certain distance (input distance). The
machine, in turn, applies force (output force) to an object, also over a certain distance (output distance). A machine
makes work easier by changing the force or the distance over which the force is applied.

What Is Mechanical Advantage?

How much a machine changes the input force is its mechanical advantage. Mechanical advantage is the ratio of
the output force to the input force, so it can be represented by the equation:
Actual Mechanical Advantage = Output force
Input force

707

4.41. Mechanical Advantage

www.ck12.org

Note that this equation represents the actual mechanical advantage of a machine. The actual mechanical advantage
takes into account the amount of the input force that is used to overcome friction. The equation yields the factor by
which the machine changes the input force when the machine is actually used in the real world.

Ideal Mechanical Advantage

It can be difﬁcult to measure the input and output forces needed to calculate the actual mechanical advantage of
a machine. Generally, an unknown amount of the input force is used to overcome friction.
It’s usually easier
to measure the input and output distances than the input and output forces. The distance measurements can then
be used to calculate the ideal mechanical advantage. The ideal mechanical advantage represents the change in
input force that would be achieved by the machine if there were no friction to overcome. The ideal mechanical
advantage is always greater than the actual mechanical advantage because all machines have to overcome friction.
Ideal mechanical advantage can be calculated with the equation:
Ideal Mechanical Advantage = Input Distance
Output Distance
You can watch a video about actual and ideal mechanical advantage at this URL:

A Simple Example

Look at the ramp in the Figure 4.80. A ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane. It can be used
to raise an object off the ground. The input distance is the length of the sloped surface of the ramp. This is the
distance over which the input force is applied. The output distance is the height of the ramp, or the vertical distance
the object is raised. For this ramp, the input distance is 6 m and the output distance is 2 meters. Therefore, the ideal
mechanical advantage of this ramp is:

Ideal Mechanical Advantage =

Input distance
Output distance = 6 m

2 m = 3

An ideal mechanical advantage of 3 means that the ramp ideally (in the absence of friction) multiplies the input force
by a factor of 3. The trade-off is that the input force must be applied over a greater distance than the object is lifted.

FIGURE 4.80

Q: Assume that another ramp has a sloping surface of 8 m and a vertical height of 4 m. What is the ideal mechanical
advantage of this ramp?
A: The ramp has an ideal mechanical advantage of:
Ideal Mechanical Advantage = 8 m

4 m = 2

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

Mechanical Advantage of Different Types of Machines

Many machines—including inclined planes such as ramps—increase the strength of the force put into the machine
but decrease the distance over which the force is applied. Other machines increase the distance over which the force
is applied but decrease the strength of the force. Still other machines change the direction of the force, with or
without also increasing its strength or distance. Which way a machine works determines its mechanical advantage,
as shown in the Table 4.2.

• Describe an inclined plane.
• Explain how an inclined plane changes force to make work easier.
• Identify the mechanical advantage of an inclined plane.

The highway above switches back and forth as it climbs up the steep hillside. The much gentler slope of the road
makes it easier for vehicles to reach the top of the mountain. The highway is an example of an inclined plane.

What Is an Inclined Plane?

An inclined plane is a simple machine that consists of a sloping surface connecting a lower elevation to a higher
elevation. An inclined plane is one of six types of simple machines, and it is one of the oldest and most basic. In
fact, two other simple machines, the wedge and the screw, are variations of the inclined plane.
A ramp like the one in the Figure 4.81 is another example of an inclined plane. Inclined planes make it easier to
move objects to a higher elevation. The sloping surface of the inclined plane supports part of the weight of the object
as it moves up the slope. As a result, it takes less force to move the object uphill. The trade-off is that the object
must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved straight up to the higher elevation. You can see several
other examples of inclined planes at this URL:
http://www.mikids.com/SMachinesInclinedPlanes.htm

Mechanical Advantage of an Inclined Plane

The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine.
It is the ratio of output force (the force put out by the machined) to input force (the force put into the machine). For
an inclined plane, less force is put into moving an object up the slope than if the object were lifted straight up, so

711

FIGURE 4.81

the mechanical advantage is greater than 1. The more gradual the slope of the inclined plane, the less input force is
needed and the greater the mechanical advantage.
Q: Which inclined plane pictured in the Figure 4.82 has a greater mechanical advantage?

FIGURE 4.82

A: The inclined plane on the right has a more gradual slope, so it has a greater mechanical advantage. Less force is
needed to move objects up the gentler slope, yet the objects attain the same elevation as they would if more force
were used to push them up the steeper slope.

Summary

• An inclined plane is a simple machine that consists of a sloping surface connecting a lower elevation to a

higher elevation. It is used to move objects more easily to the higher elevation.

• Less force is needed to move an object uphill with an inclined plane, but the force must be applied over a

greater distance.

• The mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is always greater than 1, because the machine puts out more

force than the user puts into it.

A chisel is a very useful tool for carving wood, rocks, and other hard substances. This man is using a chisel to
remove large pieces of wood. A chisel is a type of machine called a wedge.

What Is a Wedge?

A wedge is simple machine that consists of two inclined planes, giving it a thin end and thick end, as you can see in
the Figure 4.84. A wedge is used to cut or split apart objects. Force is applied to the thick end of the wedge, and the
wedge, in turn, applies force to the object along both of its sloping sides. This force causes the object to split apart.
A knife is another example of a wedge. In the Figure 4.85, a knife is being used to chop tough pecans. The job is
easy to do with the knife because of the wedge shape of the blade. The very thin edge of the blade easily enters and
cuts through the pecans. You can see other examples of wedges, as well as a history of the wedge, at the following

Mechanical Advantage of a Wedge

The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine.
It is the ratio of the output force to the input force. A wedge applies more force to the object (output force) than the
user applies to the wedge (input force), so the mechanical advantage of a wedge is greater than 1. A longer, thinner
wedge has a greater mechanical advantage than a shorter, wider wedge. With all wedges, the trade-off is that the

through the object.
Q: Which wedge in the Figure 4.86 do you think would do the same amount of work with less input force?

This old chimney has a spiral staircase wrapped around it. The spiral staircase contains an inclined plane, or ramp.
Do you see it? The stairs that wrap around the outside wall of the chimney make up the inclined plane. Together
with the chimney, they represent a machine called a screw.

What Is a Screw

A screw is a simple machine that consists of an inclined plane wrapped around a central cylinder. No doubt you are
familiar with screws like the wood screw in the left-hand side of the Figure 4.88. The cap of the bottle pictured on
the right is another example of a screw. Screws move objects to a greater depth (or higher elevation) by increasing
the force applied to the screw. Many screws are used to hold things together, such as two pieces of wood or a screw
cap and bottle. When you use a screw, you apply force to turn the inclined plane. The screw, in turn, applies greater
force to the object, such as the wood or bottle top. You can watch an animation of a turning screw at the following

The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine.
It is the ratio of the output force to the input force. The force applied by the screw (output force) is always greater
than the force applied to the screw (input force). Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a screw is always greater
than 1.
Look at the two screws in the Figure 4.89. In the screw on the right, the threads of the inclined plane are closer
together. This screw has a greater mechanical advantage and is easier to turn than the screw on the left, so it takes
less force to penetrate the wood with the right screw. The trade-off is that more turns of the screw are needed to do
the job because the distance over which the input force must be applied is greater.
Q: Why is it harder to turn a screw with more widely spaced threads?
A: The screw moves farther with each turn when the threads are more widely space, so more force must be applied
to turn the screw and cover the greater distance.

Summary

• A screw is a simple machine that consists of an inclined plane wrapped around a central cylinder. Screws

move objects to a greater depth (or higher elevation) by increasing the force applied to the screw

• The mechanical advantage of a screw is always greater than 1 because the output force applied by the screw

is greater than the input force applied to the screw.

4.45 Lever

• Deﬁne lever.
• Describe the three classes of levers.
• Outline how each class of lever changes force.

A hammer can be used to pull a nail out of a board. You can see how it’s done in this picture. When you push down
on the handle of the hammer, the claw end of the hammer pulls up on the nail. A hammer is an example of a machine
called a lever.

What Is a Lever?

A lever is a simple machine consisting of a bar that rotates around a ﬁxed point. The ﬁxed point of a lever is called
the fulcrum. Like other machines, a lever makes work easier by changing the force applied to the machine or the
distance over which the force is applied. For a video introduction to levers using skateboards as examples, go to this

How does a hammer make it easier to pull a nail out of a board? First, it changes the direction of the force applied to
the hammer—the hand pushes down on the handle while the claw end of the hammer head pulls up. Often, you can

721

4.45. Lever

www.ck12.org

push down with more force than you can push up because you can put your own weight behind it. The hammer also
increases the strength of the force that is applied to it. It easily pulls the nail out of the board, which you couldn’t do
with your hands alone. On the other hand, the hammer decreases the distance over which the force is applied. The
hand pushing down on the handle moves the handle over a distance of several inches, whereas the hammer pulls up
on the nail only an inch or two.
Q: Where is the fulcrum of the hammer when it is used to pull a nail out of a board? In other words, around what
point does the hammer rotate?
A: The fulcrum is the point where the head of the hammer rests on the surface of the board.

Classes of Levers

Other levers change force or distance in different ways than a hammer removing a nail. How a lever changes force
or distance depends on the location of the input and output forces relative to the fulcrum. The input force is the force
applied by the user to the lever. The output force is the force applied by the lever to the object. Based on the location
of input and output forces, there are three basic types of levers, called ﬁrst-class, second-class, and third-class levers.
The Table 4.3 describes the three classes. You can see animations of the classes, as well as more examples, at this

Chapter 4. Motion and Forces

• ∆ = fulcrum I = input force O = output force

The Table 4.3 includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor
by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that
would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome
some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of
the machine as it is used in the real world.
Q: Which class of lever is a hammer when it is used to pry a nail out of a board? What is its mechanical advantage?
A: To pry a nail out of a board, the fulcrum is located between the input and output forces. Therefore, when a
hammer is used in this way it is a ﬁrst class lever. The fulcrum is closer to the output force than the input force, so
the mechanical advantage is >1. In other words, the hammer increases the force applied to it, making it easier to pry
the nail out of the board.

Comparing Classes of Levers

All three classes of levers make work easier, but they do so in different ways.

• When the input and output forces are on opposite sides of the fulcrum, the lever changes the direction of the

applied force. This occurs only with ﬁrst-class levers.

• When both the input and output forces are on the same side of the fulcrum, the direction of the applied force

does not change. This occurs with both second-class and third-class levers.

• When the input force is applied farther from the fulcrum than the output force is, the output force is greater than
the input force, and the ideal mechanical advantage is greater than 1. This always occurs with second-class
levers and may occur with ﬁrst-class levers.

• When the input force is applied closer to the fulcrum than the output force is, the output force is less than the
input force, and the ideal mechanical advantage is less than 1. This always occurs with third-class levers and
may occur with ﬁrst-class levers.

• When the input and output forces are the same distance from the fulcrum, the output force equals the input

force, and the ideal mechanical advantage is 1. This occurs only with ﬁrst some ﬁrst-class levers.

Advantage of Third Class Levers

You may be wondering why you would use a third-class lever when it doesn’t change the direction or strength of the
applied force. The advantage of a third-class lever is that the output force is applied over a greater distance than the
input force. The output end of the lever must move faster than the input end in order to cover the greater distance.
Q: A broom is a third-class lever when it is used to sweep a ﬂoor (see the Figure 4.90), so the output end of the lever
moves faster than the input end. Why is this useful?
A: By moving more quickly over the ﬂoor, the broom does the work faster.

Summary

• A lever is a simple machine consisting of a bar that rotates around a ﬁxed point called the fulcrum.
• Based on the location of the input and output forces relative to the fulcrum, there are three basic types of
levers: ﬁrst-class, second-class, and third-class levers. The classes differ in their mechanical advantage and
whether they change the direction of the input force.

4.46 Wheel and Axle

• Describe the simple machine known as a wheel and axle.
• Relate the mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle to how the machine is used.

Did you ever ride on a Ferris wheel like this one? If you did, then you know how thrilling the ride can be. The faster
it goes, the more exciting it is. A Ferris wheel is an example of a machine called a wheel and axle.

Round and Round It Goes

A wheel and axle is a simple machine that consists of two connected rings or cylinders, one inside the other. Both
rings or cylinders turn in the same direction around a single center point. The inner ring or cylinder is called the
axle, and the outer one is called the wheel. Besides the Ferris wheel, the doorknob in the Figure 4.91 is another
example of a wheel and axle. For more examples, go to this URL:
http://www.mikids.com/SMachinesWheels.htm

FIGURE 4.91

725

4.46. Wheel and Axle

www.ck12.org

In a wheel and axle, force may be applied either to the wheel or to the axle. This force is called the input force. A
wheel and axle does not change the direction of the input force. However, the force put out by the machine, called
the output force, is either greater than the input force or else applied over a greater distance.
Q: Where is the force applied in a Ferris wheel and a doorknob? Is it applied to the wheel or to the axle?
A: In a Ferris wheel, the force is applied to the axle by the Ferris wheel’s motor. In a doorknob, the force is applied
to the wheel by a person’s hand.

Mechanical Advantage of a Wheel and Axle

The mechanical advantage of a machine is the factor by which the machine changes the input force. It equals the ratio
of the output force to the input force. A wheel and axle may either increase or decrease the input force, depending
on whether the input force is applied to the axle or the wheel.

• When the input force is applied to the axle, as it is with a Ferris wheel, the wheel turns with less force. Because
the output force is less than the input force, the mechanical advantage is less than 1. However, the wheel turns
over a greater distance, so it turns faster than the axle. The speed of the wheel is one reason that the Ferris
wheel ride is so exciting.

• When the input force is applied to the wheel, as it is with a doorknob, the axle turns over a shorter distance
but with greater force, so the mechanical advantage is greater than 1. This allows you to turn the doorknob
with relatively little effort, while the axle of the doorknob applies enough force to slide the bar into or out of
the doorframe. At the following URL, you can see how much a wheel and axle increases the input force when
it is applied to the wheel.

http://www.ewolfe.net/portfolio/animation/wheel.html

Summary

• A wheel and axle is a simple machine that consists of two connected rings or cylinders, one inside the other,

which both turn in the same direction around a single center point.

• A wheel and axle may either increase or decrease the input force, depending on whether the input force is
applied to the axle or the wheel. Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle may be greater than
1 or less than 1.

• Explain how to determine the ideal mechanical advantage of a pulley.

This rusty iron wheel has a rope wrapped around it. The wheel and rope hang over a building. Together they make

What Is a Pulley?

A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a rope and grooved wheel. The rope ﬁts into the groove in the wheel,
and pulling on the rope turns the wheel. Pulleys are generally used to lift objects, especially heavy objects. The
object lifted by a pulley is called the load. The force applied to the pulley is called the effort.
Q: Can you guess what the pulley pictured above is used for?
A: The pulley is used to lift heavy buckets full of water out of the well.

Types of Pulleys

Some pulleys are attached to a beam or other secure surface and remain ﬁxed in place. They are called ﬁxed pulleys.
Other pulleys are attached to the object being moved and are moveable themselves. They are called moveable
pulleys. Sometimes, ﬁxed and moveable pulleys are used together. They make up a compound pulley. The three
types of pulleys are compared in the Table 4.4. You can experiment with an interactive animation of compound
pulleys with various numbers of pulleys at this link:

Mechanical Advantage of Pulleys

www.ck12.org

The mechanical advantage of a simple machine such as a pulley is the factor by which the machine changes the force
applied to it. The ideal mechanical advantage of a machine is its mechanical advantage in the absence of friction.
All machines must overcome friction, so the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual
mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.
In a pulley, the ideal mechanical advantage is equal to the number of rope segments pulling up on the object. The
more rope segments that are helping to do the lifting work, the less force that is needed for the job. Look at the table
of types of pulleys. It gives the ideal mechanical advantage of each type.

• In the single ﬁxed pulley, only one rope segment pulls up on the load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is 1.
In other words, this type of pulley doesn’t increase the force that is applied to it. However, it does change the
direction of the force. This allows you to use your weight to pull on one end of the rope and more easily raise
the load attached to the other end.

• In the single moveable pulley, two rope segments pull up on the load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is 2.
This type of pulley doesn’t change the direction of the force applied to it, but it increases the force by a factor
of 2.

• In a compound pulley, two or more rope segments pull up on the load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is
2 or greater than 2. This type of pulley may or may not change the direction of the force applied to it—it
depends on the number and arrangement of pulleys—but the increase in force may be great.

Q: If a compound pulley has four rope segments pulling up on the load, by what factor does it multiply the force
applied to the pulley?
A: With four rope segments, the ideal mechanical advantage is 4. This means that the compound pulley multiplies
the force applied to it by a factor of 4. For example if 400 Newtons of force were applied to the pulley, the pulley
would apply 1600 Newtons of force to the load.

Summary

• A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a rope wrapped around a grooved wheel. Pulleys are generally

used to lift a load.

• There are three types of pulleys: ﬁxed pulleys, moveable pulleys, and compound pulleys. Compound pulleys

consist of two or more ﬁxed and moveable pulleys.

Did you ever look closely at the moving parts of a bicycle? You can see some of them in the opening image. Do you

machines. It’s an example of a compound machine.

What Is a Compound Machine?

A compound machine is a machine that consists of more than one simple machine. Some compound machines
consist of just two simple machines. You can read below about two examples—the wheelbarrow and corkscrew.
Other compound machines, such as bicycles, consist of many simple machines. Big compound machines such as
cars may consist of hundreds or even thousands of simple machines. You can see a student’s compound machine

Wheelbarrow

Look at the wheelbarrow in the Figure 4.92. It is used to carry heavy objects. It consists of two simple machines: a
lever and a wheel and axle. Effort is applied to the lever by picking up the handles of the wheelbarrow. The lever,
in turn, applies upward force to the load. The force is increased by the lever, making the load easier to lift. Effort
is applied to the wheel of the wheelbarrow by pushing it over the ground. The rolling wheel turns the axle and
increases the force, making it easier to push the load.

FIGURE 4.92

Corkscrew

The corkscrew in the Figure 4.93 is also a compound machine. It is used to pierce a cork and pull it out of the neck
of a bottle. It consists of a screw and two levers. Turning the handle on top twists the screw down into the center
of the cork. Then, pushing down on the two levers causes the screw to pull upward, bringing the cork with it. The
levers increase the force and change its direction.

Efﬁciency of Compound Machines

Friction is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. All machines have moving parts and
friction, so they have to use some of the work that is applied to them to overcome friction. This makes all machines
less than 100 percent efﬁcient. Because compound machines have more moving parts than simple machines, they
generally have more friction to overcome. As a result, compound machines tend to have lower efﬁciency than simple
machines. When a compound machine consists of many simple machines, friction can become a serious problem,
and it may produce a lot of heat. Lubricants such as oil or grease may be used to coat the moving parts of a machine
so they slide over each other more easily. This is how friction is reduced in a car engine.

Mechanical Advantage of Compound Machines

The mechanical advantage of a machine is the factor by which it changes the force applied to the machine. Many
machines increase the force applied to them, and this is how they make work easier. Compound machines tend to

733

4.48. Compound Machine

FIGURE 4.93

have a greater mechanical advantage than simple machines. That’s because the mechanical advantage of a compound
machine equals the product of the mechanical advantages of all its component simple machines. The greater the
number of simple machines it contains, the greater its mechanical advantage tends to be.
Q: Assume that the lever and the wheel and axle of a wheelbarrow each have a mechanical advantage of 2. What is
the mechanical advantage of the wheelbarrow?
A: The mechanical advantage of the wheelbarrow is the product of the mechanical advantage of the lever (2) and the
mechanical advantage of the wheel and axle (2). Therefore, the wheelbarrow has a mechanical advantage of 4.

Summary

• A compound machine is a machine that consists of more than one simple machine.
• Compound machines such as a wheelbarrow or corkscrew consist of just two simple machines. Big compound

machines such as cars consist of hundreds or thousands of simple machines.

• Compared with simple machines, compound machines generally have lower efﬁciency but greater mechanical

advantage.

www.ck12.org

The surfer in this photo is dwarfed by the immense wave he’s riding, yet he’s managing to use the incredible energy
of the wave for a thrilling ride. Ocean waves like this one carry a huge amount of energy. Do you know what
energy is? Can you identify other forms of energy besides ocean waves? In this unit, you’ll learn a lot about energy,
including how it makes modern life possible—even if you never ride a surfboard!

Chapter 5. Energy

5.1 Energy

• Explain the source of chemical energy.
• Describe ways chemical energy is generated and used.

What are some types of chemical reactions?

Some chemistry reactions can be very calm and boring, while other reactions release a great deal of energy. Dyna-
mite is a chemical that can explode violently. Here we see dynamite being used to move boulders to clear a path for
a road. The chemical reactions involved here release tremendous amounts of energy very quickly.
Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1866. Nitroglycerin, a very unstable explosive, was already known. No-
bel mixed the nitroglycerin with silica to stabilize it and form a solid material. He made a fortune with this discovery
and established the Nobel Foundation, which funds the Nobel Prizes every year.

Energy in Chemical Bonds

Chemical reactions either require energy or release energy. The amount of energy needed or released depends
upon the structure of the molecules that are involved in the reaction. Some reactions need to be heated for long
periods of time in order for change to take place. Other reactions release energy, allowing heat to be given off to the
surroundings.
This energy can be used in a variety of ways.

Heating

Coal, natural gas, oil – these materials can be burned to produce heat. The reaction with oxygen releases a great
deal of energy that can warm homes and ofﬁces. Wood is another example of a chemical (yes, a very complicated
one) that will release energy when burned.

Transportation

www.ck12.org

A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical
used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited,
a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an
internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of
the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push
the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel
(either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

FIGURE 5.1
Rocket launch.

Batteries

A major source of energy produced by chemical reactions involves batteries. There are many types of batteries that
operate using a variety of chemical reactions. The general principle behind these reactions is the release of electrons
that can then ﬂow through a circuit, producing an electrical current.

Chapter 5. Energy

Batteries are used in a wide variety of applications:

1. ﬂashlights
2. watches
3. computers
4. cars
5. hybrid vehicles – provide some power to wheels
6. cell phones
7. many other uses

Batteries in cars, computers, cell phones, and other devices are usually rechargeable. An electric current is passed
through the battery to provide electrons that reverse (at least partially) the chemical reactions originally used to
create the electric current. However, eventually the system can no longer be recharged and the battery has to be
discarded.

Hand-Warmers

Hikers, campers, and other outdoor folks take advantage of chemical reactions to keep their hands warm. Small
containers of chemicals can undergo reaction to generate heat that can be used to avoid frostbite. Some products
contain iron ﬁlings that will react with air to release thermal energy. These types of warmer cannot be reused. Other
systems rely on heat being released when certain chemicals crystallize. If the warmer is placed in very hot water
after use, the system can be regenerated.

Summary

• Some chemical reactions release energy.
• This energy can be used in a variety of ways.

5.2 Kinetic Energy

• Deﬁne kinetic energy.
• Show how to calculate the kinetic energy of a moving object.

What could these four photos possibly have in common? Can you guess what it is? All of them show things that
have kinetic energy.

Deﬁning Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy is the energy of moving matter. Anything that is moving has kinetic energy—from atoms in matter
to stars in outer space. Things with kinetic energy can do work. For example, the spinning saw blade in the photo
above is doing the work of cutting through a piece of metal.

Calculating Kinetic Energy

The amount of kinetic energy in a moving object depends directly on its mass and velocity. An object with greater
mass or greater velocity has more kinetic energy. You can calculate the kinetic energy of a moving object with this
equation:
Kinetic Energy (KE) = 1
This equation shows that an increase in velocity increases kinetic energy more than an increase in mass. If mass
doubles, kinetic energy doubles as well, but if velocity doubles, kinetic energy increases by a factor of four. That’s
because velocity is squared in the equation.

2mass× velocity2

5.2. Kinetic Energy

www.ck12.org

Let’s consider an example. The Figure 5.3 shows Juan running on the beach with his dad. Juan has a mass of 40 kg
and is running at a velocity of 1 m/s. How much kinetic energy does he have? Substitute these values for mass and
velocity into the equation for kinetic energy:
KE = 1
Notice that the answer is given in joules (J), or N • m, which is the SI unit for energy. One joule is the amount of
energy needed to apply a force of 1 Newton over a distance of 1 meter.

s2 = 20 N· m, or 20 J

s )2 = 20 kg× m2

2 × 40 kg× (1m

FIGURE 5.3

2 × 80 kg× (1m

s )2 = 40 kg× m2

What about Juan’s dad? His mass 80 kg, and he’s running at the same velocity as Juan (1 m/s). Because his mass is
twice as great as Juan’s, his kinetic energy is twice as great:
s2 = 40 N· m, or 40 J
KE = 1
Q: What is Juan’s kinetic energy if he speeds up to 2 m/s from 1 m/s?
A: By doubling his velocity, Juan increases his kinetic energy by a factor of four:
KE = 1

Summary

• The amount of kinetic energy in a moving object depends directly on its mass and velocity. It can be calculated

with the equation: KE = 1

• Show how to calculate gravitational potential energy.
• Describe elastic potential energy.
• Identify other forms of potential energy.

This diver has just jumped up from the end of the diving board. After she dives down and is falling toward the water,
she’ll have kinetic energy, or the energy of moving matter. But even as she is momentarily stopped high above the
water, she has energy. Do you know why?

Stored Energy

The diver has energy because of her position high above the pool. The type of energy she has is called potential
energy. Potential energy is energy that is stored in a person or object. Often, the person or object has potential
energy because of its position or shape.
Q: What is it about the diver’s position that gives her potential energy?
A: Because the diver is high above the water, she has the potential to fall toward Earth because of gravity. This gives
her potential energy.

Gravitational Potential Energy

Potential energy due to the position of an object above Earth’s surface is called gravitational potential energy. Like
the diver on the diving board, anything that is raised up above Earth’s surface has the potential to fall because of
gravity. You can see another example of people with gravitational potential energy in the Figure 5.5. You can also

FIGURE 5.5

watch a cartoon introduction to gravitational potential energy by playing video #10 at this URL: http://www.anima
tedscience.co.uk/ﬂv/
Gravitational potential energy depends on an object’s weight and its height above the ground. It can be calculated
with the equation:
Gravitational potential energy (GPE) = weight × height
Consider the little girl on the sled, pictured in the Figure 5.5. She weighs 140 Newtons, and the top of the hill is 4
meters higher than the bottom of the hill. As she sits at the top of the hill, the child’s gravitational potential energy
is:
GPE = 140 N × 4 m = 560 N • m
Notice that the answer is given in Newton • meters (N • m), which is the SI unit for energy. A Newton • meter is the
energy needed to move a weight of 1 Newton over a distance of 1 meter. A Newton • meter is also called a joule (J).
Q: The gymnast on the balance beam pictured in the Figure 5.5 weighs 360 Newtons. If the balance beam is 1.2
meters above the ground, what is the gymnast’s gravitational potential energy?
A: Her gravitational potential energy is:
GPE = 360 N × 1.2 m = 432 N • m, or 432 J

Elastic Potential Energy

Potential energy due to an object’s shape is called elastic potential energy. This energy results when an elastic object
is stretched or compressed. The farther the object is stretched or compressed, the greater its potential energy is. A
point will be reached when the object can’t be stretched or compressed any more. Then it will forcefully return to
its original shape.
Look at the pogo stick in the Figure 5.6. Its spring has elastic potential energy when it is pressed down by the boy’s
weight. When it can’t be compressed any more, it will spring back to its original shape. The energy it releases will
push the pogo stick—and the boy—off the ground. You can see how a pogo stick spring compresses and then returns
to its original shape in the animation at this URL:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pogoanim.gif
Q: The girl in the Figure 5.7 is giving the elastic band of her slingshot potential energy by stretching it. She’s
holding a small stone against the stretched band. What will happen when she releases the band?
A: The elastic band will spring back to its original shape. When that happens, watch out! Some of the band’s elastic
potential energy will be transferred to the stone, which will go ﬂying through the air.

Other Forms of Potential Energy

All of the examples of potential energy described above involve movement or the potential to move. The form of
energy that involves movement is called mechanical energy. Other forms of energy also involve potential energy,
including chemical energy and nuclear energy. Chemical energy is stored in the bonds between the atoms of
compounds. For example, food and batteries both contain chemical energy. Nuclear energy is stored in the nuclei of
atoms because of the strong forces that hold the nucleus together. Nuclei of radioactive elements such as uranium
are unstable, so they break apart and release the stored energy.

Summary

• Potential energy is energy that is stored in a person or object.
• Gravitational potential energy is due to the position of an object above Earth’s surface. The object has the
potential to fall due to gravity. Gravitational potential energy depends on an object’s weight and its height

5.4 Forms of Energy

• Identify and describe different forms of energy.

This musician’s electric guitar wails at a concert, as colored lights wash over the band. It’s hot on stage because of
the lights, but they really add to the show. The fans are thrilled and screaming with excitement. The exciting concert
wouldn’t be possible without several different forms of energy. Do you know what they are?

Introducing Forms of Energy

Energy, or the ability to cause changes in matter, can exist in many different forms. Energy can also change from
one form to another. The photo above of the guitar player represents six forms of energy: mechanical, chemical,
electrical, light, thermal, and sound energy. Another form of energy is nuclear energy. For an introduction to all of
these forms of energy, watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZWICeFsNy0 (8:25).

Q: Can you ﬁnd the six different forms of energy in the photo of the guitar player (See opening image)?
A: The guitarist uses mechanical energy to pluck the strings of the guitar. He gets the energy he needs to perform
from chemical energy in food he ate earlier in the day. The stage lights use electrical energy, which they change
to light energy and thermal energy (commonly called heat). The guitar produces sound energy when the guitarist
plucks the strings.

Seven Forms of Energy

Chapter 5. Energy

The different forms of energy are deﬁned and illustrated below. For an interactive animation about different forms
of energy, visit this URL: http://blip.tv/gatm/different-types-of-energy-647820 .
1. Mechanical energy is the energy of movement. It is found in objects that are moving or have the potential to
move.

FIGURE 5.8
This drummer has mechanical energy as
he moves the drumsticks to hit the drums
and cymbals.
The moving drumsticks
also have mechanical energy, but they
would have mechanical energy even if
they weren’t moving. That’s because they
have the potential to fall when the drum-
mer is holding them above the ﬂoor. This
potential energy is due to gravity.

2. Chemical energy is energy that is stored in the bonds between the atoms of compounds. If the bonds are broken,
the energy is released and can be converted to other forms of energy.

FIGURE 5.9
This portable guitar ampliﬁer can run on
batteries. Batteries store chemical energy
and change it to electrical energy.

3. Electrical energy is the energy of moving electrons. Electrons ﬂow through wires to create electric current.
4. Electromagnetic energy is energy that travels through space as electrical and magnetic waves. The light ﬂooding
the stage in the Figure 5.10 is one type of electromagnetic energy. Other types include radio waves, microwaves, X
rays, and gamma rays.
5. Thermal energy is the energy of moving atoms of matter. All matter has thermal energy because atoms of all
matter are constantly moving. An object with more mass has greater thermal energy than an object with less mass
because it has more atoms.

FIGURE 5.10
The bright lights on this stage use elec-
trical energy. They are wired into the
electrical system of the of the hall. The
guitars and microphone also use electri-
cal energy. You can see the electrical
cords running from them to the outlet on
the ﬂoor below the musicians.

FIGURE 5.11
Why is this jogger sweating so much? His
sweat is soaking up his shirt because he
has so much thermal energy. Jogging is
hot work because of the heat from the sun
and the hard work he puts into his run.

756

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

6. Sound energy is a form of mechanical energy that starts with a vibration in matter. For example, the singer’s voice
starts with vibrations of his vocal cords, which are folds of tissue in his throat. The vibrations pass to surrounding
particles of matter and then from one particle to another in waves. Sound waves can travel through air, water, and
other substances, but not through empty space.
7. Nuclear energy is energy that is stored in the nuclei of atoms because of the strong forces that hold the nucleus
together. The energy can be released in nuclear power plants by splitting nuclei apart. It is also released when
unstable (radioactive) nuclei break down, or decay.
Q: The fans at a rock concert also produce or use several forms of energy. What are they?
A: The fans see the concert because of electromagnetic energy (light) that enters their eyes from the well-lit
musicians on stage. They hear the music because of the sound energy that reaches their ears from the ampliﬁers.
They use mechanical energy when they clap their hands and jump from their seats in excitement. Their bodies
generate thermal energy, using the chemical energy stored in food they have eaten.

Summary

• Energy, or the ability to cause changes in matter, can exist in many different forms. Energy can also change

from one form to another.

• Forms of energy include mechanical, chemical, electrical, electromagnetic, thermal, sound, and nuclear en-

ergy.

5.5 Energy Conversion

• Deﬁne energy conversion.
• Give examples of energy changing from one form to another.
• Describe energy changes between kinetic and potential energy.

Sari and Daniel are spending a stormy Saturday afternoon with cartons of hot popcorn and a spellbinding movie.
They are obviously too focused on the movie to wonder where all the energy comes from to power their weekend
entertainment. They’ll give it some thought halfway through the movie when the storm causes the power to go out!

Changing Energy

Watching movies, eating hot popcorn, and many other activities depend on electrical energy. Most electrical energy
comes from the burning of fossil fuels, which contain stored chemical energy. When fossil fuels are burned, the
chemical energy changes to thermal energy and the thermal energy is then used to generate electrical energy. These
are all examples of energy conversion. Energy conversion is the process in which one kind of energy changes into
another kind. When energy changes in this way, the energy isn’t used up or lost. The same amount of energy exists
after the conversion as before. Energy conversion obeys the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy
cannot be created or destroyed.

How Energy Changes Form

Besides electrical, chemical, and thermal energy, some other forms of energy include mechanical and sound energy.
Any of these forms of energy can change into any other form. Often, one form of energy changes into two or more
different forms. For example, the popcorn machine below changes electrical energy to thermal energy. The thermal
energy, in turn, changes to both mechanical energy and sound energy. You can read the Figure 5.13 how these

759

5.5. Energy Conversion

changes happen. You can see other examples of energy changing form at this URL: http://fi.edu/guide/hughes/energ
ychangeex.html

FIGURE 5.13
1. The popcorn machine changes elec-
trical to thermal energy, which heats the
popcorn. 2. The heat causes the popcorn
to pop. You can see that the popping
corn has mechanical energy (energy of
movement). It overﬂows the pot and falls
into the pile of popcorn at the bottom of
the machine. 3. The popping corn also
has energy. That’s why it makes popping
sounds.

Kinetic-Potential Energy Changes

Mechanical energy commonly changes between kinetic and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of moving
objects. Potential energy is energy that is stored in objects, typically because of their position or shape. Kinetic
energy can be used to change the position or shape of an object, giving it potential energy. Potential energy gives the
object the potential to move. If it does, the potential energy changes back to kinetic energy.
That’s what happened to Sari. After she and Daniel left the theater, the storm cleared and they went for a swim.
That’s Sari in the Figure 5.14 coming down the water slide. When she was at the top of the slide, she had potential
energy. Why? She had the potential to slide into the water because of the pull of gravity. As she moved down the
slide, her potential energy changed to kinetic energy. By the time she reached the water, all the potential energy had
changed to kinetic energy.
Q: How could Sari regain her potential energy?

FIGURE 5.14

A: Sari could climb up the steps to the top of the slide. It takes kinetic energy to climb the steps, and this energy
would be stored in Sari as she climbed. By the time she got to the top of the slide, she would have the same amount
of potential energy as before.
A roller coaster is another fun example of changes between kinetic and potential energy. Watch the roller coaster
animation at the URL below to see the energy changes. Notice how the roller coaster’s total energy (kinetic energy
+ potential energy) does not change.

Q: Can you think of other fun examples of energy changing between kinetic and potential energy?

Summary

• Energy conversion is the process in which energy changes from one form or type to another. Energy is always

conserved in energy conversions.

• Deﬁne nonrenewable resource.
• Identify nonrenewable energy resources.
• State drawbacks of using nonrenewable energy resources.

It may look beautiful, but this oil slick threatens the environment and living things. Unfortunately, oil spills are
common because we rely heavily on oil as an energy resource. Oil is an example of a nonrenewable resource.

What Are Nonrenewable Resources?

Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that are limited in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they
are used up. A natural resource is anything people can use that comes from nature. Energy resources are some of the
most important natural resources because everything we do requires energy. Nonrenewable energy resources include
fossil fuels such as oil and the radioactive element uranium.

Types of Fossil Fuels

Oil, or petroleum, is one of several fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are mixtures of hydrocarbons (compounds containing
only hydrogen and carbon) that formed over millions of years from the remains of dead organisms. In addition to
oil, they include coal and natural gas. Fossil fuels provide most of the energy used in the world today. They are
burned in power plants to produce electrical energy, and they also fuel cars, heat homes, and supply energy for many
other purposes. You can see some ways they are used in the Figure 5.15. For a more detailed introduction to fossil
fuels, go to this URL: http://www.ecokids.ca/pub/eco_info/topics/energy/ecostats/index.cfm
Q: Why do fossil fuels have energy?
A: Fossil fuels contain stored chemical energy that came originally from the sun.

762

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

FIGURE 5.15

How Fossil Fuels Formed

When ancient plants underwent photosynthesis, they changed energy in sunlight to stored chemical energy in food.
The plants used the food and so did the organisms that ate the plants. After the plants and other organisms died, their
remains gradually changed to fossil fuels as they were covered and compressed by layers of sediments. Petroleum
and natural gas formed from ocean organisms and are found together. Coal formed from giant tree ferns and other
swamp plants.

Fossil Fuels and the Environment

When fossil fuels burn, they release thermal energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. The thermal energy can be
used to generate electricity or do other work. The carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere and is a major
cause of global climate change. The burning of fossil fuels also releases many pollutants into the air. Pollutants
such as sulfur dioxide form acid rain, which kills living things and damages metals, stonework, and other materials.
Pollutants such as nitrogen oxides cause smog, which is harmful to human health. Tiny particles, or particulates,
released when fossil fuels burn also harm human health.
The Figure 5.16 shows the amounts of pollutants released by different fossil fuels. Natural gas releases the least
pollution; coal releases the most. Petroleum has the additional risk of oil spills, which may seriously damage
ecosystems. To learn about other ways that our dependence on fossil fuels damages the environment and threatens
human life, watch the video at this URL: http://coal.wiki.lovett.org/Home
Q: Some newer models of cars and other motor vehicles can run on natural gas. Why would a natural gas vehicle be
better for the environment than a vehicle that burns gasoline, which is made from oil?
A: Natural gas produces much less pollution and carbon dioxide when it burns than gasoline does. So a natural gas
vehicle would contribute less to global climate change, acid rain, and air pollution that harms health. Besides being
better for the environment, burning natural gas instead of gasoline results in less engine wear and provides more
energy for a given amount of fuel.

Nuclear Energy

Like fossil fuels, the radioactive element uranium can be used to generate electrical energy in power plants. This
source of energy is known as nuclear energy. In a nuclear power plant, the nuclei of uranium atoms are split apart
into smaller nuclei in the process of nuclear ﬁssion. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy from
just a small amount of uranium. The total supply of uranium in the world is quite limited, however, and cannot be
replaced once it is used up. That’s why nuclear energy is a nonrenewable resource. The use of nuclear energy also
produces dangerous radioactive wastes. In addition, accidents at nuclear power plants have the potential to release
large amounts of harmful radiation into the environment.

5.6. Non-Renewable Energy Resources

FIGURE 5.16

Q: Why is nuclear energy often considered to be “greener” than energy from fossil fuels?
A: Unlike energy from fossil fuels, nuclear energy doesn’t produce air pollution or carbon dioxide that contributes
to global climate change.

Summary

• Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that are limited in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as

they are used up. Nonrenewable energy resources include fossil fuels and uranium.

• Fossil fuels—including oil, natural gas, and coal—provide most of the energy used in the world today. Burning

fossil fuels produces air pollution as well as carbon dioxide that causes global climate change.

• Nuclear energy is produced by splitting the nuclei of radioactive uranium. This doesn’t release air pollution

or carbon dioxide, but it does produce dangerous radioactive wastes.

5.7 Renewable Energy Resources

• Deﬁne renewable resource.
• Describe several renewable energy resources.

Acre upon acre of wind turbines stretch over the landscape in this photo. The blades of the turbines spin in the wind
like giant pinwheels. The energy of the moving blades is used to generate useful electrical energy. Wind is one of
several renewable energy resources.
Q: What are some other renewable energy resources?
A: You can read about the major renewable energy resources in this article. But here’s a hint in advance. Renewable
energy resources include mechanical, electromagnetic, chemical, and thermal forms of energy.

What Are Renewable Resources?

Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually
limitless in supply.
In addition to wind, renewable energy resources include sunlight, moving water, biomass,
and geothermal energy. All of these resources are freely available and won’t run out. Most of them also have
the advantage of producing little if any pollution or carbon dioxide, which contributes to global climate change.
Nonetheless, these energy resources are used far less than nonrenewable energy resources, especially fossil fuels.
You can see where renewable energy resources are used in the U.S., as well as learn more about them, at this URL:
http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/people/a_energy.html

Wind

Wind is moving air, so it has mechanical energy that can do work. People have been using wind for energy for
thousands of years. The old-fashioned windmill in the Figure 5.17 is one way that wind energy can be used. The
wind turbines in the opening photo above are a much newer way of using wind energy. They change the kinetic
energy of the wind to electrical energy. However, only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind to produce
much electricity. Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy, dangerous to birds, and unattractive in the

landscape. At the URL below, you can watch a video about the development of wind energy in China, which aims
to become a world leader in renewable energy production.

FIGURE 5.17
This old windmill uses wind energy to operate a mechanical pump that lifts
water out of a well. Windmills like this one have been used for centuries.

Q: Where does the energy of the wind come from? Why does air move in the atmosphere?
A: Wind is caused by unequal heating of the atmosphere by the sun. In other words, differences in thermal energy
cause air to move in the atmosphere.

Sunlight

The sunlight that reaches Earth is the planet’s most important source of energy. The energy in sunlight, called solar
energy, is electromagnetic energy. This is a form of energy that travels through space in electric and magnetic waves.
Solar energy can be used to heat homes and produce electricity in solar cells like those on the roof seen in the Figure
5.18. Sunny areas receive plenty of sunlight to generate electricity, but solar energy may not be practical in areas
that are often cloudy.
Q: In addition to the roofs of homes and other buildings, where else can you ﬁnd solar cells?
A: Calculators often have solar cells. Solar-powered outdoor lights are very common as well.

Moving Water

The mechanical energy of rapidly ﬂowing water can turn a turbine and generate electricity. Electricity produced in
this way is called hydroelectric power. The water may ﬂow over a waterfall or through a dam. You can see a picture
of a dam in the Figure 5.19. A drawback of dams is that they ﬂood land upstream from the dam and reduce water
ﬂow downstream from the dam, and this can destroy ecosystems. At the following URL, you can learn more about

FIGURE 5.19
This is Hoover dam on the Colorado River
between Arizona and Nevada. Water
ﬂowing through the dam generates elec-
tricity for both of these states and south-
ern California.

Q: Does a hydroelectric power plant release air pollution or carbon dioxide? Why or why not.
A: No, it is doesn’t. A hydroelectric plant doesn’t burn fuel, which is what produces air pollution in power plants
that generate electricity from fossil fuels or biomass.

Biomass

The stored chemical energy in organic matter or wastes is called biomass energy. The organic matter may be trees
or other plants, or it may be wastes from homes and industries. When biomass is burned, it produces thermal energy
that can be used for heating homes, cooking, or generating electricity. Biomass—especially wood—is an important
energy source in the poorer nations where most people can’t afford fossil fuels. However, burning biomass releases
air pollution and contributes to global climate change. Biomass can be used to make ethanol, a fuel that is added to
gasoline. Although ethanol releases less pollution than gasoline, large areas of land are needed to grow the plants
needed to make it (see Figure 5.20). This reduces the amount of land available for food production.

FIGURE 5.20
This large machine is harvesting and
grinding plants to make ethanol.

Geothermal Energy

Geothermal energy is thermal (“heat”) energy from below Earth’s surface. It can be used to heat homes or generate
electricity. A geothermal system pumps water underground where it is heated and then pumps the warm water back
to the home or power plant (see Figure 5.21). The thermal energy of the water can be used directly to heat the home.
Or it can be used to produce steam and generate electricity. Installing a geothermal system can be expensive because
of the need to drill through underground rocks, but the energy it uses is free.

5.8 Energy Use

• Describe energy use in the U.S.
• Compare oil use in the U.S. and other top oil-using nations.

This woman in Burkina Faso uses a simple wood ﬁre for cooking. For many people in the world, wood is their main
energy resource. They burn it to stay warm as well as to cook their food. Other energy resources, such as oil or gas,
are simply not available to them or are far too expensive for most people to use. However, if you live in the U.S.
or another of the richer nations of the world, you probably depend almost totally on these more expensive energy
resources, especially oil.

Use of Energy Resources

Look at the circle graph in the Figure 5.22. It shows that oil is the single most commonly used energy resource in
the U.S., followed by natural gas, and then by coal. All of these energy resources are nonrenewable. Nonrenewable
resources are resources that are limited in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up. Renewable
resources, in contrast, provide only 8 percent of all energy used in the U.S. Renewable resources are natural
resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limitless in supply. They include
solar energy from sunlight, geothermal energy from under Earth’s surface, wind, biomass (from once-living things
or their wastes), and hydropower (from running water).

Oil Use by Nation

People in the U.S. use far more energy—especially energy from oil—than people in any other nation. The bar graph
in the Figure 5.23 compares the amount of oil used by the top ten oil-using nations. The U.S. uses more oil than
several other top-ten countries combined. If you also consider the population size in these countries, the differences
are even more stunning. The average person in the U.S. uses a whopping 23 barrels of oil a year! In comparison, the
average person in India or China uses just 1 or 2 barrels of oil a year. At the following URL, you can explore energy
use per person in the U.S. and other countries or regions of the world over the past 50 years.

You won’t see this car on the road, at least not yet. It’s a concept car that was developed by a major automaker.
Instead of burning gasoline, it runs on hydrogen gas. Using hydrogen for fuel doesn’t produce pollution, and it

Conservation means saving resources by using them more efﬁciently, using less of them, or not using them at all.
You can read below about some of the ways you can conserve energy on the road and in the home. You can ﬁnd
more energy-saving tips at this URL: http://www.partselect.ca/resources/Home-Energy-Saving-Tips.aspx

Conserving Energy in Transportation

Much of the energy used in the U.S. is used for transportation. You can conserve transportation energy in several
ways. For example, you can:

• plan ahead to avoid unnecessary trips.

5.9. Energy Conservation

www.ck12.org

• take public transit such as subways (see Figure 5.24) instead of driving.
• drive an energy-efﬁcient vehicle when driving is the only way to get there.

FIGURE 5.24

Q: What are some other ways you could save energy in transportation?
A: You could carpool to save transportation energy. Even if you carpool with just one other person, that’s one less
vehicle on the road. For short trips, you could ride a bike or walk to you destination. The extra exercise is another
beneﬁt of using your own muscle power to get where you need to go.

Conserving Energy at Home

Many people waste energy at home, so a lot of energy can be saved there as well. What can you do to conserve
energy? You can:

• turn off lights and unplug appliances and other electrical devices when not in use.
• use energy-efﬁcient light bulbs and appliances.
• turn the thermostat down in winter and up in summer.

5.10 Thermal Energy

• Deﬁne thermal energy.
• Relate thermal energy to temperature and mass.

This unusual landscape is found in the hottest place in the U.S.: Death Valley, California. The temperature of the
air near the ground can be as high as 57 °C (134 °F)—and that’s in the shade (if you can ﬁnd any)! The temperature
of the sand in the baking sun can be much higher. If you were to walk barefoot on the hot sand, it would burn your
feet. The air and sand in Death Valley have a lot of thermal energy.

What Is Thermal Energy?

Why do the air and sand of Death Valley feel so hot? It’s because their particles are moving very rapidly. Anything
that is moving has kinetic energy, and the faster it is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. The total kinetic energy
of moving particles of matter is called thermal energy. It’s not just hot things such as the air and sand of Death
Valley that have thermal energy. All matter has thermal energy, even matter that feels cold. That’s because the
particles of all matter are in constant motion and have kinetic energy.

Thermal Energy, Temperature, and Mass

Thermal energy and temperature are closely related. Both reﬂect the kinetic energy of moving particles of matter.
However, temperature is the average kinetic energy of particles of matter, whereas thermal energy is the total
kinetic energy of particles of matter. Does this mean that matter with a lower temperature has less thermal energy
than matter with a higher temperature? Not necessarily. Another factor also affects thermal energy. The other factor
is mass.
Q: Look at the pot of soup and the tub of water in the Figure 5.27. Which do you think has greater thermal energy?

776

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

A: The soup is boiling hot and has a temperature of 100 °C, whereas the water in the tub is just comfortably warm,
with a temperature of about 38 °C. Although the water in the tub has a much lower temperature, it has greater thermal
energy.

FIGURE 5.27

The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the
soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup
in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the
water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in
the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the
following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.”
http://www.absorblearning.com/media/item.action?quick=ad
Q: Could a block of ice have more thermal energy than a pot of boiling water?
A: Yes, the block of ice could have more thermal energy if its mass was much greater than the mass of the boiling
water.

Summary

• The total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter is called thermal energy.
• The thermal energy of matter depends on how fast its particles are moving on average, which is measured by

temperature, and also on how many particles there are, which is measured by mass.

5.11 Temperature

• Deﬁne temperature.
• Explain how temperature is measured and how a thermometer works.
• Describe three temperature scales, and show how to convert temperatures from one scale to another.

This boy has a fever, and it makes him feel miserable. He feels achy and really tired. He also feels hot because his
temperature is higher than normal. He has a thermometer in his mouth to measure his temperature.

What Is Temperature?

No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something
feels. In physics, temperature is deﬁned as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of
matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature,
matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature
is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.

How a Thermometer Measures Temperature

Many thermometers measure temperature with a liquid that expands when it gets warmer and contracts when it gets
cooler. Look at the common household thermometer pictured in the Figure 5.28. The red liquid rises or falls in the
glass tube as the temperature changes. Temperature is read off the scale at the height of the liquid in the tube. To
learn more about measuring temperature, watch the animation “Measuring Temperature” at this URL: http://www.s
ciencehelpdesk.com/unit/science2/3
Q: Why does the liquid in the thermometer expand and contract when temperature changes?

779

5.11. Temperature

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 5.28

A: When the temperature is higher, particles of the liquid have greater kinetic energy, so they move about more and
spread apart. This causes the liquid to expand. The opposite happens when the temperature is lower and particles of
liquid have less kinetic energy. The particles move less and crowd closer together, causing the liquid to contract.

Temperature Scales

The thermometer pictured in the Figure 5.28 measures temperature on two different scales: Celsius (C) and Fahren-
heit (F). Although some scientists use the Celsius scale, the SI scale for measuring temperature is the Kelvin scale.
If you live in the U.S., you are probably most familiar with the Fahrenheit scale. The Table 5.1 compares all
three temperature scales. Each scale uses as reference points the freezing and boiling points of water. Notice that
temperatures on the Kelvin scale are not given in degrees (°).

Freezing Point of Water
273 K
0 °C
32 °F

Boiling Point of Water
373 K

212 °F

Because all three temperature scales are frequently used, it’s useful to know how to convert temperatures from one
scale to another. It’s easy to convert temperatures between the Kelvin and Celsius scales. Each 1-degree change on
the Kelvin scale is equal to a 1-degree change on the Celsius scale. Therefore, to convert a temperature from Celsius
to Kelvin, just add 273 to the Celsius temperature. For example, 10 °C equals 283 Kelvin.
Q: How would you convert a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius?
A: You would subtract 273 from the Kelvin temperature. For example, a temperature of 300 Kevin equals 27 °C.
Converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit is more complicated. The following conversion factors can be used:
780

Celsius → Fahrenheit: (°C × 1.8) + 32 = °F
Fahrenheit → Celsius: (°F - 32) ÷ 1.8 = °C

5.12 Heat

• Deﬁne heat.
• Explain how thermal energy is transferred.

This chef is taking corn bread out of a hot oven. What happened to the batter when it was put in the oven? Did the
hot oven add “heat energy” to the batter? Not exactly. Contrary to popular belief, heat is not a form of energy.

What Is Heat?

Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between substances. Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of moving particles
of matter, measured by their temperature. Thermal energy always moves from matter with greater thermal energy to
matter with less thermal energy, so it moves from warmer to cooler substances. You can see this in the Figure 5.29.
Faster-moving particles of the warmer substance bump into and transfer some of their energy to slower-moving
particles of the cooler substance. Thermal energy is transferred in this way until both substances have the same
thermal energy and temperature. For a visual introduction to these concepts, watch the animation “Temperature vs.
Heat” at this URL:
http://www.sciencehelpdesk.com/unit/science2/3
Q: How is thermal energy transferred in an oven?
A: Thermal energy of the hot oven is transferred to the cooler food, raising its temperature.

Cooling Down by Heating Up

How do you cool down a glass of room-temperature cola? You probably add ice cubes to it, as in the Figure 5.30.
You might think that the ice cools down the cola, but in fact, it works the other way around. The warm cola heats up
the ice. Thermal energy from the warm cola is transferred to the much colder ice, causing it to melt. The cola loses
thermal energy in the process, so its temperature falls.

5.13 Speciﬁc Heat

• Deﬁne speciﬁc heat.
• Describe variation in the speciﬁc heat of different substances.

This girl and her brother are having fun at the beach. It’s a warm, sunny day, and the sand feels hot on their bare
feet. They take a dip in the water whenever they want to cool off because the water feels much cooler than the sand.
Why does the sand—but not the water—get hot in the sun? The answer has to do with speciﬁc heat.

Be Speciﬁc

Speciﬁc heat is a measure of how much energy it takes to raise the temperature of a substance. It is the amount of
energy (in joules) needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 °C. Speciﬁc heat is a property that
is speciﬁc to a given type of matter. That’s why it’s called speciﬁc.

Variation in Speciﬁc Heat

The Table 5.2 compares the speciﬁc heat of four different substances. Metals such as iron have low speciﬁc heat.
It doesn’t take much energy to raise their temperature. That’s why a metal spoon heats up quickly when placed in
a cup of hot coffee. Sand also has a relatively low speciﬁc heat. Water, on the other hand, has a very high speciﬁc
heat. It takes a lot more energy to increase the temperature of water than sand. This explains why the sand on a
beach gets hot while the water stays cool. Differences in the speciﬁc heat of water and land even affect climate. To
learn how, watch the video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkBStF2Rnu4

A: Wood has a higher speciﬁc heat than metal, so it takes more energy to heat a wooden handle than a metal handle.
As a result, a wooden handle would heat up more slowly and be less likely to burn your hand when you touch it.

Summary

• Speciﬁc heat is a measure of how much energy it takes to raise the temperature of a substance. It is the amount

of energy (in joules) needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 °C.

5.14 Heat Conduction

• Deﬁne conduction and explain how it occurs.
• Describe examples of conduction.

Yummy! These cookies look delicious. But watch out! They just ﬁnished baking in a hot oven, so the cookie sheet
is too hot to handle without an oven mitt. Touching the cookie sheet with bare hands could cause a painful burn. Do
you know why? The answer is conduction.

What Is Conduction?

Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter that are touching. Thermal energy is the
total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, and the transfer of thermal energy is called heat. Conduction
is one of three ways that thermal energy can be transferred (the other ways are convection and thermal radiation).
Thermal energy is always transferred from matter with a higher temperature to matter with a lower temperature.

Pass It On

To understand how conduction works, you need to think about the tiny particles that make up matter. The particles
of all matter are in constant random motion, but the particles of warmer matter have more energy and move more
quickly than the particles of cooler matter. When particles of warmer matter collide with particles of cooler matter,
they transfer some of their thermal energy to the cooler particles. From particle to particle, like dominoes falling,
thermal energy moves through matter. Click on the animation “Conduction” at this URL to see an animation of
conduction:

In the opening photo above, conduction occurs between particles of metal in the cookie sheet and anything cooler
that comes into contact with it—hopefully, not someone’s bare hands! For a deeper understanding of this method of
heat transfer, watch the animation “Conduction” at this URL:
http://www.sciencehelpdesk.com/unit/science2/3

Examples of Conduction

The cookie sheet in the opening image transfers thermal energy to the cookies and helps them bake. There are
many other common examples of conduction. The Figure 5.31 shows a few situations in which thermal energy is
transferred in this way.

hot cocoa feels good when you have cold
hands. Camp Stove: This camp stove
can be used to cook food in a small pot.
Snow: Ouch! Can you imagine how cold
this snow must feel on bare feet?

Q: How is thermal energy transferred in each of the situations pictured in the Figure 5.31?
A: Thermal energy is transferred by conduction from the hot iron to the shirt, from the hot cup to the hand holding it,
from the ﬂame of the camp stove to the bottom of the pot as well as from the bottom of the pot to the food inside, and
from the feet to the snow. The shirt, hand, pot, food, and snow become warmer because of the transferred energy.
Because the feet lose thermal energy, they feel colder.

www.ck12.org

5.15 Convection

• Deﬁne convection, and explain how it occurs.
• Describe convection currents.
• Give examples of the transfer of thermal energy by convection.

Do you see the water bubbling in this pot? The water is boiling hot. How does all of the water in the pot get hot
when it is heated only from the bottom by the gas ﬂame? The answer is convection.

Deﬁning Convection

Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by particles moving through a ﬂuid (either a gas or a liquid). Thermal
energy is the total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, and the transfer of thermal energy is called heat.
Convection is one of three ways that thermal energy can be transferred (the other ways are conduction and thermal
radiation). Thermal energy is always transferred from matter with a higher temperature to matter with a lower
temperature.

How Does Convection Occur?

The Figure 5.32 shows how convection occurs, using hot water in a pot as an example. When particles in one area
of a ﬂuid (in this case, the water at the bottom of the pot) gain thermal energy, they move more quickly, have more
collisions, and spread farther apart. This decreases the density of the particles, so they rise up through the ﬂuid.
As they rise, they transfer their thermal energy to other particles of the ﬂuid and cool off in the process. With less
energy, the particles move more slowly, have fewer collisions, and move closer together. This increases their density,

790

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

so they sink back down through the ﬂuid. When they reach the bottom of the ﬂuid, the cycle repeats. The result is
a loop of moving particles called a convection current. You can learn more about convection currents by watching
the cartoon video called “Convection” at this URL: http://www.sciencehelpdesk.com/unit/science2/3

FIGURE 5.32

Examples of Convection

Convection currents transfer thermal energy through many ﬂuids, not just hot water in a pot. For example, convection
currents transfer thermal energy through molten rock below Earth’s surface, through water in the oceans, and through
air in the atmosphere. Convection currents in the atmosphere create winds. You can see one way this happens in the
Figure 5.33. The land heats up and cools off faster than the water because it has lower speciﬁc heat. Therefore, the
land gets warmer during the day and cooler at night than the water does. During the day, warm air rises above the
land and cool air from the water moves in to take its place. During the night, the opposite happens. Warm air rises
above the water and cool air from the land moves out to take its place.

www.ck12.org

Q: During the day, in which direction is thermal energy of the air transferred? In which direction is it transferred
during the night?
A: During the day, thermal energy is transferred from the air over the land to the air over the water. During the night,
thermal energy is transferred in the opposite direction.

Summary

• Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by particles moving through a ﬂuid. Thermal energy is always

transferred from an area with a higher temperature to an area with a lower temperature.

• Moving particles transfer thermal energy through a ﬂuid by forming convection currents.
• Convection currents move thermal energy through many ﬂuids, including molten rock inside Earth, water in

the oceans, and air in the atmosphere.

5.16 Thermal Radiation

• Describe how thermal energy is transferred by thermal radiation.
• Give examples of thermal radiation.

Someone is warming his hands over a bonﬁre. He doesn’t have to touch the ﬁre to feel its warmth. How is warmth
from the ﬁre transferred to his hands? In this article, you’ll ﬁnd out.

Introducing Thermal Radiation

The bonﬁre from the opening image has a lot of thermal energy. Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of moving
particles of matter, and the transfer of thermal energy is called heat. Thermal energy from the bonﬁre is transferred
to the hands by thermal radiation. Thermal radiation is the transfer of thermal energy by waves that can travel
through air or even through empty space, as shown in the Figure 5.35. When the waves of thermal energy reach
objects, they transfer the energy to the objects, causing them to warm up. This is how the ﬁre warms the hands of
someone sitting near the bonﬁre. This is also how the sun’s energy reaches Earth and heats its surface. Without the
energy radiated from the sun, Earth would be too cold to support life as we know it.
Thermal radiation is one of three ways that thermal energy can be transferred. The other two ways are conduction
and convection, both of which need matter to transfer energy. Radiation is the only way of transferring thermal
energy that doesn’t require matter. To learn more about thermal radiation, watch “Radiation” at the URL below.

Sources of Thermal Radiation

You might be surprised to learn that everything radiates thermal energy, not just really hot things such as the sun
or a ﬁre. For example, when it’s cold outside, a heated home radiates some of its thermal energy into the outdoor
environment. A home that is poorly insulated radiates more energy than a home that is well insulated. Special
cameras can be used to detect radiated heat. In the Figure 5.36, you can see an image created by one of these
cameras. The areas that are yellow are the areas where the greatest amount of thermal energy is radiating from the
home. Even people radiate thermal energy. In fact, when a room is full of people, it may feel noticeably warmer
because of all the thermal energy the people radiate!
Q: Where is thermal radiation radiating from the home in the picture?
A: The greatest amount of thermal energy is radiating from the window on the upper left. A lot of thermal energy is
also radiating from the edges of the windows and door.

Summary

• Thermal radiation is the transfer of thermal energy by waves that can travel through air or even through empty
space. This is how thermal energy from a ﬁre is transferred to your hands and how thermal energy from the
sun is transferred to Earth.

• Everything radiates thermal energy, even objects that aren’t very warm.

5.17 Thermal Conductors and Insulators

• Deﬁne and give examples of thermal conductors.
• Describe thermal insulators and ways they are used.

Do you like toast? Did you ever look inside a toaster while it’s toasting bread? When you push down the lever to
turn on the toaster, the metal heating element inside starts to glow orange or red almost instantly. You can see the
glowing heating element inside this yellow toaster. The glowing metal shows that the heating element has become
very hot. It gets hot so quickly because metals are good conductors of thermal energy.

Thermal Conductors

Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter that are touching. Thermal conduction
occurs when particles of warmer matter bump into particles of cooler matter and transfer some of their thermal
energy to the cooler particles. Conduction is usually faster in certain solids and liquids than in gases. Materials
that are good conductors of thermal energy are called thermal conductors. Metals are especially good thermal
conductors because they have freely moving electrons that can transfer thermal energy quickly and easily.
Besides the heating element inside a toaster, another example of a thermal conductor is a metal radiator, like the one
in the Figure 5.37. When hot water ﬂows through the coils of the radiator, the metal quickly heats up by conduction
and then radiates thermal energy into the surrounding air.
Q: Thermal conductors have many uses, but sometimes it’s important to prevent the transfer of thermal energy. Can
you think of an example?
A: One example is staying warm on a cold day. You will stay warmer if you can prevent the transfer of your own
thermal energy to the outside air.

FIGURE 5.37

Thermal Insulators

One way to retain your own thermal energy on a cold day is to wear clothes that trap air. That’s because air, like other
gases, is a poor conductor of thermal energy. The particles of gases are relatively far apart, so they don’t bump into
each other or into other things as often as the more closely spaced particles of liquids or solids. Therefore, particles
of gases have fewer opportunities to transfer thermal energy. Materials that are poor thermal conductors are called
thermal insulators. Down-ﬁlled snowsuits, like those in the Figure 5.38, are good thermal insulators because their
feather ﬁlling traps a lot of air.

FIGURE 5.38

Another example of a thermal insulator is pictured in the Figure 5.39. The picture shows ﬂuffy pink insulation
inside the attic of a home. Like the down ﬁlling in a snowsuit, the insulation traps a lot of air. The insulation helps to
prevent the transfer of thermal energy into the house on hot days and out of the house on cold days. Other materials
that are thermal insulators include plastic and wood. That’s why pot handles and cooking utensils are often made of
these materials. Notice that the outside of the toaster pictured in the opening image is made of plastic. The plastic
casing helps prevent the transfer of thermal energy from the heating element inside to the outer surface of the toaster
where it could cause burns. You can learn more about thermal insulators at this URL: http://www.school-for-champi
ons.com/science/thermal_insulation.htm .
Q: Thermal insulators have many practical uses besides the uses mentioned above. Can you think of others?
A: Thermal insulators are often used to keep food or drinks hot or cold. For example, Styrofoam® coolers and
thermos containers are used for these purposes.

5.18 Heating Systems

• State the function of a home heating system.
• Explain how hot-water and warm-air heating systems work.

A roaring blaze in a ﬁreplace is a good way to keep toes toasty on a cold winter day. But you probably wouldn’t use
a ﬁreplace to heat an entire house. Do you know how your home is heated?

Heating the Home

Modern home heating systems keep us comfortable in cold weather. We may even depend on them for our survival.
But we often take them for granted. Two common types of home heating systems are hot-water and warm-air heating
systems. Both types are described below. You can watch an animation showing how a solar heating system works at
the following URL.
http://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/AP%20Environmental%20Science/course%20files/multimedia/lesson67/ani
mations/4e_solar_heating_system.html
Thermal energy is the total energy of moving particles of matter. The transfer of thermal energy is called heat.
Therefore, a heating system is a system for the transfer of thermal energy. Regardless of the type of heating system
in a home, the basic function is the same: to produce thermal energy and transfer it to air throughout the house.

Hot-Water Heating System

A hot-water heating system produces thermal energy to heat water and then pumps the hot water throughout the
building in a system of pipes and radiators. You can see a simple diagram of this type of heating system in the
Figure 5.40.

799

5.18. Heating Systems

www.ck12.org

• Water is heated in a boiler that burns a fuel such as natural gas or heating oil. The boiler converts the chemical

energy stored in the fuel to thermal energy.

• The heated water is pumped from the boiler through pipes and radiators throughout the house. There is usually

a radiator in each room. The radiators get warm when the hot water ﬂows through them.

• The warm radiators radiate thermal energy to the air around them. The warm air then circulates throughout

the rooms in convection currents.

• The hot water cools as it ﬂows through the system and transfers its thermal energy. When it ﬁnally returns to

the boiler, it is heated again and the cycle repeats.

FIGURE 5.40

Q: Look closely at the hot-water heating system in the Figure 5.40. The radiator is a coiled pipe through which
hot water ﬂows. What happens to the water as it ﬂows through the radiator? Why is each radiator connected to two
pipes? Why can’t water ﬂow directly from one radiator to another through a single pipe?
A: The radiator is where most of the energy transfer occurs. Water passes through such a great length of pipe in the
radiator that it transfers a lot of thermal energy to the radiator. As the water transfers thermal energy, it gets cooler.
The cool water ﬂows into a return pipe rather than going directly to another radiator because the cool water no longer
has enough thermal energy to heat a room.

Warm-Air Heating System

A warm-air heating system uses thermal energy to heat air and then forces the warm air through a system of ducts
and registers. You can see a this type of heating system in the Figure 5.41.

• The air is heated in a furnace that burns fuel such as natural gas, propane, or heating oil.
• After the air gets warm, a fan blows it through the ducts and out through the registers that are located in each

room.

• Warm air blowing out of a register moves across the room, pushing cold air out of the way.
• The cold air enters a return register across the room and returns to the furnace with the help of another fan.
• In the furnace, the cold air is heated, and the cycle repeats.

Q: How does a home heating system “know” when to run and when to stop running?
A: A home heating system is turned on or off by a thermostat.

Warm-air heating system.

How a Thermostat Works

A thermostat, like the one seen in the Figure 5.42, is an important part of any home heating system. It is like the
“brain” of the entire system. It constantly monitors the temperature in the home and “tells” the boiler or furnace
when to turn on or off. The thermostat is set at a selected temperature, say 71 °F. When the temperature in the home
starts to fall below this point, the thermostat triggers the boiler or furnace to start running. When the temperature
starts to rise above this point, the thermostat triggers the boiler or furnace to stop running. In this way, the thermostat
maintains the home’s temperature at the set point.

5.19 Cooling Systems

• State the purpose of a cooling system.
• Explain how a refrigerator works.
• Describe the role of the refrigerant in a cooling system

A refrigerator door makes a great message center. Its smooth metal surface is perfect for sticky notes and magnets.
In most homes, a refrigerator is one of the hardest working appliances, but not just because it holds messages. Unlike
most other home appliances, a refrigerator generally runs nonstop every day of the year. Can you think of another
home appliance that gets such constant use?

Purpose of a Cooling System

A refrigerator is an example of a cooling system. Another example is an air conditioner. The purpose of any cooling
system is to transfer thermal energy in order to keep things cool. A refrigerator, for example, transfers thermal
energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator to the warm air in the kitchen. If you’ve ever noticed how warm the
back of a running refrigerator gets, then you know that it releases a lot of thermal energy into the room.
Q: Thermal energy always moves from a warmer area to a cooler area. How can thermal energy move from the
cooler air inside a refrigerator to the warmer air in a room?
A: The answer is work.

How a Refrigerator Works

A refrigerator must do work to reverse the normal direction of thermal energy ﬂow. Work involves the use of force
to move something, and doing work takes energy. In a refrigerator, the energy is usually provided by electricity. You
can read in detail in the Figure 5.43 how a refrigerator does its work. For an animation of how a refrigerator works,

The Refrigerant

www.ck12.org

The key to how a refrigerator or other cooling system works is the refrigerant. A refrigerant is a substance such
as FreonTM that has a low boiling point and changes between liquid and gaseous states as it passes through the
refrigerator. As a liquid, the refrigerant absorbs thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator and changes
to a gas. As a gas, it transfers thermal energy to the warm air outside the refrigerator and changes back to a liquid.
Work is done by a refrigerator to move the refrigerant through the different components of the refrigerator.

FIGURE 5.43

Summary

• The purpose of a cooling system such as a refrigerator or air conditioner is to transfer thermal energy in order

to keep things cool.

• A refrigerator transfers thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator to the warm air in the kitchen.
Thermal energy normally moves from a warmer area to a cooler area, so a refrigerator must do work to reverse
the normal direction of heat ﬂow.

5.20 External Combustion Engines

• Identify the purpose of a combustion engine.
• Deﬁne external combustion engine.
• Outline how an external combustion engine works.

This picture was taken in 1899 (the color was added later). The picture shows the inventor of an early automobile,
along with his wife, driving one of his inventions. The man and woman were on their way to the top of Mount
Washington, the highest mountain in the eastern U.S. The purpose of the trip up the mountain was to get publicity
for the steam-powered automobile. The inventor and his wife were the ﬁrst people to ever reach the top of the
mountain by car. Steam engines are not used very much anymore, because more efﬁcient and powerful engines have
been developed. But inventors and engineers learned a lot from these early combustion engines.
Q: How else were steam engines used?
A: Starting in the 1700s and up until the early 1900s, steam engines were commonly used to run factory machines,
train locomotives, and ships. Their power led to a revolution in industry and transportation.

What Is a Combustion Engine?

A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the thermal
energy to do work. There are two types of combustion engines: external and internal. A steam engine is an external
combustion engine.

How an External Combustion Engine Works

An external combustion engine burns fuel externally, or outside the engine. The burning fuel releases thermal
energy, which is used to heat water and change it to steam. The pressure of the steam moves a piston back and
forth inside a cylinder. The kinetic energy of the moving piston can be used to turn a vehicle’s wheels, a turbine, or
other mechanical device. The Figure 5.44 explains in greater detail how this type of engine works. You can see an
animated external combustion engine at this URL: http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment

energy to do work.

• An external combustion engine burns fuel externally, or outside the engine.
• An external combustion engine burns fuel to heat water and produce steam. The steam is under pressure and
is used to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. As the piston moves back and forth, it moves a piston
rod, which can do work.

• Deﬁne combustion engine and internal combustion engine.
• Explain how an internal combustion engine works.
• Describe how kinetic energy from an internal combustion engine is used to turn the wheels of a car.

This racecar isn’t really burning up the road. The ﬂames were added to show that the car is zooming down the road
at a high rate of speed. A racecar can move so fast because it has a powerful combustion engine.

Introducing Combustion Engines

A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the energy
to do work. In a car, the engine does the work of providing kinetic energy that turns the wheels. The combustion
engine in a car is a type of engine called an internal combustion engine. (Another type of combustion engine is an
external combustion engine.)

How an Internal Combustion Engine Works

An internal combustion engine burns fuel internally, or inside the engine. This type of engine is found not only in
cars but in most other motor vehicles as well. The engine works in a series of steps, which keep repeating. You can
follow the steps in the Figure 5.45.

1. A mixture of fuel and air is pulled-into a cylinder through a valve, which then closes.

808

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

2. A piston inside the cylinder moves upward, compressing the fuel-air mixture in the closed cylinder. The

mixture is now under a lot of pressure and very warm.

3. A spark from a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture, causing it to burn explosively within the conﬁned space

of the closed cylinder.

4. The pressure of the hot gases from combustion pushes the piston downward.
5. The piston moves up again, pushing exhaust gases out of the cylinder through another valve.
6. The piston moves downward again, and the cycle repeats.

Q: The internal combustion engine converts thermal energy to another form of energy. Which form of energy is it?
A: The engine converts thermal energy to kinetic energy, or the energy of a moving object—in this case, the moving
piston.

How Energy from the Engine Turns the Wheels

In a car, the piston in the engine is connected by the piston rod to the crankshaft. The crankshaft rotates when the
piston moves up and down. The crankshaft, in turn, is connected to the driveshaft. When the crankshaft rotates, so
does the driveshaft. The rotating driveshaft turns the wheels of the car.

809

5.21. Internal Combustion Engines

How Many Cylinders?

www.ck12.org

Most cars have at least four cylinders connected to the crankshaft. Their pistons move up and down in sequence, one
after the other. A powerful car may have eight pistons, and some racecars may have even more. The more cylinders
a car engine has, the more powerful its engine can be.

Summary

• A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the energy

to do work. An internal combustion engine burns fuel internally, or inside the engine.

• In an internal combustion engine, a mixture of fuel and air is burned in a closed cylinder, forcing a piston to

move up and down.

• In a car, the moving piston rotates a crankshaft, which turns a driveshaft. The turning driveshaft causes the

5.22 Mechanical Wave

• Describe mechanical waves.
• Deﬁne the medium of a mechanical wave.
• Identify three types of mechanical waves.

No doubt you’ve seen this happen. Droplets of water fall into a body of water, and concentric circles spread out
through the water around the droplets. The concentric circles are waves moving through the water.

Waves in Matter

The waves in the picture above are examples of mechanical waves. A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter
that transfers energy through the matter. A mechanical wave starts when matter is disturbed. A source of energy is
needed to disturb matter and start a mechanical wave.
Q: Where does the energy come from in the water wave pictured above?
A: The energy comes from the falling droplets of water, which have kinetic energy because of their motion.

The Medium

The energy of a mechanical wave can travel only through matter. The matter through which the wave travels is called
the medium (plural, media). The medium in the water wave pictured above is water, a liquid. But the medium of a
mechanical wave can be any state of matter, even a solid.
Q: How do the particles of the medium move when a wave passes through them?
A: The particles of the medium just vibrate in place. As they vibrate, they pass the energy of the disturbance to the
particles next to them, which pass the energy to the particles next to them, and so on. Particles of the medium don’t
actually travel along with the wave. Only the energy of the wave travels through the medium.

811

5.22. Mechanical Wave

Types of Mechanical Waves

www.ck12.org

There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. They differ in how particles
of the medium move. You can see this in the Figure 5.46 and in the animation at the following URL. http://www.a
cs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/waves/wavemotion.html

FIGURE 5.46

• In a transverse wave, particles of the medium vibrate up and down perpendicular to the direction of the wave.
• In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium vibrate back and forth parallel to the direction of the wave.
• In a surface wave, particles of the medium vibrate both up and down and back and forth, so they end up

moving in a circle.

Q: How do you think surface waves are related to transverse and longitudinal waves?
A: A surface wave is combination of a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave.

5.23 Transverse Wave

• Describe transverse waves.
• Identify the crests and troughs of a transverse wave.
• Deﬁne S waves.

Can you guess what this picture shows? Here’s a hint: the objects in the picture have been magniﬁed, and one of
them is moving rapidly. The objects are guitar strings, and the moving string is the one on the bottom right. The
string is moving because it has just been plucked. Plucking the string gave it energy, which is moving through the
string in a mechanical wave. A mechanical wave is a wave that travels through matter. The matter a mechanical
wave travels through is called the medium. The type of mechanical wave passing through the vibrating guitar string
is a transverse wave.

What Is a Transverse Wave?

A transverse wave is a wave in which particles of the medium vibrate at right angles, or perpendicular, to the
direction that the wave travels. Another example of a transverse wave is the wave that passes through a rope with
you shake one end of the rope up and down, as in the Figure 5.47. The direction of the wave is down the length of
the rope away from the hand. The rope itself moves up and down as the wave passes through it. You can watch a
video of a transverse wave in a rope at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZIr9mpERbU .

A: The wave travels down the string to the end. The string vibrates up and down at right angles to the direction of

Crests and Troughs

A transverse wave is characterized by the high and low points reached by particles of the medium as the wave passes
through. The high points are called crests, and the low points are called troughs. You can see both in the Figure
below.

S Waves

Transverse waves called S waves occur during earthquakes. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends
transverse waves through underground rocks in all directions away from the disturbance. S waves may travel for
hundreds of miles. An S wave is modeled in the Figure 5.49.

Summary

• A transverse wave is a wave in which particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction that the

wave travels.

• The high points of a transverse wave are called crests, and the low points are called troughs.
• S waves are transverse waves that travel through underground rocks during earthquakes.

5.24 Longitudinal Wave

• Describe a longitudinal wave.
• Identify compressions and rarefactions of a longitudinal wave.
• Deﬁne P waves.

You’ve probably played with Slinky spring toys like these. They’re simple toys, but they can move in very interesting
ways. Pushing in on the end of a spring toy, for example, gives it energy that moves through the spring in a
longitudinal wave.

What Is a Longitudinal Wave?

A longitudinal wave is a type of mechanical wave. A mechanical wave is a wave that travels through matter, called
the medium. In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium vibrate in a direction that is parallel to the direction
that the wave travels. You can see this in the Figure 5.50. The person’s hand pushes and pulls on one end of the
spring. The energy of this disturbance passes through the coils of the spring to the other end. You can see a video of
a longitudinal wave in a spring at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubRlaCCQfDk .

Compressions and Rarefactions

Notice in the Figure 5.50 that the coils of the spring ﬁrst crowd closer together and then spread farther apart as the
wave passes through them. Places where particles of a medium crowd closer together are called compressions, and
places where the particles spread farther apart are called rarefactions. The more energy the wave has, the closer
together the particles are in compressions and the farther apart they are in rarefactions.

P Waves

Earthquakes cause longitudinal waves called P waves. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends longitudinal
waves through underground rocks in all directions away from the disturbance. P waves are modeled in the Figure
5.51.

FIGURE 5.51

Q: Where are the compressions and rarefactions of the medium in this model of P waves?
A: The compressions are the places where the vertical lines are closest together. The rarefactions are the places
where the vertical lines are farthest apart.

Summary

• Describe the motion of particles of the medium in a surface wave.
• Explain why ocean waves break near the shore.

This immense wall of moving water gives the surfer an amazing ride. The swelling surf raises him up and pushes
him forward as though he’s as light as a feather. All he needs to do is keep his balance on the surfboard. The
incredible power of the wave will do the rest. Ocean waves like this one are examples of surface waves.

Waves on the Surface

A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium. The medium is the matter through which the
wave travels. Ocean waves are the best-known examples of surface waves. They travel on the surface of the water
between the ocean and the air.
Q: What do you think causes ocean waves?
A: Most ocean waves are caused by wind blowing across the water. Moving air molecules transfer some of their
energy to molecules of ocean water. The energy travels across the surface of the water in waves. The stronger the
winds are blowing, the larger the waves are and the more energy they have.

How the Medium Moves

A surface wave is a combination of a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave. A transverse wave is a wave in which
particles of the medium move up and down perpendicular to the direction of the wave. A longitudinal wave is a
wave in which particles of the medium move parallel to the direction of the wave. In a surface wave, particles of the

820

medium move up and down as well as back and forth. This gives them an overall circular motion. You can see how
the particles move in the Figure 5.52 and at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yPTa8qi5X8

FIGURE 5.52

Why Waves Break

In deep water, particles of water just move in circles. They don’t actually move closer to shore with the energy of the
waves. However, near the shore where the water is shallow, the waves behave differently. Look at the Figure 5.53.
You can see how the waves start to drag on the bottom in shallow water. This creates friction that slows down the
bottoms of the waves, while the tops of the waves keep moving at the same speed. The difference in speed causes
the waves to get steeper until they topple over and break. The crashing waves carry water onto the shore as surf.
Q: In this diagram of a wave breaking near shore, where do you think a surfer would try to catch the wave?
A: The surfer would try to catch the wave where it starts to steepen and lean forward toward the shore.

Summary

• A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium. Ocean waves are the best-known examples

of surface waves.

• In a surface wave, particles of the medium move up and down as well as back and forth in an overall circular

motion. The particles don’t actually move closer to shore as the waves pass through.

• In shallow water close to shore, waves start to drag on the bottom of the water. The bottoms—but not the
tops—of the wave slow down because of friction. This causes the waves to steepen until they break and fall
over, carrying water onto the shore as surf.

5.26 Wave Amplitude

• Deﬁne wave amplitude.
• State how to measure the amplitude of transverse and longitudinal waves.
• Explain what determines the amplitude of a wave.

On a windy day, moving air particles strike these ﬂags and transfer their energy of motion to particles of fabric. The
energy travels through the fabric in waves. You can see the waves rippling through the brightly colored cloth. The
windier the day is, the more vigorously the ﬂags wave.

What’s the Matter?

Waves that travel through matter—such as the fabric of a ﬂag—are called mechanical waves. The matter they travel
through is called the medium. When the energy of a wave passes through the medium, particles of the medium
move. The more energy the wave has, the farther the particles of the medium move. The distance the particles move
is measured by the wave’s amplitude.

What Is Wave Amplitude?

Wave amplitude is the maximum distance the particles of the medium move from their resting positions when a
wave passes through. The resting position of a particle of the medium is where the particle would be in the absence
of a wave. The Figure 5.54 show the amplitudes of two different types of waves: transverse and longitudinal waves.

• In a transverse wave, particles of the medium move up and down at right angles to the direction of the wave.
Wave amplitude of a transverse wave is the difference in height between the crest and the resting position. The
crest is the highest point particles of the medium reach. The higher the crests are, the greater the amplitude of
the wave.

823

5.26. Wave Amplitude

www.ck12.org

• In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium move back and forth in the same direction as the wave. Wave
amplitude of a longitudinal wave is the distance between particles of the medium where it is compressed by
the wave. The closer together the particles are, the greater the amplitude of the wave.

FIGURE 5.54

Q: What do you think determines a wave’s amplitude?
A: Wave amplitude is determined by the energy of the disturbance that causes the wave.

Energy and Amplitude

A wave caused by a disturbance with more energy has greater amplitude. Imagine dropping a small pebble into
a pond of still water. Tiny ripples will move out from the disturbance in concentric circles. The ripples are low-
amplitude waves with very little energy. Now imagine throwing a big boulder into the pond. Very large waves will
be generated by the disturbance. These waves are high-amplitude waves and have a great deal of energy.

Nobody really has such colorful eyes! The colors were added digitally after the photo was taken. They represent all
the different colors of light. Light is a form of energy that travels in waves. Light of different colors has different
wavelengths.

Deﬁning Wavelength

Wavelength is one way of measuring the size of waves. It is the distance between two corresponding points on
adjacent waves, and it is usually measured in meters. How it is measured is a little different for transverse and
longitudinal waves.

• In a transverse wave, particles of the medium vibrate up and down at right angles to the direction that the wave
travels. The wavelength of a transverse wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent crests, or
high points, as shown in the Figure 5.57.

• In a longitudinal wave, particles of matter vibrate back and forth in the same direction that the wave travels.
The wavelength of a longitudinal wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent compressions,
as shown in the Figure 5.58. Compressions are the places where particles of the medium crowd close together
as the energy of the wave passes through.

Wavelength and Wave Energy

wavelength waves of the same amplitude. (Amplitude is a measure of how far particles of the medium move up and
down or back and forth when a wave passes through them.) You can see examples of transverse waves with shorter
and longer wavelengths in the Figure 5.59.
Q: Of all the colors of visible light, red light has the longest wavelength and violet light has the shortest wavelength.
Which color of light has the greatest energy?
A: Violet light has the greatest energy because it has the shortest wavelength.

Summary

• Wavelength is one way of measuring the size of waves. It is the distance between two corresponding points

on adjacent waves, usually measured in meters.

• The wavelength of a transverse wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent crests. The

www.ck12.org

5.28 Wave Frequency

• Deﬁne wave frequency.
• Identify the SI unit for wave frequency.
• Explain how wave frequency is related to the energy of a wave.

Imagine making transverse waves in a rope, like the person in the sketch above. You tie one end of the rope to a tree
or other ﬁxed point, and then you shake the other end of the rope up and down with your hand. You can move the
rope up and down slowly or quickly. How quickly you move the rope determines the frequency of the waves.

What Is Wave Frequency?

The number of waves that pass a ﬁxed point in a given amount of time is wave frequency. Wave frequency can
be measured by counting the number of crests (high points) of waves that pass the ﬁxed point in 1 second or some
other time period. The higher the number is, the greater the frequency of the waves. The SI unit for wave frequency
is the hertz (Hz), where 1 hertz equals 1 wave passing a ﬁxed point in 1 second. The Figure 5.60 shows high-
frequency and low-frequency transverse waves. You can simulate transverse waves with different frequencies at
these URLs: http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/wave-on-a-string and http://zonalandeducation.com/mstm/ph
ysics/waves/partsOfAWave/waveParts.htm
Q: The wavelength of a wave is the distance between corresponding points on adjacent waves. For example, it is the
distance between two adjacent crests in the transverse waves in the diagram. Infer how wave frequency is related to
wavelength.
A: Waves with a higher frequency have crests that are closer together, so higher frequency waves have shorter
wavelengths.

Wave Frequency and Energy

The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate
a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy,
so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see
examples of different frequencies in the Figure 5.61 (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move
when the energy of a wave passes through them.)

5.29 Wave Speed

• Deﬁne wave speed.
• Relate wave speed to wavelength and wave frequency.
• Show how to calculate wave speed.
• Explain how wave speed is related to the medium of a wave.

Assume that you move one end of a rope up and down just once to generate a wave in the rope. How long will take
the wave to travel down the rope to the other end? It depends on the speed of the wave.

The Speed of a Wave

Wave speed is the distance a wave travels in a given amount of time, such as the number of meters it travels per
second. Wave speed (and speed in general) can be represented by the equation:

Speed = Distance
Time

Wave Speed, Wavelength, and Wave Frequency

Wave speed is related to both wavelength and wave frequency. Wavelength is the distance between two correspond-
ing points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a ﬁxed point in a given amount of
time. This equation shows how the three factors are related:

Speed = Wavelength x Wave Frequency

In this equation, wavelength is measured in meters and frequency is measured in hertz (Hz), or number of waves per
second. Therefore, wave speed is given in meters per second, which is the SI unit for speed.
Q: If you increase the wavelength of a wave, does the speed of the wave increase as well?

832

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

A: Increasing the wavelength of a wave doesn’t change its speed. That’s because when wavelength increases, wave
frequency decreases. As a result, the product of wavelength and wave frequency is still the same speed. At the
following URL, you can see what happens to the wavelength when the frequency of a wave increases.

Calculating Wave Speed from Wavelength and Wave Frequency

The equation for wave speed can be used to calculate the speed of a wave when both wavelength and wave frequency
are known. Consider an ocean wave with a wavelength of 3 meters and a frequency of 1 hertz. The speed of the
wave is:

Speed = 3 m x 1 wave/s = 3 m/s

Q: Kim made a wave in a spring by pushing and pulling on one end. The wavelength is 0.1 m, and the wave
frequency is 2 hertz. What is the speed of the wave?
A: Substitute these values into the equation for speed:

Speed = 0.1 m x 2 waves/s = 0.2 m/s

Calculating Wave Frequency or Wavelength from Wave Speed

The equation for wave speed (above) can be rewritten as:

Frequency =

Speed
Wavelength or Wavelength = Speed
Frequency

Therefore, if you know the speed of a wave and either the wavelength or wave frequency, you can calculate the
missing value. For example, suppose that a wave is traveling at a speed of 2 meters per second and has a wavelength
of 1 meter. Then the frequency of the wave is:

Frequency = 2m/s

1m = 2 waves/s, or 2 Hz

Q: A wave is traveling at a speed of 2 m/s and has a frequency of 2 Hz. What is its wavelength?
A: Substitute these values into the equation for wavelength:

Wavelength = 2m/s

2waves/s = 1 m

The Medium Matters

The speed of most waves depends on the medium, or the matter through which the waves are traveling. Generally,
waves travel fastest through solids and slowest through gases. That’s because particles are closest together in solids

833

5.29. Wave Speed

www.ck12.org

and farthest apart in gases. When particles are farther apart, it takes longer for the energy of the disturbance to pass
from particle to particle through the medium. At the following URL, you can watch an animation showing what
happens when a wave passes from one medium to another.

• Wave speed is the distance a wave travels in a given amount of time, such as the number of meters it travels

5.30 Wave Interactions

• Identify ways that waves can interact with matter.
• Deﬁne and give examples of wave reﬂection, refraction, and diffraction.

Did you ever hear an echo of your own voice? An echo occurs when sound waves bounce back from a surface that
they can’t pass through. The woman pictured here is trying to create an echo by shouting toward a large building.
When the sound waves strike the wall of the building, most of them bounce back toward the woman, and she hears
an echo of her voice. An echo is just one example of how waves interact with matter.

How Waves Interact with Matter

Waves interact with matter in several ways. The interactions occur when waves pass from one medium to another.
The types of interactions are reﬂection, refraction, and diffraction. Each type of interaction is described in detail
below. You can see animations of the three types at this URL: http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/schools/teacher/l
esson3/flash/whiteboardcomplete.swf .

835

5.30. Wave Interactions

Reﬂection

www.ck12.org

An echo is an example of wave reﬂection. Reﬂection occurs when waves bounce back from a surface they cannot
pass through. Reﬂection can happen with any type of waves, not just sound waves. For example, light waves can
also be reﬂected. In fact, that’s how we see most objects. Light from a light source, such as the sun or a light bulb,
shines on the object and some of the light is reﬂected. When the reﬂected light enters our eyes, we can see the object.
Reﬂected waves have the same speed and frequency as the original waves before they were reﬂected. However, the
direction of the reﬂected waves is different. When waves strike an obstacle head on, the reﬂected waves bounce
straight back in the direction they came from. When waves strike an obstacle at any other angle, they bounce back at
the same angle but in a different direction. This is illustrated in the Figure 5.62. In this diagram, waves strike a wall
at an angle, called the angle of incidence. The waves are reﬂected at the same angle, called the angle of reﬂection,
but in a different direction. Notice that both angles are measured relative to a line that is perpendicular to the wall.

FIGURE 5.62

Refraction

Refraction is another way that waves interact with matter. Refraction occurs when waves bend as they enter a new
medium at an angle. You can see an example of refraction in the Figure 5.63. Light bends when it passes from air
to water or from water to air. The bending of the light traveling from the ﬁsh to the man’s eyes causes the ﬁsh to
appear to be in a different place from where it actually is.
Waves bend as they enter a new medium because they start traveling at a different speed in the new medium. For
example, light travels more slowly in water than in air. This causes it to refract when it passes from air to water or
from water to air.
Q: Where would the ﬁsh appear to be if the man looked down at it from straight above its actual location?
A: The ﬁsh would appear to be where it actually is because refraction occurs only when waves (in this case light
waves from the ﬁsh) enter a new medium at an angle other than 90°.

Diffraction

Did you ever notice that you can hear sounds around the corners of buildings even though you can’t see around
them? The Figure 5.64 shows why this happens. As you can see from the ﬁgure, sound waves spread out and travel
around obstacles. This is called diffraction. It also occurs when waves pass through an opening in an obstacle. All
waves may be diffracted, but it is more pronounced in some types of waves than others. For example, sound waves
bend around corners much more than light does. That’s why you can hear but not see around corners.

Chapter 5. Energy

FIGURE 5.63

FIGURE 5.64

For a given type of waves, such as sound waves, how much the waves diffract depends on the size of the obstacle
(or opening in the obstacle) and the wavelength of the waves. The Figure 5.65 shows how the amount of diffraction
is affected by the size of the opening in a barrier. Note that the wavelength of the wave is the distance between the
vertical lines.

Summary

• Three ways that waves may interact with matter are reﬂection, refraction, and diffraction.
• Reﬂection occurs when waves bounce back from a surface that they cannot pass through.
• Refraction occurs when waves bend as they enter a new medium at an angle and start traveling at a different

speed.

• Diffraction occurs when waves spread out as they travel around obstacles or through openings in obstacles.

5.31 Wave Interference

• Deﬁne wave interference.
• Compare and contrast constructive and destructive interference.
• Explain how standing waves occur.

When raindrops fall into still water, they create tiny waves that spread out in all directions away from the drops.
What happens when the waves from two different raindrops meet? They interfere with each other.

When Waves Meet

When two or more waves meet, they interact with each other. The interaction of waves with other waves is called
wave interference. Wave interference may occur when two waves that are traveling in opposite directions meet.
The two waves pass through each other, and this affects their amplitude. Amplitude is the maximum distance the
particles of the medium move from their resting positions when a wave passes through. How amplitude is affected
by wave interference depends on the type of interference. Interference can be constructive or destructive.

Constructive Interference

Constructive interference occurs when the crests, or highest points, of one wave overlap the crests of the other wave.
You can see this in the Figure 5.66. As the waves pass through each other, the crests combine to produce a wave
with greater amplitude. You can see an animation of constructive interference at this URL: http://phys23p.sl.psu.ed

FIGURE 5.66

Destructive Interference

Destructive interference occurs when the crests of one wave overlap the troughs, or lowest points, of another wave.
The Figure 5.67 shows what happens. As the waves pass through each other, the crests and troughs cancel each
other out to produce a wave with zero amplitude. You can see an animation of destructive interference at this URL:
http://phys23p.sl.psu.edu/phys_anim/waves/embederQ1.20200.html

Standing Waves

Waves may reﬂect off an obstacle that they are unable to pass through. When waves are reﬂected straight back
from an obstacle, the reﬂected waves interfere with the original waves and create standing waves. These are waves
that appear to be standing still. Standing waves occur because of a combination of constructive and destructive
interference. You can see animations of standing waves at the URLs below.

• http://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/waves/swf.cfm

Q: How could you use a rope to produce standing waves?
A: You could tie one end of the rope to a ﬁxed object, such as doorknob, and move the other end up and down to
generate waves in the rope. When the waves reach the ﬁxed object, they are reﬂected back. The original waves and
the reﬂected waves interfere to produce a standing wave. Try it yourself and see if the waves appear to stand still.

• Wave interference is the interaction of waves with other waves.
• Constructive interference occurs when the crests of one wave overlap the crests of the other wave, causing an

increase in wave amplitude.

• Destructive interference occurs when the crests of one wave overlap the troughs of the other wave, causing a

decrease in wave amplitude.

• When waves are reﬂected straight back from an obstacle, the reﬂected waves interfere with the original waves

5.32 Sound Waves

• Deﬁne sound.
• Describe sound waves and how they are generated.
• Identify media through which sound waves can travel.

Crack! Crash! Thud! That’s what you’d hear if you were in the forest when this old tree cracked and came crashing
down to the ground. But what if there was nobody there to hear the tree fall? Would it still make these sounds? This
is an old riddle. To answer the riddle correctly, you need to know the scientiﬁc deﬁnition of sound.

Deﬁning Sound

In science, sound is deﬁned as the transfer of energy from a vibrating object in waves that travel through matter.
Most people commonly use the term sound to mean what they hear when sound waves enter their ears. The tree
above generated sound waves when it fell to the ground, so it made sound according to the scientiﬁc deﬁnition. But
the sound wasn’t detected by a person’s ears if there was nobody in the forest. So the answer to the riddle is both
yes and no!

How Sound Waves Begin

All sound waves begin with vibrating matter. Look at the ﬁrst guitar string on the left in the Figure 5.68. Plucking
the string makes it vibrate. The diagram below the ﬁgure shows the wave generated by the vibrating string. The
moving string repeatedly pushes against the air particles next to it, which causes the air particles to vibrate. The
vibrations spread through the air in all directions away from the guitar string as longitudinal waves. In longitudinal
waves, particles of the medium vibrate back and forth parallel to the direction that the waves travel. You can see an
animation of sound waves traveling through air at this URL: http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/01/sound-waves
.html
Q: If there were no air particles to carry the vibrations away from the guitar string, how would sound reach the ear?

FIGURE 5.68

A: It wouldn’t unless the vibrations were carried by another medium. Sound waves are mechanical waves, so they
can travel only though matter and not through empty space.

A Ticking Clock

The fact that sound cannot travel through empty space was ﬁrst demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named
Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air
and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still ticking, but the ticking sound
could no longer be heard. That’s because the sound couldn’t travel away from the clock without air particles to pass
the sound energy along. You can see an online demonstration of the same experiment—with a modern twist—at this

Sound Waves and Matter

Most of the sounds we hear reach our ears through the air, but sounds can also travel through liquids and solids. If
you swim underwater—or even submerge your ears in bathwater—any sounds you hear have traveled to your ears
through the water. Some solids, including glass and metals, are very good at transmitting sounds. Foam rubber and
heavy fabrics, on the other hand, tend to mufﬂe sounds. They absorb rather than pass on the sound energy.
Q: How can you tell that sounds travel through solids?
A: One way is that you can hear loud outdoor sounds such as sirens through closed windows and doors. You can
also hear sounds through the inside walls of a house. For example, if you put your ear against a wall, you may be

able to eavesdrop on a conversation in the next room—not that you would, of course.

Summary

• In science, sound is deﬁned as the transfer of energy from a vibrating object in waves that travel through

matter.

• All sound waves begin with vibrating matter. The vibrations generate longitudinal waves that travel through

matter in all directions.

• Most sounds we hear travel through air, but sounds can also travel through liquids and solids.

5.33. Speed of Sound

5.33 Speed of Sound

• Give the speed of sound in dry air at 20 °C.
• Describe variation in the speed of sound in different media.
• Explain the effect of temperature on the speed of sound.

Has this ever happened to you? You see a ﬂash of lightning on the horizon, but several seconds pass before you hear
the rumble of thunder. The reason? The speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.

What Is the Speed of Sound?

The speed of sound is the distance that sound waves travel in a given amount of time. You’ll often see the speed
of sound given as 343 meters per second. But that’s just the speed of sound under a certain set of conditions,
speciﬁcally, through dry air at 20 °C. The speed of sound may be very different through other matter or at other
temperatures.

Speed of Sound in Different Media

Sound waves are mechanical waves, and mechanical waves can only travel through matter. The matter through
which the waves travel is called the medium (plural, media). The Table 5.3 gives the speed of sound in several
different media. Generally, sound waves travel most quickly through solids, followed by liquids, and then by gases.
Particles of matter are closest together in solids and farthest apart in gases. When particles are closer together, they
can more quickly pass the energy of vibrations to nearby particles. You can explore the speed of sound in different
media at this URL:

Q: The table gives the speed of sound in dry air. Do you think that sound travels more or less quickly through air
that contains water vapor? (Hint: Compare the speed of sound in water and air in the table.)
A: Sound travels at a higher speed through water than air, so it travels more quickly through air that contains water
vapor than it does through dry air.

Temperature and Speed of Sound

The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium. For a given medium, sound has a slower speed
at lower temperatures. You can compare the speed of sound in dry air at different temperatures in the following
Table 5.4. At a lower temperature, particles of the medium are moving more slowly, so it takes them longer to
transfer the energy of the sound waves.

Q: What do you think the speed of sound might be in dry air at a temperature of -20 °C?
A: For each 1 degree Celsius that temperature decreases, the speed of sound decreases by 0.6 m/s. So sound travels
through dry, -20 °C air at a speed of 319 m/s.

Summary

• The speed of sound is the distance that sound waves travel in a given amount of time. The speed of sound in

dry air at 20 °C is 343 meters per second.

• Generally, sound waves travel most quickly through solids, followed by liquids, and then by gases.
• For a given medium, sound waves travel more slowly at lower temperatures.

5.34 Intensity and Loudness of Sound

• Deﬁne intensity of sound and relate it to loudness.
• Compare decibel levels of different sounds.
• Identify factors that affect sound intensity.

A friend whispers to you in a voice so soft that she has to lean very close so you can hear what she’s saying. Later
that day, your friend shouts to you from across the gymnasium. Now her voice is loud enough for you to hear her
clearly even though she’s several meters away. Obviously, sounds can vary in loudness.

It’s All About Energy

Loudness refers to how loud or soft a sound seems to a listener. The loudness of sound is determined, in turn, by the
intensity of the sound waves. Intensity is a measure of the amount of energy in sound waves. The unit of intensity
is the decibel (dB).

Decibel Levels

The Figure 5.70 shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have
greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times
greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light
rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and
cause loss of hearing.

FIGURE 5.70

Q: How much louder than a 20-decibel whisper is the 60-decibel sound of a vacuum cleaner?
A: The vacuum cleaner is 10,000 times louder than the whisper!

Amplitude and Distance

The intensity of sound waves determines the loudness of sounds, but what determines intensity? Intensity results
from two factors: the amplitude of the sound waves and how far they have traveled from the source of the sound.

• Amplitude is a measure of the size of sound waves.

It depends on the amount of energy that started the
waves. Greater amplitude waves have more energy and greater intensity, so they sound louder. For a video
demonstration of the amplitude and loudness of sounds, go to this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i
rqfGYD2UKw

• As sound waves travel farther from their source, the more spread out their energy becomes. You can see how
this works in the Figure 5.71. As distance from the sound source increases, the area covered by the sound
waves increases. The same amount of energy is spread over a greater area, so the intensity and loudness of the
sound is less. This explains why even loud sounds fade away as you move farther from the source.

Q: Why can low-amplitude sounds like whispers be heard only over short distances?
A: The sound waves already have so little energy that spreading them out over a wider area quickly reduces their
intensity below the level of hearing.

Summary

• Loudness refers to how loud or soft a sound seems to a listener. The loudness of sound is determined, in turn,

by the intensity, or amount of energy, in sound waves. The unit of intensity is the decibel (dB).

• As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel

increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater.

• Intensity of sound results from two factors: the amplitude of the sound waves and how far they have traveled

from the source of the sound.

5.35. Frequency and Pitch of Sound

5.35 Frequency and Pitch of Sound

• Deﬁne the pitch of sound.
• Relate the pitch of sound to the frequency of sound waves.
• Identify infrasound and ultrasound.

A marching band passes you as it parades down the street. You heard it coming from several blocks away. Now
that the different instruments have ﬁnally reached you, their distinctive sounds can be heard. The tiny piccolos trill
their bird-like high notes, and the big tubas rumble out their booming bass notes. Clearly, some sounds are higher or
lower than others.

High or Low

How high or low a sound seems to a listener is its pitch. Pitch, in turn, depends on the frequency of sound waves.
Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a ﬁxed point in a given amount of time. High-pitched sounds, like
the sounds of the piccolo in the Figure 5.72, have high-frequency waves. Low-pitched sounds, like the sounds of
the tuba Figure 5.72, have low-frequency waves. For a video demonstration of frequency and pitch, go to this URL:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irqfGYD2UKw

Can You Hear It?

The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a ﬁxed point in a second.
Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with
frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound. Infrasound is too low-pitched for humans to hear. Sounds with
frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound. Ultrasound is too high-pitched for humans to hear.
Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as
high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs—but not people—can hear. The whistles produce

sounds with frequencies too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds.
Bats, like the one pictured in the Figure 5.73, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz!

FIGURE 5.73

Q: Bats use ultrasound to navigate in the dark. Can you explain how?
A: Bats send out ultrasound waves, which reﬂect back from objects ahead of them. They sense the reﬂected sound
waves and use the information to detect objects they can’t see in the dark. This is how they avoid ﬂying into walls
and trees and also how they ﬁnd ﬂying insects to eat.

Summary

• How high or low a sound seems to a listener is its pitch. Pitch, in turn, depends on the frequency of sound

waves.

• High-frequency sound waves produce high-pitched sounds, and low-frequency sound waves produce low-

pitched sounds.

• Infrasound has wave frequencies too low for humans to hear. Ultrasound has wave frequencies too high for

humans to hear.

5.36 Doppler Effect

• Describe the Doppler effect.
• Explain why the Doppler effect occurs.

Has this ever happened to you? You hear a siren from a few blocks away. The source is a police car that is racing in
your direction. As the car approaches, zooms past you, and then speeds off into the distance, the sound of its siren
keeps changing in pitch. First the siren gets higher in pitch, and then it suddenly gets lower. Do you know why this
happens? The answer is the Doppler effect.

What Is the Doppler Effect?

The Doppler effect is a change in the frequency of sound waves that occurs when the source of the sound waves
is moving relative to a stationary listener. (It can also occur when the sound source is stationary and the listener is
moving.) The Figure 5.74 shows how the Doppler effect occurs. The sound waves from the police car siren travel
outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (to the left), the sound waves get bunched up in front of
the car and spread out behind it. Sound waves that are closer together have a higher frequency, and sound waves that
are farther apart have a lower frequency. The frequency of sound waves, in turn, determines the pitch of the sound.
Sound waves with a higher frequency produce sound with a higher pitch, and sound waves with a lower frequency
produce sound with a lower pitch. For an interactive animation of a diagram like the one below, go to the following

Experiencing the Doppler Effect

As the car approaches listener A, the sound waves get closer together, increasing their frequency. This listener
hears the pitch of the siren get higher. As the car speeds away from listener B, the sound waves get farther apart,
decreasing their frequency. This listener hears the pitch of the siren get lower. You can experience the Doppler effect
with a moving siren in the following animation: http://www.epicphysics.com/physics-animations/doppler-effect-ani
mation/
Q: What will the siren sound like to listener A after the police car passes him?
A: The siren will suddenly get lower in pitch because the sound waves will be much more spread out and have a
lower frequency.

Summary

• The Doppler effect is a change in the frequency of sound waves that occurs when the source of the sound

waves is moving relative to a stationary listener.

• As the source of sound waves approaches a listener, the sound waves get closer together, increasing their
frequency and the pitch of the sound. The opposite happens when the source of sound waves moves away
from the listener.

5.37 Hearing and the Ear

• Explain how we sense sound energy and hear sounds.
• Identify the structures of the ear and their role in hearing.

This boy is cupping his hands behind his ears in order to hear better. Do you think this will help? To answer this
question, you need to know more about sound, the ear, and how we hear.

The Sounds We Hear

Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves through matter. The ability to sense sound energy and perceive
sound is called hearing. The organ that we use to sense sound energy is the ear. Almost all the structures in the ear
are needed for this purpose. Together, they gather sound waves, amplify the waves, and change their kinetic energy
to electrical signals. The electrical signals travel to the brain, which interprets them as the sounds we hear.
The Figure 5.75 shows the three main parts of the ear: the outer, middle, and inner ear. It also shows the speciﬁc
structures in each part of the ear. The roles of these structures in hearing are described below and in this animation:
http://www.medindia.net/animation/ear_anatomy.asp .

Outer Ear

The outer ear includes the pinna, ear canal, and eardrum.

• The pinna is the only part of the ear that extends outward from the head. Its position and shape make it good

at catching sound waves and funneling them into the ear canal.

• The ear canal is a tube that carries sound waves into the ear. The sound waves travel through the air inside the

ear canal to the eardrum.

857

5.37. Hearing and the Ear

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 5.75

• The eardrum is like the head of a drum. It is a thin membrane stretched tight across the end of the ear canal.

The eardrum vibrates when sound waves strike it, and it sends the vibrations on to the middle ear.

Q: How might cupping his hands behind his ears help the boy pictured in the opening image hear better?
A: His hands might help the pinna of his ears catch sound waves and direct them into the ear canal.

Middle Ear

The middle ear contains three tiny bones (ossicles) called the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. If you look at these bones in
the Figure 5.75, you might notice that they resemble the objects for which they are named. The three bones transmit
vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. The arrangement of the three bones allows them to work together as a
lever that increases the amplitude of the waves as they pass to the inner ear.
Q: Wave amplitude is the maximum distance particles of matter move when a wave passes through them. Why
would amplifying the sound waves as they pass through the middle ear improve hearing?
A: Ampliﬁed sound waves have more energy. This increases the intensity and loudness of the sounds, so they are
easier to hear.

Inner Ear

The stirrup in the middle ear passes the ampliﬁed sound waves to the inner ear through the oval window. When the
oval window vibrates, it causes the cochlea to vibrate as well. The cochlea is a shell-like structure that is full of ﬂuid
and lined with nerve cells called hair cells. Each hair cell has many tiny “hairs,” as you can see in the magniﬁed
image 5.76. When the cochlea vibrates, it causes waves in the ﬂuid inside. The waves bend the “hairs” on the hair
cells, and this triggers electrical impulses. The electrical impulses travel to the brain through nerves. Only after the
nerve impulses reach the brain do we hear the sound.

Summary

• Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves through matter. The ear gathers and ampliﬁes sound waves and

changes them to electrical signals. The brain receives the signals and interprets them as the sounds we hear.

The Ear and Hearing

The ear is a complex organ that senses sound energy so we can hear. Hearing is the ability to sense sound energy
and perceive sound. All of the structures of the ear that are involved in hearing must work well for a person to have
normal hearing. Damage to any of the structures, through illness or injury, may cause hearing loss. Total hearing
loss is called deafness. To learn more about hearing loss, watch the animation at this URL: http://www.youtube.c
om/watch?v=YpIptQSEEjY .

Loud Sounds

The most common cause of hearing loss is exposure to loud sounds. Loud sounds can damage hair cells inside the
ears. Hair cells change sound waves to electrical signals that the brain can interpret as sounds. Louder sounds, which
have greater intensity than softer sounds, can damage hair cells more quickly than softer sounds. You can see the
relationship between sound intensity, exposure time, and hearing loss in the following Figure 5.77. The intensity of
sounds is measured in decibels (dB).
Q: What is the maximum amount of time you should be exposed to a sound as intense as 100 dB? What might make
a sound this intense?

Chapter 5. Energy

FIGURE 5.77

A: You should be exposed to a 100-dB sound for no longer than 15 minutes. An example of a sound this intense is
the sound of a car horn.

Shhhh!

Hearing loss caused by loud sounds is permanent. However, this type of hearing loss can be prevented by protecting
the ears from loud sounds. People who work in jobs that expose them to loud sounds must wear hearing protectors.
Examples include construction workers who work around loud machinery for many hours each day. But anyone
exposed to loud sounds for longer than the permissible exposure time should wear hearing protectors. Many home
and yard chores and even recreational activities are loud enough to cause hearing loss if people are exposed to them
for too much time. You can see examples in the Figure 5.78.

How Hearing Protectors Work

You can see two different types of hearing protectors in the Figure 5.79. Earplugs are simple hearing protectors that
just mufﬂe sounds by partially blocking all sound waves from entering the ears. This type of hearing protector is
suitable for lower noise levels, such as the noise of a lawnmower or snowmobile.
Electronic ear protectors work differently. They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through
them in the opposite direction. This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude
to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear,
such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be ampliﬁed instead so they can be
heard more clearly. This type of hearing protector is recommended for higher noise levels and situations where it’s
important to be able to hear lower-decibel sounds.

Summary

• Hearing is the ability to sense sound energy and perceive sound. The ear is the organ that senses sound and
allows us to hear. Damage to structures of the ear may cause hearing loss. Total hearing loss is called deafness.

• Identify common features shared by all musical instruments.
• Describe how different categories of musical instruments make sounds and change pitch.

Do you ever see a colorful drum like this one before? It’s a traditional musical instrument of Uruguay. The drummer
is equally colorful. Each time he strikes the drum, it produces a loud, pounding sound. There are hundreds of
different kinds of musical instruments, from drums to horns to stringed instruments. Would it surprise you to learn
that all of them make sound in the same basic way?

Making Music

People have been using sound to make music for thousands of years. They have invented many different kinds of
musical instruments. Despite their diversity, however, musical instruments share certain similarities.

• All musical instruments create sound by causing matter to vibrate. The vibrations start sound waves moving

through the air.

• Most musical instruments use resonance to amplify the sound waves and make the sounds louder. Resonance
occurs when an object vibrates in response to sound waves of a certain frequency. In a musical instrument
such as a drum, the whole instrument and the air inside it may vibrate when the head of the drum is struck.

• Most musical instruments have a way of changing the frequency of the sound waves they produce. This

changes the pitch of the sounds, or how high or low the sounds seem to a listener.

5.40 Ultrasound

• Deﬁne ultrasound
• Describe echolocation.
• State what sonar is and how it is used.
• Explain how ultrasound is used to “see” inside the human body.

What could this smiling dolphin and yawning bat possibly have in common? It’s not just that both of them are
mammals. Both of them also use ultrasound to ﬁnd things in the dark.

What Is Ultrasound?

Ultrasound is sound that has a wave frequency higher than the human ear can detect. It includes all sound with wave
frequencies higher than 20,000 waves per second, or 20,000 hertz (Hz). Although we can’t hear ultrasound, it is very
useful to humans and some other animals. Uses of ultrasound include echolocation, sonar, and ultrasonography.

Echolocation

Animals such as bats and dolphins send out ultrasound waves and use their echoes, or reﬂected waves, to identify
the locations of objects they cannot see. This is called echolocation. Animals use echolocation to ﬁnd prey and
avoid running into objects in the dark. You can see in the Figure 5.81 and also at the following URL how a bat uses
echolocation to ﬁnd insect prey. http://www.bsos.umd.edu/psyc/batlab/headaimmovies/nsf_challenge/nsf4.wmv

Sonar

Sonar uses ultrasound in a way that is similar to echolocation. Sonar stands for sound navigation and ranging. It is
used to locate underwater objects such as submarines. That’s how the ship pictured in the Figure 5.82 is using it. A
sonar device is both a sender and a receiver. It sends out ultrasound waves and detects the waves after they reﬂect

from underwater objects. If you watch the video at the URL below, you can see how sonar is used on a submarine.

MEDIA

URL: http://www.ck12.org/ﬂx/render/embeddedobject/82389

The distance to underwater objects can be calculated from the known speed of sound in water and the time it takes
for the sound waves to travel to the object. The equation for distance traveled when speed and time are known is:

Distance = Speed × Time

Consider the ship and submarine pictured in the Figure 5.82. If an ultrasound wave travels from the ship to the
submarine and back again in 2 seconds, what is the distance from the ship to the submarine? The sound wave travels
from the ship to the submarine in just 1 second, or half the time it takes to make the round trip. The speed of sound
waves through ocean water is 1437 m/s. Therefore, the distance from the ship to the submarine is:

Distance = 1437 m/s × 1 s = 1437 m

Q: Now assume that the sonar device on the ship sends an ultrasound wave to the bottom of the water. If the sound
wave is reﬂected back to the device in 4 seconds, how deep is the water?
A: The time it takes the wave to reach the bottom is 2 seconds. So the distance from the ship to the bottom of the
water is:

Distance = 1437 m/s × 2 s = 2874 m

Ultrasonography

Another use of ultrasound is to “see” inside the human body. This use of ultrasound is called ultrasonography.
Harmless ultrasound waves are sent inside the body, and the reﬂected waves are used to create an image on a screen.

• Deﬁne electromagnetic wave and electromagnetic radiation.
• Describe the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of an electromagnetic wave.
• Explain how electromagnetic waves begin and how they travel.
• State how electromagnetic waves may interact with matter.

Did you ever wonder how a microwave works? It directs invisible waves of radiation toward the food placed inside
of it. The radiation transfers energy to the food, causing it to get warmer. The radiation is in the form of microwaves,
which are a type of electromagnetic waves.

What Are Electromagnetic Waves?

Electromagnetic waves are waves that consist of vibrating electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Like other waves, electro-
magnetic waves transfer energy from one place to another. The transfer of energy by electromagnetic waves is called
electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic waves can transfer energy through matter or across empty space. For

5.41. Electromagnetic Waves

www.ck12.org

Q: How do microwaves transfer energy inside a microwave oven?
A: They transfer energy through the air inside the oven to the food.

May the Force Be with You

A familiar example may help you understand the vibrating electric and magnetic ﬁelds that make up electromagnetic
waves. Consider a bar magnet, like the one in the Figure 5.84. The magnet exerts magnetic force over an area all
around it. This area is called a magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld lines in the diagram represent the direction and location of
the magnetic force. Because of the ﬁeld surrounding a magnet, it can exert force on objects without touching them.
They just have to be within its magnetic ﬁeld.

FIGURE 5.84

Q: How could you demonstrate that a magnet can exert force on objects without touching them?
A: You could put small objects containing iron, such as paper clips, near a magnet and show that they move toward
the magnet.
An electric ﬁeld is similar to a magnetic ﬁeld. It is an area of electrical force surrounding a positively or negatively
charged particle. You can see electric ﬁelds in the following Figure 5.85. Like a magnetic ﬁeld, an electric ﬁeld can
exert force on objects over a distance without actually touching them.

How an Electromagnetic Wave Begins

An electromagnetic wave begins when an electrically charged particle vibrates. The Figure 5.86 shows how this
happens. A vibrating charged particle causes the electric ﬁeld surrounding it to vibrate as well. A vibrating
electric ﬁeld, in turn, creates a vibrating magnetic ﬁeld. The two types of vibrating ﬁelds combine to create an
electromagnetic wave. You can see animations of electromagnetic waves at these URLs:

FIGURE 5.85

FIGURE 5.86

How an Electromagnetic Wave Travels

As you can see in the Figure 5.86, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds that make up an electromagnetic wave are
perpendicular (at right angles) to each other. Both ﬁelds are also perpendicular to the direction that the wave travels.

873

5.41. Electromagnetic Waves

www.ck12.org

Therefore, an electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave. However, unlike a mechanical transverse wave, which can
only travel through matter, an electromagnetic transverse wave can travel through empty space. When waves travel
through matter, they lose some energy to the matter as they pass through it. But when waves travel through space, no
energy is lost. Therefore, electromagnetic waves don’t get weaker as they travel. However, the energy is “diluted”
as it travels farther from its source because it spreads out over an ever-larger area.

Electromagnetic Wave Interactions

When electromagnetic waves strike matter, they may interact with it in the same ways that mechanical waves interact
with matter. Electromagnetic waves may:

• reﬂect, or bounce back from a surface;
• refract, or bend when entering a new medium;
• diffract, or spread out around obstacles.

Electromagnetic waves may also be absorbed by matter and converted to other forms of energy. Microwaves are a
familiar example. When microwaves strike food in a microwave oven, they are absorbed and converted to thermal
energy, which heats the food.

Sources of Electromagnetic Waves

The most important source of electromagnetic waves on Earth is the sun. Electromagnetic waves travel from the sun
to Earth across space and provide virtually all the energy that supports life on our planet. Many other sources of
electromagnetic waves depend on technology. Radio waves, microwaves, and X rays are examples. We use these
electromagnetic waves for communications, cooking, medicine, and many other purposes.

Summary

• Electromagnetic waves are waves that consist of vibrating electric and magnetic ﬁelds. They transfer energy
through matter or across space. The transfer of energy by electromagnetic waves is called electromagnetic
radiation.

• The electric and magnetic ﬁelds of an electromagnetic wave are areas of electric or magnetic force. The ﬁelds

can exert force over objects at a distance.

• An electromagnetic wave begins when an electrically charged particle vibrates. This causes a vibrating
electric ﬁeld, which in turn creates a vibrating magnetic ﬁeld. The two vibrating ﬁelds together form an
electromagnetic wave.

• An electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave that can travel across space as well as through matter. When it

travels through space, it doesn’t lose energy to a medium as a mechanical wave does.

• When electromagnetic waves strike matter, they may be reﬂected, refracted, or diffracted. Or they may be

absorbed by matter and converted to other forms of energy.

• The most important source of electromagnetic waves on Earth is the sun. Many other sources of electromag-

netic waves depend on technology.

What a beautiful sunset! You probably know that sunlight travels in waves through space from the sun to Earth. But
do you know what light really is? Is it just energy, or is it something else? In this article you’ll ﬁnd out that light
may be more than it seems.

The Question

Electromagnetic radiation, commonly called light, is the transfer of energy by waves called electromagnetic waves.
These waves consist of vibrating electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Where does electromagnetic energy come from? It is
released when electrons return to lower energy levels in atoms. Electromagnetic radiation behaves like continuous
waves of energy most of the time. Sometimes, however, electromagnetic radiation seems to behave like discrete, or
separate, particles rather than waves. So does electromagnetic radiation consist of waves or particles?

The Debate

This question about the nature of electromagnetic radiation was debated by scientists for more than two centuries,
starting in the 1600s. Some scientists argued that electromagnetic radiation consists of particles that shoot around
like tiny bullets. Other scientists argued that electromagnetic radiation consists of waves, like sound waves or water
waves. Until the early 1900s, most scientists thought that electromagnetic radiation is either one or the other and
that scientists on the other side of the argument were simply wrong.
Q: Do you think electromagnetic radiation is a wave or a particle?
A: Here’s a hint: it may not be a question of either-or. Keep reading to learn more.

876

www.ck12.org

A New Theory

Chapter 5. Energy

In 1905, the physicist Albert Einstein developed a new theory about electromagnetic radiation. The theory is often
called the wave-particle theory. It explains how electromagnetic radiation can behave as both a wave and a particle.
Einstein argued that when an electron returns to a lower energy level and gives off electromagnetic energy, the energy
is released as a discrete “packet” of energy. We now call such a packet of energy a photon. According to Einstein, a
photon resembles a particle but moves like a wave. You can see this in the Figure 5.87. The theory posits that waves
of photons traveling through space or matter make up electromagnetic radiation.

FIGURE 5.87

Energy of a Photon

A photon isn’t a ﬁxed amount of energy. Instead, the amount of energy in a photon depends on the frequency of the
electromagnetic wave. The frequency of a wave is the number of waves that pass a ﬁxed point in a given amount of
time, such as the number of waves per second. In waves with higher frequencies, photons have more energy.

Evidence for the Wave-Particle Theory

After Einstein proposed his theory, evidence was discovered to support it. For example, scientists shone laser light
through two slits in a barrier made of a material that blocked light. You can see the setup of this type of experiment
in the Figure 5.88. Using a special camera that was very sensitive to light, they took photos of the light that passed
through the slits. The photos revealed tiny pinpoints of light passing through the double slits. This seemed to
show that light consists of particles. However, if the camera was exposed to the light for a long time, the pinpoints
accumulated in bands that resembled interfering waves. Therefore, the experiment showed that light seems to consist
of particles that act like waves.

Summary

• Electromagnetic radiation behaves like waves of energy most of the time, but sometimes it behaves like
particles. From the 1600s until the early 1900s, most scientists thought that electromagnetic radiation consists
either of particles or of waves but not both.

• In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed the wave-particle theory of electromagnetic radiation. This theory states that

electromagnetic energy is released in discrete packets of energy—now called photons—that act like waves.

• Describe wavelengths and frequencies of electromagnetic waves.
• Relate wave frequency to wave energy.
• Show how to calculate wavelength or wave frequency if the other value is known.

What do these two photos have in common? They both represent electromagnetic waves. These are waves that
consist of vibrating electric and magnetic ﬁelds. They transmit energy through matter or across space. Some
electromagnetic waves are generally harmless. The light we use to see is a good example. Other electromagnetic
waves can be very harmful and care must be taken to avoid too much exposure to them. X rays are a familiar
example. Why do electromagnetic waves vary in these ways? It depends on their properties. Like other waves,
electromagnetic waves have properties of speed, wavelength, and frequency.

Speed of Electromagnetic Waves

All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through empty space. That speed, called the speed of light,
is about 300 million meters per second (3.0 x 108 m/s). Nothing else in the universe is known to travel this fast.
The sun is about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) from Earth, but it takes electromagnetic radiation only 8
minutes to reach Earth from the sun. If you could move that fast, you would be able to travel around Earth 7.5 times
in just 1 second! You can learn more about the speed of light at this URL: http://videos.howstuffworks.com/discover

Wavelength and Frequency of Electromagnetic Waves

Although all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed across space, they may differ in their wavelengths,
frequencies, and energy levels.

879

5.43. Properties of Electromagnetic Waves

www.ck12.org

• Wavelength is the distance between corresponding points of adjacent waves (see the Figure 5.89). Wave-
lengths of electromagnetic waves range from longer than a soccer ﬁeld to shorter than the diameter of an
atom.

• Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a ﬁxed point in a given amount of time. Frequencies of

electromagnetic waves range from thousands of waves per second to trillions of waves per second.

• The energy of electromagnetic waves depends on their frequency. Low-frequency waves have little energy

and are normally harmless. High-frequency waves have a lot of energy and are potentially very harmful.

FIGURE 5.89

Q: Which electromagnetic waves do you think have higher frequencies: visible light or X rays?
A: X rays are harmful but visible light is harmless, so you can infer that X rays have higher frequencies than visible
light.

Speed, Wavelength, and Frequency

The speed of a wave is a product of its wavelength and frequency. Because all electromagnetic waves travel at the
same speed through space, a wave with a shorter wavelength must have a higher frequency, and vice versa. This
relationship is represented by the equation:

Speed = Wavelength × Frequency

The equation for wave speed can be rewritten as:

Frequency =

Speed

Wavelength or Wavelength =

Speed

Frequency

Therefore, if either wavelength or frequency is known, the missing value can be calculated. Consider an electromag-
netic wave that has a wavelength of 3 meters. Its speed, like the speed of all electromagnetic waves, is 3.0 × 108
meters per second. Its frequency can be found by substituting these values into the frequency equation:

Frequency = 3.0×108 m/s

3.0 m = 1.0× 108 waves/s, or 1.0 × 108 Hz

Q: What is the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave that has a frequency of 3.0 × 108 hertz?
A: Use the wavelength equation:

Wavelength = 3.0×108 m/s

3.0×108 waves/s = 1.0 m

Summary

Chapter 5. Energy

• All electromagnetic waves travel across space at the speed of light, which is about 300 million meters per

second (3.0 x 108 m/s).

• Electromagnetic waves vary in wavelength and frequency. Longer wavelength electromagnetic waves have
lower frequencies, and shorter wavelength waves have higher frequencies. Higher frequency waves have more
energy.

• The speed of a wave is a product of its wavelength and frequency. Because the speed of electromagnetic waves
through space is constant, the wavelength or frequency of an electromagnetic wave can be calculated if the
other value is known.

• Describe electromagnetic radiation and its properties.
• Give an overview of the electromagnetic spectrum.

It’s a warm sunny Saturday, and Michael and Lavar have a big day planned. They’re going to ride across town to
meet their friends and then go to the zoo. The boys may not realize it, but they will be bombarded by electromagnetic
radiation as they ride their bikes and walk around the zoo grounds. The only kinds of radiation they can detect are
visible light, which allows them to see, and infrared light, which they feel as warmth on their skin.
Q: Besides visible light and infrared light, what other kinds of electromagnetic radiation will the boys be exposed to
in sunlight?
A: Sunlight consists of all the different kinds of electromagnetic radiation, from harmless radio waves to deadly
gamma rays. Fortunately, Earth’s atmosphere prevents most of the harmful radiation from reaching Earth’s surface.
You can read about the different kinds of electromagnetic radiation in this article.

Electromagnetic Radiation

Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in waves across space as well as through matter. Most of the
electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized
by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on
adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a ﬁxed point in a given amount of time.
Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy.

A Spectrum of Electromagnetic Waves

Visible light and infrared light are just a small part of the full range of electromagnetic radiation, which is called the
electromagnetic spectrum. You can see the waves of the electromagnetic spectrum in the Figure 5.90. At the top

light, and ultraviolet light. The wavelengths, frequencies, and energy levels of light fall in between those of
radio waves on the left and X rays and gamma rays on the right.

Q: Which type of light has the longest wavelengths?
A: Infrared light has the longest wavelengths.
Q: What sources of infrared light are shown in the diagram?
A: The sources in the diagram are people and light bulbs, but all living things and most other objects give off infrared
light.

Summary

• Electromagnetic radiation travels in waves through space or matter. Electromagnetic waves with shorter

wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy.

• Describe radio waves and identify their uses.
• Explain how radio waves are used for radio and television broadcasts.

William can’t help rocking out when his favorite song starts playing on the radio. Do you like to listen to the radio?
Did you ever wonder how music travels from a radio station to a radio receiver? How do the sounds travel through
air and buildings and everything else in between you and the station? The answer is by electromagnetic waves.

A Spectrum of Waves

Electromagnetic waves consist of vibrating electric and magnetic ﬁelds. They transfer energy across space as well
as through matter. Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths and frequencies, and higher-frequency waves
have more energy. The full range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves is called the electromagnetic spectrum.
It is outlined in the following Figure 5.91.

Introducing Radio Waves

Electromagnetic waves on the left side of the Figure 5.91 are called radio waves. Radio waves are electromagnetic
waves with the longest wavelengths. They may have wavelengths longer than a soccer ﬁeld. They are also the
electromagnetic waves with the lowest frequencies. With their low frequencies, they have the least energy of all
electromagnetic waves. Nonetheless, radio waves are very useful. They are used for radio and television broadcasts
and many other purposes. You can learn more about radio waves, including how they were discovered, at this URL:

Q: Based on the electromagnetic spectrum Figure 5.91, what is the range of frequencies of radio waves?
A: The range of frequencies of radio waves is between 105 and 1012 Hz, or waves per second.

AM and FM Radio

In radio broadcasts, sounds are encoded in radio waves, and then the waves are sent out through the atmosphere from
a radio tower. A radio receiver detects the waves and changes them back to sounds. You may have listened to both
AM and FM radio stations. How sounds are encoded in radio waves differs between AM and FM broadcasts.

• AM stands for amplitude modulation. In AM broadcasts, sound signals are encoded by changing the am-
plitude, or maximum height, of radio waves. AM broadcasts use longer wavelength radio waves than FM
broadcasts. Because of their longer wavelengths, AM waves reﬂect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called
the ionosphere. You can see how this happens in the Figure 5.92. Because the waves are reﬂected, they can
reach radio receivers that are very far away from the radio tower.

• FM stands for frequency modulation. In FM broadcasts, sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency
of radio waves. Frequency modulation allows FM waves to encode more information than does amplitude
modulation, so FM broadcasts usually produce clearer sounds than AM broadcasts. However, the relatively
short wavelengths of FM waves means that they don’t reﬂect off the ionosphere as AM waves do. Instead, FM
waves pass through the ionosphere and out into space. This is also shown in the Figure 5.92. As a result, FM
waves cannot reach very distant receivers.

Q: The composition of the ionosphere changes somewhat from day to night. The changes make the nighttime
ionosphere even better at reﬂecting AM radio waves. How do you think this might affect the distance AM radio
waves travel at night?
A: With greater reﬂection off the ionosphere, AM waves can travel even farther at night than they can during the
day. Radio receivers can often pick up radio broadcasts at night from cities that are hundreds of miles away.

FIGURE 5.92

Television

Television broadcasts also use radio waves (see Figure 5.92). For TV broadcasts, sounds are encoded with frequency
modulation, and pictures are encoded with amplitude modulation. The encoded waves are broadcast from a TV
tower. When the waves are received by television sets, they are decoded and changed back to sounds and pictures.

Summary

• Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths, frequencies, and energy levels. The full range of electro-

magnetic waves makes up the electromagnetic spectrum.

• Radio waves are electromagnetic waves with the longest wavelengths, lowest frequencies, and least amount

of energy. They are used for radio and television broadcasts and many other purposes.

• In radio broadcasts, sounds are encoded in radio waves by changing either the amplitude (AM) or frequency
(FM) of the waves. The encoded waves are broadcast from a tower and changed back to sounds by radio
receivers.

• In television broadcasts, sounds and pictures are encoded in radio waves, broadcast from a tower, and changed

back to sounds and pictures by television sets.

This person is pointing a gun at a kid practicing his baseball pitch. But it’s not the type of gun that can be used as a
weapon. It’s a radar gun, and it’s used to detect the speed of moving objects. It has measured this pitch to be going
at 51 miles per hour. Do you know how a radar gun works? Instead of shooting bullets, it “shoots” electromagnetic
waves.

Deﬁning Electromagnetic Waves

Electromagnetic waves carry energy through matter or space as vibrating electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Electromag-
netic waves have a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies. The complete range is called the electromagnetic
spectrum. The Figure 5.93 shows all the waves of the spectrum. The waves used in radar guns are microwaves.

Deﬁning Microwaves

Chapter 5. Energy

Find the microwave in the Figure 5.93. A microwave is an electromagnetic wave with a relatively long wavelength
and low frequency. Microwaves are often classiﬁed as radio waves, but they have higher frequencies than other radio
waves. With higher frequencies, they also have more energy. That’s why microwaves are useful for heating food
in microwave ovens. Microwaves have other important uses as well, including cell phone transmissions and radar.
These uses are described below. You can learn more about microwaves and their uses in the video at this URL: http

Cell Phones

Cell phone signals are carried through the air as microwaves. You can see how this works in the Figure 5.94. A cell
phone encodes the sounds of the caller’s voice in microwaves by changing the frequency of the waves. This is called
frequency modulation. The encoded microwaves are then sent from the phone through the air to a cell tower. From
the cell tower, the waves travel to a switching center. From there they go to another cell tower and from the tower to
the receiver of the person being called. The receiver changes the encoded microwaves back to sounds.

FIGURE 5.94

Q: Cell towers reach high above the ground. Why do you think such tall towers are used?
A: Microwaves can be interrupted by buildings and other obstructions, so cell towers must be placed high above the
ground to prevent the interruption of cell phone signals.

5.46. Microwaves

Radar

www.ck12.org

Radar stands for radio detection and ranging. In police radar, a radar gun sends out short bursts of microwaves. The
microwaves reﬂect back from oncoming vehicles and are detected by a receiver in the radar gun. The frequency of
the reﬂected waves is used to compute the speed of the vehicles. Radar is also used for tracking storms, detecting air
trafﬁc, and other purposes.

FIGURE 5.95

Q: How are reﬂected microwaves used to determine the speed of oncoming cars (see Figure 5.95)?
A: As the car approaches the radar gun, the reﬂected microwaves get bunched up in front of the car. Therefore, the
waves the receiver detects have a higher frequency than they would if they were being reﬂected from a stationary
object. The faster the car is moving, the greater the increase in the frequency of the waves. This is an example of the
Doppler effect, which can also occur with sound waves.

Summary

• Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelength, frequency, and energy. The full range of electromagnetic

waves makes up the electromagnetic spectrum.

• Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with relatively long wavelengths and low frequencies. They are used

for microwave ovens, cell phones, and radar.

• A cell phone encodes the sounds of the caller’s voice in microwaves by changing the frequency of the waves.
The encoded microwaves then travel through the air to a cell tower and eventually to the receiver of the person
being called. The receiver decodes the microwaves and changes them back to sounds.

• Radar stands for radio detection and ranging. It is the use of reﬂected microwaves to determine vehicle speeds,

track storms, or detect air trafﬁc.

Slip! Slop! Slap! Did you ever hear this slogan? It stands for slip on a shirt, slop on some sunscreen, and slap on a
hat. The slogan originated in Australia in the 1980s, but it has since been adopted in many other places around the
globe. It sums up simple steps you can take to protect your skin from sunlight. Sunlight consists of a wide range of
electromagnetic waves, some of which are harmful.

The Waves in Sunlight

Electromagnetic waves are waves that carry energy through matter or space as vibrating electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
Electromagnetic waves have a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies. Sunlight contains the complete range of
wavelengths of electromagnetic waves, which is called the electromagnetic spectrum. The Figure 5.96 shows all the
waves in the spectrum.

Let There Be Light

Light includes infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light. As you can see from the Figure 5.96, light falls
roughly in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum.
It has shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than
microwaves, but not as short and high as X rays.

Infrared Light

Light with the longest wavelengths is called infrared light. The term infrared means “below red.” Infrared light is
the range of light waves that have longer wavelengths and lower frequencies than red light in the visible range of
light waves. The sun gives off infrared light as do ﬂames and living things. You can’t see infrared light waves, but
you can feel them as heat. But infrared cameras and night vision goggles can detect infrared light waves and convert
them to visible images. For a deeper understanding of infrared light, watch the video at this URL: http://www.youtu

The only light that people can see is called visible light. This light consists of a very narrow range of wavelengths
that falls between infrared light and ultraviolet light. Within the visible range, we see light of different wavelengths
as different colors of light, from red light, which has the longest wavelength, to violet light, which has the shortest
wavelength (see Figure 5.97). When all of the wavelengths of visible light are combined, as they are in sunlight,
visible light appears white. You can learn more about visible light at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P

Ultraviolet Light

Light with wavelengths shorter than visible light is called ultraviolet light. The term ultraviolet means “above
violet.” Ultraviolet light is the range of light waves that have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than violet
light in the visible range of light. With higher frequencies than visible light, ultraviolet light has more energy. It can
be used to kill bacteria in food and to sterilize surgical instruments. The human skin also makes vitamin D when it
is exposed to ultraviolet light. Vitamin D, in turn, is needed for strong bones and teeth. You can learn more about

Too much exposure to ultraviolet light can cause sunburn and skin cancer. As the “slip, slop, slap” slogan suggests,
you can protect your skin from ultraviolet light by wearing clothing that covers your skin, applying sunscreen to any
exposed areas, and wearing a hat to protect your head from exposure. The SPF, or sun-protection factor, of sunscreen
gives a rough idea of how long it protects the skin from sunburn (see Figure 5.98). A sunscreen with a higher SPF
value protects the skin longer. Sunscreen must be applied liberally and often to be effective, and no sunscreen is

You probably recognize this somewhat startling image as an X-ray image of a human skull. X-rays, which are used
to make images like this one, are electromagnetic waves.

Putting X-Rays in Context

Electromagnetic waves are vibrating electric and magnetic ﬁelds that transfer energy across space as well as through
matter. There are several different types of electromagnetic waves that vary in their frequencies and wavelengths.
Waves with higher frequencies have more energy. The electromagnetic spectrum pictured in the Figure 5.99
represents the full range of frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

High Energy Waves

Electromagnetic waves with the highest frequencies and greatest energy are on the right side of the electromagnetic
spectrum in the Figure 5.99. X-rays have more energy than any other electromagnetic waves except gamma rays.
For example, X-rays have enough energy to pass through soft tissues such as skin, although not enough to pass
through bones and teeth, which are very dense. The bright areas in the skull X-ray shows where X-rays were
absorbed by teeth and bones. X-rays are used not only for medical and dental purposes but also to screen luggage
at airports (see Figure 5.100). You can learn about the discovery of X-rays as well as other uses of X-rays at this

Q: What do the dark areas in an X-ray image represent?
A: The dark areas represent materials that do not absorb X-rays. Instead, the X-rays pass through these areas. For
example, in the X-ray image pictured in the Figure 5.100, the bag doesn’t show up because X-rays pass through the
soft cloth, but not the dense objects inside.

Dangers of X-Rays

Because X-rays are so energetic, they can penetrate many substances, including living cells. Therefore, too much
X-ray exposure can be dangerous. It may damage cells and cause cancer. If you’ve had dental X-rays, you may have
noticed that a heavy apron was placed over your body to protect it from stray X-rays. Protective aprons like this are
made of lead, which X-rays can’t pass through.

electromagnetic waves. http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/mov/97789main_GRBstar2.mov

electromagnetic waves. Their wavelengths are shorter than the diameter of atomic nuclei, and their frequencies are
greater than 1019 hertz (Hz). That’s 10 quadrillion waves per second! Because of their high frequencies, gamma

other stars, as well as by collapsing stars in gamma ray bursts. Fortunately, gamma rays from space are absorbed by
Earth’s atmosphere before they can reach the surface.
Q: Predict how gamma rays might affect living things on Earth if they weren’t absorbed by the atmosphere.
A: Gamma rays would destroy most living things on Earth because they have so much energy.

Dangers and Uses of Gamma Rays

The extremely high energy of gamma rays allows them to penetrate just about anything. They can even pass through
bones and teeth. This makes gamma rays very dangerous. They can destroy living cells, produce gene mutations,
and cause cancer. Ironically, the deadly effects of gamma rays can be used to treat cancer. In this type of treatment, a
medical device sends out focused gamma rays that target cancerous cells. The gamma rays kill the cells and destroy
the cancer.

Summary

• Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths and frequencies. Higher-frequency waves have more energy.
• Of all electromagnetic waves, gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies. Because of

their very high frequencies, gamma rays have more energy than any other electromagnetic waves.

• Sources of gamma rays include radioactive atoms, nuclear explosions, and stars. Gamma rays from space are

absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere.

• Gamma rays can destroy living cells, produce mutations, and cause cancer. They can be used to treat cancer

by focusing the deadly rays on cancer cells.

5.50 Sources of Visible Light

• Deﬁne visible light.
• Describe incandescence, and list sources of incandescent light.
• Identify three ways that luminescence can occur.

Imagine scuba diving and coming upon a jellyﬁsh. Would you be startled if the jellyﬁsh suddenly started to glow
with bright yellow light, like the jellyﬁsh in the picture above? If so, then the jellyﬁsh would have done its job.
Jellyﬁsh give off light to startle possible predators. The light they emit is visible light.

The Light We See

Visible light includes all the wavelengths of light that the human eye can detect. It allows us to see objects in the
world around us. Without visible light, we would only be able to sense most objects by sound, touch, or smell. Like
humans, most other organisms also depend on visible light, either directly or indirectly. Many animals—including
predators of jellyﬁsh—use visible light to see. Plants and certain other organisms use visible light to make food in
the process of photosynthesis. Without this food, most other organisms would not be able to survive.
Q: Do you think that some animals might be able to see light that isn’t visible to humans?
A: Some animals can see light in the infrared or ultraviolet range of wavelengths. For example, mosquitoes can see
infrared light, which is emitted by warm objects. By seeing infrared light, mosquitoes can tell where the warmest,
blood-rich areas of the body are located.

Incandescence

Chapter 5. Energy

Most of the visible light on Earth comes from the sun. The sun and other stars produce light because they are so hot.
They glow with light due to their extremely high temperatures. This way of producing light is called incandescence.
Incandescent light bulbs also produce light in this way. When electric current passes through a wire ﬁlament inside
an incandescent bulb, the wire gets so hot that it glows. Do you see the glowing ﬁlament inside the incandescent
light bulb in the Figure 5.102?

FIGURE 5.102

Q: What are some other sources of incandescent light?
A: Flames also produce incandescent light. For example, burning candles, oil lamps, and bonﬁres produce light in
this way.

Luminescence

Some objects produce light without becoming very hot. They generate light through chemical reactions or other
processes. Producing light without heat is called luminescence. Luminescence, in turn, can occur in several different
ways:

• One type of luminescence is called ﬂuorescence.

In this process, a substance absorbs shorter-wavelength
ultraviolet light and then gives off light in the visible range of wavelengths. Certain minerals produce light in
this way, including gemstones such as amethyst, diamond, and emerald. At the following URL, move your
mouse over the minerals in the picture to see the magic of ﬂuorescence: http://www.fluomin.org/uk/ .

• Another type of luminescence is called electroluminescence. In this process, a substance gives off light when
an electric current passes through it. Gases such as neon, argon, and krypton produce light by this means. The
car dash lights in the Figure 5.103 are produced by electroluminescence.

• A third type of luminescence is called bioluminescence. This is the production of light by living things as a
result of chemical reactions. The jellyﬁsh in the opening photo above produces light by bioluminescence. So
does the ﬁreﬂy in the Figure 5.104. Fireﬂies give off visible light to attract mates. You can learn more about
bioluminescence in the video at this URL: http://www.ted.com/talks/edith_widder_glowing_life_in_an_und

Illumination

Many other objects appear to produce their own light, but they actually just reﬂect light from another source. Being
lit by another source is called illumination. The moon in the Figure 5.105 is glowing so brightly that you can see
shadows under the trees. It appears to glow from its own light, but it’s really just illuminated by light from the sun.
Everything you can see that doesn’t produce its own light is illuminated by light from some other source.

Summary

• Visible light includes all the wavelengths of light that the human eye can detect. Humans and virtually all
other organisms depend on visible light to survive. Humans and many other animals use it to see. Plants use
it to make food for themselves and most other organisms.

• Most of the visible light on Earth comes from the sun. The sun produces light because it is so hot. Glowing

with visible light because of a high temperature is called incandescence.

• Producing light without a high temperature is called luminescence. Types of luminescence include ﬂuores-

cence, electroluminescence, and bioluminescence.

• All objects you can see that do not produce their own light are reﬂecting light from another source. This is

known as illumination.

5.51. Artiﬁcial Light

www.ck12.org

5.51 Artiﬁcial Light

• Identify ﬁve different types of artiﬁcial lights.
• Explain how each type of artiﬁcial light produces visible light.

What an exciting scene! The picture above shows Times Square in New York City. There are so many artiﬁcial lights
that it’s almost as bright as day even after the sun has gone down. Sunlight provides most of the visible light on
Earth, but artiﬁcial lights are also important. That’s obvious to someone in Times Square at night. It’s also obvious
to anyone who’s ever experienced a power outage after dark.

Turn on the Lights

If you’re like most people, you don’t give it a thought when you ﬂick a switch to turn on a light—at least not until
the power goes out and you’re left in the dark! When you ﬂick on a light switch, electricity normally ﬂows through
the light, and some type of light bulb converts the electrical energy to visible light. This can happen in various ways,
depending on the type of light bulb. Several different types of light bulbs are described below. All of them are
examples of artiﬁcial light, as opposed to natural light from the sun or other sources in nature.

Incandescent Light

An incandescent light bulb like the one pictured in the Figure 5.106 produces visible light by incandescence.
Incandescence occurs when something gets so hot that it glows. An incandescent light bulb contains a thin wire
ﬁlament made of tungsten. When electric current passes through the ﬁlament, it gets extremely hot and emits light.

906

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

FIGURE 5.106

Fluorescent Light

A ﬂuorescent light bulb produces visible light by ﬂuorescence. Fluorescence occurs when a substance absorbs
shorter-wavelength ultraviolet light and then gives off the energy as visible light. The compact ﬂuorescent light bulb
(CFL) in the Figure 5.107 contains mercury gas that gives off ultraviolet light when electricity passes through it.
The inside of the bulb is coated with a substance called phosphor. Phosphor absorbs the ultraviolet light and then
gives off most of the energy as visible light.

FIGURE 5.107

Neon Light

A neon light produces visible light by electroluminescence. In this process, neon or some other gas gives off light
when an electric current passes through it. Other halogen gases besides neon—including krypton and argon—also
produce light in this way. The word “OPEN” in the sign 5.108 is a neon light. It is a long glass tube that contains
neon gas. When electricity passes through the gas, it excites electrons of neon atoms, and the electrons jump to a

907

5.51. Artiﬁcial Light

www.ck12.org

higher energy level. As the excited electrons return to their original energy level, they give off visible light. Neon
produces red light. Other gases produce light of different colors. For example, krypton produces violet light, and
argon produces blue light.

FIGURE 5.108

Vapor Light

A vapor light also produces visible light by electroluminescence The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium
or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it
causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like the streetlight
pictured in the Figure 5.109, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. In addition to
lighting city streets, vapor lights are used to light highways and stadiums. The bulbs are very bright and long lasting
so they are a good choice for these places.

FIGURE 5.109

LED Light

LED stands for “light-emitting diode.” An LED light contains a material called a semi-conductor, which gives off
visible light when an electric current ﬂows through it. LED lights are used for trafﬁc lights (see Figure 5.110) and
also indicator lights on computers, cars, and many other devices. This type of light is very reliable and durable.
Q: Some light bulbs produce a lot of heat in addition to visible light, so they waste energy. Other bulbs produce
much less heat, so they use energy more efﬁciently. Which light bulbs described above would you place in each
category?
A: Incandescent light bulbs, which produce light by incandescence, give off a lot of heat as well as light, so they
waste energy. The other light bulbs produce light by some type of luminescence, in which light is produced without
heat. These light bulbs use energy more efﬁciently. Which types of light bulbs do you use?

Summary

• Most artiﬁcial lights use electricity for energy and have a light bulb that changes the electrical energy to visible

light. The production of visible light can happen in various ways, depending on the type of bulb.

5.52. Visible Light and Matter

www.ck12.org

5.52 Visible Light and Matter

• Describe how visible light interacts with matter.
• Compare and contrast transparent, translucent, and opaque matter.

A mime is an actor who uses movement and facial expressions rather than words to communicate with an audience.
The mime in this picture is using a mirror to apply stage makeup that will accentuate her features so she can
communicate more expressively. When light strikes a mirror, it is reﬂected back from the shiny surface. The
reﬂected light forms an image of whatever is in front of the mirror. Reﬂection is just one way that visible light may
interact with matter.

Reﬂection

Reﬂection of light occurs when light bounces back from a surface that it cannot pass through. Reﬂection may be
regular or diffuse.

• If the surface is very smooth, like a mirror, the reﬂected light forms a very clear image. This is called regular,
or specular, reﬂection. In the Figure 5.111, the smooth surface of the still water in the pond on the left reﬂects
light in this way.

• When light is reﬂected from a rough surface, the waves of light are reﬂected in many different directions, so a
clear image does not form. This is called diffuse reﬂection. In the Figure 5.111, the ripples in the water in the
picture on the right cause diffuse reﬂection of the blooming trees.

U13l1d.cfm

Transmission

Transmission of light occurs when light passes through matter. As light is transmitted, it may pass straight through
matter or it may be refracted or scattered as it passes through.

• When light is refracted, it changes direction as it passes into a new medium and changes speed. The straw in
the Figure 5.112 looks bent where light travels from water to air. Light travels more quickly in air than in
water and changes direction. For a detailed explanation of how this happens, watch the animation at this URL:

http://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/optics/bp.cfm

FIGURE 5.112

• Scattering occurs when light bumps into tiny particles of matter and spreads out in all directions. In the
Figure 5.113, beams of light from car headlights are shining through fog. The light is scattered by water
droplets in the air, giving the headlights a “halo” appearance.

FIGURE 5.113

Q: What might be another example of light scattering?
A: When light passes through smoky air, it is scattered by tiny particles of soot.

Absorption

Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reﬂected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption.
When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been
sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if
they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them.
Q: In hot sunny climates, people often dress in light-colored clothes. Why is this a good idea?
A: Light-colored clothes absorb less light and reﬂect more light than dark-colored clothes, so they keep people
cooler.

Classifying Matter in Terms of Light

Matter can be classiﬁed on the basis of its interactions with light. Matter may be transparent, translucent, or opaque.
An example of each type of matter is pictured in the Figure 5.114.

• Transparent matter is matter that transmits light without scattering it. Examples of transparent matter include
air, pure water, and clear glass. You can see clearly through transparent objects, such as the top panes of the
window 5.114, because just about all of the light that strikes them passes through to the other side.

• Translucent matter is matter that transmits light but scatters the light as it passes through. Light passes through
translucent objects but you cannot see clearly through them because the light is scattered in all directions. The
frosted glass panes at the bottom of the window 5.114 are translucent.

• Opaque matter is matter that does not let any light pass through it. Matter may be opaque because it absorbs

light, reﬂects light, or does some combination of both.

Examples of opaque objects are objects made of wood, like the shutters in the Figure 5.115. The shutters absorb
most of the light that strikes them and reﬂect just a few wavelengths of visible light. The glass mirror 5.115 is also
opaque. That’s because it reﬂects all of the light that strikes it.

• Describe how a prism separates visible light into its different colors.

This rainbow contains all the colors that you can see in the land below it—the yellow of the hills, the green of the
leaves and grasses. It contains other colors as well. In fact, a rainbow contains all of the colors of visible light.

Wavelength and Color

Visible light is light that has wavelengths that can be detected by the human eye. The wavelength of visible light
determines the color that the light appears. As you can see in the Figure 5.116, light with the longest wavelength
appears red, and light with the shortest wavelength appears violet. In between are all the other colors of light that
we can see. Only seven main colors of light are actually represented in the diagram.

Separating Colors of Light

A prism, like the one in the Figure 5.117, can be used to separate visible light into its different colors. A prism is
a pyramid-shaped object made of transparent matter, usually clear glass or plastic. Matter that is transparent allows
light to pass through it. A prism transmits light but slows it down. When light passes from air to the glass of the
prism, the change in speed causes the light to change direction and bend. Different wavelengths of light bend at
different angles. This makes the beam of light separate into light of different wavelengths. What we see is a rainbow
of colors. For an animated version of the prism below, go to this URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Light_disp

Q: Look back at the rainbow that opened this article. Do you see all the different colors of light, from red at the top
to violet at the bottom? What causes a rainbow to form? A: Individual raindrops act as tiny prisms. They separate
sunlight into its different wavelengths and create a rainbow of colors.

Colors of Objects

An opaque object is one that doesn’t let light pass through it. Instead, it reﬂects or absorbs the light that strikes it.
Many objects, such as the leaves pictured in the Figure 5.118, reﬂect just one or a few wavelengths of visible light
and absorb the rest. The wavelengths that are reﬂected determine the color that an object appears to the human eye.
For example, the leaves appear green because they reﬂect green light and absorb light of other wavelengths.

FIGURE 5.118

916

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

A transparent or translucent material, such as window glass, transmits some or all of the light that strikes it. This
means that the light passes through the material rather than being reﬂected by it. In this case, we see the material
because of the transmitted light. Therefore, the wavelength of the transmitted light determines the color that the
object appears. Look at the beautiful stained glass windows in the Figure 5.119. The different colors of glass
transmit light of different colors.

FIGURE 5.119

The color of light that strikes an object may also affect the color that the object appears. For example, if only blue
light strikes green leaves, the blue light is absorbed and no light is reﬂected.
Q: What color do you see if an object absorbs all of the light that strikes it?
A: When all of the light is absorbed, none is reﬂected, so the object looks black. But black isn’t a color of light.
Black is the absence of light.

The Colors We See

The human eye can distinguish only red, green, and blue light. These three colors are called the primary colors of
light. All other colors of light can be created by combining the primary colors. Look at the Venn diagram 5.120.
Red and green light combine to form yellow light. Red and blue light combine to form magenta light, and blue and
green light combine to form cyan light. Yellow, magenta, and cyan are called the secondary colors of light. Look at
the center of the diagram, where all three primary colors of light combine. The result is white light. You can explore
the colors of visible light and how they combine at this URL: http://www.phy.ntnu.edu.tw/oldjava/color/color_e.htm
l

Pigments

Many objects have color because they contain pigments. A pigment is a substance that colors materials by reﬂecting
light of certain wavelengths and absorbing light of other wavelengths. A very common pigment is the dark green
pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in plants. Chlorophyll absorbs all but green wavelengths of visible light.
Pigments are also found in many manufactured products. They are used to color paints, inks, and dyes. Just three
pigments, called primary pigments, can be combined to produce all other colors. The primary colors of pigments
are the same as the secondary colors of light: cyan, magenta, and yellow.
Q: A color printer needs just three colors of ink to print all of the colors that we can see. Which colors are they?

FIGURE 5.120

A: The three colors of ink in a color printer are the three primary pigment colors: cyan, magenta, and yellow. These
three colors can be combined in different ratios to produce all other colors, so they are the only colors needed for
full-color printing.

Summary

• The wavelength of visible light determines the color that the light appears. Light with the longest wavelength
appears red, and light with the shortest wavelength appears violet. In between are the wavelengths of all the
other colors of light.

• A prism separates visible light into its different colors. As light passes through the prism, it slows and bends,
but different wavelengths bend at different angles. This separates light into different wavelengths, forming a
rainbow of colors.

• The wavelengths of visible light that an object reﬂects or transmits determine the color that the object appears

to the human eye.

• The human eye can distinguish only red, green, and blue light. These three colors are the primary colors
of light. All other colors of light can be created by combining the primary colors. Secondary colors of
light—cyan, yellow, and magenta—form when two primary colors combine equally.

• Pigments are substances that color materials by reﬂecting light of certain wavelengths and absorbing light of
other wavelengths. The primary pigment colors are cyan, yellow, and magenta. They can be combined to
produce all other colors.

their image in the mirror as they dance. What is an image, and how does it get “inside” a mirror? In this article,
you’ll ﬁnd out.

Reﬂected Light and Images

Reﬂection is one of several ways that light can interact with matter. Light reﬂects off surfaces such as mirrors that
do not transmit or absorb light. When light is reﬂected from a smooth surface, it may form an image. An image is a
copy of an object that is formed by reﬂected (or refracted) light.
Q: Is an image an actual object? If not, what is it?

920

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

A: No, an image isn’t an actual object. It is focused rays of light that make a copy of an object, like a picture
projected on a screen.

Regular and Diffuse Reﬂection

If a surface is extremely smooth, as it is in a mirror, then the image formed by reﬂection is sharp and clear. This is
called regular reﬂection (also called specular reﬂection). However, if the surface is even slightly rough or bumpy, an
image may not form, or if there is an image, it is blurry or fuzzy. This is called diffuse reﬂection.
Q: Look at the boats and their images in the Figure 5.122. Which one represents regular reﬂection, and which one
represents diffuse reﬂection?
A: Reﬂection of the boat on the left is regular reﬂection. The water is smooth and the image is sharp and clear.
Reﬂection of the boat on the right is diffuse reﬂection. The water has ripples and the image is blurry and wavy.

FIGURE 5.122

In the Figure 5.123, you can see how both types of reﬂection occur. Waves of light are represented by arrows called
rays. Rays that strike the surface are referred to as incident rays, and rays that reﬂect off the surface are known
as reﬂected rays. In regular reﬂection, all the rays are reﬂected in the same direction. This explains why regular
reﬂection forms a clear image. In diffuse reﬂection, the rays are reﬂected in many different directions. This is why
diffuse reﬂection forms, at best, a blurry image. You can see animations of both types of reﬂection at this URL: http
://toolboxes.ﬂexiblelearning.net.au/demosites/series5/508/Laboratory/StudyNotes/snReﬂectionMirrors.htm

FIGURE 5.123

Law of Reﬂection

One thing is true of both regular and diffuse reﬂection. The angle at which the reﬂected rays leave the surface is
equal to the angle at which the incident rays strike the surface. This is known as the law of reﬂection. The law is
illustrated in the Figure 5.124 and also in this animation: http://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/optics/lr.cfm

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 5.124
According to the law of reﬂection, the an-
gle of reﬂection always equals the angle
of incidence. The angles of both reﬂected
and incident light are measured relative
to an imaginary line, called normal, that
is perpendicular (at right angles) to the
reﬂective surface.

Summary

• Reﬂection is one of several ways that light can interact with matter. When light is reﬂected from a smooth
surface, it may form an image. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reﬂected (or refracted) light.
• Regular reﬂection occurs when light reﬂects off a very smooth surface and forms a clear image. Diffuse

reﬂection occurs when light reﬂects off a rough surface and forms a blurry image or no image at all.

• According to the law of reﬂection, the angle at which light rays reﬂect off a surface is equal to the angle at

which the incident rays strike the surface.

How Mirrors Form Images

A mirror is typically made of glass with a shiny metal backing that reﬂects all the light that strikes it. When a
mirror reﬂects light, it forms an image. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reﬂection or refraction.
Mirrors may have ﬂat or curved surfaces. The shape of a mirror’s surface determines the type of image it forms. For
example, some mirrors form real images, and other mirrors form virtual images. What’s the difference between real
and virtual images?

• A real image forms in front of a mirror where reﬂected light rays actually meet. It is a true image that could

be projected on a screen.

• A virtual image appears to be on the other side of the mirror. Of course, reﬂected rays don’t actually go
through the mirror to the other side, so a virtual image doesn’t really exist. It just appears to exist to the
human brain.

Q: Look back at the image of the girl pointing at her image in the mirror. Which type of image is it, real or virtual?
A: The image of the girl is a virtual image. It appears to be on the other side of the mirror from the girl.

924

Plane Mirror

Chapter 5. Energy

The mirror in the opening photo is a plane mirror. This is the most common type of mirror. It has a ﬂat reﬂective
surface and forms only virtual images. The image formed by a plane mirror is also right-side up and life sized.
But something is different about the image compared with the real object in front of the mirror. Left and right are
reversed. Look at the girl brushing her teeth in the Figure 5.127. She is using her left hand to brush her teeth, but
her image (on the left) appears to be brushing her teeth with the right hand. All plane mirrors reverse left and right
in this way. The term mirror image refers to how left and right are reversed in an image compared with the object.

FIGURE 5.127

Concave Mirror

Some mirrors have a curved rather than ﬂat surface. Curved mirrors can be concave or convex. A concave mirror
is shaped like the inside of a bowl. This type of mirror forms either real or virtual images, depending on where the
object is placed relative to the focal point. The focal point is the point in front of the mirror where the reﬂected
rays meet. You can see how concave mirrors form images in the Figure 5.128 and at the following URL. Concave
mirrors are used behind car headlights. They focus the light and make it brighter. Concave mirrors are also used in
some telescopes. http://www.splung.com/content/sid/4/page/concavemirrors

Convex Mirror

www.ck12.org

The other type of curved mirror, a convex mirror, is shaped like the outside of a bowl. Because of its shape, it can
gather and reﬂect light from a wide area. As you can see in the Figure 5.129, a convex mirror forms only virtual
images that are right-side up and smaller than the actual object. You can see how a convex mirror forms an image in
the animation at this URL: http://physics.slss.ie/resources/convex%20mirror.swf

FIGURE 5.129

Q: Convex mirrors are used as side mirrors on cars. You can see one in the Figure 5.130. Why is a convex mirror
good for this purpose?
A: Because it gathers light over a wide area, a convex mirror gives the driver a wider view of the area around the
vehicle than a plane mirror would.

Summary

Chapter 5. Energy

• When a mirror reﬂects light, it forms an image. An image is a copy of an object formed by reﬂection (or
refraction). A real image is a true image that forms in front of a mirror where reﬂected light rays actually
meet. A virtual image appears to be on the other side of the mirror and doesn’t really exist.

• Most mirrors are plane mirrors that have a ﬂat reﬂective surface. A plane mirror forms only virtual, right-side

up, and life-sized images.

• A concave mirror is shaped like the inside of a bowl. The type of image it forms depends on where the object
is relative to the focal point. The image may be real, upside down, and reduced in size; or it may be virtual,
right-side up, and enlarged.

• A convex mirror is shaped like the outside of a bowl. It forms only virtual images that are right-side up and

reduced in size relative to the object.

5.56 Refraction

• Relate the speed of light to its medium.
• Describe refraction and explain when it occurs.

Is this some kind of magic trick? Or is this straw really broken where it enters the water? The answer to both
questions is no. There’s nothing wrong with the straw, and no magic is involved. It’s simply how light may behave
when it enters a new medium.

Speed of Light and Matter

Light always travels at the same speed across space. That speed, represented by the letter c, is about 300 million
meters per second. However, when light travels through a medium, it travels more slowly. The speed varies for
different kinds of matter. The Table 5.5 gives the speed of visible light in six different materials.

Q: Predict the speed of visible light through vinegar.

929

5.56. Refraction

www.ck12.org

A: Vinegar is mostly water, so if you predicted that the speed of light through vinegar would be close to its speed
through water, you are correct. The speed of visible light through Heinz® vinegar is about 230 million m/s.

Bending Light

When light passes from one medium to another, it changes speed. For example, when light passes from air to glass,
it slows down. If light strikes a sheet of glass at a 90° angle, or perpendicular to the glass, it slows down but still
passes straight through the glass. However, if light enters the glass at an angle other than 90°, the light bends as
it slows down. The bending of light as it changes speed in a new medium is called refraction. The Figure 5.132
shows how refraction occurs. Notice that the speed of light changes again as it passes from the glass back to the air.
In this case, the speed increases, and the ray of light resumes its initial direction. For a more detailed explanation of
refraction, watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RM46yvDOHI .

FIGURE 5.132

What’s Your Angle?

The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium depends on its change in speed. The greater the
change in speed, the greater the angle of refraction is. For example, light refracts more when it passes from air to
diamond than it does when it passes from air to water. That’s because the speed of light is slower in diamond than it
is in water.
Q: Now can you explain why the straw in the opening image appears to be broken where it enters the water?
A: The straw appears to be broken because of refraction. Light slows down and bends when it passes from the water
in the glass to the air on its way to your eyes.

Summary

• Light always travels at the same speed through empty space. That speed, represented by the letter c, is about

300 million meters per second. However, when light travels through a medium, it travels more slowly.

• If light passes from one medium to another at an angle other than 90 °, the light changes speed and bends.

This bending of light is called refraction.

• The angle at which light refracts when it enters a different medium depends on its change in speed. The greater

the change in speed, the greater the angle of refraction is.

5.57 Lens

• Describe a lens and what it does.
• Compare and contrast concave and convex lenses.

The tiny object on this man’s ﬁnger is life-changing for him. It lets him see clearly without wearing glasses. You
probably recognize the object as a contact lens. You may even wear contact lenses yourself.

What Is a Lens?

A lens is a transparent object with one or two curved surfaces. It is typically made of glass (or clear plastic in the
case of a contact lens). A lens refracts, or bends, light and forms an image. An image is a copy of an objected
formed by the refraction (or reﬂection) of visible light. The more curved the surface of a lens is, the more it refracts
the light that passes through it. There are two basic types of lenses: concave and convex. The two types of lenses
have different shapes, so they bend light and form images in different ways.

Concave Lens

A concave lens is thicker at the edges than it is in the middle. You can see the shape of a concave lens in the Figure
5.133. From the diagram, it’s clear that the lens causes rays of light to diverge, or spread apart, as they pass through
it. Note that the image formed by a concave lens is on the same side of the lens as the object. It is also smaller than

Chapter 5. Energy

the object and right-side up. However, it isn’t a real image. It is a virtual image. Your brain “tricks” you into seeing
an image there. The light rays actually pass through the glass to the other side and spread out in all directions. You
can explore the formation of images by a concave lens at this URL: http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/geometric-optics/g
eometric-optics_en.html

FIGURE 5.133

Convex Lens

A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges. You can see the shape of a convex lens in the Figure 5.134.
A convex lens causes rays of light to converge, or meet, at a point called the focus (F). A convex lens forms either a
real or virtual image. It depends on how close the object is to the lens relative to the focus. You can interact with an
animated convex lens at this URL: http://www.phy.ntnu.edu.tw/ntnujava/index.php?topic=1395.msg5241#msg5241

Q: An example of a convex lens is a hand lens. Which of the three convex lens diagrams in the Figure 5.134 shows
how a hand lens makes an image?
A: You’ve probably looked through a hand lens before. If you have, then you know that the image it produces
is right-side up. Therefore, the ﬁrst diagram must show how a hand lens makes an image. It’s the only one that
produces a right-side up image.

Summary

• A lens is a transparent object, typically made of glass, with one or two curved surfaces. A lens refracts light

and forms an image.

• A concave lens is thicker at the edges than it is in the middle. This causes rays of light to diverge. The light

forms a virtual image that is right-side up and smaller than the object.

• A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges. This causes rays of light to converge. The light forms

a real or virtual image depending on the distance of the object from the lens.

Optics and Optical Instruments

Optics is the study of visible light and the ways it can be used to extend human vision and do other tasks. Knowledge
of light was needed for the invention of optical instruments such as microscopes, telescopes, and cameras, in addition
to optical ﬁbers. These instruments use mirrors and lenses to reﬂect and refract light and form images.

Light Microscope

Chapter 5. Energy

A light microscope is an instrument that uses lenses to make enlarged images of objects that are too small for the
unaided eye to see. A common type of light microscope is a compound microscope, like the one shown in the
Figure 5.135. A compound microscope has at least two convex lenses: one or more objective lenses and one or
more eyepiece lenses. The objective lenses are close to the object being viewed. They form an enlarged image of
the object inside the microscope. The eyepiece lenses are close to the viewer’s eyes. They form an enlarged image
of the ﬁrst image. The magniﬁcations of all the lenses are multiplied together to yield the overall magniﬁcation of
the microscope. Some light microscopes can magnify objects more than 1000 times! For more on light microscopes
and the images they create, watch the video at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo7mr90GYLA

FIGURE 5.135

Q: How has the microscope advanced scientiﬁc knowledge?
A: The microscope has revealed secrets of the natural world like no other single invention. The microscope let
scientists see entire new worlds, leading to many discoveries—especially in biology and medicine—that could not
have been made without it. Some examples include the discovery of cells and the identiﬁcation of bacteria and other
single-celled organisms. With the development of more powerful microscopes, viruses were discovered and even
atoms ﬁnally became visible. These discoveries changed our ideas about the human body and the nature of life itself.

Telescope

Like microscopes, telescopes use convex lenses to make enlarged images. However, telescopes make enlarged
images of objects—such as distant stars—that only appear tiny because they are very far away. There are two basic
types of telescopes: reﬂecting telescopes and refracting telescopes. The two types are compared in the Figure 5.136.
They differ in how they collect light, but both use convex lenses to form enlarged images. You can learn more about
telescopes and how they evolved in the video at this URL:

Camera

A camera is an optical instrument that forms and records an image of an object. The image may be recorded on
ﬁlm or it may be detected by an electronic sensor that stores the image digitally. Regardless of how the image is
recorded, all cameras form images in the same basic way, as shown in the Figure 5.137.

• Light passes through the lens at the front of the camera and enters the camera through an opening called the

aperture.

• As light passes through the lens, it forms a reduced real image. The image focuses on ﬁlm (or a sensor) at the

back of the camera. The lens may be moved back and forth to bring the image into focus.

• The shutter controls the amount of light that actually strikes the ﬁlm (or sensor). It stays open longer in dim

light to let more light in.

crests and troughs of the waves line up. The diagram in Figure 5.138 shows why a beam of laser light is so focused
compared with ordinary light from a ﬂashlight.

mirror at one end of the tube is partly transparent. A constant stream of photons passes through the transparent part,
forming the laser beam. You can see an animation showing how a laser works at this URL: http://www.youtube.c

Optical Fibers

Besides entertaining a cat, laser light has many other uses. One use is carrying communication signals in optical
ﬁbers. Sounds or pictures are encoded in pulses of laser light, which are then sent through an optical ﬁber. All of the
light reﬂects off the inside of the ﬁber, so none of it escapes. As a result, the signal remains strong even over long
distances. More than one signal can travel through an optical ﬁber at the same time, as you can see in the Figure
5.140. Optical ﬁbers are used to carry telephone, cable TV, and Internet signals.
Q: When lasers were invented in 1960, they were called "a solution looking for a problem.” Since then, they have
been put to thousands of different uses. Can you name other ways that lasers are used?

Summary

• Optics is the study of visible light and the ways it can be used to extend human vision and do other tasks.
Optical instruments are based on optics. They use mirrors and lenses to reﬂect and refract light and form
images.

• The light microscope and telescope use convex lenses and mirrors to make enlarged images of very tiny or

distant objects. A camera uses a convex lens to make a reduced image of an object.

• A laser is a device that produces a very focused beam of visible light of just one wavelength and color. Pulses

5.59 Vision and the Eye

• Describe how the eye collects and focuses light.
• Explain the role of the brain in vision.

Did you ever hear the proverb, “the eyes are the windows to the soul”? While it’s true that our eyes often express
what we are thinking or feeling, they are windows in another sense as well. Like windows made of glass, the eyes
let light in and allow us to see.

Structure and Function of the Eye

The human eye is an organ that is specialized to collect light and focus images. The structures of the human eye are
shown in the Figure 5.141. Examine each structure in the diagram as you read about it below.

• The sclera, also known as the white of the eye, is an opaque outer covering that protects the eye. It keeps light

out of the eye except at the center front of the eye.

• The cornea is a transparent outer covering of the front of the eye. It protects the eye and also acts as a convex
lens. A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges and makes rays of light converge, or meet at a
point. The shape of the cornea helps focus light that enters the eye.

• The pupil is an opening in the front of the eye. It looks black because it doesn’t reﬂect any light. All the
light passes through it instead. The pupil controls the amount of light that enters the eye. It automatically gets
bigger or smaller to let more or less light in as needed.

• The iris is the colored part of the eye. It controls the size of the pupil.
• The lens of the eye is a convex lens. It ﬁne-tunes the focus so an image forms on the retina at the back of the

eye. Tiny muscles control the shape of the lens to focus images of close or distant objects.

• The retina is a membrane lining the back of the eye. The retina has nerve cells called rods and cones that
change images to electrical signals. Rods are good at sensing dim light but can’t distinguish different colors
of light. Cones can sense colors but not dim light. There are three different types of cones. Each type senses
one of the three primary colors of light (red, green, or blue).

• The optic nerve carries electrical signals from the rods and cones to the brain.

Q: The lens of the eye is a convex lens. How would vision be affected if the lens of the eye was concave instead of
convex?
A: A concave lens causes rays of light to diverge, or spread apart. It forms a virtual image on the same side of the
lens at the object being viewed. Therefore, a concave lens would focus the image in front of the eye, not on the
retina inside the eye. No signals would be sent to the brain so vision would not be possible.

How We See

The ability to see is called vision. This ability depends on more than healthy eyes. It also depends on certain parts
of the brain, because the brain and eyes work together to allow us to see. The eyes collect and focus visible light.
The lens and other structures of the eye work together to focus an image on the retina. The image is upside-down
and reduced in size, as you can see in the Figure 5.142. Cells in the retina change the image to electrical signals that
travel to the brain through the optic nerve. The brain interprets the electrical signals as shape, color, and brightness.
It also interprets the image as though it were right-side up. The brain does this automatically, so what we see always
appears right-side up. The brain also interprets what we are seeing.
Q: The part of the brain that processes information from the eyes is the visual cortex. It is located at the back of the
brain. How might an injury to the visual cortex affect vision?
A: An injury to the visual cortex might cause abnormal vision or even blindness regardless of how well the eyes can
gather and focus light.

• Identify common vision problems.
• Explain how lenses can correct vision problems.

If you’ve ever had your vision checked, you’ve no doubt been asked to read an eye chart like the one in this cartoon.
The patient in the cartoon must be having trouble making out the letters in the second row of the chart, because he
asks the doctor for a hint (in the style of a popular TV game show). The patient clearly has a vision problem.

Problems with Vision

Many people have problems with their vision, or ability to see. Often, the problem is due to the shape of the eyes
and how they focus light. Two of the most common vision problems are nearsightedness and farsightedness, which
you can read about below. You may even have one of these vision problems yourself. Usually, the problems can be
corrected with contact lenses or lenses in eyeglasses. In many people, they can also be corrected with laser surgery,
which reshapes the outer layer of the eye. For a video about vision problems, go to this URL: http://www.youtube.c

Nearsightedness

Chapter 5. Energy

Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the condition in which nearby objects are seen clearly, but distant objects appear
blurry. The Figure 5.143 shows how it occurs. The eyeball is longer (from front to back) than normal. This causes
images to be focused in front of the retina instead of on the retina. Myopia can be corrected with concave lenses.
The lenses focus images farther back in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of in front of it.

FIGURE 5.143

Q: Sometimes squinting the eyes can help someone see more clearly. Why do you think this works?
A: Squinting may improve focus by slightly changing the shape of the eyes. When you squint, you tighten muscles
around the eyes, putting pressure on the eyeballs.

Farsightedness

Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear
blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure 5.144). This causes images to be focused in a
spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex
lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

FIGURE 5.144

Q: Joey has hyperopia. When is he more likely to need his glasses: when he reads a book or when he watches TV?
A: With hyperopia, Joey is farsighted. He can probably see the TV more clearly than the words in a book because
the TV is farther away. Therefore, he is more likely to need his glasses when he reads than when he watches TV.

5.61 Electric Charge and Electric Force

• Deﬁne electric charge.
• Describe electric forces between charged particles.

A lightning bolt is like the spark that gives you a shock when you touch a metal doorknob. Of course, the lightning
bolt is on a much larger scale. But both the lightning bolt and spark are a sudden transfer of electric charge.

Introducing Electric Charge

Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without
touching. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge,
and an electron has a negative electric charge. In the Figure 5.145, you can see that positively charged protons (+)
are located in the nucleus of the atom, while negatively charged electrons (-) move around the nucleus.

Electric Force

When it comes to electric charges, opposites attract, so positive and negative particles attract each other. You can see
this in the Figure 5.146. This attraction explains why negative electrons keep moving around the positive nucleus
of the atom. Like charges, on the other hand, repel each other, so two positive or two negative charges push apart.
This is also shown in the diagram. The attraction or repulsion between charged particles is called electric force. The
strength of electric force depends on the amount of electric charge on the particles and the distance between them.
Larger charges or shorter distances result in greater force. You can experiment with electric force with the animation
at the following URL. http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/waves_particles/wavpart2.html
Q: How do positive protons stay close together inside the nucleus of the atom if like charges repel each other?
A: Other, stronger forces in the nucleus hold the protons together.

What Is an Electric Field?

An electric ﬁeld is a space around a charged particle where the particle exerts electric force on other charged
particles. Because of their force ﬁelds, charged particles can exert force on each other without actually touching.
Electric ﬁelds are generally represented by arrows, as you can see in the Figure 5.147. The arrows show the direction
of electric force around a positive particle and a negative particle. For an animated diagram, go to this URL: http://o

Interacting Electric Fields

When charged particles are close enough to exert force on each other, their electric ﬁelds interact. This is illustrated
in the Figure 5.148. The lines of force bend together when particles with different charges attract each other. The
lines bend apart when particles with like charges repel each other. At the following URL, play “Electric Field of

Why is this girl’s hair standing straight up? She is touching a device called a van de Graaff generator. The dome on
top of the device has a negative electric charge. When the girl places her hand on the dome, she becomes negatively
charged as well—right down to the tip of each hair! You can see a video demonstrating a van de Graff generator at

pushing away from each other, causing them to stand on end.

Transferring Electrons

Chapter 5. Energy

The girl pictured above became negatively charged because electrons ﬂowed from the van de Graaff generator to
her. Whenever electrons are transferred between objects, neutral matter becomes charged. This occurs even with
individual atoms. Atoms are neutral in electric charge because they have the same number of negative electrons as
positive protons. However, if atoms lose or gain electrons, they become charged particles called ions. You can see
how this happens in the Figure 5.149. When an atom loses electrons, it becomes a positively charged ion, or cation.
When an atom gains electrons, it becomes a negative charged ion, or anion.

FIGURE 5.149

Conservation of Charge

Like the formation of ions, the formation of charged matter in general depends on the transfer of electrons, either
between two materials or within a material. Three ways this can occur are referred to as conduction, polarization,
and friction. All three ways are described below. However, regardless of how electrons are transferred, the total
charge always remains the same. Electrons move, but they aren’t destroyed. This is the law of conservation of
charge.

Conduction

The transfer of electrons from the van de Graaff generator to the man is an example of conduction. Conduction
occurs when there is direct contact between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. A
van de Graff generator produces a negative charge on its dome, so it tends to give up electrons. Human hands are
positively charged, so they tend to accept electrons. Therefore, electrons ﬂow from the dome to the man’s hand when
they are in contact.
You don’t need a van de Graaff generator for conduction to take place. It may occur when you walk across a wool
carpet in rubber-soled shoes. Wool tends to give up electrons and rubber tends to accept them. Therefore, the carpet
transfers electrons to your shoes each time you put down your foot. The transfer of electrons results in you becoming
negatively charged and the carpet becoming positively charged.

953

5.63. Transfer of Electric Charge

Polarization

www.ck12.org

Assume that you have walked across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes and become negatively charged. If you
then reach out to touch a metal doorknob, electrons in the neutral metal will be repelled and move away from your
hand before you even touch the knob. In this way, one end of the doorknob becomes positively charged and the
other end becomes negatively charged. This is called polarization. Polarization occurs whenever electrons within a
neutral object move because of the electric ﬁeld of a nearby charged object. It occurs without direct contact between
the two objects. The Figure 5.150 models how polarization occurs.

FIGURE 5.150

Q: What happens when the negatively charged plastic rod in the diagram is placed close to the neutral metal plate?
A: Electrons in the plate are repelled by the positive charges in the rod. The electrons move away from the rod,
causing one side of the plate to become positively charged and the other side to become negatively charged.

Friction

Did you ever rub an inﬂated balloon against your hair? You can see what happens in the Figure 5.151. Friction
between the balloon and hair cause electrons from the hair to “rub off” on the balloon. That’s because a balloon
attracts electrons more strongly than hair does. After the transfer of electrons, the balloon becomes negatively
charged and the hair becomes positively charged. The individual hairs push away from each other and stand on end
because like charges repel each other. The balloon and the hair attract each other because opposite charges attract.
Electrons are transferred in this way whenever there is friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up
or accept electrons. Watch the animation “Balloons and Static Electricity” at the following URL to see how electrons
are transferred by friction between a sweater and a balloon. http://www.cabrillo.edu/~jmccullough/Physics/Electri
c_Forces_Fields.html
Q: If you rub a balloon against a wall, it may stick to the wall. Explain why.
A: Electrons are transferred from the wall to the balloon, making the balloon negatively charged and the wall
positively charged. The balloon sticks to the wall because opposite charges attract.

5.64 Static Electricity and Static Discharge

• Describe static electricity.
• Explain static discharge.
• Outline how lightning occurs.

You’re a thoughtful visitor, so you wipe your feet on the welcome mat before you reach out to touch the brass
knocker on the door. Ouch! A spark suddenly jumps between your hand and the metal, and you feel an electric
shock.
Q: Why do you think an electric shock occurs?
A: An electric shock occurs when there is a sudden discharge of static electricity.

What Is Static Electricity?

Static electricity is a buildup of electric charges on objects. Charges build up when negative electrons are transferred
from one object to another. The object that gives up electrons becomes positively charged, and the object that accepts
the electrons becomes negatively charged. This can happen in several ways.
One way electric charges can build up is through friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or
accept electrons. When you wipe your rubber-soled shoes on the wool mat, for example, electrons rub off the mat
onto your shoes. As a result of this transfer of electrons, positive charges build up on the mat and negative charges
build up on you.
Once an object becomes electrically charged, it is likely to remain charged until it touches another object or at least
comes very close to another object. That’s because electric charges cannot travel easily through air, especially if the
air is dry.

956

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

Q: You’re more likely to get a shock in the winter when the air is very dry. Can you explain why?
A: When the air is very dry, electric charges are more likely to build up objects because they cannot travel easily
through the dry air. This makes a shock more likely when you touch another object.

Static Discharge

What happens when you have become negatively charged and your hand approaches the metal doorknocker? Your
negatively charged hand repels electrons in the metal, so the electrons move to the other side of the knocker. This
makes the side of the knocker closest to your hand positively charged. As your negatively charged hand gets very
close to the positively charged side of the metal, the air between your hand and the knocker also becomes electrically
charged. This allows electrons to suddenly ﬂow from your hand to the knocker. The sudden ﬂow of electrons is
static discharge. The discharge of electrons is the spark you see and the shock you feel. Watch the animation “John
Travoltage” at the following URL to see an example of static electricity and static discharge.
http://www.cabrillo.edu/~jmccullough/Physics/Electric_Forces_Fields.html

How Lightning Occurs

Another example of static discharge, but on a much larger scale, is lightning. You can see how it occurs in the
following diagram ( Figure 5.152) and animation as you read about it below.
http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/electromag/java/lightning/index.html

FIGURE 5.152

During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of positive and negative charge due to the movement of air molecules,
water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds, and the positive
charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground beneath them, so the ground
below the clouds becomes positively charged. At ﬁrst, the atmosphere prevents electrons from ﬂowing away from
areas of negative charge and toward areas of positive charge. As more charges build up, however, the air between
the oppositely charged areas also becomes charged. When this happens, static electricity is discharged as bolts of
lightning.

• Describe electric current.
• Explain why electric current occurs.
• Deﬁne voltage.

Emily’s dad is giving his car battery a “jump” because the battery “died” overnight. He’s attaching cables to the
terminals of the car battery. Then he will connect the other ends of the cables to the terminals of a “live” battery.
The cables will carry electric current to the dead battery, providing the energy needed for the car to start.

Flowing Charges

Electric current is a continuous ﬂow of electric charges (electrons). Current is measured as the amount of charge
that ﬂows past a given point in a certain amount of time. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), or
amp. Electric current may ﬂow in just one direction (direct current), or it may keep reversing direction (alternating
current). You can watch an animation of electric current at this URL: http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/animations/El
ectric_current/index.html
Q: Why do you think charges ﬂow in an electric current?

959

5.65. Electric Current

www.ck12.org

A: Electric charges ﬂow when they have electric potential energy. Potential energy is stored energy that an object
has due to its position or shape.

Electric Potential Energy

Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric ﬁeld. For example, when two
negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential
to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move
spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential
energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity.

Voltage

For an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential energy
between the two positions. A difference in electric potential energy is called voltage. The SI unit for voltage is the
volt (V). Look at the Figure 5.153. It shows a simple circuit. The source of voltage in the circuit is a 1.5-volt battery.
The difference of 1.5 volts between the two battery terminals results in a spontaneous ﬂow of charges, or electric
current, between them. Notice that the current ﬂows from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, because
electric current is a ﬂow of electrons.

FIGURE 5.153

Q: You might put a 1.5-volt battery in a TV remote. The battery in a car is a 12-volt battery. How do you think the
current of a 12-volt battery compares to the current of a 1.5-volt battery?
A: Greater voltage means a greater difference in potential energy, so the 12-volt battery can produce more current
than the 1.5-volt battery.

Summary

• Electric current is a continuous ﬂow of electric charges. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A).
• An electric charge ﬂows when it has electric potential energy due to its position in an electric ﬁeld. An electric

charge always moves spontaneously from a position of higher to lower potential energy.

• For an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential

energy between the two positions. This difference is called voltage. The SI unit for voltage is the volt (V).

5.66 Direct and Alternating Current

• Distinguish between direct current and alternating current.

To use an electric appliance, you have to plug it into an outlet unless it has batteries. This may be all you need to
know in order to use electric current. But did you ever wonder what electric current is or how it ﬂows through wires
inside the walls of your home? Electric current is a continuous ﬂow of electric charges. The charges may ﬂow in
just one direction, or they may keep reversing direction. You can watch an animation of both types of current at this

Direct Current

Chapter 5. Energy

When current ﬂows in just one direction, it is called direct current (DC). The diagram below shows how direct
current ﬂows through a simple circuit. An example of direct current is the current that ﬂows through a battery-
powered ﬂashlight. In addition to batteries, solar cells and fuel cells can also provide direct current.

Alternating Current

When current keeps reversing direction, it is called alternating current (AC). You can see how it works in the two
diagrams below. The current that comes from a power plant and supplies electricity to homes and businesses is
alternating current. The current changes direction 60 times per second. It happens so quickly that the light bulb
doesn’t have a chance to stop glowing when the reversals occur.

Q: Which type of current ﬂows through the wires in your home?
A: Alternating current from a power plant ﬂows through the wires in a home.

Summary

• Direct current (DC) keeps ﬂowing in just one direction. Batteries provide direct current.

5.67 Chemical and Solar Cells

• Explain how a chemical cell works.
• Outline how a solar cell produces electric current.

Can you identify the two objects pictured above? You’ve probably used objects like these many times. The photos
show a TV remote (left) and a calculator (right). Both of them run on electric current. Current requires a source of
voltage, which is a difference in electric potential energy.
Q: The source of voltage is different in the remote and the calculator. Do you know what source of voltage each
device uses?
A: The TV remote uses chemical cells as a source of voltage. The calculator uses a solar cell.

Chemical Cells

Chemical cells are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions. Chemical cells have
two electrodes, which are strips of different materials, such as zinc and carbon. The electrodes are suspended in an
electrolyte. This is a substance that contains free ions, which can carry electric current. The electrolyte may be either
a paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in which case the cell is called a wet cell. Flashlight
batteries contain dry cells. Car batteries contain wet cells.
The Figure 5.154 shows how a battery works. The diagram represents the simplest type of battery, one that contains
a single chemical cell. Both dry and wet cells work the same basic way. The electrodes react chemically with the
electrolyte, causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to accept electrons. Electrons ﬂow
through the electrolyte from the negative to positive electrode. The electrodes extend out of the battery for the
attachment of wires that carry the current. The current can be used to power a light bulb or other electric device.

Solar Cells

Solar cells convert the energy in sunlight to electrical energy. Solar cells are also called photovoltaic (PV) cells
because they use light (photo-) to produce voltage (-voltaic). Solar cells contain a material such as silicon that
absorbs light energy. The energy knocks electrons loose so they can ﬂow freely and produce a difference in electric
potential energy, or voltage. The ﬂow of electrons creates electric current. Solar cells have positive and negative
contacts, like the terminals in chemical cells. If the contacts are connected with wire, current ﬂows from the negative
to positive contact. The Figure 5.155 and following URL show how a solar cell works. http://www.suntreksolar.

5.68. Electric Resistance

www.ck12.org

5.68 Electric Resistance

• Deﬁne resistance and identify the SI unit for resistance.
• List factors that affect resistance.
• Explain why resistance can be a help or a hindrance.

These athletes are playing rugby, a game that is similar to American football. The players in red and blue are trying
to stop the player in blue and black from running across the ﬁeld with the ball. They are resisting his forward motion.
This example of resistance in rugby is a little like resistance in physics.

What Is Resistance?

In physics, resistance is opposition to the ﬂow of electric charges in an electric current as it travels through matter.
The SI unit for resistance is the ohm. Resistance occurs because moving electrons in current bump into atoms of
matter. Resistance reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transferred through matter. That’s because some
of the electrical energy is absorbed by the atoms and changed to other forms of energy, such as heat. You can see
an animation of resistance at the level of atoms and electrons at this URL: http://www.physics.org/explorelink.asp?i
d=1738&q=electricalresistance&currentpage=1&age=0&knowledge=0&item=3
Q: In the rugby analogy to resistance in physics, what do the players on each team represent?
A: The player on the blue and black team represents a moving electron in an electric current. The players on the red
and blue team represent particles of matter through which the current is ﬂowing.

Factors That Affect Resistance

How much resistance a material has depends on several factors: the type of material, its width, its length, and its
temperature.

968

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

• All materials have some resistance, but certain materials resist the ﬂow of electric current more or less than
other materials do. Materials such as plastics have high resistance to electric current. They are called electric
insulators. Materials such as metals have low resistance to electric current. They are called electric conductors.
• A wide wire has less resistance than a narrow wire of the same material. Electricity ﬂowing through a wire is
like water ﬂowing through a hose. More water can ﬂow through a wide hose than a narrow hose. In a similar
way, more current can ﬂow through a wide wire than a narrow wire.

• A longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire. Current must travel farther through a longer wire, so

there are more chances for it to collide with particles of matter.

• A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler particles have less kinetic energy, so they move
more slowly. Therefore, they are less likely to collide with moving electrons in current. Materials called
superconductors have virtually no resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures. You can
learn more about superconductors at this URL:

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x29bbd_superconductors_tech

Is Resistance Good or Bad?

Resistance can be helpful or just a drain on electrical energy. If the aim is to transmit electric current through a wire
from one place to another, then resistance is a drawback. It reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transmitted
because some of the current is absorbed by particles of matter. On the other hand, if the aim is to use electricity to
produce heat or light, then resistance is useful. When particles of matter absorb electrical energy, they change it to
heat or light. For example, when electric current ﬂows through the tungsten wire inside an incandescent light bulb
like the one in the Figure 5.156, the tungsten resists the ﬂow of electric charge. It absorbs electrical energy and
converts some of it to light and heat.
Q: The tungsten wire inside a light bulb is extremely thin. How does this help it do its job?
A: The extremely thin wire has more resistance than a wider wire would. This helps the wire resist electric current
and change it to light.

Summary

• In physics, resistance is opposition to the ﬂow of electric charges that occurs as electric current travels through

matter. The SI unit for resistance is the ohm.

• All materials have resistance. How much resistance a material has depends on the type of material, its width,

its length, and its temperature.

• Resistance is a hindrance when a material is being used to transmit electric current. Resistance is helpful when

a material is being used to produce heat or light.

5.69 Electric Conductors and Insulators

• Relate electric current to matter.
• Deﬁne electric conductor, and give examples of conductors.
• Describe electric insulators, and identify materials that are insulators.

Do you see the wires and peaks on top of this old house? They are lightning rods, and their purpose is to protect the
building in the event of a lightning strike. Each lightning rod is connected to a wire that goes down the side of the
house and into the ground. If lightning strikes the building, it will target the rod and be conducted by the rod and
wire into the ground. There the electricity can be safely absorbed. Lightning rods may differ in style, but to work
they must be good at conducting electricity.

Electric Current and Matter

Electrical energy is transmitted by moving electrons in an electric current. In order to travel, electric current needs
matter. It cannot pass through empty space. However, matter resists the ﬂow of electric current. That’s because
ﬂowing electrons in current collide with particles of matter, which absorb their energy. Some types of matter offer
more or less resistance to electric current than others.

971

5.69. Electric Conductors and Insulators

www.ck12.org

Electric Conductors

Materials that have low resistance to electric current are called electric conductors. Many metals—including copper,
aluminum, and steel—are good conductors of electricity. The outer electrons of metal atoms are loosely bound and
free to move, allowing electric current to ﬂow. Water that has even a tiny amount of impurities is an electric conductor
as well.
Q: What do you think lightning rods are made of?
A: Lightning rods are made of metal, usually copper or aluminum, both of which are excellent conductors of
electricity.

Electric Insulators

Materials that have high resistance to electric current are called electric insulators. Examples include most non-
metallic solids, such as wood, rubber, and plastic. Their atoms hold onto their electrons tightly, so electric current
cannot ﬂow freely through them. Dry air is also an electric insulator. You can learn more about electric insulators—as
well as how to test whether a material is an insulator—by doing the activity at this URL:
http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/ks2bitesize/science/physical_processes/circuits_conductors/play.shtml
Q: You may have heard that rubber-soled shoes will protect you if you are struck by lightning. Do you think this is
true? Why or why not?
A: It isn’t true. Rubber is an electric insulator, but a half-inch layer on the bottom of a pair of shoes is insigniﬁcant
when it comes to lightning. The average lightning bolt has 100 million volts and can burn through any insulator,
even the insulators on high-voltage power lines.

The Path of Least Resistance

Look at the electric wires in the Figure 5.157. They are made of copper and coated with plastic. Copper is very
good conductor, and plastic is a very good insulator. When more than one material is available for electric current
to ﬂow through, the current always travels through the material with the least resistance. That’s why all the current
passes through the copper wire and none ﬂows through its plastic coating.

FIGURE 5.157

Summary

• Electricity must travel through matter. All matter offers some resistance to the ﬂow of electrons in an electric

current. Some materials resist current more or less than others.

• Materials that have low resistance to electric current are called electric conductors. Many metals are good

electric conductors.

5.70. Ohm’s Law

5.70 Ohm’s Law

• Explain Ohm’s law.
• Use Ohm’s law to calculate current from voltage and resistance.

Look at the water spraying out of this garden hose. You have to be careful using water around power tools and
electric outlets because water can conduct an electric current. But in some ways, water ﬂowing through a hose is
like electric current ﬂowing through a wire.

Introducing Ohm’s Law

For electric current to ﬂow through a wire, there must be a source of voltage. Voltage is a difference in electric
potential energy. As you might have guessed, greater voltage results in more current. As electric current ﬂows
through matter, particles of matter resist the moving charges. This is called resistance, and greater resistance results
in less current. These relationships between electric current, voltage, and resistance were ﬁrst demonstrated in the
early 1800s by a German scientist named Georg Ohm, so they are referred to as Ohm’s law. Ohm’s law can be
represented by the following equation.

Current(amps) = Voltage(volts)
Resistance(ohms)

Understanding Ohm’s Law

Ohm’s law may be easier to understand with an analogy. Current ﬂowing through a wire is like water ﬂowing
through a hose. Increasing voltage with a higher-volt battery increases the current. This is like opening the tap wider
so more water ﬂows through the hose. Increasing resistance reduces the current. This is like stepping on the hose so
less water can ﬂow through it. If you still aren’t sure about the relationships among current, voltage, and resistance,

Using Ohm’s Law to Calculate Current

You can use the equation for current (above) to calculate the amount of current ﬂowing through a circuit when the
voltage and resistance are known. Consider an electric wire that is connected to a 12-volt battery. If the wire has a
resistance of 2 ohms, how much current is ﬂowing through the wire?

Current = 12 volts

2 ohms = 6 amps

Q: If a 120-volt voltage source is connected to a wire with 10 ohms of resistance, how much current is ﬂowing
through the wire?
A: Substitute these values into the equation for current:

Current = 120 volts

10 ohms = 12 amps

Summary

• According to Ohm’s law, greater voltage results in more current and greater resistance results in less current.
• Ohm’s law can be represented by the equation:

Current (amps) = Voltage (volts)
Resistance (ohms)

• This equation can be used to calculate current when voltage and resistance are known.

• Describe the parts of an electric circuit.
• Show how to represent a simple electric circuit with a circuit diagram.

Jose made this sketch of a battery and light bulb for science class. If this were a real set up, the light bulb wouldn’t
work. The problem is the loose wire on the left. It must be connected to the positive terminal of the battery in order
for the bulb to light up.
Q: Why does the light bulb need to be connected to both battery terminals?
A: Electric current can ﬂow through a wire only if it forms a closed loop. Charges must have an unbroken path to
follow between the positively and negatively charged parts of the voltage source, in this case, the battery.

Electric Circuit Basics

A closed loop through which current can ﬂow is called an electric circuit. In homes in the U.S., most electric circuits
have a voltage of 120 volts. The amount of current (amps) a circuit carries depends on the number and power of
electrical devices connected to the circuit. Home circuits generally have a safe upper limit of about 20 or 30 amps.

Parts of an Electric Circuit

All electric circuits have at least two parts: a voltage source and a conductor. They may have other parts as well,
such as light bulbs and switches, as in the simple circuit seen in the Figure 5.158. To see an animation of a circuit
like this one, go to: http://www.rkm.com.au/animations/animation-electrical-circuit.html

• The voltage source of this simple circuit is a battery. In a home circuit, the source of voltage is an electric
power plant, which may supply electric current to many homes and businesses in a community or even to
many communities.

• The conductor in most circuits consists of one or more wires. The conductor must form a closed loop from
the source of voltage and back again. In the Figure 5.158, the wires are connected to both terminals of the
battery, so they form a closed loop.

• Most circuits have devices such as light bulbs that convert electrical energy to other forms of energy. In the

case of a light bulb, electrical energy is converted to light and thermal energy.

• Many circuits have switches to control the ﬂow of current. When the switch is turned on, the circuit is closed
and current can ﬂow through it. When the switch is turned off, the circuit is open and current cannot ﬂow
through it.

Circuit Diagrams

When a contractor builds a new home, she uses a set of plans called blueprints that show her how to build the house.
The blueprints include circuit diagrams. The diagrams show how the wiring and other electrical components are to
be installed in order to supply current to appliances, lights, and other electric devices. You can see an example of
a very simple circuit in the Figure 5.159. Different parts of the circuit are represented by standard circuit symbols.
An ammeter measures the ﬂow of current through the circuit, and a voltmeter measures the voltage. A resistor is any
device that converts some of the electricity to other forms of energy. For example, a resistor might be a light bulb or
doorbell.
Q: Only one of the circuit symbols in the Figure 5.159 must be included in every circuit. Which symbol is it?
A: The battery symbol (or a symbol for some other voltage source) must be included in every circuit. Without a
source of voltage, there is no electric current.

• Describe a series circuit.
• Explain how a parallel circuit differs from a series circuit.

Only a licensed professional electrician like this one is qualiﬁed to install or repair the electrical system inside a
home. It’s a complicated system that consists of a maze of electric circuits.

One Loop or Two?

An electric circuit consists of at least one closed loop through which electric current can ﬂow. Every circuit has a
voltage source such as a battery and a conductor such as metal wire. A circuit may have other parts as well, such as
lights and switches. In addition, a circuit may consist of one loop or two loops.

Series Circuit

A circuit that consists of one loop is called a series circuit. You can see a simple series circuit below. If a series
circuit is interrupted at any point in its single loop, no current can ﬂow through the circuit and no devices in the
circuit will work. In the series circuit below, if one light bulb burns out, the other light bulb won’t work because it
won’t receive any current. Series circuits are commonly used in ﬂashlights. You can see an animation of a series

Q: If one light bulb burns out in this series circuit, how can you tell which bulb it is?
A: It may not be obvious, because neither bulb will light if one is burned out. You can tell which one it is only by
replacing ﬁrst one bulb and then the other to see which replacement results in both bulbs lighting up.

Parallel Circuit

A circuit that has two loops is called a parallel circuit. A simple parallel circuit is sketched below. If one loop of a
parallel circuit is interrupted, current can still ﬂow through the other loop. In the parallel circuit below, if one light
bulb burns out, the other light bulb will still work because current can bypass the burned-out bulb. The wiring in a
house consists of parallel circuits. You can see an animation of a parallel circuit at this URL: http://www.regentspr

• Show how to calculate the electrical energy used by an appliance.

Miranda has to use a hair dryer in order to dry her long hair quickly enough to get to school on time. She has a
powerful hair dryer that dries her hair faster than a less powerful hair dryer would. That’s because a more powerful
hair dryer changes electric current to thermal energy more quickly.

Electric Power

The rate at which a device changes electric current to another form of energy is called electric power. The SI unit for
power—including electric power—is the watt. A watt equals 1 joule of energy per second. High wattages are often
expressed in kilowatts, where 1 kilowatt equals 1000 watts. The power of an electric device, such as a hair dryer,
can be calculated if you know the voltage of the circuit and how much current the device receives. The following
equation is used:

Power (watts) = Current (amps) × Voltage (volts)

Assume that Miranda’s hair dryer is the only electric device in a 120-volt circuit that carries 15 amps of current.
Then the power of her hair dryer in kilowatts is:

Power = 15 amps × 120 volts = 1800 watts, or 1.8 kilowatts

Q: If a different hair dryer is plugged into a 120-volt circuit that carries 10 amps of current. What is the power of
the other hair dryer?
A: Substitute these values in the power equation:

Power = 10 amps × 120 volts = 1200 watts, or 1.2 kilowatts

use depends on the power of the appliance and how long it is used. It can be calculated with this equation:

Electrical Energy = Power × Time

If Miranda uses her 1.8-kilowatt hair dryer for 0.2 hours, how much electrical energy does she use?

Electrical Energy = 1.8 kilowatts × 0.2 hours = 0.36 kilowatt-hours

Electrical energy use is typically expressed in kilowatt-hours, as in this example. How much energy is this? One
kilowatt-hour equals 3.6 million joules of energy.
Q: Suppose Miranda were to use a 1.2-kilowatt hair dryer for 0.2 hours. How much electrical energy would she use
then?
A: She would use:

Electrical Energy = 1.2 kilowatts × 0.2 hour = 0.24 kilowatt-hours

You can learn much more about electrical energy use—including your own—at the URL below. Use the tables and
other information, along with the handy electrical energy calculator, to estimate how much electrical energy you use.

Summary

• Electric power is the rate at which a device changes electric current to another form of energy. The SI unit of

power is the watt. Electric power can be calculated as current times voltage.

• Electrical energy use equals the power of the appliance multiplied by the amount of time the appliance is used.

5.74 Electric Safety

• Explain how a short circuit occurs.
• Identify safety features built into electric circuits and devices.
• List rules for using electricity safely.

Electricity isn’t really an evil cloud, but the sign makes the point that electricity is dangerous. Contact with electric
current can cause severe burns and even death. Electricity can also cause serious ﬁres.
Q: A common cause of electric hazards and ﬁres is a short circuit. Do you know what a short circuit is?
A: As its name suggests, a short circuit is damage that allows electric current to travel through a shorter loop than it
should. To ﬁnd out how this can occur and why it is dangerous, keep reading.

How a Short Circuit Occurs

Did you ever see an old appliance with a damaged cord, like the old shown in the Figure 5.160? A damaged electric
cord can cause a severe shock if it allows current to pass from the cord to a person who touches it. A damaged cord

984

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

can also cause a short circuit. A short circuit occurs when electric current follows a shorter path than the intended
loop of the circuit. An electric cord contains two wires: one that carries current from the outlet to the appliance and
one that carries current from the appliance back to the outlet. If the two wires in a damaged cord come into contact
with each other, current ﬂows from one wire to the other and bypasses the appliance. This may cause the wires to
overheat and start a ﬁre.

FIGURE 5.160

Electric Safety Features

Because electricity can be so dangerous, safety features are built into modern electric circuits and devices. They
include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets. You can read about these three safety features in the
Figure 5.161. You can learn more about electric safety features in the home by watching the video at this URL: http
://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6fg5i_basics-of-your-home-s-electrical-sy_school .

FIGURE 5.161
GFCI Outlet: GFCI stands for ground-
fault circuit interrupter. GFCI outlets are
typically found in bathrooms and kitchens
where the use of water poses a risk of
shock (because water is a good electric
conductor). A GFCI outlet contains a
device that monitors the amount of current
leaving and returning to the outlet.
If
less current is returning than leaving, this
means that current is escaping. When
this occurs, a tiny circuit breaker in the
outlet interrupts the circuit. The breaker
can be reset by pushing a button on the
outlet cover.

Q: Can you think of any other electric safety features?
A: One safety feature is the label on a lamp that warns the user of the maximum safe wattage for light bulbs. Another
safety feature is double insulation on many electric devices. Not only are the electric wires insulated with a coating
of plastic but so is the entire device. The old toaster pictured in the Figure 5.160 lacks this safety feature, but most
modern toasters have a plastic casing. This reduces the risk of current leaving the device except through the cord.

Using Electricity Safely

Even with electric safety features, electricity is still dangerous if it is misused. Follow the safety rules below to
reduce the risk of injury or ﬁre from electricity.

• Never mix electricity and water. Don’t plug in or turn on electric lights or appliances when your hands are wet,
you are standing in water, or you are in the shower or bathtub. The current could ﬂow through the water—and
you—because water is a good conductor of electricity.

• Never overload circuits. Avoid plugging too many devices into one outlet or extension cord. The more devices
that are plugged in, the more current the circuit carries. Too much current can overheat a circuit and start a
ﬁre.

• Never use devices with damaged cords or plugs. They can cause shocks, shorts, and ﬁres.
• Never put anything except plugs into electric outlets. Putting any other object into an outlet is likely to cause

a serious shock that could be fatal.

• Never go near fallen electric lines. They could have very high voltage. Report fallen lines to the electric

company as soon as possible.

Summary

• A short circuit occurs when electric current follows a shorter path than the intended loop of the circuit. A short

circuit may cause wires to overheat and start a ﬁre.

• Several safety features are built into modern electric circuits and devices. They include three-prong plugs,

circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets.

• Following safety rules can reduce the risk of injury or ﬁre from electricity.

Did you ever make a secret code by assigning each letter of the alphabet a unique symbol? The code shown above is
believed to have been used by George Washington to send secret messages during the American Revolutionary War.
A different type of code can be sent with electric current.
Q: How do you think electric current can be used to encode messages?
A: The short answer is by changing the voltage in an electric circuit. Keep reading to learn more.

Electronic Messages

Electric devices, such as lights and household appliances, change electric current to other forms of energy. For
example, an electric stove changes electric current to thermal energy. Other common devices, such as mobile phones
and computers, use electric current for another purpose: to encode information. A message encoded this way is
called an electronic signal, and the use of electric current for this purpose is called electronics. For an overview
of electronics and electronic signals, read the short article at this URL: http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/bites
ize/standard/physics/electronics/overview_rev1.shtml .
To encode a message with electric current, the voltage is changed rapidly, over and over again. Voltage is a difference
in electric potential energy that is needed in order for electric current to ﬂow. There are two different ways voltage
can be changed, resulting in two different types of electronic signals, called analog signals and digital signals.

Analog Signals

Analog signals consist of continuously changing voltage in an electric circuit. The Figure 5.162 represents analog
signals. These were the ﬁrst electronic signals to be invented. They were used in early computers and other early
electronic devices. Analog signals are subject to distortion and noise, so they aren’t used as often anymore. They
are used mainly in microphones and some mobile phones to encode sounds as electronic signals.

Digital Signals

Today, most electronic signals are digital signals. Digital signals consist of rapid pulses of voltage that repeatedly
switch the current off and on. The Figure 5.163 represents digital signals. This type of signal encodes information

FIGURE 5.162

as a string of 0’s (current off) and 1’s (current on). This is called a binary (“two-digit”) code. The majority of modern
electronic devices, including computers and many mobile phones, encode data as digital signals. Compared with
analog signals, digital signals are easier to transmit and more accurate.

• A message encoded by changing the voltage of an electric current is called an electronic signal. The use of

electric current for this purpose is known as electronics.

• Electronic signals may be analog or digital signals. Analog signals consist of continuously changing voltage
in an electric circuit. Digital signals, which are the main type of signals used today, consist of rapid pulses of
voltage that repeatedly switch the current off and on.

5.76 Electronic Component

• Deﬁne electronic component.
• Describe semiconductors.
• Outline the structure and function of diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits.

You’ve probably heard of Silicon Valley. You may even know that it’s a region in northern California. But do you
know how the region got its name? Silicon Valley is the birthplace of modern electronics and continues to be a hub
of electronic innovation. The word silicon in the name refers to the element silicon, which is the chief “ingredient”
of electronic components.

What Are Electronic Components?

Electronic components are the parts used in electronic devices such as computers. The components change electric
current so it can carry information. Types of electronic components include diodes, transistors, and integrated
circuits, all of which you can read about below. However, to understand how these components work, you ﬁrst
need to know about semiconductors. That’s because electronic components consist of semiconductors—sometimes
millions of them!

Semiconductors

A semiconductor is a solid crystal, consisting mainly of silicon. It gets its name from the fact that it can conduct
current better than an electric insulator but not as well as an electric conductor. As you can see in the Figure 5.164,
each silicon atom has four valence electrons that it shares with other silicon atoms in the crystal. A semiconductor
is formed by replacing a few silicon atoms with other atoms, such as phosphorus or boron, which have more or

990

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

less valence electrons than silicon. This is called doping, and it’s what allows the semiconductor to conduct electric
current.

FIGURE 5.164

Q: Why wouldn’t a pure silicon crystal be able to conduct electric current?
A: Electric current is a ﬂow of electrons. All of the valence electrons of silicon atoms in a pure crystal are shared
with other silicon atoms, so they are not free to move and carry current.
There are two different types of semiconductors: n-type and p-type.

• An n-type (negative-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as phosphorus that gives the
silicon crystal extra electrons. You can see this in the Figure 5.164. An n-type semiconductor is like the
negative terminal of a battery.

• A p-type (positive-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as boron that gives the silicon
positively charged “holes” where electrons are missing. This is also shown in the Figure 5.164. A p-type
semiconductor is like the positive terminal of a battery.

Diode

A diode is an electronic component that consists of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor placed side by side, as
shown in the Figure 5.165. When a diode is connected by leads to a source of voltage, electrons ﬂow from the
n-type to the p-type semiconductor. This is the only direction that electrons can ﬂow in a diode. This makes a diode
useful for changing alternating current to direct current.

FIGURE 5.165

5.76. Electronic Component

Transistor

www.ck12.org

A transistor consists of three semiconductors, either p-n-p or n-p-n. Both arrangements are illustrated in the Figure
5.166. Current can’t ﬂow through a transistor unless a small amount of current is applied to the center semiconductor
(through the base). Then a much larger current can ﬂow through the transistor from end to end (from collector to
emitter). This means that a transmitter can be used as a switch, with pulses of a small current turning a larger current
on and off. A transistor can also be used to increase the amount of current ﬂowing through a circuit. You can learn
more about transistors and how they work at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaBLiciesOU

Integrated Circuit

An integrated circuit—also called a microchip—is a tiny, ﬂat piece of silicon that consists of layers of many
electronic components such as transistors. You can see an integrated circuit in the Figure 5.167. Look how small it
is compared with the ﬁnger it’s resting on. Although the integrated circuit is tiny, it may contain millions of smaller
electronic components. Current ﬂows extremely rapidly in an integrated circuit because it doesn’t have far to travel.
Integrated circuits are used in virtually all modern electronic devices to carry out speciﬁc tasks. You can see how
integrated circuits are made at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHAso1yM-D4 .

• Identify common electronic devices.
• Outline the parts of a computer and what they do.

If you were born in the last few decades, it’s probably impossible for you to imagine life without the computer. The
computer is just one of many electronic devices that make modern life possible.

What are Electronic Devices?

Many of the devices people commonly use today are electronic devices. Electronic devices use electric current to
encode, analyze, or transmit information. In addition to computers, they include mobile phones, TV remotes, DVD
and CD players, and digital cameras, to name just a few.
Q: Can you think of other electronic devices that you use?
A: Other examples include game systems and MP3 players.

Focus on the Computer

Let’s take a close look at the computer as an example of an electronic device. A computer contains integrated
circuits, or microchips, that consist of millions of tiny electronic components. Information is encoded in digital
electronic signals. Rapid pulses of voltage switch electric current on and off, producing long strings of 1’s (current
on) and 0’s (current off). The 1’s and 0’s are the “letters” of the code, and a huge number of them are needed. One
digit (either 0 or 1) is called a bit, which stands for “binary digit.” Each group of eight digits is called a byte, and a
billion bytes is called a gigabyte. Because a computer’s circuits are so tiny and close together, the computer can be
very fast and capable of many complex tasks while remaining small.

• Deﬁne magnet and magnetic pole.
• Describe magnetic force and relate it to magnetic ﬁeld.

The train in this photo is called a maglev train. The word maglev stands for “magnetic levitation.” Magnets push
the train upward so it hovers, or levitates, above the track without actually touching it. This eliminates most of the
friction acting against the train when it moves. Other magnets pull the train forward along the track. Because of all
the magnets, the train can go very fast. It can ﬂy over the tracks at speeds up to 480 kilometers (300 miles) per hour!
What are magnets and how do they exert such force? In this article, you’ll ﬁnd out. You can also watch a video
introduction to magnets at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y4JSp5U82I

Magnetic Poles

A magnet is an object that attracts certain materials such as iron. You’re probably familiar with common bar
magnets, like the one shown in the Figure 5.169. Like all magnets, this bar magnet has north and south magnetic
poles. The red end of the magnet is the north pole and the blue end is the south pole. The poles are regions where
the magnet is strongest. The poles are called north and south because they always line up with Earth’s north-south
axis if the magnet is allowed to move freely. (Earth’s axis is the imaginary line around which the planet rotates.)
Q: What do you suppose would happen if you cut the bar magnet pictured in the Figure 5.169 along the line between
the north and south poles?
A: Both halves of the magnet would also have north and south poles. If you cut each of the halves in half, all those
pieces would have north and south poles as well. Pieces of a magnet always have both north and south poles no
matter how many times you cut the magnet.

Magnetic Force and Magnetic Field

The force that a magnet exerts on certain materials, including other magnets, is called magnetic force. The force
is exerted over a distance and includes forces of attraction and repulsion. North and south poles of two magnets
attract each other, while two north poles or two south poles repel each other. A magnet can exert force over a
distance because the magnet is surrounded by a magnetic ﬁeld. In the Figure 5.170, you can see the magnetic ﬁeld
surrounding a bar magnet. Tiny bits of iron, called iron ﬁlings, were placed under a sheet of glass. When the magnet
was placed on the glass, it attracted the iron ﬁlings. The pattern of the iron ﬁlings shows the lines of force that make
up the magnetic ﬁeld of the magnet. The concentration of iron ﬁlings near the poles indicates that these areas exert
the strongest force. You can also see how the magnetic ﬁeld affects the compasses placed above the magnet. To see

• Deﬁne ferromagnetic materials, and describe how they can be magnetized.
• Distinguish between temporary and permanent magnets.
• Describe magnetite.

This collection of magnets is located in a familiar place: a refrigerator door. No doubt you’ve handled refrigerator
magnets like the ones in this photo. You probably know ﬁrst-hand that they stick to metal refrigerators but not to
surfaces such as wooden doors and glass windows. Wood and glass aren’t attracted to a magnet, whereas the steel
refrigerator is. Obviously, only certain materials respond to magnetic force.

What Makes a Material Magnetic?

Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. Magnetism is due to the
movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom
to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic ﬁeld. In most materials, the north and south
poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic
materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets
and cannot become magnets.
In other materials, there are regions where the north and south poles of atoms are all lined up in the same direction.
These regions are called magnetic domains. Generally, the magnetic domains point in different directions, so the
material is still not magnetic. However, the material can be magnetized (made into a magnet) by placing it in a
magnetic ﬁeld. When this happens, all the magnetic domains line up, and the material becomes a magnet. You can

see this in the Figure 5.172. Materials that can be magnitized are called ferromagnetic materials. They include
iron, cobalt, and nickel.

FIGURE 5.172
Magnetic domains must be lined up by an
outside magnetic ﬁeld for most ferromag-
netic materials to become magnets.

Temporary and Permanent Magnets

Materials that have been magnetized may become temporary or permanent magnets.

• If you bring a bar magnet close to pile of paper clips, the paper clips will become temporarily magnetized,
as all their magnetic domains line up. As a result, the paper clips will stick to the magnet and also to each
other (see the Figure 5.173). However, if you remove the paper clips from the bar magnet’s magnetic ﬁeld,
their magnetic domains will no longer align. As a result, the paper clips will no longer be magnetized or stick
together. You can follow the ﬁve easy steps at the following URL to make a temporary magnet from a paper
clip that will retain its magnetism somewhat longer.

you remove the nail from the magnetic ﬁeld of the bar magnet.

Q: Even permanent magnets can be demagnetized if they are dropped or heated to high temperatures. Can you
explain why?
A: Jarring or heating a magnet moves the magnetic domains out of alignment. When the magnetic domains no
longer line up in the same direction, the material is no longer magnetic.

Magnetite

Some materials are natural permanent magnets. The most magnetic material in nature is the mineral magnetite, also
called lodestone (see Figure 5.175). The magnetic domains of magnetite naturally align with Earth’s axis. The
picture on the left shows a chunk of magnetite attracting small bits of iron. The magnetite spoon compass shown on
the right dates back about 2000 years and comes from China. The handle of the spoon always points north. Clearly,
the magnetic properties of magnetite have been recognized for thousands of years.

Summary

• Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. A material can be
magnetized if all of its magnetic domains can be aligned. Magnetic domains are regions of matter where north
and south poles of atoms line up in the same direction.

• Only certain materials, called ferromagnetic materials, can be magnetized. They include iron, cobalt, and

nickel. Materials that have been magnetized may become temporary or permanent magnets.

• Describe how Earth is a magnet.
• Distinguish between Earth’s geographic and magnetic poles.
• Describe the magnetosphere.

Did you ever use a compass like the one in this picture? Even if you’ve never used a compass, you probably know
that the needle of a compass always points north. That’s because a compass needle is magnetized, so it is attracted
by a magnet.
Q: What magnet attracts a compass needle?
A: A compass needle is attracted by magnet Earth. It always points north because Earth acts as a giant magnet.

Earth’s Magnetic Poles

Imagine a huge bar magnet passing through Earth’s axis, as in the Figure 5.176. This is a good representation of
Earth as a magnet. Like a bar magnet, Earth has north and south magnetic poles. A magnetic pole is the north or
south end of a magnet, where the magnet exerts the most force.

Two North Poles

Although the needle of a compass always points north, it doesn’t point to Earth’s north geographic pole. Find the
north geographic pole in the Figure 5.177. As you can see, it is located at 90° north latitude. Where does a compass

also has two south poles: a south geographic pole and a south magnetic pole.

Q: The north end of a compass needle points toward Earth’s north magnetic pole. The like poles of two magnets
repel each other, and the opposite poles attract. So why doesn’t the north end of a compass needle point to Earth’s
south magnetic pole instead?
A: The answer may surprise you. The compass needle actually does point to the south pole of magnet Earth.
However, it is called the north magnetic pole because it is close to the north geographic pole. This naming convention
was adopted a long time ago to avoid confusion.

Earth’s Magnetic Field

Like all magnets, Earth has a magnetic ﬁeld. Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is called the magnetosphere. You can see a
model of the magnetosphere in the Figure 5.178. It is a huge region that extends outward from Earth in all directions.
Earth exerts magnetic force over the entire ﬁeld, but the force is strongest at the poles, where lines of force converge.

Changing Places

Earth’s magnetic poles have switched places repeatedly in the past. As you can see in the Figure 5.179, each time
the switch occurred, Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld was reversed. The magnetic ﬁeld is the region around a magnet over
which it exerts magnetic force. We think of today’s magnetic ﬁeld direction as “normal,” but that’s only because it’s
what we’re used to. You can watch a simulation of a magnetic ﬁeld reversal at this URL: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/

Scientists don’t know for certain why magnetic reversals occur, but there is hard evidence that they have for hundreds
of millions of years. The evidence comes from rocks on the ocean ﬂoor. Look at Figure 5.180. They show the same
ridge on the ocean ﬂoor during different periods of time.

FIGURE 5.180

A. At the center of the ridge, hot magma pushes up through the crust and hardens into rock. Once the magma
hardens, the alignment of magnetic domains in the rock is frozen in place forever. Magnetic domains are regions in
the rocks where all the atoms are lined up and pointing toward Earth’s north magnetic pole.
B. The newly hardened rock is gradually pushed away from the ridge in both directions as more magma erupts and
newer rock forms. The alignment of magnetic domains in this new rock is in the opposite direction, showing that a
magnetic reversal has occurred.
C. A magnetic reversal occurs again. It is frozen in rock to document the change.
Rock samples from many places on the ocean ﬂoor show that the north and south magnetic poles reversed hundreds
of times over the last 330 million years. The last reversal was less than a million years ago.

• Relate Earth’s inner structure to its magnetic ﬁeld.

Did you ever see a globe like this one? Magnets in the globe and its stand repel each other, allowing the globe to
hover in midair. The globe is a good model for Earth the magnet.

Earth the Magnet

Like the real Earth, the globe pictured above is a magnet. A magnet is an object that has north and south magnetic
poles and a magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic globe is a modern device, but the idea that Earth is a magnet is far from
new. It was ﬁrst proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. He used a spherical magnet to
represent Earth. With a compass, he demonstrated that it the spherical magnet causes a compass needle to behave
the same way that Earth causes a compass needle to behave. This showed that a spherical magnet is a good model
for Earth and therefore that Earth is a magnet.
Q: Can you describe Earth’s magnetic poles and magnetic ﬁeld?
A: Earth has north and south magnetic poles. The North Pole is located at about 80 degrees north latitude. The
magnetic ﬁeld is an area around Earth that is affected by its magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld is strongest at the poles, and

lines of magnetic force move from the north to the south magnetic pole.

Spinning Like a Top

Although the idea that Earth is a magnet is centuries old, the discovery of why Earth is a magnet is a relatively new.
In the early 1900s, scientists started using seismographic data to learn about Earth’s inner structure. A seismograph
detects and measure earthquake waves. Evidence from earthquakes showed that Earth has a solid inner core and a
liquid outer core (see the Figure 5.181). The outer core consists of molten metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists
think that Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is generated by the movement of charged particles through these molten metals in
the outer core. The particles move as Earth spins on its axis. The video at the URL below takes a closer look at how
this occurs.

• Describe how some animals use Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld for navigation.

You may recognize the eerie green glow in this cold northern sky as the northern lights, or aurora borealis. But do
you know what causes the northern lights? Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is a major factor.

Earth’s Magnetic Field

Like a bar magnet, planet Earth has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic ﬁeld over which it exerts
magnetic force. Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is called the magnetosphere. You can see it in the Figure 5.182.

Like an Umbrella

The sun gives off radiation in solar winds. You can see solar winds in the Figure 5.182. Notice what happens to
solar winds when they reach the magnetosphere. They are deﬂected almost completely by Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.
Radiation in solar wind would wash over Earth and kill most living things were it not for the magnetosphere. It
protects Earth’s organisms from radiation like an umbrella protects you from rain.
Q: Now can you explain the northern lights?
A: Energetic particles in solar wind collide with atoms in the atmosphere over the poles, and energy is released in
the form of light. The swirling patterns of light follow lines of magnetic force in the magnetosphere.

What a clever dog! He wants to go inside to get out of the rain, so he’s ringing the doorbell. Does your home have a
doorbell? Did you ever wonder how a doorbell works? The answer is electromagnetism.

What Is Electromagnetism?

Electromagnetism is magnetism produced by an electric current. When electric current ﬂows through a wire, it
creates a magnetic ﬁeld that surrounds the wire in circles. You can see this in the diagram below. Note that electric
current is conventionally shown moving from positive to negative electric potential, as in this diagram. However,
electrons in current actually ﬂow in the opposite direction, from negative to positive potential.

Chapter 5. Energy

Q: If more current ﬂows through a wire, how might this affect the magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the wire?
A: With more current, the magnetic ﬁeld is stronger.

Right Hand Rule

The direction of the magnetic ﬁeld created when current ﬂows through a wire depends on the direction of the current.
A simple rule, called the right hand rule, makes it easy to ﬁnd the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld if the direction of
the current is known. The rule is illustrated in the Figure 5.184. When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the
same direction as the current, the ﬁngers of the right hand curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld.
You can see the right hand rule in action at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK1Ar5WPJj8 .

electromagnetism is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a technique for making images of the inside of the
body in order to diagnose diseases or injuries. Magnetism created with electric current is so useful because it can be
turned on or off simply by turning the current on or off. The strength of the magnetic ﬁeld is also easy to control by
changing the amount of current. You can’t do either of these things with a regular magnet.

Summary

• Electromagnetism is magnetism produced by an electric current. Current ﬂowing through a wire creates a

magnetic ﬁeld that surrounds the wire in concentric circles.

• When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction as the current ﬂowing through a wire, the

ﬁngers of the right hand curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld.

• Electromagnetism is very useful because it can be turned on or off by turning the current on or off, and it can

be made stronger or weaker by using more or less current.

Tamara made the simple device in this picture for science class. She wrapped a wire around a nail and connected
the ends of the wire to the terminals of a battery. The nail is attracting paper clips, so it appears to have become
magnetized. The device isn’t complicated, but it shows a very important relationship.
Q: What does Tamara’s device show?
A: The device shows that you can use electricity to create magnetism.

Electricity and Magnetism

Magnetism produced by electricity is called electromagnetism. Today, electromagnetism is used in many electric
devices. However, until electromagnetism was discovered, scientists thought that electricity and magnetism were
unrelated. A Danish scientist named Hans Christian Oersted (pictured in the Figure 5.185) changed all that. He made
the important discovery that electric current creates a magnetic ﬁeld. But like many other important discoveries in
science, Oersted’s discovery was just a lucky accident.

FIGURE 5.185

An Accidental Discovery

In 1820, Oersted was presenting a demonstration to some science students. Ironically, he was trying to show them
that electricity and magnetism are not related. He placed a wire with electric current ﬂowing through it next to a
compass, which has a magnetic needle. As he expected, the needle of the compass didn’t move. It just kept pointing
toward Earth’s north magnetic pole.
After the demonstration, a curious student held the wire near the compass again, but in a different direction. To
Oersted’s surprise, the needle of the compass swung toward the wire so it was no longer pointing north. Oersted
was intrigued. He turned off the current in the wire to see what would happen to the compass needle. The needle
swung back to its original position, pointing north once again. Oersted had discovered that an electric current creates
a magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld created by the current was strong enough to attract the needle of the nearby
compass.

Oersted Learns More

Oersted wanted to learn more about the magnetic ﬁeld created by a current. He placed a compass at different
locations around a wire with current ﬂowing through it. You can see what he found in the Figure 5.186. The
lines of magnetic force circle around the wire in a counterclockwise direction. You can learn more about Oersted’s

From Magnets to Electricity

Just about a decade after Oersted discovered that electric current can produce a magnetic ﬁeld, an English scientist
named Michael Faraday discovered that the opposite is also true. A magnetic ﬁeld can produce an electric current.
This is known as Faraday’s law. The process by which a magnetic ﬁeld produces current is called electromagnetic

induction. It occurs when a conductor, such as a wire, crosses lines of force in a magnetic ﬁeld. This can happen
when a wire is moving relative to a magnet or a magnet is moving relative to a wire.

Summary

• Electricity can be used to produce a magnetic ﬁeld. Magnetism produced by electricity is called electromag-

netism.

• In 1820, Oersted discovered by accident that electric current creates a magnetic ﬁeld. Prior to that, scientists

thought that electricity and magnetism were unrelated.

• Oersted also used a compass to ﬁnd the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld around a wire carrying current.
• Around 1830, Michael Faraday discovered that a magnetic ﬁeld can generate an electric current if a conductor

crosses the lines of force in a magnetic ﬁeld. This is known as Faraday’s law.

Strength of a Solenoid

Any wire with current ﬂowing through it has a magnetic ﬁeld. However, the magnetic ﬁeld around a coiled wire is
stronger than the magnetic ﬁeld around a straight wire. That’s because each turn of the wire in the coil has its own
magnetic ﬁeld. Adding more turns to the coil of wire increases the strength of the ﬁeld. Increasing the amount of
current ﬂowing through the coil also increases the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Uses of Solenoids

A solenoid is generally used to convert electromagnetic energy into motion. Solenoids are often used in devices that
need a sudden burst of power to move a speciﬁc part. In addition to paintball markers, you can ﬁnd solenoids in
machines ranging from motor vehicles to electric dishwashers. Another device that uses solenoids is pictured in the

Summary

• A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current ﬂowing through it, giving it north and south magnetic poles

and a magnetic ﬁeld.

• Using more turns of wire in the coil or more current increases the strength of the solenoid’s magnetic ﬁeld.

5.87 Electromagnet

• Describe an electromagnet.
• Explain why electromagnets are very strong.

This crane is dangling a big round magnet that has picked up metal car parts in a junk yard. The parts practically
leap up to the magnet because it’s so strong. That’s because it’s an electromagnet.

What Is an Electromagnet?

An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material. A solenoid is a coil
of wire with electric current ﬂowing through it. This gives the coil north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic
ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar by aligning its magnetic domains. You can see this
in the Figure 5.189. You can learn how to make an electromagnet at this URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e
mlzh9XXWgQ

Strength of an Electromagnet

The combined magnetic force of the magnetized wire coil and iron bar makes an electromagnet very strong. In fact,
electromagnets are the strongest magnets made. An electromagnet is stronger if there are more turns in the coil of
wire or there is more current ﬂowing through it. A bigger bar or one made of material that is easier to magnetize also
increases an electromagnet’s strength. At the following URL, you can see an animation demonstrating how these
factors affect the strength of an electromagnet. http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/animations/Electromagnet/index.ht

Besides their strength, another pro of electromagnets is the ability to control them by controlling the electric current.
Turning the current on or off turns the magnetic ﬁeld on or off. The amount of current ﬂowing through the coil can
also be changed to control the strength of the electromagnet.
Q: Why might it be useful to be able to turn an electromagnet on and off?
A: Look back at the electromagnet hanging from the crane in the opening photo. It is useful to turn on its magnetic
ﬁeld so it can pick up the metal car parts. It is also useful to turn off its magnetic ﬁeld so it can drop the parts into
the train car.

Summary

• An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material. The magnetic

ﬁeld of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar.

• The combined magnetic force of the magnetized wire coil and iron bar makes an electromagnet very strong.
• Electromagnets can be turned on or off and their strength can be changed by controlling the electric current.

5.88 Electromagnetic Devices

• Deﬁne electromagnet and identify electromagnetic devices.
• Explain how a doorbell works.
• Outline how an electric motor changes electrical energy to kinetic energy.

The little boy on the left is pressing the doorbell on his playhouse. The doorbell is connected to a battery, so it
actually rings when he pushes the button. The little girl on the right is using a hand-held fan to cool off on a hot day.
The fan is also battery-operated, and the blades of the fan turn in a blur of motion. What do the doorbell and fan
have in common? Both of them work because they contain electromagnets.

Devices with Electromagnets

Many common electric devices contain electromagnets. An electromagnet is a coil of wire wrapped around a bar
of iron or other ferromagnetic material. When electric current ﬂows through the wire, it causes the coil and iron bar
to become magnetized. An electromagnet has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic ﬁeld. Turning off the
current turns off the electromagnet. To understand how electromagnets are used in electric devices, we’ll focus on
two common devices: doorbells and electric motors like the one that turns the blades of a fan.
Q: Besides doorbells and fans, what are some other devices that contain electromagnets?
A: Any device that has an electric motor contains electromagnets. Some other examples include hairdryers, CD
players, power drills, electric saws, and electric mixers.

How a Doorbell Works

The Figure 5.190 represents a simple doorbell. Like most doorbells, it has a button located by the front door.
Pressing the button causes two electric contacts to come together and complete an electric circuit. In other words,
the button is a switch. The circuit is also connected to a source of current, an electromagnet, and a clapper that
strikes a bell. You can see an animation of a doorbell at this URL: http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/animations/El
ectric_bell/index.html
What happens when current ﬂows through the doorbell circuit?

• The electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic ﬁeld attracts the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell,

making it ring.

1032

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Energy

FIGURE 5.190

• Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike the bell, it breaks the circuit. Without current

ﬂowing through the circuit, the electromagnet turns off, and the clapper returns to its original position.

• When the clapper moves back to its original position, this closes the circuit again and turns the electromagnet

back on. The electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell once more.

• This sequence of events keeps repeating.

Q: How can you stop the sequence of events so the doorbell will stop ringing?
A: Stop pressing the button! This interrupts the circuit so no current can ﬂow through it.

Electric Motor

An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy. You can see
a simple diagram of an electric motor in the Figure 5.191. The motor contains an electromagnet that is connected
to a shaft. When current ﬂows through the motor, the electromagnet rotates, causing the shaft to rotate as well. The
rotating shaft moves other parts of the device. For example, in an electric fan, the rotating shaft turns the blades of
the fan. You can make a very simple electric motor by following the instructions at this URL: http://www.youtube.c
om/watch?v=VhaYLnjkf1E
Why does the motor’s electromagnet rotate?

• The electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets. When current
ﬂows through the electromagnet, it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles of the
permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to rotate toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets.
• A device called a commutator then changes the direction of the current so the poles of the electromagnet
are reversed. The reversed poles are again repelled by the poles of the permanent magnets, which have not
reversed. This causes the electromagnet to continue to rotate.

• These events keep repeating, so the electromagnet rotates continuously.

5.89 Electromagnetic Induction

• Deﬁne electromagnetic induction.
• Explain how electromagnetic induction occurs.
• Describe the current produced by electromagnetic induction.
• Identify ways that electromagnetic induction is used.

The girl on the left in this photo is riding a stationary bike. She’s getting exercise, but that’s not the real reason
she’s riding the bike. She’s using her muscle power to generate electricity through a process called electromagnetic
induction.

What Is Electromagnetic Induction?

Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic ﬁeld. It occurs whenever
a magnetic ﬁeld and an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another. As long as the
conductor is part of a closed circuit, current will ﬂow through it whenever it crosses lines of force in the magnetic
ﬁeld. One way this can happen is illustrated in the Figure 5.192. The sketch shows a magnet moving through a wire
coil. You can watch an animated version of the illustration at this URL: http://jsticca.wordpress.com/2009/09/01/
the-magnet-car/ .
Q: What is another way that a coil of wire and magnet can move relative to one another and generate an electric
current?
A: The coil of wire could be moved back and forth over the magnet.

The Current Produced by a Magnet

The device with the pointer in the Figure 5.192 is an ammeter. It measures the current that ﬂows through the wire.
The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to

5.89. Electromagnetic Induction

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 5.192

the coil or a stronger magnet were used, this would produce more current as well.
The Figure 5.193 shows the direction of the current that is generated by a moving magnet. If the magnet is moved
back and forth repeatedly, the current keeps changing direction. In other words, alternating current (AC) is produced.
Alternating current is electric current that keeps reversing direction.

FIGURE 5.193

How Electromagnetic Induction Is Used

Two important devices depend on electromagnetic induction: electric generators and electric transformers. Both
devices play critical roles in producing and regulating the electric current we depend on in our daily lives. Electric
generators use electromagnetic induction to change kinetic energy to electrical energy. They produce electricity in
power plants. Electric transformers use electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current. Some
transformers increase voltage and other decrease voltage.
Q: How do you think the girl on the exercise bike in the opening photo is using electromagnetic induction?
A: As she pedals the bike, the kinetic energy of the turning pedals is used to move a conductor through a magnetic
ﬁeld. This generates electric current by electromagnetic induction.

It occurs
whenever a magnetic ﬁeld and an electric conductor move relative to one another so the conductor crosses

• Explain how generators transform kinetic energy to electrical energy.

The sprawling machines in this plant aren’t factory machines, but they do produce something. They are electric
generators in a hydroelectric power plant, and they produce electricity.

Generating Electricity

An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction.
Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic ﬁeld.
It occurs when a
magnetic ﬁeld and an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another.
A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in the Figure 5.194. In any electric generator, some form of
energy is applied to turn a shaft. The turning shaft causes a coil of wire to rotate between the opposite poles of a
magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic ﬁeld, electric current is generated in the wire. You can learn how
to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will
help you understand how a generator works.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Sz8oT8ou0
Q: What might happen to the current produced by an electric generator if the poles of the magnet kept reversing?
A: The direction of the current would also keep reversing. In other words, the electric generator would generate
alternating current.

FIGURE 5.194

From Kinetic to Electrical Energy

Generators may be set up to produce either direct or alternating current. Generators in cars and most power plants
produce alternating current. Regardless of the type of current, all generators change kinetic energy to electrical
energy.

• A car generator produces electricity with some of the kinetic energy of the turning crankshaft. The electricity
is used to run the car’s lights, power windows, radio, and other electric devices. Some of the electricity is
stored in the car’s battery to provide electrical energy when the car isn’t running.

• A power plant generator produces electricity with the kinetic energy of a turning turbine. The energy to turn
the turbine may come from burning fuel, falling water, or some other energy source. You can see how falling
water is used to generate electricity in a hydroelectric power plant in the Figure 5.195.

FIGURE 5.195

Q: The water ﬂowing through the dam and over the turbine has kinetic energy because it is moving. Where does the

A: When the water is in the reservoir, it has potential energy because of gravity. Potential energy is stored in the
water because of its position behind the dam. When the water ﬂows into the intake pipe, gravity pulls it downhill to
the power plant.

• An electric generator is a device that produces electricity through electromagnetic induction. Electromagnetic

induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic ﬁeld.

• Generators may produce either alternating or direct current, but they all change kinetic energy to electrical

• Distinguish between step-up and step-down electric transformers.

You’ve probably noticed big drums like this one at the tops of electric poles. A pole close to your home is likely
to have one. The drum is an electric transformer. Without it, the current entering your home would have too much
voltage for your home’s electric circuits to handle.

What Is an Electric Transformer?

An electric transformer is a device that uses electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current.
Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating current with a magnetic ﬁeld. It occurs when a magnetic ﬁeld
and electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another. A transformer may either increase or
decrease voltage. You can see the basic components of an electric transformer in the Figure 5.196. For an animation

The transformer in the diagram consists of two wire coils wrapped around an iron core. Each coil is part of a
different circuit. When alternating current passes through coil P, it magnetizes the iron core. Because the current is
alternating, the magnetic ﬁeld of the iron core keeps reversing. This is where electromagnetic induction comes in.
The changing magnetic ﬁeld induces alternating current in coil S of the other circuit.

Stepping Up or Stepping Down

Notice that coil P and coil S in the Figure 5.196 have the same number of turns of wire. In this case, the voltages of
the primary and secondary currents are the same. Usually, the two coils of a transformer have different numbers of
turns. In that case, the voltages of the two currents are different.

• When coil S has more turns than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is greater than the voltage in the
primary current (see Figure 5.197). This type of transformer is called a step-up transformer. That’s because it
steps up, or increases, the voltage.

FIGURE 5.197

• When coil S has fewer turns of wire than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is less than the voltage in
the primary current (see Figure 5.198). This type of transformer is called a step-down transformer because it
steps down, or decreases, the voltage.

Q: Both step-up and step-down transformers are used in the electrical grid that carries electricity from a power plant

A: One place that step-down transformers are used is on the electric poles that supply current to homes. They reduce
the voltage of the electric current before it enters home circuits.

• An electric transformer is a device that uses electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of an electric

current.

5.92 Electrical Grid

• Describe an electrical grid.
• Identify the roles of power plants, transmission lines, and electric substations in an electrical grid.

These electric power towers carry high-voltage electric lines. The lines transmit electricity from power plants to
homes like yours. The towers are a crucial part of the electrical grid.

What Is an Electrical Grid?

An electrical grid is the entire electrical system that generates, transmits, and distributes electric power throughout
a region or country. A very simple electrical grid is sketched in the Figure 5.199. The grid includes a power plant,
transmission lines, and electric substations, all of which work together to provide alternating current to customers.

FIGURE 5.199

Power Plants

Electricity originates in power plants. They have electric generators that produce electricity by electromagnetic
induction. In this process, a changing magnetic ﬁeld is used to generate electric current. The generators convert
kinetic energy to electrical energy. The kinetic energy may come from ﬂowing water, burning fuel, wind, or some
other energy source.

Transmission Lines

Transmission lines on big towers—like those in the opening photo above—carry high-voltage electric current from
power plants to electric substations. Smaller towers and individual power poles carry lower-voltage current from
electric substations to homes and businesses.

Electric Substations

Electric substations have several functions. Many substations distribute electricity from a few high-voltage lines
to several lower-voltage lines. They have electric transformers, which use electromagnetic induction to change the
voltage of the current. Some transformers increase the voltage; others decrease the voltage. In the Figure 5.200,
you can see how both types of transformers are used in an electrical grid.

FIGURE 5.200

• A step-up transformer increases the voltage of the current as it leaves the power plant. After the voltage has
been increased, less current travels through the high-voltage power lines. This reduces the amount of power
that is lost due to resistance of the power lines.

1045

5.92. Electrical Grid

www.ck12.org

• A step-down transformer decreases the voltage of the current so it can be distributed safely to businesses and
homes. A high-voltage power line may have 750,000 volts, whereas most home circuits have a maximum of
240 volts. Therefore, one or more step-down transformers are needed to decrease the voltage of current before
it enters homes.

Q: Assume that a home needs a 14-volt circuit for a light and a 120-volt circuit for a microwave oven. If the main
power line entering home has 240 volts, what can you infer about the home’s electrical system?
A: The home’s electrical system must have step-down transformers that lower the voltage for some of the home’s
circuits.

Summary

• The electrical grid is the entire electrical system that generates, transmits, and distributes electric power

throughout a region or country. It includes power plants, transmission lines, and electric substations.

• Power plants are where electric power originates. They have electric generators that generate electric current

through electromagnetic induction.

• Transmission lines carry electric current from power plants to substations and from substations to homes and

other places where electric power is needed.

• Electric substations have step-up or step-down transformers to increase or decrease the voltage of current as

needed.
