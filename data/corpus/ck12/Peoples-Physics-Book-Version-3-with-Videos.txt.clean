The  Big  Idea 	  Units identify what a specific number refers to. For instance, the number 42 can be used to represent 42 miles, 42 pounds, or 42 elephants! Numbers are mathematical objects, but units give them physical meaning. Keeping track of units can help you avoid mistakes when you work out problems. 
Key  Concepts 	  Every answer to a physics problem must include units. Even if a problem explicitly asks for a speed in meters per second (m/s), the answer is 5 m/s, not 5. When youre not sure how to approach a problem, you can often get insight by considering how to obtain the units of the desired result by combining the units of the given variables. For instance, if you are given a distance (in meters) and a time (in hours), the only way to obtain units of speed (meters/hour) is to divide the distance by the time. This is a simple example of a method called dimensional analysis, which can be used to find equations that govern various physical situations without any knowledge of the phenomena themselves. This textbook uses SI units (La Systme International dUnits), the most modern form of the metric system. When converting speeds from metric to American units, remember the following rule of thumb: a speed measured in mi/hr is about double the value measured in m/s (i.e., 10 {m/s} is equal to about 20 MPH). Remember that the speed itself hasnt changed, just our representation of the speed in a certain set of units. If a unit is named after a person, it is capitalized. So you write 10 Newtons, or 10 N, but 10 meters, or 10 m. Vectors are arrows that represent quantities with direction. In this textbook, vectors will be written in bold. For instance, the force vector will be written as F in this textbook. Your teacher will likely use~F to represent vectors. Dont let this confuse you: ~F represents the same concept as F. Vectors can be added together in a simple way. Two vectors can be moved (without changing their directions) to become two legs of a parallelogram. The sum of two vectors is simply the diagonal of the parallelogram:

Youll come pretty close if you guess that there are about 800,000 people in S.F. and that one person drinks on average about 100 cans per year. So, around 80,000,000 cans are consumed every year. Sure, this answer is not exactly right, but it is likely not off by more than a factor of 10 (i.e., an order of magnitude). That is, even though we guessed, were going to be in the ballpark of the right answer. This is often the first step in working out a physics problem. ?upper case (a subscript zero, such as that found in x0 is often pronounced naught or not)

The  Big  Idea 	  Energy is a measure of the amount of, or potential for, dynamical activity in something. The total amount of energy in the universe is constant. This symmetry is called a conservation law. Physicists have identified five conservation laws that govern our universe. A group of things (well use the word system) has a certain amount of energy. Energy can be added to a system: when chemical bonds in a burning log break, they release heat. A system can also lose energy: when a spacecraft burns up its energy of motion during re-entry, it releases energy and the surrounding atmosphere absorbs it in the form of heat. A closed system is one for which the energy is constant, or conserved. In this chapter, we will often consider closed systems; although the total amount of energy stays the same, it can transform from one kind to another. We will consider transfers of energy between systems  known as work-in more detail in Chapter 8.

Key  Concepts 	  Any object in motion has kinetic energy. Kinetic energy increases as the square of the velocity, so faster objects have much more kinetic energy than slower ones. The energy associated with gravity is called gravitational potential energy. Near the surface of the earth, an objects gravitational potential energy increases linearly with its height. Molecules store chemical potential energy in the bonds between electrons; when these bonds are broken the released energy can be transferred into kinetic and/or potential energy. 1 KCal (1 food Calorie) is equal to 4180 Joules of stored chemical potential energy. Energy can be transformed from one kind into another and exchanged between systems; if there appears to be less total energy in a system at the end of a process then at the beginning, the lost energy has been transferred to another system, often by heat or sound waves. 
Key  Applications 	  In roller coaster problems, a carts gravitational potential energy at the top of one hill is transformed into kinetic energy at the next valley. It turns back into potential energy as cart climbs the next hill, and so on. In reality a fraction of the energy is lost to the tracks and air as heat, which is why the second rise is rarely as big as the first in amusement parks. In pole-vaulter problems, the athletes body breaks down the food molecules to change some of the bonding energy into energy that is used to power the body. This energy is transformed into kinetic energy as the athlete gains speed. The kinetic energy can be changed into potential energy as the athlete gains height. In pendulum problems, the gravitational potential energy of the pendulum at its highest point changes to kinetic energy as it swings to the bottom and then back into potential energy as it swings up. At any in-between point there is a combination of kinetic energy and potential energy, but the total energy remains constant.

The  Big  Idea 	  One dimensional motion describes objects moving in straight lines. Speed is a scalar measure of how quickly an object is moving along this line. Velocity is speed with a direction, making it a vector. If an objects velocity changes with time, the object is said to be accelerating. When restricted to one dimension, there are only two possible directions for the velocity and acceleration vectors to point in. As well see in the next chapters, understanding an objects acceleration is the key to understanding its motion.

Key  Concepts 	  When beginning a one dimensional problem, define a positive direction. The other direction is then taken to be negative. Traditionally, positive is taken to mean to the right; however, any definition of direction used consistency throughout the problem will yield the right answer. Be sure you understand the difference between average velocity (measured over a period of time) and instantaneous velocity (measured at a single moment in time). Gravity near the Earth pulls an object toward the surface of the Earth with an acceleration of 9.8 m/s2(? 10 m/s2). In the absence of air resistance, all objects will fall with the same acceleration. Air resistance can cause low-mass, large area objects to accelerate more slowly. Deceleration is the term used when an objects speed is decreasing due to an acceleration in the opposite direction of its velocity. The Big Three equations define the graphs of position and velocity as a function of time. When there is no acceleration (constant velocity), position increases linearly with time  distance equals rate times time. Under constant acceleration, velocity increases linearly with time but distance does so at a quadratic rate. The slopes of the position and velocity graphs will give instantaneous velocity and acceleration, respectively. At first, you might get frustrated trying to figure out which of the Big Three equations to use for a certain problem, but dont worry, this comes with practice. Making a table that identifies the variables given in the problem and the variables you are looking for can sometimes help.

The  Big  Idea 	  In this chapter, we aim to understand and explain the parabolic motion of a thrown object, known as projectile motion. We can break down any initial velocity vector into its vertical and horizontal components. Motion in one direction is unrelated to motion in perpendicular directions, so we can treat the individual components as separate one-dimensional motion problems using all the equations from the last chapter. Once the object has been thrown, the only acceleration is from gravity, in the vertical direction. The horizontal component of velocity remains unchanged (ignoring air resistance) throughout the flight. 
Vertical  Direction 	  ? +y	= Upward ??? )	=	gt2 ? vy(t)	= v0y ?gt = v0y2 ?2g(?y) 
Horizontal  Direction 	  ? x(t) ?? vx(t) ??ax = x0 +v0xt = v0x = 0 Note: the initial velocity v0 can be separated into v0x = v0 cos? and v0y = v0 sin?, where ? is the angle between the velocity vector and the horizontal. 
Key  Concepts 	  In projectile motion, the horizontal displacement of an object from its starting point is called its range. Vertical speed is zero only at the highest point of a thrown objects flight. To work these problems, separate the Big Three equations into two sets: one for the vertical direction, and one for the horizontal. Keep them separate. The only variable that can go into both sets of equations is time. You use time to communicate between the two directions. Since in the absence of air resistance there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction, this component of velocity does not change over time. This is a counter-intuitive notion for many. (Air resistance will cause velocity to decrease slightly or significantly depending on the object. But this factor is ignored for the time being.) Motion in the vertical direction must include the acceleration due to gravity, and therefore the velocity in the vertical direction changes over time. The shape of the path of an object undergoing projectile motion in two dimensions is a parabola. We will ignore air resistance in this chapter. Air resistance will tend to shorten the range of the projectile motion by virtue of producing an acceleration opposite to the direction of motion.

The  Big  Idea 	  Applied forces may cause objects to accelerate. All forces come in pairs because they arise in the interaction of two objects you cant push without being pushed back! The more force applied, the greater the acceleration that is produced. Objects with high masses are difficult to accelerate without a large force. In the absence of applied forces, objects move in a straight line at a constant speed (or remain at rest). In formal language: 
Newtons  First  Law 	  Anybody continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right (straight) line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it. 
Newtons  Second  Law 	  The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right (straight) line in which that force is impressed. 
Newtons  Third  Law 	  To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. (Taken from the Principia in modern English, Isaac Newton, University of California Press, 1934). Understanding motion comes in two stages. The first stage youve already seen: you can figure out where something will go, and how fast it will get there, if you know its acceleration. The second stage is much more interesting: where did the acceleration come from? How can you predict the amount of acceleration? Mastering both stages is the key to understanding motion. The First Law is about inertia; objects at rest stay at rest unless acted upon and objects in motion continue that motion in a straight line unless acted upon. Prior to Newton and Galileo, the prevailing view on motion was still Aristotles. According to his theory the natural state of things is at rest; force is required to keep something moving at a constant rate. This made sense to people throughout history because on earth, friction and air resistance slow moving objects. When there is no air resistance (or other sources of friction), a situation approximated in space, Newtons first law is much more evident. The motion Newton mentions in the Second Law is, in his language, the product of the mass and velocity of an object  we call this quantity momentum  so the Second Law is actually the famous equation : ~F = ?(m~v) = m?~v = m~a	[1] ?t	?t That is, the acceleration experienced by an object will be proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to its mass. If there are multiple forces, they can be added as vectors and it is the net force that matters: m~a = F~net = ?~Fi i 
Net force is the vector sum of all the forces 	  max = Fnet, x = ?Fix i 
Horizontal components add 	  may = Fnet, y = ?Fiy i 
As do vertical ones 	  When the net force on an object is zero, it is said to be in translational equilibrium: i Finally, the Third Law states that you cant push someone or something without being pushed back. This law is somewhat confusing: if to each applied force there is an equal and opposite force, why does anything ever accelerate? The key is that the equal and opposite forces act on different objects. If I push a cart, the cart is in turn pushing on me. However, Im also pushing (and being pushed by) the earth, through my feet. Therefore, in the end, the cart and I move in the same direction and the earth moves opposite us. The cart-person system experienced a net force in one direction, while the earth experienced an equal and opposite force. According to Newtons second law, the acceleration objects experience due to applied forces is inversely proportional to their mass; clearly, the earth  with its gigantic mass  doesnt move very far compared to the cart and person. 
Newtons  Laws  Example 	  Question: Tom and Mary are standing on identical skateboards. Tom and Mary push off of each other and travel in opposite directions. a) If Tom (M) and Mary (m) have identical masses, who travels farther? b) If Tom has a bigger mass than Mary, who goes farther? c) If Tom and Mary have identical masses and Tom pushes twice as hard as Mary, who goes farther? 
Solution 	  a) Neither. Both Tom and Mary will travel the same distance. The forced applied to each person is the same (Newtons Third Law). So 
Ma =ma 	  which cancels to a = a Therefore both people will travel the same distance because the acceleration controls how far someone will travel and Tom and Mary have equal acceleration. b) Mary will go farther. Again, the same force is applied to both Mary and Tom so 
Ma = ma 	  Since Tom has the larger mass, his acceleration must be smaller (acceleration and mass are inversely proportional). Finally, because Marys acceleration is greater, she will travel farther. c) Neither. Newtons Third Law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore if Tompushes twice as hard as Mary, Mary will essentially be pushing back with the same strength. They will therefore travel the same distance if they have the same mass. 
Key  Concepts 	  An object will not change its state of motion (i.e., accelerate) unless an unbalanced force acts on it. Equal and oppositely directed forces do not produce acceleration. If no unbalanced force acts on an object the object remains at constant velocity or at rest. The force of gravity is called weight and equals mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity of the planet (g = 9.8 m/s2, downward, on Earth). Your mass does not change when you move to other planets, because mass is a measure of how much matter your body contains, and not how much gravitational force you feel. A free body diagram (FBD) is a diagram that shows all the forces acting on an object. It is essential to draw this diagram before attempting to answer a question or solve a problem. If the FBD is drawn correctly then solving the problem is made easy. For incline planes, it is often convenient to rotate the axis such that the x-direction points down the incline and the y-direction points perpendicular to the surface. This will make the math easier to work with as there will be less vectors to break into components. To calculate the net force on an object, you need to calculate all the individual forces acting on the object and then add them as vectors. This requires some mathematical skill. Air resistance is generally not considered in this chapter, however it is important when an object is moving at high speeds through an atmosphere and is generally proportional to the velocity or the velocity squared for slow or fast speeds, respectively. Newtons 3rd Law states for every force there is an equal but opposite reaction force. To distinguish a third law pair from merely oppositely directed pairs is difficult, but very important. Third law pairs must obey three rules: (1) Third law force pairs must be of the same type of force. (2) Third law force pairs are exerted on two different objects. (3) Third law force pairs are equal in magnitude and oppositely directed. Example: A block sits on a table. The Earths gravity on the block and the force of the table on the block are equal and opposite. But these are not third law pairs, because they are both on the same object and the forces are of different types. The proper third law pairs are: (1) earths gravity on block/blocks gravity on earth and (2) table pushes on block/ block pushes on table. If youre asked to evaluate a vector, you may state the x and y components of the vector, or a magnitude and an angle with respect to the horizontal.

Problem  Solving for  Newtons  Laws,  Step- By- Step 	  a. If youre looking for the motion of a rolling cart, the cart is the object of interest. b. If the object of interest is not moving, thats OK, dont panic yet. c. Draw a sketch! This may help you sort out which object is which in your problem. a. If the object has mass and is near the Earth, the easiest (and therefore, first) force to write down is the force of gravity, pointing downward, with value mg. b. If the object is in contact with a flat surface, it means there is a normal force acting on the object. This normal force points away from and is perpendicular to the surface. c. There may be more than one normal force acting on an object. For instance, if you have a bologna sandwich, remember that the slice of bologna feels normal forces from both the slices of bread! d. If a rope, wire, or cord is pulling on the object in question, youve found yourself a tension force. The direction of this force is in the same direction that the rope is pulling. e. Dont worry about any forces acting on other objects. For instance, if you have a bologna sandwich as your object of interest, and youre thinking about the forces acting on the slice of bologna, dont worry about the force of gravity acting on either piece of bread. f. Remember that Newtons 3rd Law, calling for equal and opposite forces, does not apply to a single object. None of your forces should be equal and opposite on the same object in the sense of Newtons 3rd Law. Third law pairs act on two different objects. g. Recall that scales (like a bathroom scale you weigh yourself on) read out the normal force acting on you, not your weight. If you are at rest on the scale, the normal force equals your weight. If you are accelerating up or down, the normal force had better be higher or lower than your weight, or you wont have an unbalanced force to accelerate you. h. Never include m a as a force acting on an object. m a is the result for which the net force Fnet is the cause. a. If a force is upward, make it in the y?direction and give it a positive sign. If it is downward, make it in the y?direction and give it a negative sign. b. Same thing applies for right vs. left in the x?direction. Make rightward forces positive. c. If forces are at an angle, draw them at an angle. A great example is that when a dog on a leash runs ahead, pulling you along, its pulling both forward and down on your hand. d. Draw the free body diagram (FBD). e. Remember that the FBD is supposed to be helping you with your problem. For instance, if you forget a force, itll be really obvious on your FBD. a. Use right triangle trigonometry b. Remember that these components arent new forces, but are just what makes up the forces youve already identified. c. Consider making a second FBD to do this component work, so that your first FBD doesnt get too messy. a. Remember that all the rightward forces add with a plus (+) sign, and that all the leftward forces add with a minus (?) sign. b. Dont forget about the x?components of any forces that are at an angle! c. When youve added them all up, call this the sum of all x forces or the net force in the x?direction. a. Remember that all the upward forces add with a (+) sign, all the downward forces add with a (?) sign. b. Dont forget about the y?components of any forces that are at an angle! c. When youve added them all up, call this the sum of all y forces or net force in the y?direction. a. The sum of all x?forces, divided by the mass, is the objects acceleration in the x?direction. b. The sum of all y?forces, divided by the mass, is the objects acceleration in the y?direction. c. If you happen to know that the acceleration in the x?direction or y?direction is zero (say the object is just sitting on a table), then you can plug this in to Newtons 2nd Law directly. d. If you happen to know the acceleration, you can plug this in directly too. a. Draw a separate FBD for each body. b. Set up a sum of forces equation based on the FBD for each body. c. Newtons Third Law will tell you which forces on different bodies are the same in magnitude. d. Your equations should equal your unknown variables at this point.

What is the coefficient of kinetic friction K between the box and the floor? k. The kid pulls the box at an angle of 30??, producing an acceleration of 2 m/s2. What is the coefficient of kinetic friction K between the box and the floor? Draw free body diagrams for the situation below. Notice that we are pulling the bottom block out from beneath the top block. There is friction between the blocks! After you have drawn your FBDs, identify the 3rd law force pairs, as above. Heres the situation: both springs are compressed by an amount xo. The rod of length L is fixed to both the top plate and the bottom plate. The two springs, each with spring constant k, are wrapped around the rod on both sides of the middle plate, but are free to move because they are not attached to the rod or the plates. The middle plate has negligible mass, and is constrained in its motion by the compression forces of the top and bottom springs. The medical implementation of this device is to screw the top plate to one vertebrae and the middle plate to the vertebrae directly below. The bottom plate is suspended in space. Instead of fusing broken vertebrates together, this implant allows movement somewhat analogous to the natural movement of functioning vertebrae. Below you will do the exact calculations that an engineer did to get this device patented and available for use at hospitals. a. Find the force, F, on the middle plate for the region of its movement 4x ? xo. Give your answer in terms of the constants given. ( Hint: In this region both springs are providing opposite compression forces.) b. Find the force, F, on the middle plate for the region of its movement 4x ? xo.

Design and state a strategy for solving for how long it will take the larger mass to hit the ground, assuming at this moment it is at a height h above the ground. Do not attempt to solve this: simply state the strategy for solving it. lift the two objects upward. The angles of the ropes, measured with respect to the vertical, are shown. Assume the bodies are at rest initially. a. Suppose you are able to measure the masses m1 and m2 of the two hanging objects as well as the tension TC. Do you then have enough information to determine the other two tensions, TA and TB? Explain your reasoning. b. If you only knew the tensions TA and TC, would you have enough information to determine the masses m1 and m2? If so, write m1 and m2 in terms of TA and TC. If not, what further information would you require? Draw a graph of friction force vs. time. As you know, if the situation is left like this, the little block will just fall. But if we accelerate the leftmost block to the right, this will create a normal force between the little block and the big block, and if there is a coefficient of friction between them, then the little block wont slide down! Clever, eh? a. The mass of the little block is 0.15 kg. What frictional force is required to keep it from falling? (State a magnitude and direction.) b. If both blocks are accelerating to the right with an acceleration a = 14.0 m/s2, what is the normal force on the little block provided by the big block? c. What is the minimum coefficient of static friction required? 
The  Big  Idea 	  In the absence of a net force, objects move in a straight line. If they turn that is, if their velocity changes, even only in direction there must be an applied force. Forces which cause objects to turn around continuously in a circle are known as centripetal forces. When an object moves in a circle its velocity at any particular instant points in a direction tangent to the circle. The acceleration points towards the center of the circle, and so does the force acting on it. This is only natural, when you think about it if you feel a force pushing you towards your left as you walk forward, you will walk in a circle, always turning left. The reason the Earth orbits the sun is due to the Universal Law of Gravity and centripetal motion. The Universal Law of Gravity was a great achievement in the history of mankind. It unified the heavenly bodies and the Earthly bodies. Isaac Newton showed that an apple falling to the ground and the moon orbiting Earth are both explained by the same laws of physics. 
Key  Equations 	  ? m mv2 ?? 
C =	v 	  r ??r mass (in kilograms, kg) speed (in meters per second, m/s) radius of circle 
Gravitational  Force 	  ? ?m1,m2	Masses of objects 
Key  Concepts 	  An orbital period, T, is the time it takes to make one complete rotation. If a particle travels a distance 2?r in an amount of time T, then its speed is distance over time or 2?r/T. An object moving in a circle has an instantaneous velocity vector tangential to the circle of its path. The force and acceleration vectors point to the center of the circle. Net force and acceleration always have the same direction. Centripetal acceleration is just the acceleration provided by centripetal forces. Any force can be a centripetal force. Centripetal force is the umbrella term given to any force that is acting perpendicular to the motion of an object and thus causing it to go in a circle. When undergoing centripetal motion you might feels an outward pull, however this is not a true force, but merely the objects inertia. Remember, Newtons first law maintains that the natural state of an object is to go in a straight line at constant speed. Thus, when you make a right turn in your car and the basketball in the back seat flies to the left, that is because the car is moving right and the basketball is maintaining its position and thus from your point of view moves to the left. Your point of view in this case is different from reality because you are in a rotating reference frame. The Geosynchronous orbit is the orbit where a satellite completes one orbit of the Earth every 24 hours, staying above the same spot (longitude) on Earth. This is a very important orbit for spy satellites and TV satellites among others. You force the speed of the satellite to be a value such that the satellite makes one rotation every 24 hours. 
Universal  Law of  Gravity 	  In previous chapters we learned that gravity  near the surface of planets, at least  is a force that accelerates objects at a constant rate. At this point we can extend this description using the framework of Newtons Laws. Newtons Laws apply to all forces; but when he developed them only one was known: gravity. Newtons major insight  and one of the greatest in the history of science  was that the same force that causes objects to fall when released is also responsible for keeping the planets in orbit. According to some sources, he realized this while taking a stroll through some gardens and witnessing a falling apple. After considering the implications of this unification, Newton formulated the Law of Universal Gravitation: Any two objects in the universe, with masses m1 and m2 with their centers of mass at a distance r apart will experience a force of mutual attraction along the line joining their centers of mass equal to: F~G = Gm12m2	Universal Law of Gravity, r where G is the Gravitational constant: 
G = 6.6730010?11m3kg?1s?2 	  Here is an illustration of this law for two objects, for instance the earth and the sun: 
Gravity on the  Earths  Surface 	  In the chapter on force, we saw that the gravitational force or weight formula for objects near earth, Fg = mg, is a special case of a more general result. On the surface of a planet  such as earth  the r in the Universal Law of Gravity is very close to the radius of the planet. A planets center of mass is approximately at its center (for a spherical planet with azimuthal symmetry of density this is exactly true). In addition, we can safely ignore the increase in height off the surface of Earth. For instance, the earths radius is about 6,000 km, while the heights we consider for this book are on the order of at most a few kilometers  so we can say to very good accuracy that for objects near the surface of the earth, the r in the formula is constant and equal to the earths radius. This allows us to say that gravity is constant on the surface of the earth. Heres an illustration: For any object a height h above the surface of the earth, the force of gravity may be expressed as: 
Gmearthmobj 	  (rearth +h)2 
Now we make the approximation that 	  rearth +h ? rearth then, we can rewrite the above as 
Gm mobj = mobj ~g	 Gravity on  Earth  gearth 	  We can do this because the quantity in braces only has constants; we can combine them and call their product g. Remember, this is an approximation that holds only when objects are near (think in our atmosphere) the surface of Earth. We call the quantity mg an objects weight. Weight is different from mass  which is identical everywhere  since it depends on the gravitational force an object experiences. In fact, weight is the magnitude of that force. To find the weight of an object on another planet, star, or moon, use the appropriate values in the Law of Gravity formula and solve for FG 
Key  Applications 	  To find the maximum speed that a car can take a corner on a flat road without skidding out, set the force of friction equal to the centripetal force. To find the tension in the rope of a swinging pendulum, remember that it is the sum of the tension and gravity that produces a net upward centripetal force. A common mistake is just setting the centripetal force equal to the tension. To find the speed of a planet or satellite in an orbit, set the force of gravity equal to the centripetal force.

The  Big  Idea 	  The universe has many remarkable qualities, among them a rather beautiful symmetry: the total amount of motion in the universe is constant. This law only makes sense if we measure motion in a specific way: as the product of mass and velocity. This product, called momentum, can be transferred from one object to another in a collision. The rapidity with which momentum is exchanged over time is determined by the forces involved in the collision. This is the second of the five fundamental conservation laws in physics. The other four are conservation of energy, angular momentum, charge and CPT. (See Feynmans Diagrams for an explanation of CPT.)

Uses of  Momentum?p 	  ma =	=	Newtons Second Law in terms of momentum ?t	?t ??? pinitial = ? pfinal 
Key  Concepts 	  Momentum is a vector that points in the direction of the velocity vector. The magnitude of this vector is the product of mass and speed. The total momentum of the universe is always the same and is equal to zero. The total momentum of an isolated system never changes. Momentum can be transferred from one body to another. In an isolated system in which momentum is transferred internally, the total initial momentum is the same as the total final momentum. Momentum conservation is especially important in collisions, where the total momentum just before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision. The force imparted on an object is equal to the change in momentum divided by the time interval over which the objects are in contact. Impulse is the change in momentum on one of the objects in a collision. Impulse force is the force imparted on one of the objects as defined above. Impulse is how momentum is transferred from one system to another. You can always determine the impulse by finding the changes in momentum, which are done by forces acting over a period of time. If you graph force vs. time of impact the area under the curve is the impulse. When calculating impulse the time to use is when the force is in contact with the body. Center-of-mass is the balancing point of an object. For uniform density ball, the center of mass is at the exact center. All collisions in this chapter are treated as center of mass collisions. Internal forces are forces for which both Newtons 3rd Law force pairs are contained within the system. For example, consider a two-car head-on collision. Define the system as just the two cars. In this case, internal forces include that of the fenders pushing on each other, the contact forces between the bolts, washers, and nuts in the engines, etc. External forces are forces that act on the system from outside. In our previous example, external forces include the force of gravity acting on both cars (because the other part of the force pair, the pull of gravity the Earth experiences coming from the cars, is not included in the system) and the forces of friction between the tires and the road. If there are no external forces acting on a system of objects, the initial momentum of the system will be the same as the final momentum of the system. Otherwise, the final momentum will change by 4p = F4t. We call a change in momentum, 4p, an impulse. 
Key  Applications 	  Two cars collide head-on...two subatomic particles collide in an accelerator...a bird slams into a glass office building: all of these are examples of one-dimensional (straight line) collisions. For these, pay extra attention to direction: define one direction as positive and the other as negative, and be sure everybody gets the right sign. A firecracker in mid-air explodes...two children push off each other on roller skates...an atomic nucleus breaks apart during a radioactive decay: all of these are examples of disintegration problems. The initial momentum beforehand is zero, so the final momentum afterwards must also be zero. A spacecraft burns off momentum by colliding with air molecules as it descends...hail stones pummel the top of your car...a wet rag is thrown at and sticks to the wall: all of these are examples of impulse problems, where the change in momentum of one object and the reaction to the applied force are considered. What is important here is the rate: you need to come up with an average time Dt that the collision(s) last so that you can figure out the force F =4p/4t. Remember as well that if a particle has momentum p, and it experiences an impulse that turns it around completely, with new momentum ?p, then the total change in momentum has magnitude 2p. It is harder to turn something totally around than just to stop it! A car going south collides with a second car going east . . . an inflatable ball is thrown into the flow of a waterfall . . . a billiard ball strikes two others, sending all three off in new directions: these are all examples of two-dimensional (planar) collisions. For these, you get a break: the sum of all the momenta in the x direction have to remain unchanged before and after the collision independent of any y momenta, and vice-versa. This is a similar concept to the one we used in projectile motion. Motions in different directions are independent of each other. Momenta vectors add just like any other vectors. Refer to the addition of vectors material in Chapter 1. 
Example 1 	  Question: Two blocks collide on a frictionless surface. Afterwards, they have a combined mass of 10kg and a speed of 2.5m/s. Before the collision, block A, which has a mass of 8.0kg, was at rest. What was the mass and initial speed of block B? Solution: To find mass of block B we have a simple subtraction problem. We know that the combined mass is 10kg and the mass of block A is 8.0kg. Now that we know the mass of both blocks we can find the speed of block B. We will use conservation of momentum. This was a completely inelastic collision. We know this because the blocks stuck together after the collision. This problem is one dimensional, because all motion happens along the same line. Thus we will use the equation (mA +mB)vf = mA vA +mB vB and solve for the velocity of block B. (mA +mB)vf = mA vA +mBvB ? (mA +mB)(vf )?(mA)(vA) = vB mB Now we simply plug in what we know to solve for the velocity. (2.0kg+8.0kg)(2.5m/s)?(8.0kg)(0m/s) = 12.5m/s 
Example 2 	  Question: Chris and Ashley are playing pool on a frictionless table. Ashley hits the cue ball into the 8 ball with a velocity of 1.2m/s. The cue ball (c) and the 8 ball (e) react as shown in the diagram. The 8 ball and the cue ball both have a mass of .17kg. What is the velocity of the cue ball? What is the direction (the angle) of the cue ball? Answer: We know the equation for conservation of momentum, along with the masses of the objects in question as well two of the three velocities. Therefore all we need to do is manipulate the conservation of momentum equation so that it is solved for the velocity of the cue ball after the collision and then plug in the known values to get the velocity of the cue ball. mcvic +mevie = mcvfc +mevfe mcvic +mevie ?mevfe	.17kg2.0m/s+.17kg0m/s?.17kg1.2m/s vfc =	=	= .80m/s mc	.17kg Now we want to find the direction of the cue ball. To do this we will use the diagram below. We know that the momentum in the y direction of the two balls is equal. Therefore we can say that the velocity in the y direction is also equal because the masses of the two balls are equal. mcvcy = mevey ? vcy = vey Given this and the diagram, we can find the direction of the cue ball. After 1 second, the 8 ball will have traveled 1.2m. Therefore we can find the distance it has traveled in the y direction. sin25o =	opposite	=	x	? x = sin251.2m = .51m hypotenuse	1.2m Therefore, in one second the cue ball will have traveled .51m in the y direction as well. We also know how far in total the cue ball travels in one second (.80m). Thus we can find the direction of the cue ball. ?1 opposite ?1 .51m o sin  = sin  = 40 hypotenuse .80m

The  Big  Idea 	  The law of conservation of momentum states that in any closed system (including the universe) the total quantity of momentum is constant. Momentum can be transferred from one body to another, but none is lost or gained. If a system has its momentum changed from the outside it is caused by an impulse, which transfers momentum from one body to another. When any two bodies in the universe interact, they can exchange energy, momentum, or both. The law of conservation of energy states that in any closed system (including the universe) the total quantity of energy remains fixed. Energy is transferred from one form to another, but not lost or gained. If energy is put into a system from the outside or vice versa it is often in the form of work, which is a transfer of energy between bodies.

Key  Concepts 	  Work is simply how much energy was transferred from one system to another system. You can always find the work done on an object (or done by an object) by determining how much energy has been transferred into or out of the object through forces. If you graph force vs. distance, the area under the curve is work. (The semantics take some getting used to: if you do work on me, then you have lost energy, and I have gained energy.) Work can be computed by multiplying the distance traveled with the component of force that is parallel to that distance Energy can be transformed from one kind into the other; if the total energy at the end of the process appears to be less than at the beginning, the lost energy has been transferred to another system, often by heat or sound waves. Work can be computed by multiplying the distance with the component of force that is parallel to the distance Efficiency is equal to the output energy divided by the input energy. 
Math of  Force,  Energy, and  Work 	  When an object moves in the direction of an applied force, we say that the force does work on the object. Note that the force may be slowing the object down, speeding it up, maintaining its velocity  any number of things. In all cases, the net work done is given by this formula: W = ~F d~ = ~F ?~x	[1]Work is the dot product of force and displacement. In other words, if an object has traveled a distance d under force ~F, the work done on it will equal to d multiplied by the component of ~F along the objects path. Consider the following example of a block moving horizontally with a force applied at some angle: Here the net work done on the object by the force will be Fd cos?. 
Work- Energy  Principle 	  The reason the concept of work is so useful is because of a theorem, called the work-energy principle, which states that the change in an objects kinetic energy is equal to the net work done on it: ?Ke =Wnet [2] Although we cannot derive this principle in general, we can do it for the case that interests us most: constant acceleration. In the following derivation, we assume that the force is along motion. This doesnt reduce the generality of the result, but makes the derivation more tractable because we dont need to worry about vectors or angles. Recall that an objects kinetic energy is given by the formula: 
Ke =mv2 [3] 	  Consider an object of mass m accelerated from a velocity vi to vf under a constant force. The change in kinetic energy, according to [2], is equal to: ?Ke = Kei ?Kef Now lets see how much work this took. To find this, we need to find the distance such an object will travel under these conditions. We can do this by using the third of our Big three equations, namely: vf 2 = vi2 +2a?x [5] alternatively, vf 2 ?vi2 ?x =	 [6] Plugging in [6] and Newtons Third Law, F = ma, into [2], we find: vf 2 ?vi2v2i ) [7], W = F?x = ma which was our result in [4]. 
Using the  Work- Energy  Principle 	  The Work-Energy Principle can be used to derive a variety of useful results. Consider, for instance, an object dropped a height ?h under the influence of gravity. This object will experience constant acceleration. Therefore, we can again use equation [6], substituting gravity for acceleration and ?h for distance: vf 2 ?vi2 ?h = multiplying both sides by $mg$, we find: vf 2 ?vi2 mg?h = mg	= ?K [8] In other words, the work performed on the object by gravity in this case is mg?h. We refer to this quantity as gravitational potential energy; here, we have derived it as a function of height. For most forces (exceptions are friction, air resistance, and other forces that convert energy into heat), potential energy can be understood as the ability to perform work. 
Spring  Force 	  A spring with spring constant k a distance ?x from equilibrium experiences a restorative force equal to: 
Fs = ?k?x [9] 	  This is a force that can change an objects kinetic energy, and therefore do work. So, it has a potential energy associated with it as well. This quantity is given by: 
Esp =k?x2	[10]  Spring  Potential  Energy 	  The derivation of [10] is left to the reader. Hint: find the average force an object experiences while moving from x = 0 to x =?x while attached to a spring. The net work is then this force times the displacement. Since this quantity (work) must equal to the change in the objects kinetic energy, it is also equal to the potential energy of the spring. This derivation is very similar to the derivation of the kinematics equations  look those up. 
Key  Applications 	  When working a problem that asks for height or speed, energy conservation is almost always the easiest approach. Potential energy of gravity, Ug, is always measured with respect to some arbitrary zero height defined to be where the gravitational potential energy is zero. You can set this height equal to zero at any altitude you like. Be consistent with your choice throughout the problem. Often it is easiest to set it to zero at the lowest point in the problem. When using the equation Etot,initial = Etot,final to solve a problem, it is important to know which side of the equation the kinetic and potential energy, work, heat, etc., go on. To figure this out, think about what kind of energy the person or object had in the beginning ( initial) and what kind it had in the end (final). Some problems require you to use both energy conservation and momentum conservation. Remember, in every collision, momentum is conserved. Kinetic energy, on the other hand, is not always conserved, since some kinetic energy may be lost to heat. If a system involves no energy losses due to heat or sound, no change in potential energy and no work is done by anybody to anybody else, then kinetic energy is conserved. Collisions where this occurs are called elastic. In elastic collisions, both kinetic energy and momentum are conserved. In inelastic collisions kinetic energy is not conserved; only momentum is conserved. Sometimes energy is lost when crushing an object. For instance, if you throw silly putty against a wall, much of the energy goes into flattening the silly putty (changing intermolecular bonds). Treat this as lost energy, similar to sound, chemical changes, or heat. In an inelastic collision, things stick, energy is lost, and so kinetic energy is not conserved. When calculating work, use the component of the force that is in the same direction as the motion. Components of force perpendicular to the direction of the motion dont do work. (Note that centripetal forces never do work, since they are always perpendicular to the direction of motion.) Mechanical Advantage is the ability to lift or move objects with great force while utilizing only a little force. The trade-off is that you must operate the smaller input force for a large distance. This is all seen through the work Equation. Work equals force times distance. Energy is conserved. Thus one can get a large force for a small distance equal to a small force for a large distance. Mechanical advantage equals the distance of effort divided by the distance the object moves. It is also equal to the output force divided by the input force. In some problems you will need to consider centripetal forces when finding the minimum energy to complete a loop or when driving over a hill.

The  Big  Idea 	  The third conservation law is conservation of angular momentum. This vector quantity is the product of rotational velocity and rotational inertia. In any closed system (including the universe) the quantity of angular momentum is fixed. Angular momentum can be transferred from one body to another, but cannot be lost or gained. If a system has its angular momentum changed from the outside it is caused by a torque. Torque is a force applied at a distance from the center of rotation. 
Key  Concepts 	  To determine the rotation axis, wrap your right hands fingers in the direction of rotation and your thumb will point along the axis (see figure). When something rotates in a circle, it moves through a position angle ? that runs from 0 to 2? radians and starts over again at 0. The physical distance it moves is called the path length. If the radius of the circle is larger, the path length traveled is longer. The angular velocity ? tells you how quickly the angle ? changes. In more formal language, the rate of change of ?, the angular position, is called the angular velocity ?. The direction of angular velocity is either clockwise or counterclockwise. Analogously, the rate of change of ? is the angular acceleration ?. The linear velocity and linear acceleration of rotating object also depend on the radius of rotation, which is called the moment arm (See figure below.) If something is rotating at a constant angular velocity, it moves more quickly if it is farther from the center of rotation. For instance, people at the Earths equator are moving faster than people at northern latitudes, even though their day is still 24 hours long this is because they have a greater circumference to travel in the same amount of time. There are rotational analogs to the Big Three equations. Just as linear accelerations are caused by forces, angular accelerations are caused by torques. Torques produce angular accelerations, but just as masses resist acceleration (due to inertia), there is an inertia that opposes angular acceleration. The measure of this inertial resistance depends on the mass, but more importantly on the distribution of the mass in a given object. The moment of inertia, I, is the rotational version of mass. Values for the moment of inertia of common objects are given in problem 2. Torques have only two directions: those that produce clockwise (CW) and those that produce counterclockwise (CCW) rotations. The angular acceleration or change in ? would be in the direction of the torque. Moment of inertia is the inertia to rotation. So the larger the moment of inertia the more difficult it is to rotate. And, thus, the more resistant it is to angular acceleration. Imagine spinning a fairly heavy disk. To make it spin, you dont push towards the disk centerthat will just move it in a straight line. To spin it, you need to push along the side, much like when you spin a basketball. Thus, the torque you exert on a disk to make it accelerate depends only on the component of the force perpendicular to the radius of rotation: ? = r F?. Many separate torques can be applied to an object. The angular acceleration produced is ? = ?net/I. When an object is rolling without slipping this means that v = r? and a = r?. This is also true in the situation of a rope on a pulley that is rotating the pulley without slipping. Using this correspondence between linear and angular speed and acceleration is very useful for solving problems, but is only true if there is no slipping. The angular momentum of a spinning object is L = I?. Torques produce a change in angular momentum with time: ? = 4L/4t Spinning objects have a kinetic energy, given by K = 1/2 I?2.

The  Big  Idea 	  The development of devices to measure time, like the pendulum, led to the analysis of periodic motion. Such motion repeats itself in equal intervals of time (called periods) and is also referred to as harmonic motion. When an object moves back and forth over the same path in harmonic motion it is said to be oscillating. If the distance such an object travels in one oscillation remains constant, it is called simple harmonic motion (SHM). A grandfather clocks pendulum and the quartz crystal in a modern watch are examples of SHM. 
Key  Concepts 	  The oscillating object does not lose any energy in SHM. Friction is assumed to be zero. In harmonic motion there is always a restorative force, which attempts to restore the oscillating object to its equilibrium position. The restorative force changes during an oscillation and depends on the position of the object. In a spring the force is given by Hookes Law: F = ?kx; in a pendulum it is the component of gravity along the path. Objects in simple harmonic motion do not obey the Big Three equations of motion because the acceleration is not constant. As a spring compresses, the force (and hence the acceleration) increases. Similarly, as a pendulum swings, the tangential component of the force of gravity changes. The equations of motion for SHM are given in the Key Equations section. The period, T, is the amount of time needed for the harmonic motion to repeat itself, or for the object to go one full cycle. In SHM, T is the time it takes the object to return to its exact starting point and starting direction. The frequency, f, is the number of cycles an object goes through in 1 second. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 cycle per sec. The amplitude, A, is the distance from the equilibrium (or center) point of motion to either its lowest or highest point (end points). The amplitude, therefore, is half of the total distance covered by the oscillating object. The amplitude can vary in harmonic motion, but is constant in SHM. The kinetic energy and the speed are at a maximum at the equilibrium point, but the potential energy and restorative force is zero there. At the end points the potential energy is at a maximum, while the kinetic energy and speed are zero. However at the end points the restorative force and acceleration are at a maximum. In SHM since energy is conserved, often, the most fruitful method of calculating position and velocity is to set the total energy equal to the sum of kinetic and potential energies. Similarly force and acceleration are best calculated by using ?F = ma.

The  Big  Idea 	  Objects in motion that return to the same position after a fixed period of time are said to be in harmonic motion. Objects in harmonic motion have the ability to transfer some of their energy over large distances. They do so by creating waves in a medium. Imagine pushing up and down on the surface of a bathtub filled with water. Water acts as the medium that carries energy from your hand to the edges of the bathtub. Waves transfer energy over a distance without direct contact with the initial source. Since waves are disturbances in an existing medium, they are considered phenomena and not actual objects. 
Key  Concepts 	  A medium is the substance through which the wave travels. For example, water acts as the medium for ocean waves, while air molecules act as the medium for sound waves. When a wave passes through a medium, the medium is only temporarily disturbed. When an ocean wave travels from one side of the Mediterranean Sea to the other, no actual water molecules move this great distance. Only the disturbance propagates (moves) through the medium. An object oscillating with frequency f will create waves which oscillate with the same frequency f. The speed v and wavelength ? of a wave depend on the nature of the medium through which the wave travels. There are two main types of waves we will consider: longitudinal waves and transverse waves. In longitudinal waves, the vibrations of the medium are in the same direction as the wave motion. A classic example is a wave traveling down a line of standing dominoes: each domino will fall in the same direction as the motion of the wave. A more physical example is a sound wave. For sound waves, high and low pressure zones move both forward and backward as the wave moves through them. In transverse waves, the vibrations of the medium are perpendicular to the direction of motion. A classic example is a wave created in a long rope: the wave travels from one end of the rope to the other, but the actual rope moves up and down, and not from left to right as the wave does. Water waves act as a mix of longitudinal and transverse waves. A typical water molecule pretty much moves in a circle when a wave passes through it. Most wave media act like a series of connected oscillators. For instance, a rope can be thought of as a large number of masses (molecules) connected by springs (intermolecular forces). The speed of a wave through connected harmonic oscillators depends on the distance between them, the spring constant, and the mass. In this way, we can model wave media using the principles of simple harmonic motion. The speed of a wave on a string depends on the material the string is made of, as well as the tension in the string. This fact is why tightening a string on your violin or guitar will change the sound it produces. The speed of a sound wave in air depends subtly on pressure, density, and temperature, but is about 343 m/s at room temperature. Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when something that has a natural frequency of vibration (pendulum, guitar, glass, etc.) is shaken or pushed at a frequency that is equal to its natural frequency of vibration. The most dramatic example is the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge due to wind causing vibrations at the bridges natural frequency. The result is the dramatic collapse of a very large suspension bridge.

Key  Applications 	  Constructive interference occurs when two waves combine to create a larger wave. This occurs when the peaks of two waves line up. Destructive interference occurs when two waves combine and cancel each other out. This occurs when a peak in one wave lines up with a trough in the other wave. When waves of two different frequencies interfere, phenomena known as beats occur. The frequency of a beat is the difference of the two frequencies. When a wave meets a barrier, it is reflected and travels back the way it came. The reflected wave may interfere with the original wave. If this occurs in precisely the right way, a standing wave can be created. The types of standing waves that can form depend strongly on the speed of the wave and the size of the region in which it is traveling. A typical standing wave is shown below. This is the motion of a simple jump-rope. Nodes are the places where the rope doesnt move at all; antinodes occur where the motion is greatest. For this wave, the wavelength is . Since , the frequency of oscillation is . Higher harmonics can also form. Note that each end, where the rope is attached, must always be a node. Below is an example of a rope in a 5th harmonic standing wave. In general, the frequency of oscillation is , where n is the number of antinodes. The thick, dotted lines represent the wave envelope: these are the upper and lower limits to the motion of the string. In general, the frequency of oscillation is f = nv/2L, where n is the number of antinodes. The thick and dotted lines represent the wave envelope: these are the upper and lower limits to the motion of the string. Importantly, each of the above standing wave examples can also apply to sound waves in a closed tube, electromagnetic waves in a wire or fiber optic cable, and so on. In other words,the standing wave examples can apply to any kind of wave, as long as nodes are forced at both ends by whatever is containing/reflecting the wave back on itself. If a node is forced at one end, but an antinode is forced at the other end, then a different spectrum of standing waves is produced. For instance, the fundamental standing sound wave produced in a tube closed at one end is shown below. In this case, the amplitude of the standing wave is referring to the magnitude of the air pressure variations. For this standing wave, the wavelength is . Since , the frequency of oscillation is . In general, the frequency of oscillation is , where is always odd. For this standing wave, the wavelength is ? = 4L. Since v = ?f , the frequency of oscillation is f = v/4L. In general, the frequency of oscillation is f = nv/4L, where n is always odd. When a source of a wave is moving towards you, the apparent frequency of the wave you detect is higher than that emitted. For instance, if an ambulance approaches you while playing a note at 500 Hz, the sound you hear will have slightly higher frequency. This familiar phenomenon is known as the Doppler Effect. The opposite occurs for a receding wave or if the observer moves or both move. There is a difference in the quantitative effect, depending on who is moving. (See the formulas under key equations above.) Note that these equations are for sound waves only. While the effect is similar for light and electromagnetic waves the formulas are not exactly the same as for sound.

The  Big  Idea 	  Conservation of charge is the fourth of the five conservation laws in physics. There are two types of charge: positive and negative; the law of conservation of electric charge states that the net charge of the universe remains constant. As with momentum and energy, in any closed system charge can be transferred from one body to another and can move within the system but cannot leave the system. Electromagnetism is associated with charge and is a fundamental force of nature, like gravity (which for us is associated with mass). If charges are static, the only manifestation of electromagnetism is the Coulomb electric force. In the same way the gravitational force that an object exerts upon other objects, and that other objects exert on it, depends on the amount of mass it possesses, the Coulomb electric force that an object experiences depends on the amount of electric charge the object possesses. Like gravity, the Coulomb electric force decreases with the square of the distance. The Coulomb electric force is responsible for many of the forces we discussed previously: the normal force, contact forces such as friction, and so on  all of these forces arise in the mutual attraction and repulsion of charged particles. Although the law determining the magnitude of the Coulomb electric force has the same form as the law of gravity, the electric constant is 20 orders of magnitude greater than the gravitational constant. That is why electricity normally dominates gravity at the atomic and molecular level. Since there is only one type of mass but two opposite types of electric charge, gravity will dominate in large bodies unless there is a separation of charge. 
The  Coulomb  Force  Law 	  The Coulomb Force Law states that any two charged particles (q1,q2)  with charge measured in units of Coulombs  at a distance r from each other will experience a force of repulsion or attraction along the line joining them equal to: 
F~e = kq12q2	 The  Coulomb  Force [1] 	  r 
Where 	  k = 8.987109 Nm2 C?2.	The Electric Constant This looks a lot like the Law of Universal Gravitation, which deals with attraction between objects with mass. The big difference is that while any two masses experience mutual attraction, two charges can either attract or repel each other, depending on whether the signs of their charges are alike: Like gravitational (and all other) forces, Coulomb forces add as vectors. Thus to find the force on a charge from an arrangement of charges, one needs to find the vector sum of the force from each charge in the arrangement. 
Example 1 	  Question: Two negatively charged spheres (one with ?12C; the other with ?3C) are 3m apart. Where could you place an electron so that it will be suspended in space between them with a net force of zero (for this problem we will ignore the force of repulsion between the two charges because they are held in place)? Answer: Consider the diagram above; here rs?e is the distance between the electron and the small charge, while ~Fs?e is the force the electron feels due to it. For the electron to be balanced in between the two charges, the forces of repulsion caused by the two charges on the electron would have to be balanced. To do this, we will set the equation for the force exerted by two charges on each other equal and solve for a distance ratio. We will denote the difference between the charges through the subscripts s for the smaller charge, e for the electron, and l for the larger charge. kqsqe	kqlqe = rs2?e	r Now we can cancel. The charge of the electron cancels. The constant k also cancels. We can then replace the large and small charges with the numbers. This leaves us with the distances. We can then manipulate the equation to produce a ratio of the distances. Given this ratio, we know that the electron is twice as far from the large charge (?12C) as from the small charge (?12C). Given that the distance between the small and large charges is 3m, we can determine that the electron must be located 2m away from the large charge and 1m away from the smaller charge. 
Electric  Fields and  Electric  Forces 	  Gravity and the Coulomb force have a nice property in common: they can be represented by fields. Fields are a kind of bookkeeping tool used to keep track of forces. Take the electromagnetic force between two charges given above: 
F~e = kqr12q2 	  If we are interested in the acceleration of the first charge only  due to the force from the second charge  we can rewrite this force as the product of q1 and kqr22 . The first part of this product only depends on properties of the object were interested in (the first charge), and the second part can be thought of as a property of the point in space where that object is. In fact, the quantity kqr22 captures everything about the electromagnetic force on any object possible at a distance r from q2. If we had replaced q1 with a different charge, q3, we would simply multiply q3 by kqr22 to find the new force on the new charge. Such a quantity, kqr22 here, is referred to as the electric field from charge q2 at that point: in this case, it is the electric field due to a single charge: kq [2] Electric field due to point charge q, distance r away r2 The electric field is a vector quantity, and points in the direction that a force felt by a positive charge at that point would. If we are given the electric field at some point, it is just a matter of multiplication  as illustrated above  to find the force any charge q0 would feel at that point: 
Force on charge q0	 Field  Charge 	  Note that this is true for all electric fields, not just those from point charges. In general, the electric field at a point is the force a positive test charge of magnitude 1 would feel at that point. Any other charge will feel a force along the same line (but possibly in the other direction) in proportion to its magnitude. In other words, the electric field can be thought of as force per unit charge. In the case given above, the field was due to a single charge. Such a field is shown in the figure below. Notice that this a field due to a positive charge, since the field arrows are pointing outward. The field produced by a point charge will be radially symmetric i.e., the strength of the field only depends on the distance, r, from the charge, not the direction; the lengths of the arrows represent the strength of the field. 
Example 3 	  Question: Calculate the electric field a distance of 4.0mm away from a ?2.0C charge. Then, calculate the force on a ?8.0C charge placed at this point. Answer: To calculate the electric field we will use the equation kq E = r2 Before we solve for the electric field by plugging in the values, we convert all of the values to the same units. ?2.0C= ?2.010	C Now that we have consistent units we can solve the problem. kq	9109Nm2/C2 ?2.010?6C	?1.1109N/C 
E =	=	= r2	(.004m)2 	  To solve for the force at the point we will use the equation 
F =  Eq 	  We already know all of the values so all we have to do is convert all of the values to the same units and then plug in the values. ?8.0C	 = ?8.010	C 
Fields  Due to  Several  Charges 	  To find the field at a point due to an arrangement of charges  in fact, all electric fields arise due to some arrangement of charges  we find the vector sum of the individual fields: 
E~net = ? E~i	[3]  Net  Electric  Field 	  i Electric fields are used more frequently than gravitational ones because there are two types of charge, which makes electric force and potential energy harder to keep track of than their gravitational counterparts. To apply this approach to gravitational forces  that is, to find a net gravitational field  one needs to repeat the steps above, with mass in place of charge (left for the reader). 
Example 4 	  Question: For the diagram above, draw (qualitatively) the electric field vectors at the points shown using the test charge method. Answer: We will start with Test Charge 1. Test charges are always positive and have magnitude 1. Therefore we know that the test charge will want to go toward the negative charge and away from the positive charge (like charges repel and opposite charges attract). The strength of the electric field felt by the test charge is dependent on the inverse square of the distance of the charges as shown by the equation kq E = r2 The farther away from the source of the field, the weaker the field becomes. Therefore Test Charge 1 will experience a stronger field from the 1C charge. Because the distance from Test Charge 1 to the ?1C is only slightly longer than the distance from Test Charge 1 to the 1C charge, the vectors will be similar in length. Once we have determined the relative scale of each vector, we can add them using the parallelogram method. The resultant vector is the electric field at that point. Finding the electric field at Test Charge 2 will involve all of the same steps. First we must determine which charge Test Charge 2 is closer to. Like Test Charge 1, Test Charge 2 is closer to the 1C charge. However, Test Charge 2 is drastically closer whereas Test Charge 1 was only slightly closer. Therefore, the electric field that Test Charge 2 experiences as a result of the 1C charge will be strong, thus resulting in a longer arrow. The distance between the ?1C and Test Charge 2 is large and therefore the electric field experienced by Test Charge 2 as a result of the ?1C charge will be small. The resultant vectors will look something like this. 
Electric  Potential 	  Like gravity, the electric force can do work and has a potential energy associated with it. But like we use fields to keep track of electromagnetic forces, we use electric potential, or voltage to keep track of electric potential energy. So instead of looking for the potential energy of specific objects, we define it in terms of properties of the space where the objects are. The electric potential difference, or voltage difference (often just called voltage) between two points (A and B) in the presence of an electric field is defined as the work it would take to move a positive test charge of magnitude 1 from the first point to the second against the electric force provided by the field. For any other charge q, then, the relationship between potential difference and work will be: 
 	  ?VAB =		[4] Electric Potential q Rearranging, we obtain: 
Work	 Potential  Difference 	 	 Charge 	  The potential of electric forces to do work corresponds to electric potential energy: ?UE,AB = q?VAB [5] Potential energy change due to voltage change The energy that the object gains or losses when traveling through a potential difference is supplied (or absorbed) by the electric field  there is nothing else there. Therefore, it follows that electric fields contain energy. To summarize: just as an electric field denotes force per unit charge, so electric potential differences represent potential energy differences per unit charge. A useful mnemonic is to consider a cell phone: the battery has the potential to do work for you, but it needs a charge! Actually, the analogy there is much more rigorous than it at first seems; well see why in the chapter on current. Since voltage is a quantity proportional to work it is a scalar, and can be positive or negative. 
Electric  Field of a  Parallel  Plate  Capacitor 	  Suppose we have two parallel metal plates set a distance d from one another. We place a positive charge on one of the plates and a negative charge on the other. In this configuration, there will be a uniform electric field between the plates pointing from, and normal to, the plate carrying the positive charge. The magnitude of this field is given by 
 	  E = d where V is the potential difference (voltage) between the two plates. The amount of charge, Q, held by each plate is given by 
Q = 	  where again V is the voltage difference between the plates and C is the capacitance of the plate configuration. Capacitance can be thought of as the capacity a device has for storing charge . In the parallel plate case the capacitance is given by ?0A C = d where A is the area of the plates, d is the distance between the plates, and ?0 is the permittivity of free space whose value is 8.8410?12C/V m. The electric field between the capacitor plates stores energy. The electric potential energy, UC, stored in the capacitor is given by 
C =  V2 	  Where does this energy come from? Recall, that in our preliminary discussion of electric forces we assert that like charges repel one another. To build our initial configuration we had to place an excess of positive and negative charges, respectively, on each of the metal plates. Forcing these charges together on the plate had to overcome the mutual repulsion that the charges experience; this takes work. The energy used in moving the charges onto the plates gets stored in the field between the plates. It is in this way that the capacitor can be thought of as an energy storage device. This property will become more important when we study capacitors in the context of electric circuits in the next chapter. Note: Many home-electronic circuits include capacitors; for this reason, it can be dangerous to mess around with old electronic components, as the capacitors may be charged even if the unit is unplugged. For example, old computer monitors (not flat screens) and TVs have capacitors that hold dangerous amounts of charge hours after the power is turned off. 
More on  Electric and  Gravitational  Potential 	  There are several differences between our approach to gravity and electricity that could cause confusion. First, with gravity we usually used the concept of energy, rather than energy difference. Second, we spoke about it in absolute terms, rather than per unit mass. To address the first issue: when we dealt with gravitational potential energy we had to set some reference height h = 0 where it is equal to mg0 = 0. In this sense, we were really talking about potential energy differences rather than absolute levels then also: at any point, we compared the gravitational potential energy of an object to the energy it would have had at the reference level h = 0. When we used the formula 
Ug = mg?h 	  we implicitly set the initial point as the zero: no free lunch! For the same reason, we use the concept of electric potential difference between two points  or we need to set the potential at some point to 0, and use it as a reference. This is not as easy in this case though; usually a point very far away (infinitely far) is considered to have 0 electric potential. Regarding the second issue: in the chapter on potential energy, we could have gravitational potential difference between two points at different heights as g?h. This, of course, is the work required to move an object of mass one a height ?h against gravity. To find the work required for any other mass, we would multiply this by its magnitude. In other words, 
Work|{z} |{z} Mass	 Potential  Difference|{z} 	  Which is exactly analogous to the equation above. 
Summary of  Relationships 	  The following table recaps the relationships discussed in this chapter. TABLE 12.1: Relationship between per Coulomb and absolute quantities. Property of Object. Property of Space. Combine Into: Charge (Coulombs) Field* (Newtons/Coulomb) Force (Newtons) Charge (Coulombs) Potential* (Joules/C) Potential Energy (Joules) An advanced note: for a certain class of forces called conservative forces e.g., gravity and the electromagnetic force, a specific potential distribution corresponds to a unique field. Conversely, a field corresponds to a unique potential distribution up to an additive constant. Remember though, its relative potential between points not absolute potential that is physically relevant. In effect the field corresponds to a unique potential. In particular, we see that in the case of conservative forces the scalar potential (one degree of freedom per point) carries all information needed to determine the vector electric field (three degrees of freedom per point. The potential formulation is even more useful than it at first seems. 
Key  Concepts 	  Electrons have negative charge and protons have positive charge. The magnitude of the charge is the same for both: e = 1.610?19C. In any closed system, electric charge is conserved. The total electric charge of the universe does not change. Therefore, electric charge can only be transferred not lost from one body to another. Normally, electric charge is transferred when electrons leave the outer orbits of the atoms of one body (leaving it positively charged) and move to the surface of another body (causing the new surface to gain a negative net charge). In a plasma, the fourth state of matter, all electrons are stripped from the atoms, leaving positively charged ions and free electrons. Similarly-charged objects have a repulsive force between them. Oppositely charged objects have an attractive force between them. The value of the electric field tells you the force that a charged object would feel if it entered this field. Electric field lines tell you the direction a positive charge would go if it were placed in the field. Electric potential is measured in units of Volts (V) thus electric potential is often referred to as voltage. Electric potential is the source of the electric potential energy. Positive charges move towards lower electric potential; negative charges move toward higher electric potential. If you are familiar with a contour map then positive charges go downhill and negative charges go uphill. Faraday cages consist of a metal box. All of your sensitive electronics are encased in a metal box called a Faraday cage. The Faraday cage protects everything inside from external electric fields. Basically the electrons in the metal box move around to cancel out the electric field, thus preventing it from coming inside the box and thus preventing movement of charge and possible blown out electronic chips. Cars and airplanes, being enclosed in metal, are also Faraday cages and thus the safest place to be in a lightning storm. 
Key  Applications 	  In problems that ask for excess negative or positive charge, remember that each electron has one unit of the fundamental charge e = 1.610?19C. To find the speed of a particle after it traverses a voltage difference, use the equation for the conservation of energy: q?V =mv2 Force and electric field are vectors. Use your vector math skills (i.e. keep the x and y directions separate) when solving two-dimensional problems.

R 13  Electric  Circuits:  Batteries 	  and Resistors 
The  Big  Ideas 	  The name electric current is given to the phenomenon that occurs when an electric field moves down a wire at close to the speed of light. Voltage is the electrical energy density (energy divided by charge) and differences in this density (voltage) cause electric current. Resistance is the amount a device in the wire resists the flow of current by converting electrical energy into other forms of energy. The device, called the resistor, could be a light bulb transferring electrical energy into heat and light, or an electric motor that converts electric energy into mechanical energy. The difference in energy density across a resistor or other electrical device is called voltage drop. In electric circuits (closed loops of wire with resistors and constant voltage sources) energy must be conserved. It follows that changes in energy density, the algebraic sum of voltage drops and voltage sources, around any closed loop will equal zero. In an electric junction there is more than one possible path for current to flow. For charge to be conserved at a junction the current into the junction must equal the current out of the junction. 
Key  Concepts 	  Ohms Law V = IR (Voltage drop equals current times resistance.) This is the main equation for electric circuits but it is often misused. In order to calculate the voltage drop across a light bulb use the formula: Vlightbulb = IlightbulbRlightbulb. For the total current flowing out of the power source, you need the total resistance of the circuit and the total voltage: Vtotal = ItotalRtotal. Power is the rate that energy is released. The unit for power is Watts (W), which equals Joules per second [W] = [J]/[s]. Therefore, a 60 W light bulb releases 60 Joules of energy every second. The equations used to calculate the power dissipated in a circuit is P = IV. As with Ohms Law, one must be careful not to mix apples and oranges. If you want the power of the entire circuit, then you multiply the total voltage of the power source by the total current coming out of the power source. If you want the power dissipated (i.e. released) by a light bulb, then you multiply the voltage drop across the light bulb by the current going through that light bulb.

A river of water.  Objects connected in series are all 	  on the same river, thus receive the same current. Objects connected in parallel make the main river branch into smaller rivers. These guys all have different currents. 
Examples:  Whatever you plug into your wall sockets draws current 	  Resistance (R) Ohm (?) 
If current is analogous to 	  coming out at different heights. The lower the a river, then resistance is the amount of rocks in the river. The bigger the resistance the less current that flows Examples:	Light	bulb, Toaster, etc. Resistors in Series: All resistors are connected end to end. There is only one river, so they all receive the same current. But since there is a voltage drop across each resistor, they may all have different voltages across them. The more resistors in series the more rocks in the river, so the less current that flows. Rtotal = R1 +R2 +R3 +... Resistors in Parallel: All resistors are connected together at both ends. There are many rivers (i.e. The main river branches off into many other rivers), so all resistors receive different amounts of current. But since they are all connected to the same point at both ends they all receive the same voltage. =	+	+	+... 
Rtotal	 R1	 R2	 R3 	  DC Power: Voltage and current flow in one direction. Examples are batteries and the power supplies we use in class. AC Power: Voltage and current flow in alternate directions. In the US they reverse direction 60 times a second. (This is a more efficient way to transport electricity and electrical devices do not care which way it flows as long as current is flowing. Note: your TV and computer screen are actually flickering 60 times a second due to the alternating current that comes out of household plugs. Our eyesight does not work this fast, so we never notice it. However, if you film a TV or computer screen the effect is observable due to the mismatched frame rates of the camera and TV screen.) Electrical current coming out of your wall plug is an example. Ammeter: A device that measures electric current. You must break the circuit to measure the current. Ammeters have very low resistance; therefore you must wire them in series. Voltmeter: A device that measures voltage. In order to measure a voltage difference between two points, place the probes down on the wires for the two points. Do not break the circuit. Volt meters have very high resistance; therefore you must wire them in parallel. Voltage source: A power source that produces fixed voltage regardless of what is hooked up to it. A battery is a real-life voltage source. A battery can be thought of as a perfect voltage source with a small resistor (called internal resistance) in series. The electric energy density produced by the chemistry of the battery is called emf, but the amount of voltage available from the battery is called terminal voltage. The terminal voltage equals the emf minus the voltage drop across the internal resistance (current of the external circuit times the internal resistance.) 
I = 4q/4t 	  Current is the rate at which charge passes by; the units of current are Amperes (1 A = 1 C/s). The current flow through a resistor depends on the applied electric potential difference across it; the units of resistance are Ohms (1 ? = 1 V/A). 
P =  I 4 	  The power dissipated by a resistor is the product of the current through the resistor and the applied electric potential difference across it; the units of power are Watts (1 W = 1 J/s).

The  Big  Idea 	  For static electric charges, the electromagnetic force is manifested by the Coulomb electric force alone. If charges are moving, an additional force emerges, called magnetism. The 19th century realization that electricity and magnetism are dual aspects of the same force completely changed our understanding of the world we live in. Insights due to Ampere, Gauss, and Maxwell led to the understanding that moving charges electric currents create magnetic fields. Varying magnetic fields create electric fields. Thus a loop of wire in a changing magnetic field will have current induced in it. This is called electromagnetic induction. Magnetic fields are usually denoted by the letter B and are measured in Teslas, in honor of the Serbian physicist Nikola Tesla. 
Key  Concepts 	  Magnetic fields are generated by charged particles in motion. Magnetic fields exert magnetic forces on charged particles in motion. Permanent magnets (like refrigerator magnets) consist of atoms, such as iron, for which the magnetic moments (roughly spin) of the nuclei are lined up all across the atom. This means that their magnetic fields add up, rather than canceling each other out. The net effect is noticeable because so many atoms have lined up. This means that their magnetic fields add up, rather than canceling each other out. The net effect is noticeable because so many atoms have lined up. The magnetic field of such a magnet always points from the north pole to the south. The magnetic field of a bar magnet, for example, is illustrated below: If we were to cut the magnet above in half, it would still have north and south poles; the resulting magnetic field would be qualitatively the same as the one above (but weaker). Changing magnetic fields passing through a loop of wire generate currents in that wire; this is how electric power generators work. Likewise, the changing amounts of current in a wire create a changing magnetic field; this is how speakers and electric motors work. Our world is 3 dimensional, and this includes magnetic fields. However, it is necessary to represent such three dimensional fields on a two dimensional sheet of paper. The following example illustrates how this is done. In the example above, a current is running along a wire towards the top of your page. The magnetic field is circling the wire in loops that are pierced through the center by the current. Where these loops intersect this piece of paper, we use the symbol J to represent where the magnetic field is coming out of the page and the symbol N to represent where the magnetic field is going into the page. This convention can be used for all vector quantities: fields, forces, velocities, etc. Magnetic fields have a 3-D property, requiring you to use special vector rules (called right hand rules) to figure out the directions of forces, fields, and currents. ? Right Hand Rule #1 A wire with electric current going through it produces a magnetic field going in circles around it. To find the direction of the magnetic field, point your thumb in the direction of the current. Then, curl your fingers around the wire. The direction your fingers curl tells you the direction that the magnetic field is pointing. Be sure to use your right hand! ? Right Hand Rule #2 Point your index finger along the direction of the particles velocity or the direction of the current. Your middle finger goes in the direction of the magnetic field and your thumb tells you the direction of the force. NOTE: For negative charge reverse the direction of the force (or use your left hand) 
Key  Equations and  Applications 	  FB = qvBsin? The force due to a magnetic field on a moving particle depends on the charge and speed of the particle. The angle ? is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector. The direction of the force is given by RHR #2. If a positively charged particle is moving to the right, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it feels a force going out of the page. Use this figure to remember the geometry of the angle ?. If a positively charged particle is moving to the left, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it feels a force going into the page. Fwire = LIBsin(?) A current-carrying wire is made up of a whole bunch of individually moving charges. Thus this wire will feel a force. In this equation, L refers to the length of the wire, B to the magnetic field strength and the angle ? is the angle between the direction of the current and the direction of the magnetic field. The direction of the force is given by RHR #2 as explained above. Permeability of Vacuum (also approximately the same for air) The magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire depends on the strength of the current and the distance from the wire. In the example to the left, a current is running along a wire towards the top of your page. The magnetic field is circling the wire in loops that are pierced through the center by the current. Where these loops intersect this piece of paper, we use the symbol J to represent where the magnetic field is coming out of the pageand the symbol N to represent where the magnetic field is going into the page. The distance r (for radius) is the distance from the wire. Two current-carrying wires next to each other each exert magnetic fields and thereby forces on each other. ? = NBA If you have a closed, looped wire of area A (measured in m2) and N loops, and you pass a magnetic field B through, the magnetic flux is ?. The units of magnetic flux are T m2, also known as a Weber(Wb). In the example to the left, there are four loops of wire (N = 4) and each has area ?r2. The magnetic field is pointing toward the top of the page, at a right angle to the loops. Think of the magnetic flux as the bundle of magnetic field lines held by the loop. Why does it matter? See the next equation ?? emf = ? ?t The direction of the induced current is determined as follows: the current will flow so as to generate a magnetic field that opposes the change in flux. This is called Lenzs Law. If you change the amount of magnetic flux that is passing through a loop of wire, electrons in the wire will feel a force (called the electromotive force), and this will generate a current. The equivalent voltage (emf) that they feel is equal to the change in flux 4? divided by the amount of time 4t it takes to change the flux by that amount. This is Faradays Law of Induction. The relative direction of the loops and the field matter; this relationship is preserved by creating an area vector: a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. The directions influence can then be conveniently captured through a dot product: ? = N~B~A	Electromagnetic Flux The units of magnetic flux are Tm2, also known as Webers(Wb). In the example above, there are four loops of wire (N = 4) and each has area ?r2 (horizontally hashed). The magnetic field is pointing at an angle ? to the area vector. If the magnetic field has magnitude B, the flux through the loops will equal 4cos(?)B?r2. Think of the magnetic flux as the part of the bundle of magnetic field lines held by the loop that points along the area vector. If the magnetic flux through a loop or loops changes, electrons in the wire will feel a force, and this will generate a current. The induced voltage (also called electromotive force, or emf) that they feel is equal to the change in flux 4? divided by the amount of time 4t that change took. This relationship is called Faradays Law of Induction: ?? emf = ?		Faradays Law of Induction ?t The direction of the induced current is determined as follows: the current will flow so as to generate a magnetic field that opposes the change in flux. This is called Lenzs Law. Note that the electromotive force described above is not actually a force, since it is measured in Volts and acts like an induced potential difference. It was originally called that since it caused charged particles to move  hence electromotive  and the name stuck (its somewhat analogous to calling an increase in a particles gravitational potential energy difference a gravitomotive force). Since only a changing flux can produce an induced potential difference, one or more of the variables in equation [5] must be changing if the ammeter in the picture above is to register any current. Specifically, the following can all induce a current in the loops of wire: Changing the direction or magnitude of the magnetic field. Changing the loops orientation or area. Moving the loops out of the region with the magnetic field. 
Example 1:  Find the  Magnetic  Field 	  Question: An electron is moving to the east at a speed of 1.8106 m/s. It feels a force in the upward direction with a magnitude of 2.2  10?12 N. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field this electron just passed through? Answer: There are two parts to this question, the magnitude of the electric field and the direction. We will first focus on the magnitude. 
To find the magnitude we will use the equation 	  FB = qvBsin? We were given the force of the magnetic field (2.2  10?12 N) and the velocity that the electron is traveling (1.8  106 m/s). We also know the charge of the electron (1.6  10?19 C). Also, because the electrons velocity is perpendicular to the field, we do not have to deal with sin? because sin? of 90 degrees is 1. Therefore all we have to do is solve for B and plug in the known values to get the answer. FB = qvBsin? Solving for B: 
 	  B = qvsin? 
B = qvsin? = 1.610?19  C1.8106 m/s1 = 7.6  	  Now we will find the direction of the field. We know the direction of the velocity (east) and the direction of the force due to the magnetic field (up, out of the page). Therefore we can use the second right hand rule (we will use the left hand, since an electrons charge is negative). Point the pointer finger to the right to represent the velocity and the thumb up to represent the force. This forces the middle finger, which represents the direction of the magnetic field, to point south. Alternatively, we could recognize that this situation is illustrated for a positive particle in the right half of the drawing above; for a negative particle to experience the same force, the field has to point in the opposite direction: south. 
Example 2:  Circular  Motion in  Magnetic  Fields 	  Consider the following problem: a positively charged particle with an initial velocity of, charge q and mass m traveling in the plane of this page enters a region with a constant magnetic field ~B pointing into the page. We are interested in finding the trajectory of this particle. Since the force on a charged particle in a magnetic field is always perpendicular to both its velocity vector and the field vector (check this using the second right hand rule above), a constant magnetic field will provide a centripetal force  that is, a constant force that is always directed perpendicular to the direction of motion. Two such force/velocity combinations are illustrated above. According to our study of rotational motion, this implies that as long as the particle does not leave the region of the magnetic field, it will travel in a circle. To find the radius of the circle, we set the magnitude of the centripetal force equal to the magnitude of the magnetic force and solve for r: mv2 
Fc =	 =  B = qv Bsin? = qv 	  r Therefore, mv2 r = qvB In the examples above, ? was conveniently 90 degrees, which made sin? = 1. But that does not really matter; in a constant magnetic fields a different ? will simply decrease the force by a constant factor and will not change the qualitative behavior of the particle, since ? cannot change due to such a magnetic force. (Why? Hint: what is the force perpendicular to? Read the paragraph above.)

The  Big  Idea 	  When current flows through wires and resistors in a circuit as a result of a difference in electric potential, charge does not build up significantly anywhere on its path. Capacitors are devices placed in electric circuits where charge can build up. The amount of charge a capacitor can store before it fills up depends on its geometry and how much electric potential is applied. The ratio of charge stored in a capacitor to the voltage applied is called its capacitance, measured in Farads (F). The larger the electric potential in volts, the stronger the electric field that is used to cram the charge into the device. Any capacitor will fill up with enough charge and voltage. Capacitors store energy when charged, and release it when they discharge.

Electric  Circuit  Symbol 	  The symbol for a capacitor is two flat plates, mimicking the geometry of a capacitor, which typically consists of two flat plates separated by a small distance. The plates are normally wrapped around several times to form a cylindrical shape. 
Key  Concepts 	  Current can flow into a capacitor from either side, but current doesnt flow across the capacitor from one plate to another. The plates do not touch, and the substance in between is insulating, not conducting. One side of the capacitor fills up with negative charge, and the other fills up with positive charge. The reason for the thin, close plates is so that you can use the negative charge on one plate to attract and hold the positive charge on the other plate. The reason for the plates with large areas is so that you can spread out the charge on one plate so that its self-repulsion doesnt stop you from filling it with more charge. Capacitors wired in series all contain the same amount of charge (they have to because the opposite plates of the different capacitors are directly connected. However, they have different voltages. Capacitors wired in parallel all have the same voltage (they have to because all the positive plates are directly connected together and all the negative plates are directly connected together. However, they do have different charge. Typical dielectric constants ? are roughly 5.6 for glass and 80 for water. What these dielectric substances do is align their electric polarity with the electric field in a capacitor (much like atoms in a magnetic material) and, in doing so, reduces the electric field for a given amount of charge. Thereby allowing for more charge to be stored for a given voltage. When a capacitor is initially uncharged, it is very easy to stuff charge in. As charge builds, it repels new charge with more and more force. Due to this effect, the charging of a capacitor follows a logarithmic curve. When you pass current through a resistor into a capacitor, the capacitor eventually fills up and no more current flows. A typical RC circuit is shown below; when the switch is closed, the capacitor discharges with an exponentially decreasing current. Q refers to the amount of positive charge stored on the high voltage side of the capacitor; an equal and opposite amount, ?Q, of negative charge is stored on the low voltage side of the capacitor. Many home-electronic circuits include capacitors; for this reason, it can be dangerous to mess around with old electronic components, as the capacitors may be charged even if the unit is unplugged. For example, old computer monitors (not flat screens) and TVs have capacitors that hold dangerous amounts of charge hours after the power is turned off. When solving capacitor circuits remember that connected points have the same potential. Also remember that charge must be conserved. So if the capacitor(s) are disconnected from a power supply, the total charge must remain the same.

The  Big  Idea 	  Modern circuitry depends on much more than just resistors and capacitors. The circuits in your computer, cell phone, and iPod depend on circuit elements called diodes, inductors, transistors, and operational amplifiers, as well as on other chips. In particular the invention of the transistor made the small size of modern devices possible. Transistors and op amps are known as active circuit elements. An active circuit element needs an external source of power to operate. This differentiates them from diodes, capacitors, inductors and resistors, which are passive elements. 
Key  Concepts 	  Inductors are made from coiled wires, normally wrapped around ferromagnetic material and operate according to the principles of magnetic induction presented in Magnetism. Inductors generate a back-emf. Back-emf is essentially an induced negative voltage which opposes changes in current. The amount of back-emf generated is proportional to how quickly the current changes. They can be thought of as automatic flow regulators that oppose any change in current. Thus electrical engineers call them chokes. In a circuit diagram, an inductor looks like a coil. The resistance R and capacitance C of an inductor are very close to zero. When analyzing a circuit diagram, assume R and C are precisely zero. Diodes are passive circuit elements that act like one-way gates. Diodes allow current to flow one way, but not the other. For example, a diode that turns on at 0.6 V acts as follows: if the voltage drop across the diode is less than 0.6 V, no current will flow. Above 0.6 V, current flows with essentially no resistance. If the voltage drop is negative (and not extremely large), no current will flow. Diodes have an arrow showing the direction of the flow. Transistors are active circuit elements that act like control gates for the flow of current. Although there are many types of transistors, lets consider just one kind for now. This type of transistor has three electrical leads: the base, the emitter, and the collector. The voltage applied to the base controls the amount of current which flows from the emitter to the collector. For example, if the base voltage is more than 0.8 V above the collector voltage, then current can freely flow from the emitter to the collector, as if it were just a wire. If the base voltage is less than 0.8 V above the collector voltage, then current does not flow from the emitter to the collector. Thus the transistor acts as a switch. (This 0.8 V is known as a diode drop and varies from transistor to transistor.) Transistors have an infinite output resistance. If you measure the resistance between the collector and the base (or between the emitter and the base), it will be extremely high. Essentially no current flows into the base from either the collector or the emitter; any current, if it flows, flows from the emitter to the collector. Transistors are used in amplifier circuits, which take an input voltage and magnify it by a large factor. Amplifiers typically run on the principle of positive and negative feedback. Feedback occurs when a small portion of an output voltage is used to influence the input voltage. TABLE 16.1:

Light-emitting 	  diodes (LEDs) An operational amplifier or op-amp is an active circuit element that performs a specific function. The most common op-amp has five leads: two input leads, one output lead, and two fixed-voltage leads. The job of an op-amp is to use the voltage it is supplied to adjust its output voltage. The op-amp will adjust its output voltage until the two input voltages are brought closer together. In other words, the output voltage will change as it needs to until VA ?VB = 0. This wont happen unless the output voltage is somehow fed back into one of the inputs Digital circuits only care about two voltages: for example, +5 V (known as on) and 0 V (known as off). Logic devices, which are active circuit elements, interpret voltages according to a simple set of mathematical rules known as Boolean logic. The most basic logic devices are the AND, OR, and NOT gates: For an AND gate, the output will always be at an electric potential of 0 V (off) unless both the inputs are at 5 V (on), in which case the output will be at 5 V (on) as well. For an OR gate, the output will always be at an electric potential of 0 V (off) unless either of the inputs are at 5 V (on), in which case the output will be at 5 V (on) as well. For a NOT gate, the output will always be the opposite of the input. Thus, if the input is 5 V (on), the output will be 0 V (off) and vice-versa. Alternating current changes direction of current flow. The frequency is the number of times the current reverses direction in a second. Household AC is 60 Hz. In AC circuits the current is impeded but not stopped by elements like capacitors and inductors. Capacitive Reactance is a measure of how a capacitor impedes the current flow from a given voltage in an AC circuit and is inversely proportional to capacitance. Inductive Reactance is a measure of how an inductor in an AC circuit impedes the current flow from a given voltage and is directly proportional to inductance. The total impedance of an AC circuit depends on resistance, capacitive reactance and inductive reactance. If the capacitive reactance and inductive reactance are both zero or unequal the voltage and current are out of phase. That is they peak at different times in the cycle. The phase angle measures the lag or lead of current over voltage.

The  Big  Idea 	  Light is a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields. Light waves are caused by disturbances in an electromagnetic field, like the acceleration of charged particles (such as electrons). Light has a dual nature; at times, it acts like waves, while at other times it acts like particles, called photons. Light travels through space at the maximum speed allowed by the laws of physics, called the speed of light. Light has no mass, but it carries energy and momentum. Fermats principle states that light will always take the path that takes the least amount of time (not distance). Fermats Principle governs the paths light will take and explains the familiar phenomena of reflection, refraction, diffraction, scattering and color absorption and dispersion. Light rarely travels in a straight line path. When photons interact with electrons in matter, the time it takes for this interaction determines the path. For example, higher frequency blue light is refracted more than red because blue interacts more frequently with electrons. Also, the path of least time is achieved when blue light bends more than red light so that it gets out of the slow region faster. Fermats Principle explains the many fascinating phenomena of light from rainbows to sunsets to the halos around the moon. 
Key  Concepts 	  When charged particles accelerate, changing electric and magnetic fields radiate outward. The traveling electric and magnetic fields of an accelerating (often oscillating) charged particle are known as electromagnetic radiation or light. The color of light that we observe is a measure of the wavelength of the light: the longer the wavelength, the redder the light. The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation can be roughly broken into the following ranges: TABLE 17.1: 
Comparison size 	  gamma-ray (?? ray) atomic nucleus x?ray hydrogen atom ultraviolet (UV) small molecule violet (visible) ? 410?7 m(400 nm)? typical molecule blue (visible) ? 450 nm typical molecule green (visible) ? 500 nm typical molecule red (visible) ? 650 nm typical molecule infrared (IR) human hair microwave human finger radio 
Larger than 10 cm 	  car antenna Light can have any wavelength. Our vision is restricted to a very narrow range of colors between red and violet. Fermats Principle makes the angle of incident light equal to the angle of reflected light. This is the law of reflection. When light travels from one type of material (like air) into another (like glass), its speed is reduced due to interactions between photons and electrons. If the ray enters the material at an angle, Fermats Principle dictates that the light will change the direction of its motion. This is called refraction. The figure to the right demonstrates the refraction a light ray experiences as it passes from air into a rectangular piece of glass and out again. Because light travels at slower than usual speed in transparent materials (due to constantly being absorbed and re-emitted), this means that light doesnt always travel in a straight line. White light consists of a mixture of all the visible colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (ROYGBIV). Our perception of the color black is tied to the absence of light. Our eyes include color-sensitive and brightness-sensitive cells. The three different color-sensitive cells (cones) can have sensitivity in three colors: red, blue, and green. Our perception of other colors is made from the relative amounts of each color that the cones register from light reflected from the object we are looking at. Our brightness-sensitive cells work well in low light. This is why things look black and white at night. The chemical bonds in pigments and dyes like those in a colorful shirt absorb light at frequencies that correspond to certain colors. When you shine white light on these pigments and dyes, some colors are absorbed and some colors are reflected. We only see the colors objects reflect.

Key  Applications 	  Total internal reflection occurs when light goes from a slow (high index of refraction) medium to a fast (low index of refraction) medium. With total internal reflection, light refracts so much it actually refracts back into the first medium. This is how fiber optic cables work: no light leaves the wire. Rayleigh scattering occurs when light interacts with our atmosphere. The shorter the wavelength of light, the more strongly it is disturbed by collisions with atmospheric molecules. Accordingly, blue light from the Sun is preferentially scattered by these collisions into our line of sight. This is why the sky appears blue. Beautiful sunsets are another manifestation of Rayleigh scattering that occurs when light travels long distances through the atmosphere. The blue light and some green is scattered away, making the sun appear red. Lenses, made from curved pieces of glass, focus or de-focus light as it passes through. Lenses that focus light are called converging lenses, and these are the ones used to make telescopes and cameras. Lenses that de-focus light are called diverging lenses. Lenses can be used to make visual representations, called images. Mirrors are made from highly reflective metal that is applied to a curved or flat piece of glass. Converging mirrors can be used to focus light headlights, telescopes, satellite TV receivers, and solar cookers all rely on this principle. Like lenses, mirrors can create images. The focal length, f , of a lens or mirror is the distance from the surface of the lens or mirror to the place where the light is focused. This is called the focal point or focus. For diverging lenses or mirrors, the focal length is negative. When light rays converge in front of a mirror or behind a lens, a real image is formed. Real images are useful in that you can place photographic film at the physical location of the real image, expose the film to the light, and make a two-dimensional representation of the world, a photograph. When light rays diverge in front of a mirror or behind a lens, a virtual image is formed. A virtual image is a manifestation of your brain (it traces the diverging rays backwards and forms an image), like the person you see behind a mirrors surface when you brush your teeth (theres obviously no real light focused behind a mirror!). Since virtual images arent actually anywhere, you cant place photographic film anywhere to capture them. Real images are upside-down, or inverted. You can make a real image of an object by putting it farther from a mirror or lens than the focal length. Virtual images are typically right-side-up. You can make virtual images by moving the mirror or lens closer to the object than the focal length. Waves are characterized by their ability to constructively and destructively interfere. Light waves which interfere with themselves after interaction with a small aperture or target are said to diffract. Light creates interference patterns when passing through holes (slits) in an obstruction such as paper or the surface of a CD, or when passing through a thin film such as soap. Light of different frequencies traverse materials at slightly different speeds. Thus, they refract at slightly different angles when going through a material. This explains why white light is separated into its individual frequencies forming a rainbow. This fact combined with refraction and the perspective of the viewer combines to explain how rainbows are formed. 
Key  Equations 	  ?f = c The product of the wavelength ? of the light (in meters) and the frequency f of the light (in Hz, or 1/sec) is always equal to a constant, namely the speed of light c = 300,000,000 m/s. c n = u The index of refraction, n, is the ratio of its speed (c) in a vacuum to the slower speed (u) it travels in a material. n can depend slightly on wavelength. ni sin?i = nf sin?f m? = d sin? Double slit interference maxima. m is the order of the interference maximum in question, d is the distance between slits. and ? is the angular position of the maximum. m? = d sin? Single slit interference maxima. m and ? are defined as above and d is the width of the slit. m? = d sin? Diffraction grating interference maxima. m and ? are defined as above and d is the distance between the lines on the grating. m? = 2nd Thin film interference: n is the index of refraction of the film, d is the thickness of the film, and m is an integer. In the film interference, there is a ?/2 delay (phase change) if the light is reflected from an object with an index of refraction greater than that of the incident material. =	+ f	d0	di For lenses, the distance from the center of the lens to the focus is f . Focal lengths for foci behind the lens are positive in sign. The distance from the center of the lens to the object in question is d0, where distances to the left of the lens are positive in sign. The distance from the center of the lens to the image is di. This number is positive for real images (formed to the right of the lens), and negative for virtual images (formed to the left of the lens). For mirrors, the same equation holds! However, the object and image distances are both positive for real images formed to the left of the mirror. For virtual images formed to the right of the mirror, the image distance is negative ?di M = d0 The size of an objects image is larger (or smaller) than the object itself by its magnification, M. The level of magnification is proportional to the ratio of di and do. An image that is double the size of the object would have magnification M = 2.

In the following five problems, you will do a careful ray tracing with a ruler (including the extrapolation of rays for virtual images). It is best if you can use different colors for the three different ray tracings.

The  Big  Idea 	  In studying fluids we apply the concepts of force, momentum, and energy which we have learned previously to new phenomena. Since fluids are made from a large number of individual molecules, we have to look at their behavior as an ensemble and not individually. For this reason, we use the concept of conservation of energy density in place of conservation of energy. Energy density is energy divided by volume. 
Key  Concepts 	  The pressure of a fluid is a measure of the forces exerted by a large number of molecules when they collide and bounce off its boundary. The unit of pressure is the Pascal (Pa). Mass density represents the amount of mass in a given volume. We also speak of fluids as having gravitational potential energy density, kinetic energy density, and momentum density. These represent the amount of energy or momentum possessed by a given volume of fluid. If we multiply these quantities by a volume, they will be completely identical to their versions from earlier chapters. Pressure and energy density have the same units: 1 Pa = 1 N/m2 = 1 J/m3. The pressure of a fluid can be thought of as an arbitrary level of energy density. For static fluids and fluids flowing in a steady state all locations in the connected fluid system must have the same total energy density. This means that the algebraic sum of pressure, kinetic energy density and gravitational energy density equals zero. Changes in fluid pressure must be equal to changes in energy density (kinetic and/or gravitational). Liquids obey a continuity equation which is based on the fact that liquids are very difficult to compress. This means that the total volume of a fluid will remain constant in most situations. Imagine trying to compress a filled water balloon! The specific gravity of an object is the ratio of the density of that object to the density of water. Objects with specific gravities greater than 1.0 ( i.e., greater than water) will sink in water; otherwise, they will float. The density of fresh water is 1000 kg/m3.

Pressure is force per unit area 	  ??Fbuoy = ?watergVdisplaced	Archimedes principle 
Key  Applications 	  In a fluid at rest, pressure increases linearly with depth this is due to the weight of the water above it. Archimedes Principle states that the upward buoyant force on an object in the water is equal to the weight of the displaced volume of water. The reason for this upward force is that the bottom of the object is at lower depth, and therefore higher pressure, than the top. If an object has a higher density than the density of water, the weight of the displaced volume will be less than the objects weight, and the object will sink. Otherwise, the object will float. Pascals Principle reminds us that, for a fluid of uniform pressure, the force exerted on a small area in contact with the fluid will be smaller than the force exerted on a large area. Thus, a small force applied to a small area in a fluid can create a large force on a larger area. This is the principle behind hydraulic machinery. Bernoullis Principle is a restatement of the conservation of energy, but for fluids. The sum of pressure, kinetic energy density, and gravitational potential energy density is conserved. In other words, ?P+?k+?ug equals zero. One consequence of this is that a fluid moving at higher speed will exhibit a lower pressure, and vice versa. There are a number of common applications for this: when you turn on your shower, the moving water and air reduce the pressure in the shower stall, and the shower curtain is pulled inward; when a strong wind blows outside your house, the pressure decreases, and your shutters are blown open; due to the flaps on airplane wings, the speed of the air below the wing is lower than above the wing, which means the pressure below the wing is higher, and provides extra lift for the plane during landing. There are many more examples. Conservation of flux, ?, means that a smaller fluid-carrying pipe requires a faster moving fluid. Bernoullis Principle, which says that fast-moving fluids have low pressure, provides a useful result: pressure in a smaller pipe must be lower than pressure in a larger pipe. If the fluid is not in a steady state, energy can be lost in fluid flow. The loss of energy is related to viscosity, or deviation from smooth flow. Viscosity is related to turbulence, the tendency of fluids to become chaotic in their motion. In a high viscosity fluid, energy is lost from a fluid in a way that is quite analogous to energy loss due to current flow through a resistor. A pump can add energy to a fluid system also. The full Bernoulli Equation takes these two factors, viscosity and pumps, into account.

The  Big  Ideas 	  Heat is a form of energy transfer. It can change the kinetic energy of a substance. For example, the average molecular kinetic energy of gas molecules is related to temperature. A heat engine turns a portion of the input heat (thermal energy) into mechanical work. A second portion of the input heat must be exhausted in order for the engine to have repetitive motion. Therefore, in a practical engine it is impossible for all the input heat to be converted to work. Entropy is a measure of disorder, or the variety of ways in which a system can organize itself with the same total energy. The entropy of any isolated system always tends to disorder (i.e. entropy is always increasing). In the universe, the entropy of a subset (like evolution on Earth) can decrease (i.e. more order) but the total entropy of the universe is increasing (i.e. more disorder). Thermodynamics is the study of heat engines. Any engine or power plant obeys the laws of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics is a statement of conservation of energy. Total energy, including heat, is conserved in any process and in the complete cycle of a heat engine. The second law of thermodynamics as it applies to heat engines gives an absolute limit on the efficiency of any heat engine that goes through repetitious cycles. 
Key  Concepts 	  The temperature of a gas is a measure of the amount of average kinetic energy that the atoms in the gas possess. The pressure of a gas is the force the gas exerts on a certain area. For a gas in a container, the amount of pressure is directly related to the number and intensity of atomic collisions on a container wall. An ideal gas is a gas for which interactions between molecules are negligible, and for which the gas atoms or molecules themselves store no potential energy. For an ideal gas, the pressure, temperature, and volume are simply related by the ideal gas law. Atmospheric pressure (1 atm = 101,000 Pascals) is the pressure we feel at sea level due to the weight of the atmosphere above us. As we rise in elevation, there is less of an atmosphere to push down on us and thus less pressure. When gas pressure-forces are used to move an object then work is done on the object by the expanding gas. Work can be done on the gas in order to compress it. Adiabatic process: a process that occurs with no heat gain or loss to the system in question. Isothermal: a process that occurs at constant temperature (i.e. the temperature does not change during the process). Isobaric: a process that occurs at constant pressure. Isochoric: a process that occurs at constant volume. If you plot pressure on the vertical axis and volume on the horizontal axis, the work done in any complete cycle is the area enclosed by the graph. For a partial process, work is the area underneath the curve, orP?V. In a practical heat engine, the change in internal energy must be zero over a complete cycle. Therefore, over a complete cycle W = ?Q. The work done by a gas during a portion of a cycle = P?V, note ?Vcan be positive or negative. 
The efficiency of any heat engine : ? = W/ Qin 	  An ideal engine, the most efficient theoretically possible, is called a Carnot Engine. Its efficiency is given by the following formula, where the temperatures are, respectively, the temperature of the exhaust environment and the temperature of the heat input, in Kelvins. In a Carnot engine heat is input and exhausted in isothermal cycles, and the efficiency is ? = 1?

Q = mL ; the heat lost or gained by a substance due to a change in phase is equal to the mass of the substance multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization/fusion (L refers to the latent heat) 
Qin =  Qout + W +? 	  U is the internal energy of the gas. (This is the first law of Thermodynamics and applies to all heat engines.) kT avg The average kinetic energy of atoms (each of mass m and average speed v) in a gas is related to the temperature T of the gas, measured in Kelvin.

Molecular  Kinetic  Theory of a  Monatomic  Ideal  Gas 	  The empirical combined gas law is simply a generalization of observed relationships. Using kinetic theory, it is possible to derive it from the principles of Newtonian mechanics. Previously, we thought of an ideal gas as one that obeys the combined gas law exactly. Within the current model, however, we can give a specific definition. We treat a monatomic ideal gas as a system of an extremely large number of very small particles in random motion that collide elastically between themselves and the walls of their container, where there are no interaction between particles other than collisions. Consider some amount (n atoms) of such a gas in a cubical container with side length L. Lets trace the path of a single gas atom as it collides with the walls: The path of a single gas atom as it undergoes collisions with the walls of its container Further, lets restrict ourselves to considering the motion of the particle along the x axis, and its collisions with the right y?z wall, as shown in the picture. Therefore, we only consider vx the component of the velocity vector perpendicular to the y?z wall. If the particles mass is m, in one collision, the particles momentum in the x direction changes by ?p = 2mvx Also, since it has to travel a distance 2L (back and forth, basically) in the x direction between collisions with the right y?z wall, the time ?t between collisions will be ?t =	. vx According to Newtons second law, the force imparted by the single particle on the wall is Illustration x-direction atom from above. ?p	vx	mvx2 
F =	= 2mvx 	  ?	L Now, since there are n (a very large number) atoms present, the net force imparted on the wall will be m(vx2)avg 
Fnet = n  	  Where the vx2 is averaged over all n atoms. Now let us attempt to relate this to the state variables we considered last chapter. Recall that pressure is defined as force per unit area: F P = 
 	  Since the area of the wall in question is L2, the pressure exerted by the gas atoms on it will equal: 
Pnet =  A = n  L2	= n	 L3 	  Since, for a cubical box, volume V = L3, the formula above can be reduced to: m(vx2)avg Pnet = n	 or, 
Pnet V = nm(vx2)avg	[1] 	  By the Pythagorean theorem, any three-dimensional velocity vector has the following property: v2 = vx2 +vy2 +vz2 Averaging this for the n particles in the box, we get (v2)avg = (vx2)avg +(vy2)avg +(vz2)avg Since the motions of the particles are completely random (as stated in our assumptions), it follows that the averages of the squares of the velocity components should be equal: there is no reason the gas particles would prefer to travel in the x direction over any other. In other words, (vx2)avg = (vy2)avg = (vz2)avg Plugging this into the average equation above, we find: (v2)avg = 3(vx2)avg = 3(vy2)avg = 3(vz2)avg and (v2)avg/3 = (vx2)avg Plugging this into equation [1], we get: nm(v2)avg 
Pnet V =		[2] 	  The left side of the equation should look familiar; this quantity is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the gas, since 
Eavg = m(v2)avg 	  Therefore, we have: 
Pnet V = n( E)avg	[3] 	  This is a very important result in kinetic theory, since it expresses the product of two state variables, or system parameters, pressure and volume, in terms of an average over the microscopic constituents of the system. Recall the empirical ideal gas law from last chapter: 
V = nk 	  The left side of this is identical to the left side of equation [3], whereas the only variable on the right side is temperature. By setting the left sides equal, we find: n(KE)avg = nkT or 
T =	( E)avg 	  Therefore, according to the kinetic theory of an monoatomic ideal gas, the quantity we called temperature is  up to a constant coefficient  a direct measure of the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the gas. This definition of temperature is much more specific and it is based essentially on Newtonian mechanics. 
Temperature,  Again 	  Now that we have defined temperature for a monoatomic gas, a relevant question is: can we extend this definition to other substances? It turns out that yes, we can, but with a significant caveat. In fact, according to classical kinetic theory, temperature is always proportional to the average kinetic energy of molecules in a substance. The constant of proportionality, however, is not always the same. Consider: the only way to increase the kinetic energies of the atoms in a monoatomic gas is to increase their translational velocities. Accordingly, we assumed above that the kinetic energies of such atoms are stored equally in the three components (x,y, and z) of their velocities. On the other hand, diatomic gases consist of two atoms connected by a bond. The two atoms and bond can be modeled as a spring or a harmonic oscillator. Now, a single molecules kinetic energy can be increased either by increasing its speed, by making it vibrate in simple harmonic motion, or by making it rotate around its center of mass. This difference is understood in physics through the concept of degrees of freedom: each degree of freedom for a molecule or particle corresponds to a possibility of increasing its kinetic energy independently of the kinetic energy in other degrees. It might seem to you that monatomic gases should have one degree of freedom: their velocity. They have three because their velocity can be altered in one of three mutually perpendicular directions without changing the kinetic energy in other two  just like a centripetal force does not change the kinetic energy of an object, since it is always perpendicular to its velocity. These are called translational degrees of freedom. Diatomic gas molecules, on the other hand have more: the three translational degrees explained above still exist, but there are now also vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Monatomic and diatomic degrees of freedom can be illustrated like this: Temperature is an average of kinetic energy over degrees of freedom, not a sum. Lets try to understand why this is in reference to our monoatomic ideal gas. In the derivation above, volume was constant; so, temperature was essentially proportional to pressure, which in turn was proportional to the kinetic energy due to translational motion of the molecules. If the molecules had been able to rotate as well as move around the box, they could have had the same kinetic energy with slower translational velocities, and, therefore, lower temperature. In other words, in that case, or assumption that the kinetic energy of the atoms only depends on their velocities, implied between equations [2] and [3], would not have held. Therefore, the number of degrees of freedom in a substance determines the proportionality between molecular kinetic energy and temperature: the more degrees of freedom, the more difficult it will be to raise its temperature with a given energy input. In solids, degrees of freedom are usually entirely vibrational; in liquids, the situation becomes more complicated. We will not attempt to derive results about these substances, however. A note about the above discussion: since the objects at the basis of our understanding of thermodynamics are atoms and molecules, quantum effects can make certain degrees of freedom inaccessible at specific temperature ranges. Unlike most cases in your current physics class, where these can be ignored, in this case, quantum effects can make an appreciable difference. For instance, the vibrational degrees of freedom of diatomic gas molecules discussed above are, for many gases, inaccessible in very common conditions, although we do not have the means to explain this within our theory. In fact, this was one of the first major failures of classical physics that ushered in the revolutionary discoveries of the early 20th century. 
Thermal  Energy 	  In light of the above derivation, it should not surprise you that the kinetic energy from motion of molecules contributes to what is called the thermal energy of a substance. This type of energy is called sensible energy. In ideal gases, this is the only kind of thermal energy present. Solids and liquids also have a different type of thermal energy as well, called Latent Energy, which is associated with potential energy of their intermolecular bonds in that specific phase  for example the energy it takes to break the bonds between water molecules in melting ice (remember, we assumed molecules do not interact in the ideal gas approximation). To recap, there are two types of Thermal Energy: The kinetic energy from the random motion of the molecules or atoms of the substance, called Sensible Energy The intermolecular potential energy associated with changes in the phase of a system (called Latent Energy). 
Heat 	  The term heat is formally defined as a transfer of thermal energy between substances. Note that heat is not the same as thermal energy. Before the concept of thermal energy, physicists sometimes referred to the heat energy of a substance, that is, the energy it received from actual heating (heating here can be understood as it is defined above, though for these early physicists and chemists it was a more common sense idea of heating: think beaker over Bunsen burner). The idea was then to try to explain thermodynamic phenomena through this concept. The problem with this approach is that thermal energy is the most fundamental to the science, and heating is not the only way to change the thermal energy of a substance. For example, if you rub your palms together, you increase the thermal energy of both palms. Once heat (a transfer of thermal energy) is absorbed by a substance, it becomes indistinguishable from the thermal energy already present: what methods achieved that level of thermal energy is no longer relevant. In other words, to heat is a well defined concept as a verb: its use automatically implies some kind of transfer. When heat using as a noun, one needs to be realize that it must refer to this transfer also, not something that can exist independently. 
Specific  Heat  Capacity and  Specific  Latent  Heat 	  The ideas in the paragraphs above can be understood better through the concept of specific heat capacity (or specific heat for short), which relates an increase in temperature of some mass of a substance to the amount of heat required to achieve it. In other words, for any substance, it relates thermal energy transfers to changes in temperature. It has units of Joules per kilogram Kelvin. Here is how we can define and apply specific heat (Q refers to heat supplied, m to the mass of the substance and c to its specific heat capacity): 
Q = cm? T	[2] 	  Heat capacity is largely determined by the number of degrees of freedom of the molecules in a substance (why?). However, it also depends on other parameters, such as pressure. Therefore, the formula above implicitly assumes that these external parameters are held constant (otherwise we wouldnt know if were measuring a change in specific heat is real or due to a change in pressure). When a substance undergoes a phase change, its temperature does not change as it absorbs heat. We referred to this as an increase or decrease in latent energy earlier. In this case, the relevant question is how much heat energy does it require to change a unit mass of the substance from one phase to another? This ratio is known as latent heat, and is related to heat by the following equation (L refers to the latent heat): 
Q =  Lm	[3] 	  During a phase change, the number of degrees of freedom changes, and so does the specific heat capacity. Heat capacity can also depend on temperature within a given phase, but many substances, under constant pressure, exhibit a constant specific heat over a wide range of temperatures. For instance, look at the graph of temperature vs heat input for a mole (6.0221415  1023 molecules) of water at URL changes.png . Note that the x-axis of the graph is called relative heat energy because it takes a mole of water at 0 degrees Celsius as the reference point. The sloped segments on the graph represent increases in temperature. These are governed by equation [1]. The flat segments represent phase transitions, governed by equation [2]. Notice that the sloped segments have constant, though different, slopes. According to equation [1], the heat capacity at any particular phase would be the slope of the segment that corresponds to that phase on the graph. The fact that the slopes are constant means that, within a particular phase, the heat capacity does not change significantly as a function of temperature.

Entropy 	  The last major concept we are going to introduce in this chapter is entropy. We noted earlier that temperature is determined not just by how much thermal energy is present in a substance, but also how it can be distributed. Substances whose molecules have more degrees of freedom will generally require more thermal energy for an equal temperature increase than those whose molecules have fewer degrees of freedom. Entropy is very much related to this idea: it quantifies how the energy actually is distributed among the degrees of freedom available. In other words, it is a measure of disorder in a system. An example may illustrate this point. Consider a monatomic gas with N atoms (for any appreciable amount of gas, this number will be astronomical). It has 3N degrees of freedom. For any given value of thermal energy, there is a plethora of ways to distribute the energy among these. At one extreme, it could all be concentrated in the kinetic energy of a single atom. On the other, it could be distributed among them all. According to the discussion so far, these systems would have the same temperature and thermal energy. Clearly, they are not identical, however. This difference is quantified by entropy: the more evenly distributed the energy, the higher the entropy of the system. Here is an illustration: 
The  Laws of  Thermodynamics 	  Now that we have defined the terms that are important for an understanding of thermodynamics, we can state the laws that govern relevant behavior. These laws, unlike Newtons Laws or Gravity, are not based on new empirical observations: they can be derived based on statistics and known principles, such as conservation of energy. By understanding the laws of thermodynamics we can analyze heat engines, or machines that use heat energy to perform mechanical work. 
The  First  Law 	  The First Law of Thermodynamics is simply a statement of energy conservation applied to thermodynamics systems: the change in the internal  for our purposes, this is the same as thermal  energy (denoted ?U) of a closed system is equal to the difference of net input heat and performed work. In other words, ?U = Qnet ?W	[4] First Law Note that this does not explain how the system will transform input heat to work, it simply enforces the energy balance. 
The  Second  Law 	  The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system will always increase until it reaches some maximum value. Consider it in light of the simplified example in the entropy section: if we allow the low entropy system to evolve, it seems intuitive collisions will eventually somehow distribute the kinetic energy among the atoms. The Second Law generalizes this intuition to all closed thermodynamic systems. It is based on the idea that in a closed system, energy will be randomly exchanged among constituent particles  like in the simple example above  until the distribution reaches some equilibrium (again, in any macroscopic system there will be an enormous number of atoms, degrees of freedom, etc). Since energy is conserved in closed systems, this equilibrium has to preserve the original energy total. In this equilibrium, the Second Law  fundamentally a probabilistic statement  posits that the energy will be distributed in the most likely way possible. This typically means that energy will be distributed evenly across degrees of freedom. This allows us to formulate the Second Law in another manner, specifically: heat will flow spontaneously from a high temperature region to a low temperature region, but not the other way. This is just applying the thermodynamic vocabulary to the logic of the above paragraph: in fact, this is the reason for the given definition of temperature. When two substances are put in thermal contact (that is, they can exchange thermal energy), heat will flow from the system at the higher temperature (because it has more energy in its degrees of freedom) to the system with lower temperature until their temperatures are the same. When a single system is out equilibrium, there will be a net transfer of energy from one part of it to another. In equilibrium, energy is still exchanged among the atoms or molecules, but not on a system-wide scale. Therefore, entropy places a limit on how much work a system can perform: the higher the entropy, the more even the distribution of energy, the less energy available for transfer. 
Heat  Engines 	  Heat engines transform input heat into work in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, as we learned in the previous chapter, increasing the temperature of a gas at constant volume will increase its pressure. This pressure can be transformed into a force that moves a piston. The mechanics of various heat engines differ but their fundamentals are quite similar and involve the following steps: A single cycle of such an engine can be illustrated as follows: In effect, such an engine allows us to siphon off part of the heat flow between the heat source and the heat sink. The efficiency of such an engine is defined as the ratio of net work performed to input heat; this is the fraction of heat energy converted to mechanical energy by the engine: 
 	  e =		[5] Efficiency of a heat engine 
Qi 	  If the engine does not lose energy to its surroundings (of course, all real engines do), then this efficiency can be rewritten as 
Qi ? Qo 	  e =		[6] Efficiency of a lossless heat engine 
Qi 	  A Carnot Engine, the most efficient heat engine possible, has an efficiency equal to 
Tc 	  ec = 1?		[7] Efficiency of a Carnot (ideal) heat engine 
Th 	  where Tc and Th are the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, respectively. 
Some  Important  Points 	  In a practical heat engine, the change in internal energy must be zero over a complete cycle. Therefore, over a complete cycle W = ?Q. The work done by a gas during a portion of a cycle = P?V, note ?Vcan be positive or negative. 
Gas  Heat  Engines 	  When gas pressure-forces are used to move an object then work is done on the object by the expanding gas. Work can be done on the gas in order to compress it. If you plot pressure on the vertical axis and volume on the horizontal axis (see P?V diagrams in the last chapter), the work done in any complete cycle is the area enclosed by the graph. For a partial process, work is the area underneath the curve, orP?V. Question: A heat engine operates at a temperature of 650K. The work output is used to drive a pile driver, which is a machine that picks things up and drops them. Heat is then exhausted into the atmosphere, which has a temperature of 300K. a) What is the ideal efficiency of this engine? b.) The engine drives a 1200kg weight by lifting it 50m in 2.5sec.

 	  hot=1-300K650K=54% b) To find the power of the engine, we will use the power equation and plug in the known values. 
P	240k 	  c) First, we know that it is operating at 50% of ideal efficiency. We also know that the max efficiency of this engineis 54%. So the engine is actually operating at .554% = 27% of 100% efficiency. So 240kW is 27% of what? .	890kW

C	0.02 	  The gas starts out at standard atmospheric pressure and temperature. The lid of the gas container is locked by a pin. The gas pressure is increased isochorically through a spigot to twice that of atmospheric pressure. The locking pin is removed and the gas is allowed to expand isobarically to twice its volume, lifting up a weight. The spigot continues to add gas to the cylinder during this process to keep the pressure constant. Once the expansion has finished, the spigot is released, the high-pressure gas is allowed to escape, and the sample settles back to 1 atm. Finally, the lid of the container is pushed back down. As the volume decreases, gas is allowed to escape through the spigot, maintaining a pressure of 1 atm. At the end, the pin is locked again and the process restarts. a.

The  Big  Ideas 	  Einstein believed that the laws of physics do not depend on the how fast you are moving through space: every reference frame sees the same world of physics. In other words, if you are on a moving train and drop a ball or if you are standing on a farm and drop a ball, the physics that describe the motion of that ball will be the same. Einstein realized that the speed of light, c, should depend only on the laws of physics that describe light as electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, Einstein made the bold assertion that light always travels at the same speed, no matter how fast you are moving with respect to the source of light. Consider for a moment how counterintuitive this concept really is. This is the theoretical underpinning of Einsteins theory of Special Relativity, one of the most successfully predictive theories of physics ever formulated. The most important consequence of this new understanding is that our intuition that time moves at the same rate for everyone (whether standing still or moving at a fast speed) is WRONG. In fact, the rate at which time passes depends on your speed. Since Einsteins work in the early part of the 20th century, this fact has been demonstrated many times by experiments in particle accelerators and through the use of atomic clocks aboard fast moving jet airplanes. The effect is only noticeable at extremely fast speeds, thus the normal laws of motion apply in all but the most extreme cases. Einstein was finally led to believe that the very fabric of space and time must have a more active and influential role in the laws of physics than had previously been believed. Eventually, Einstein became convinced that gravity itself amounted to no more than a curvature in spacetime. This theory is called General Relativity. 
Key  Concepts 	  The speed of light will always be measured to be the same (about 3  108 m/s) regardless of your motion towards or away from the source of light. In order for this bizarre fact to be true, we must reconsider what we mean by space, time, and related concepts, such as the concept of simultaneous events. (Events which are seen as simultaneous by one observer might appear to occur at different times to an observer moving with a different velocity. Note that both observers see the same laws of physics, just a different sequence of events.) Clocks moving towards or away from you run more slowly, and objects moving towards or away from you shrink in length. These are known as Lorentz time dilation and length contraction; both are real, measured properties of the universe we live in. If matter is compressed highly enough, the curvature of spacetime becomes so intense that a black hole forms. Within a certain distance of a black hole, called an event horizon, nothing can escape the intense curvature, not even light. No events which occur within the horizon can have any effect, ever, on events which occur outside the horizon. 
Key  Equations 	  v ? = c An object moving with speed v has a dimensionless speed ? calculated by dividing the speed v by the speed of light (c = 3108 m/s). 0 ? ? ? 1. The dimensionless Lorentz gamma factor ? can be calculated from the speed, and tells you how much time dilation or length contraction there is. 1 ? ? ? ?. TABLE 20.1: 
 	  If you see an object of length L moving towards you at a Lorentz gamma factor ?, it will appear shortened (contracted) in the direction of motion to new length L . 
T0 = ? 	  If a moving object experiences some event which takes a period of time T (say, the amount of time between two heart beats), and the object is moving towards or away from you with Lorentz gamma factor ?, the period of time T0 measured by you will appear longer. The radius of the spherical event horizon of a black hole is determined by the mass of the black hole and fundamental constants. A typical black hole radius is about 3 km. mr = m0? The mass of an object moving at relativistic speeds increases by a factor of ?. 
E = mc2 	  The potential energy of mass is equal to mass times the speed of light squared. 
Special and  General  Relativity  Problem  Set 	  a. Your twin performs an experiment which he clocks at 76.0 minutes. You observe this experiment through a powerful telescope; what duration does the experiment have according to your clock? b. Now the opposite happens and you do the 76.0 minute experiment. How long does the traveling twin think the experiment lasted? a.

What is the rebound velocity of the P31 nucleus in the case of gamma ray emission? 
The  Big  Idea 	  The nuclei of atoms are affected by three forces: the strong nuclear force, which causes protons and neutrons to bind together, the electric force, which is manifested by repulsion of the protons and tends to rip the nucleus apart, and the weak nuclear force, which causes neutrons to change into protons and vice versa. The strong force predominates and can cause nuclei of complex atoms with many protons to be stable. The electric force of repulsion is responsible for fission, the breaking apart of nuclei, and therefore also for atom bombs and nuclear power. A form of fission where a helium nucleus is a product, is called alpha radiation. The actions of the weak force give rise to beta radiation. A change in nuclear energy can also give rise to gamma radiation, high energy electromagnetic waves. Particles that emit alpha radiation, beta radiation, and gamma radiation go through the process of radioactive decay, which causes the heating of the molten core of the earth, and has even played a role in the mutations in our evolutionary history. Fission and fusion, the latter occurring when light nuclei combine to form new elements, are accompanied by copious amounts of gamma radiation. These processes often produce radioactive nuclei; in nature these radioactive nuclei were forged in the explosive deaths of ancient stars. 
Key  Equations 	  The amount of mass M of the substance surviving after an original M0n uclei decay for time t with a half-life of tH. ln MM0 t = tH 1 ln 2 The amount of time t it takes a set of nuclei to decay to a specified amount.

 	  X is the symbol for the element involved. For example, U is the symbol for the element uranium. Z is the atomic number. A is the atomic mass number, the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons). A would be 235 for uranium. 
E = ?mc2 	  Energy produced when some mass is lost during radioactive decay. 
Key  Concepts 	  Some of the matter on Earth is unstable and undergoing nuclear decay. Alpha decay is the emission of a helium nucleus and causes the product to have an atomic number 2 lower than the original and an atomic mass number 4 lower than the original. Beta minus decay is the emission of an electron, causing the product to have an atomic number 1 greater than the original Beta plus decay is the emission of a positron, causing the product to have an atomic number 1 lower than the original. When an atomic nucleus decays, it does so by releasing one or more particles. The atom often (but not always) turns into a different element during the decay process. The amount of radiation given off by a certain sample of radioactive material depends on the amount of material, how quickly it decays, and the nature of the decay product. Big, rapidly decaying samples are most dangerous. The measure of how quickly a nucleus decays is given by the half-life of the nucleus. One half-life is the amount of time it will take for half of the radioactive material to decay. The type of atom is determined by the atomic number (i.e. the number of protons). The atomic mass of an atom is approximately the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. Typically, the atomic mass listed in a periodic table is an average, weighted by the natural abundances of different isotopes. The atomic mass number in a nuclear decay process is conserved. This means that you will have the same total atomic mass number on both sides of the equation. Charge is also conserved in a nuclear process. It is impossible to predict when an individual atom will decay; one can only predict the probability. However, it is possible to predict when a portion of a macroscopic sample will decay extremely accurately because the sample contains a vast number of atoms. The nuclear process is largely random in direction. Therefore, radiation strength decreases with distance by the inverse square of the distance (the 1/r2 law, which also holds for gravity, electric fields, light intensity, sound intensity, and so on.) 
Alpha  Decay 	  Alpha decay is the process in which an isotope releases a helium nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons,He) and thus decays into an atom with two less protons. 
Beta  Decay 	  Beta decay is the process in which one of the neutrons in an isotope decays, leaving a proton, electron and anti-neutrino. As a result, the nucleus decays into an atom that has the same number of nucleons, with one neutron replaced by a proton. (Beta positive decay is the reverse process, in which a proton decays into a neutron, anti-electron and neutrino.) 
Gamma  Decay 	  Gamma decay is the process in which an excited atomic nucleus kicks out a photon and releases some of its energy. The makeup of the nucleus doesnt change, it just loses energy. (It can be useful to think of this as energy of motion think of a shuddering nucleus that only relaxes after emitting some light.) 
Example: y 	  Fission is the process in which an atomic nucleus breaks apart into two less massive nuclei. Energy is released in the process in many forms, heat, gamma rays and the kinetic energy of neutrons. If these neutrons collide with nuclei and induce more fission, then a runaway chain reaction can take place. Fission is responsible for nuclear energy and atom-bomb explosions: the fission of uranium acts as a heat source for the Earths molten interior. Example: 1 n+ 235 U ? 141 Ba+ 92 Kr+31 n Fusion is the process in which two atomic nuclei fuse together to make a single nucleus. Energy is released in the form of nuclear particles, neutrons, and gamma-rays. 
Example:   He+ 10 n+y 	  Radioactive carbon dating is a technique that allows scientists to determine the era in which a sample of biological material died. A small portion of the carbon we ingest every day is actually the radioactive isotope 14C rather than the usual 12C. Since we ingest carbon every day until we die (we do this by eating plants; the plants do it through photosynthesis), the amount of 14C in us should begin to decrease from the moment we die. By analyzing the ratio of the number of 14C to 12C atoms in dead carbon-based life forms (including cloth made from plants!), we can determine how long ago the life form died.

The  Big  Idea 	  All matter is composed of fundamental building blocks, called the elementary particles. These building blocks are much smaller than an atom, and so are sometimes referred to as subatomic particles. Particles interact with one another according to a set of laws based on symmetries in the universe. There are two types of particles: force particles (bosons) and matter particles (fermions). What sets them apart is an intrinsic property called spin. Force particles have integer spin values (1,2,3,...) and matter particles have half integer spin values (1/2,3/2, ...). The set of particles and the laws that govern their interactions are called the Standard Model. The Standard Model is very powerful and can predict particle interactions to amazing accuracy. The fifth of the five conservation laws is called CPT symmetry. The law states that if you reverse the spatial coordinates of a particle, change it from matter to anti-matter, and reverse it in time the new object is now indistinguishable from the original. More on the fifth conservation law in the Feynman Diagrams chapter. 
Matter 	  Particles can be grouped into two camps: fermions and bosons. Typically matter is made up of fermions, while interactions (which lead to forces of nature such as gravity and electromagnetism) occur through the exchange of particles called bosons. (There are exceptions to this.) Electrons and protons are fermions, while photons (light particles) are bosons and transmit the electromagnetic force (known as QED in particle physics). Fermions (matter particles) can be broken into two groups: leptons and quarks. Each of these groups comes in three families. The first family of leptons consists of the electron and the electron neutrino. The second family consists of the muon and the muon neutrino. The third consists of the tau and the tau neutrino. Particles in each successive family are more massive than the family before it. The first family of quarks consists of the up and down quark. The second family consists of the charm and strange quarks. The third family consists of the top and bottom quarks. Up and down quarks combine (via the strong force) to form nucleons. Two ups and a down quark make a proton, while an up quark and two down quarks make a neutron. Different combinations of quarks are called mesons. In reality, most of the mass of a proton, neutron, etc. is made up of binding energy and virtual particles. Particles differ in their mass, their electric charge, their family (in the case of leptons), and their spin. Spin is a quantum mechanical concept that is best explained as a magnetic moment intrinsic to the particle and manifested as angular momentum. 
Interactions 	  There are four fundamental forces in nature. From weakest to strongest, these are the gravitational force, the weak nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, and the strong nuclear force. Each fundamental force is transmitted by its own boson(s): for gravity, they are called gravitons; for the weak nuclear force, they are called W?, W+, and Z? bosons; for the electromagnetic force, they are called photons; and for the strong nuclear force, they are called gluons. In summary, the building blocks of matter and the interactions between matter consist of the following fundamental particles : TABLE 22.1: 
Quarks 	  electron up electron neutrino down muon strange muon neutrino charm tau top tau neutrino bottom TABLE 22.2: 
Associated  Boson 	  gravity graviton electromagnetic photon weak W?, W+, and Z? strong gluons 
Rules 	  For any interaction between particles, the five conservation laws (energy, momentum, angular momentum, charge, and CPT) must be followed. For instance, the total electric charge must always be the same before and after an interaction. Electron lepton number is conserved. This means that the total number of electrons plus electron neutrinos must be the same before and after an interaction. Similarly, muon lepton number and tau lepton number are also (separately) conserved. Note that matter gets lepton number of +1 and antimatter has lepton number of ?1. Total quark number is conserved. Unlike leptons, however, this total includes all families. Again matter particles get quark number of +1 and antimatter ?1. Photons can only interact with objects that have electric charge. This means that particles without charge (such as the electron neutrino) can never interact with photons. The strong nuclear force can only act on quarks. This means that gluons (the particle that carries the strong Chapter 22.	Standard Model of Particle Physics nuclear force) can only interact with quarks, or other gluons. The gravitational force can only act on objects with energy, and hence any object with mass. The weak nuclear force interacts with both quarks and leptons. However, the weak force is carried by any of three particles, called intermediate vector bosons: W?, W+, and Z?. Note that the W particles carry electric charge. This means you have to be more careful in making sure that any weak force interaction conserves electric charge. Any interaction which obeys all of these rules, and also obeys the usual rules of energy and momentum conservation, is allowed. Due to the randomness of particle interactions, any allowed interaction must eventually happen and thus has a non-zero probability of happening. 
Antimatter 	  In addition to all of this, there is a further complication: each type of particle that exists (such as an electron or an up quark) has an antiparticle. Antiparticles are strange beasts: they have the same properties as their corresponding particles (mass, size, interactions) but their quantum numbers are exactly reversed electric charge, electron, muon, or tau lepton number, and quark number). There are two ways to denote something as an antiparticle. The most common is to draw a horizontal line above the thing. So, for instance, the antiparticle of the up quark is the anti-up quark: u	u up quark	anti-up quark For charged leptons, you can merely switch the charge. So, for instance, an electron has negative charge and is written e? , while its antiparticle, the anti-electron (also called a positron) is written e+. e? e+ electron anti-electron (aka positron) Particles and antiparticles annihilate each other, and convert their mass directly to energy in the form of gamma rays. Likewise, gamma rays can spontaneously revert to particle-antiparticle pairs. Matter and energy exchange places frequently in this process, with a conversion formula given by the famous equation E = mc2.

The  Big  Idea 	  The interaction of subatomic particles through the four fundamental forces is the basic foundation of all the physics we have studied so far. Theres a relatively simple way to calculate the probability of collisions, annihilations, or decays of particles, invented by physicist Richard Feynman, called Feynman diagrams. Drawing Feynman diagrams is the first step in visualizing and predicting the subatomic world. If a process does not violate a known conservation law, then that process must exist with some probability. All the Standard Model rules of the previous chapter are used here. You are now entering the exciting world of particle physics. 
Key  Concepts 	  To make a Feynman diagram, you plot time on the horizontal axis and position on the vertical axis. This is called a space-time diagram. The fifth conservation law: CPT symmetry. States that if you charge conjugate (i.e. change matter to antimatter), Parity reversal (i.e. mirror reflection) and then reverse the flow of time, a matter particle is exactly the same as the anti-matter particle (see below) This is why anti-matter has its time arrow pointing backwards. And on collision diagrams, the matter is identical to the anti-matter after a CPT operation. If a particle is not moving, then we say that its space coordinate is fixed. Of course, if its just sitting there, then its moving through time. On the diagram below (left), the horizontal line shows the path of motion of a stationary particle. The diagram to the right shows the path of motion of a particle moving away from the origin at some speed. Here are two particles colliding! Watch out! We use the following symbols in Feynman diagrams: Annihilation Diagram: When matter and antimatter particles collide, they annihilate, leaving behind pure energy for the example below in the form of electromagnetic radiation (photons!). A different set of matter and antimatter is recreated soon thereafter. The Feynman diagram for that process looks like this: Note that space and time axes have been left out; they are understood to be there. Also note that the arrow on the bottom is supposed to be backwards. We do that any time we have an antiparticle. Most people like to think of antiparticles as traveling backwards in time, and this is roughly explained by CPT symmetry. It is very important that you remember that time is the horizontal axis! A lot of people see the drawing above and think of it as two particles coming together at an angle. These two particles are in a collision but the angle is not known from this diagram, because only one dimension of space is graphed. Scattering Diagram: Here is the Feynman diagram for two electrons coming towards each other than repelling each other through the electromagnetic force (via exchange of a virtual photon). Note that the particles are always separated in space (vertical axis) so that they never touch. Hence they are scattering by exchanging virtual photons which cause them to repel. You can think of a virtual photon as existing for an instant of time. Therefore there is no movement in time (horizontal) axis. 
Feynman  Diagrams  Problem  Set 	  For the following Feynman diagrams, describe in words the process that is occurring. For instance: (a) what type of interaction: annihilation or scattering (b) what are the incoming articles? (c) which kind of boson mediates the interaction? (d) which fundamental force is involved in the interaction? (e) what are the outgoing particles? Also, for each, decide if the interaction shown is allowed. An interaction is allowed if it does not violate any of the rules set out by the Standard Model of physics. If the interactions violate some rule, state which rule it violates. If they do not violate a rule, say that the interactions are allowed. Hint: the best approach is to verify that the incoming and outgoing particles can interact with the boson (force particle) then to look at each vertex where more than one particle is coming together. Look immediately to the left of the vertex (before) and immediately to the right of the vertex (after). For instance, one rule states that the total electric charge before a vertex must equal the total electric charge after a vertex. Is that true? Check all the conserved quantities from the previous chapter in this way. In this case, the electron and positron are exchanging virtual electron/positron pairs. 
The  Big  Idea 	  Quantum Mechanics, discovered early in the 20th century, completely changed the way physicists think. Quantum Mechanics is the description of how the universe works on the very small scale. It turns out that we cant predict what will happen, but only the probabilities of certain outcomes. The uncertainty of quantum events is extremely important at the atomic level (and smaller levels) but not at the macroscopic level. In fact, there is a result called the correspondence principle that states that all results from quantum mechanics must agree with classical physics when quantum numbers are large  that is, for objects with large mass. The foundation of quantum mechanics was developed on the observation of wave-particle duality. Electromagnetic radiation is carried by particles, called photons, which interact with electrons. Depending on the experiment, photons can behave as particles or waves. The reverse is also true; electrons can also behave as particles or waves. Because the electron has a wavelength, its position and momentum can never be precisely established. This is called the uncertainty principle. (What has been said above about the electron is true for protons or any other particle, but, experimentally, the effects become undetectable with increasing mass.) 
The  Key  Concepts 	  The energy of a photon is the product of its frequency and Plancks Constant. This is the exact amount of energy an electron will have if it absorbs a photon. A photon, which has neither mass nor volume, carries energy and momentum; the quantity of either energy or momentum in a photon depends on its frequency. The photon travels at the speed of light. The five conservation laws hold true at the quantum level. Energy, momentum, angular momentum, charge and CPT are all conserved from the particle level to the astrophysics level. If an electron loses energy the photon emitted will have its frequency (and wavelength) determined by the difference in the electrons energy. This obeys the conservation of energy, one of the five conservation laws. An electron, which has mass (but probably no volume) has energy and momentum determined by its speed, which is always less than that of light. The electron has a wavelength determined by its momentum. If a photon strikes some photoelectric material its energy must first go into releasing the electron from the material (This is called the work function of the material.) The remaining energy, if any, goes into kinetic energy of the electron and stopping potential, or the voltage of an electric circuit can be calculated from this. The current comes from the number of electrons/second and that corresponds exactly to the number of photons/second. Increasing the number of photons will not change the amount of energy an electron will have, but will increase the number of electrons emitted. The momentum of photons is equal to Plancks constant divided by the wavelength. The wavelength of electrons is equal to Plancks constant divided by the electrons momentum. If an electron is traveling at about .1 c this wavelength is then not much smaller than the size of an atom. The size of the electrons wavelength determines the possible energy levels in an atom. These are negative energies since the electron is said to have zero potential energy when it is ionized. The lowest energy level (ground state) for hydrogen is ?13.6 eV. The second level is?3.4 eV. Atoms with multiple electrons have multiple sets of energy levels. (And energy levels are different for partially ionized atoms.) When an electron absorbs a photon it moves to higher energy level, depending on the energy of the photon. If a 13.6 eV photon hits a hydrogen atom it ionizes that atom. If a 10.2 eV photon strikes hydrogen the electron is moved to the next level. Atomic spectra are unique to each element. They are seen when electrons drop from a higher energy level to a lower one. For example when an electron drops from ?3.4 eV to ?13.6 eV in the Hydrogen atom a 10.2 eV photon is emitted. The spectra can be in the infrared, visible light, ultraviolet or x-ray spectrum. (The 10.2 eV photon is ultra-violet.) The wave nature of electrons makes it impossible to determine exactly both its momentum and position. The product of the two uncertainties is on the order of Plancks Constant. (Uncertainty in the electrons energy and time are likewise related.) 
E = hf 	  Relates energy of a photon to its frequency. h p = ? Relates the momentum of a photon to its wavelength. h ? = p The Debroglie wavelength of an electron. h ?x?p This is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, (HUP) which relates the uncertainty in the momentum and position of a particle. h ?E?t ? Relates the uncertainty in measuring the energy of a particle and the time it takes to do the measurement. h = 6.626 Plancks constant. The most convenient unit of energy at the atomic scale is the electron volt, defined as the potential energy of the charge of an electron across a potential difference of 1 volt. qeV0 = Kmax The stopping potential of an electron, where Kmax is the maximum kinetic energy of the electron.

The  Big  Idea 	  The observed global warming on Earth is a manifestation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Earth operates like any heat engine. Input heat from solar radiation and exhaust heat (terrestrial radiation) largely determine the operating temperature (global surface temperature). Over geological periods this heat exchange reaches equilibrium and the temperature is stable. If the input heat increases or the exhaust heat decreases the temperature rises and vice versa. Natural processes over geologic time have changed the input and affected both output heat and temperature. In the present era the quantity of exhaust heat is being rapidly restricted by the greenhouse effect; consequently, the earths temperature must rise to reach equilibrium. How much higher it must rise depends entirely on human activity. The input heat  solar energy received  is a function of solar activity and oscillations in characteristics of the Earths orbit. The quantity of exhaust heat, terrestrial radiation, is largely a function of the presence of certain gases in the atmosphere that absorb outgoing infrared radiation. This is known as the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is due to the differential absorption of certain wavelengths of solar as compared to terrestrial radiation. The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as Carbon Dioxide and Methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about 1.0 W/m2. Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed below) which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future). The Key Concepts (Possible Effects That Can Accelerate Global Warming) The Key Concepts (Physical Laws and Observations) This band largely is unabsorbed by any atmospheric gases. The most significant of the greenhouse gases are H2O and CO2. The plot above details the absorbance of various wavelengths of radiation by atmospheric gases in the shortwave region. (a) precession of the rotational axis (period: 23,000 years) (b) variation in tilt of rotational axis from 21.5? to 24.5? (period: 41,000 years) (c) eccentricity of the elliptical orbit (period: 100,000 years) 
The  Key  Applications 	  a. Global Warming seems to cause the North Atlantic Oscillation to become stuck in the positive mode. The effect is to have warmer weather in Alaska, Siberia and western Canada, but colder weather in eastern Canada, Europe, and northeast US. b. The same effect likely will lead to dry windy conditions in Europe and North America and dry conditions in much of Africa. c. Models show global warming leading to droughts in most of the northern hemisphere, particularly in the grain belts of North America, Europe, and Asia. d. At the same time, there is predicted to be increased rain overall, but coming in the form of severe storms and consequent flooding. e. The conditions that lead to hurricanes and tornadoes are powered by solar energy. More solar energy in the ocean may lead to more severe hurricanes. There is some evidence to support that this has already occurred. The combination of warm Gulf waters and windy plains cause tornadoes. Both of these conditions will be increased by global warming.

All masses are given in amus. First, find the mass difference between reactant and products. Then, converting to kilograms and using E = ?mc2, find the energy in joules of an atomic bomb. e.
