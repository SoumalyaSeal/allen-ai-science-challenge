DEFINITION OF PHYSICS

MATHEMATICS TOOLS FOR PHYSICS
REFERENCES

Aristotle (384–322 BCE) was an incredibly important thinker in his time; he made contributions to philosophy,
mathematics, physics, biology, politics, theater, and more. Nonetheless, he followed the tendency of his time to
make unsubstantiated claims based solely on logical reasoning, such as his false proclamation that men eat more
than women and therefore must have more teeth. The scientiﬁc method, which became common after Aristotle’s
time, made careful observations—rather than opinions—the basis of scientiﬁc inquiry. Without this method, the
hypotheses, theories, discoveries, and inventions we think of as “science” would not be possible. In this chapter, you
will be introduced to the ﬁeld of physics, as well as the methodology of physics experiments.

1.1. Deﬁnition of Physics

www.ck12.org

1.1 Deﬁnition of Physics

• State a deﬁnition of physics.
• Explain the importance of physics as a ﬁeld of study.

Physics is more than calculating the momentum of billiard balls hitting each other or the friction acting on a speeding
car’s tires. Physics includes the study of practically every form of matter and how it interacts with other matter and
with energy in various forms. The image shows one of several large parabolic antennas that NASA physicists used
for years to communicate with ships and devices completing solar system exploration missions.

Deﬁnition of Physics

What is physics? Physics is the branch of science that studies the physical world, including objects as small as
subatomic particles and as large as galaxies.
It studies the nature of matter and energy and how they interact.
Physicists are inquisitive people who want to know the causes of what they see. How does the moon move? Why
does the moon move? Why do the stars shine? Why do your hands get warm when you rub them together? Physicists,
like all scientists, hope to ﬁnd explanations that describe more than one phenomenon and offer a better understanding
of how the universe works.

Common Misconceptions

People commonly believe that physics is all about solving word problems and memorizing equations. While it is
true that many physics classes focus on the equations, it is important to remember that the purpose of physics is less
about the problems and more about using equations, laws, and theories to understand the world we live in.

1.2 Scientiﬁc Method

• Understand the steps in the scientiﬁc method.
• Deﬁne hypothesis.
• Differentiate between a theory and a law.

Don Frazier, a NASA chemist, conducting an experiment using a laser imaging system.
In science, we need to make observations on various phenomena to form and test hypotheses. Some phenomena
can be found and studied in nature, but scientists often need to create an experiment. Experiments are tests under
controlled conditions designed to demonstrate something scientists already know or to test something scientists
wish to know. Experiments vary greatly in their goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical
analysis of the results. The process of designing and performing experiments is a part of the scientiﬁc method.

The Scientiﬁc Method

The scientiﬁc method is the process used by scientists to acquire new knowledge and improve our understanding
of the universe. It involves making observations on the phenomenon being studied, suggesting explanations for
the observations, and testing these possible explanations, also called hypotheses, by making new observations. A
hypothesis is a scientist’s proposed explanation of a phenomenon which still must be tested.

4

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physics

The scientiﬁc method is employed by scientists around the world, but it is not always conducted in the order above.
Sometimes, hypothesis are formulated before observations are collected; sometimes observations are made before
hypothesis are created. Regardless, it is important that scientists record their procedures carefully, allowing others
to reproduce and verify the experimental data and results. After many experiments provide results supporting a
hypothesis, the hypothesis becomes a theory. Theories remain theories forever, and are constantly being retested
with every experiment and observation. Theories can never become fact or law.
In science, a law is a mathematical relationship that exists between observations under a given set of conditions.
There is a fundamental difference between observations of the physical world and explanations of the nature of the
physical world. Hypotheses and theories are explanations, whereas laws and measurements are observational.

Summary

• The scientiﬁc method consists of making observations, formulating a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis with
new observations, making a new hypothesis if the new observations contradict the old hypothesis, or continu-
ing to test the hypothesis if the observations agree.

• A hypothesis is a tentative explanation that can be tested by further observation.
• A theory is a hypothesis that has been supported with repeated testing.
• A scientiﬁc law is a statement that summarizes the results of many observations.
• Experimental data must be veriﬁed by reproduction from other scientists.
• Theories must agree with all observations made on the phenomenon under study.
• Theories are continually tested, forever.

1.3. Measurement

1.3 Measurement

• Distinguish between qualitative and quantitative observations.
• Distinguish between fundamental and derived quantities.
• State the SI units for length, mass, and time.
• Understand unit conversions in the SI system.

Measurements are a basic necessity in science. Scientists have designed thousands of different tools to help in the
vital process of measuring. In this image of the control panel of the space shuttle Atlantis, we see dozens of readouts
from measuring systems.

Measurement

We already know that observations are an important part of the scientiﬁc method. Hypotheses are accepted or
rejected based on how well they explain observations. Some observations, such as "the plant turned brown" are
qualitative; these observations have no associated numbers. A quantitative observation includes numbers, and is
also called a measurement. A measurement is obtained by comparing an object to some standard. Any observation
is useful to a scientist, but quantitative observations are commonly considered more useful. Even if the measurement
is an estimate, scientists usually make quantitative measurements in every experiment.
Consider the following pair of observations.

1. When the volume of a gas is decreased, its pressure is increased.
2. When the volume of a gas is reduced from 2.0 liters to 1.0 liter, the pressure increases from 3.0 atm to 6.0 atm.

A great deal more information, and more useful information, is available in the second observation.
Since accurate measurement is a vital tool for doing science, a consistent set of units for measurement is necessary.
Physicists throughout the world use the International System of Units (also called the SI system). The SI system

8

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physics

is basically the metric system, which is convenient because units of different size are related by powers of 10. The
system has physical standards for length, mass, and time. These are called fundamental units because they have an
actual physical standard.
The standard SI unit for length is the meter, and is denoted by "m". Originally, the meter was deﬁned as the length
between two scratches on a piece of metal which was stored in a secure vault under controlled conditions. The
meter’s deﬁnition has changed over time, but it is now accepted to be the distance light travels in a vacuum over
1/299792458 of a second.
The standard unit of time, the second, was once deﬁned as a fraction of the time it takes the earth to complete an
orbit around the sun, but has now been redeﬁned in terms of the frequency of one type of radiation emitted by a
cesium-133 atom. Seconds are denoted by "s" or, less commonly, "sec."
The standard unit for mass is the kilogram. The kilogram’s standard is a block of platinum-iridium metal kept near
Paris, France. Other countries, of course, keep copies. A kilogram is denoted "kg" and is a multiple of the smaller
unit of mass, the gram ("g").
Meters, seconds, and kilograms are not the only unit entities. Take, for example, speed. Speed is a derived
unit, measured in meters per second (m/s). Derived units are units that are expressed using combinations of the
fundamental units.
As mentioned earlier, the SI system is a decimal system. Preﬁxes are used to change SI units by powers of ten.
Thus, one hundredth of a meter is a centimeter and one thousandth of a gram is a milligram. The metric units for
all quantities use the same preﬁxes. One thousand meters is a kilometer and one thousand grams is a kilogram. The
common preﬁxes are shown in the Table 1.1.

These preﬁxes are deﬁned using scientiﬁc notation. This notation is explained in the Mathematics Tools for Physics
section. Numbers with different preﬁxes can be shown as equalities when they are equivalent measurements. For
example, 1 meter = 100 centimeters. Similarly, 0.01 meters = 1 centimenter. These equivalencies are used as
conversion factors when units need to be converted.
Example: Convert 500. millimeters to meters.
Solution:
The equivalency statement for millimeters and meters is 1000 mm = 1 m.
To convert 500. mm to m, we multiply 500. mm by a conversion factor that will cancel the millimeter units and
generate the meter units. This requires that the conversion factor has meters in the numerator and millimeters in the

9

1.3. Measurement

denominator.

www.ck12.org

500. mm is equivalent to 0.5 m.
Example: Convert 11 µg to mg.
Solution:
When converting from one preﬁx to another, such as in this problem, it is usually easiest to convert through the base
unit. In this case, the base unit is grams, so we use the two following equivalency statements:
1× 106 µg = 1 g and 1000 mg = 1 g
The ﬁrst conversion factor converts from micrograms to grams and the second conversion factor converts from grams
to milligrams.

(cid:16) 1 g

1×106 µg

(11 µg)
1 g
11 µg is 1.1 × 10−2 mg.

(cid:17)(cid:16) 1000 mg

(cid:17)

= 1.1× 10−2 mg

Summary

• Measurements (quantitative observations) are often more useful than qualitative observations.
• The system of units for measurements in physics is the SI system.
• The fundamental quantities in the SI system are length, mass, and time.
• The SI unit for length is the meter, for time is the second, and for mass is the kilogram.

• measurement: The process or the result of determining the ratio of a physical quantity, such as a length, time,

temperature etc., to a unit of measurement, such as the meter, second or degree Celsius.

• the SI system of units: A complete metric system of units of measurement for scientists; fundamental quan-
tities are length (meter) and mass (kilogram) and time (second) and electric current (ampere) and temperature
(kelvin) and amount of matter (mole) and luminous intensity (candela).

• fundamental quantity vs derived quantity: In the language of measurement, quantities are quantiﬁable
aspects of the world, such as time, distance, velocity, mass, temperature, energy, and weight, and units are
used to describe their measure. Many of these quantities are related to each other by various physical laws,
and as a result the units of some of the quantities can be expressed as products (or ratios) of powers of other
units (e.g., momentum is mass times velocity and velocity is measured in distance divided by time). Those
quantities whose units are expressed in terms of other units are regarded as derived quantities. Those that
cannot be so expressed in terms of other units are regarded as “fundamental” quantities.

• conversion factor: A numerical factor used to multiply or divide a quantity when converting from one system

of units to another.

1.4 Mathematics Tools for Physics

• Convert given numbers from expanded form to scientiﬁc notation, and vice versa.
• Carry out mathematical operations in scientiﬁc notation.
• Identify the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in given measurements.
• Carry proper signiﬁcant ﬁgures through math operations.

Scientists today use computers to aid with many complex mathematical operations used in science. Computers take
and store measurement readings and can save hours, days, or even years of mathematical calculations. The image
is of the CSIRAC (Council for Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Automatic Computer), Australia’s ﬁrst digital
computer, ﬁrst run in November 1949. A modern laptop has more computing power than this room-ﬁlling computer
did.

What Is the Place of Mathematics in Physics?

There is certainly a lot of math in physics, but the concepts and theories of physics cannot be derived from only
mathematics. If you wish to build a complex mechanical structure, it is pointless to begin without wrenches and
screwdrivers. To build mechanical structures, you must have tools. One of the primary tools for working in physics
is mathematics. This particular physics resource requires algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, but higher-level
physics courses also require calculus. In fact, calculus was invented by Isaac Newton speciﬁcally to solve physics
problems; most advanced calculus problems are actually physics problems.

Scientiﬁc Notation

In the "Deﬁnition of Physics," it was noted that physics deals with objects as small as sub-atomic particles and as
large as galaxies. It should be clear that physicists deal with extremely small numbers - like the mass of a lead atom:

12

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physics

0.00000000000000000000034 g - and extremely large numbers - like the distance from our galaxy to the Andromeda
galaxy: 2.5 million light years, which is approximately 25,000,000,000,000,000,000 km!
These numbers are difﬁcult to write and even more difﬁcult to calculate with. It is much more convenient to write
and calculate with such extreme numbers if they are written in scientiﬁc notation. In scientiﬁc notation, the mass
of a lead atom is 3.4 × 10−34 g, and the distance from our galaxy to the Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 × 1019 km.
A number is expressed in scientiﬁc notation by moving the decimal so that exactly one non-zero digit is on the left of
the decimal and the exponent of 10 will be the number of places the decimal was moved. If the decimal is moved to
the left, the exponent is positive and if the decimal was moved to the right, the exponent is negative. All signiﬁcant
ﬁgures are maintained in scientiﬁc notation. Signiﬁcant ﬁgures are explained below.
Example: Express 13,700,000,000 in scientiﬁc notation.
Solution: Since the decimal will be moved to the left 10 places, the exponent will be 10. So, the correct notation is
1.37 × 1010.
Example: Express 0.000000000000000074 in scientiﬁc notation.
Solution: Since the decimal will be moved to the right 17 places, the exponent will be -17. So the correct scientiﬁc
notation is 7.4 × 10−17.
Example: Express the number 8.43 × 105 in expanded form.
Solution: 105 is 100,000 so 8.43 × 105 is 8.43 × 100,000 or 843,000.

Operations with Exponential Numbers

In order to add or subtract numbers in scientiﬁc notation, the exponents must be the same. If the exponents are not
the same, one of the numbers must be changed so that the exponents are the same. Once the exponents are the same,
the numbers are added and the same exponents are carried through to the answer.
Example: Add 5.0 × 105 and 4.0 × 104.
Solution: In order to add these numbers, we can change 4.0 × 104 to 0.40 × 105 and then add 0.40 × 105 to 5.0 ×
105 which yields 5.4 × 105.
When you multiply exponential numbers, the numbers multiply and the exponents add.
Example: Multiply 5.0 × 105 and 4.0 × 104.
Solution: (5.0× 105)(4.0× 104) = (5.0)(4.0)× 105+4 = 20× 109 = 2× 1010
Example: Multiply 6.0 × 103 and 2.0 × 10−5.
Solution: (6.0× 103)(2.0× 10−5) = 12× 103−5 = 12× 10−2 = 1.2× 10−1 = 0.12
When you divide exponential numbers, the numbers are divided and the exponent of the divisor is subtracted from
the exponent of the dividend.
Example: Divide 6.0 × 103 by 2.0 × 10−5.
Solution: 6.0×103

2.0×10−5 = 3.0× 103−(−5) = 3.0× 108

Signiﬁcant Figures

The numbers you use in math class are considered to be exact numbers. These numbers are deﬁned, not measured.
Measured numbers cannot be exact - the speciﬁcity with which we can make a measurement depends on how precise
our measuring instrument is. In the case of measurements, we can only read our measuring instruments to a limited
number of subdivisions. We are limited by our ability to see smaller and smaller subdivisions, and we are limited by
our ability to construct smaller and smaller subdivisions on our measuring devices. Even with the use of powerful

13

1.4. Mathematics Tools for Physics

www.ck12.org

microscopes to construct and read our measuring devices, we eventually reach a limit. Therefore, although the actual
measurement of an object may be a perfect 12 inches, we cannot prove it to be so. Measurements do not produce
perfect numbers; the only perfect numbers in science are deﬁned numbers, such as conversion factors.
It is very important to recognize and report the limitations of a measurement along with the magnitude and unit of
the measurement. Many times, the measurements made in an experiment are analyzed for regularities. Since the
reported numbers show the limits of the measurements (how speciﬁc these measurements really are), it is possible
to determine how regular these measurements are.
Consider the Table 1.2 of the pressures (P) and volumes (V) of a gas sample and the calculated PV product.

Pressure
4.01 atm
3.02 atm
6.04 atm
11.98 atm

Pressure × Volume (P × V)
24.1803 L-atm
24.1298 L-atm
24.0392 L-atm
23.8402 L-atm

Now, in the Table 1.3,
signiﬁcant ﬁgures and all the numbers must be rounded to two places.

look at this same set of data when we are told that all the measurements have only two

When the numbers are expressed with proper number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures, a regularity appears that was not apparent
before.

Rules for Determining Signiﬁcant Figures

Signiﬁcant ﬁgures are all of the digits that can be known with certainty in a measurement plus an estimated last
digit. Signiﬁcant ﬁgures provide a system to keep track of the limits of the original measurement. To record a
measurement, you must write down all the digits actually measured, including measurements of zero, and you must
not write down any digit not measured. The only real difﬁculty with this system is that zeros are sometimes used as
measured digits, while other times they are used to locate the decimal point.

In the sketch shown above, the correct measurement is greater than 1.2 inches but less than 1.3 inches. It is proper
to estimate one place beyond the calibrations of the measuring instrument. This ruler is calibrated to 0.1 inches, so
we can estimate the hundredths place. This reading should be reported as 1.25 or 1.26 inches.

14

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physics

In this second case (sketch above), it is apparent that the object is, as nearly as we can read, 1 inch. Since we know
the tenths place is zero and can estimate the hundredths place to be zero, the measurement should be reported as
1.00 inch. It is vital that you include the zeros in your reported measurement because these are measured places and
are signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

This measurement is read as 1.15 or 1.16 inches.

This measurement is read as 1.50 inches.
In all of these examples, the measurements indicate that the measuring instrument had subdivisions of a tenth of an
inch and that the hundredths place is estimated. There is some uncertainty about the last, and only the last, digit.
In our system of writing measurements to show signiﬁcant ﬁgures, we must distinguish between measured zeros and
place-holding zeros. Here are the rules for determining the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in a measurement.

Rules for Determining the Number of Signiﬁcant Figures:

1. All non-zero digits are signiﬁcant.
2. All zeros between non-zero digits are signiﬁcant.
3. All beginning zeros are not signiﬁcant.
4. Ending zeros are signiﬁcant if the decimal point is written in but not signiﬁcant if the decimal point is an

understood decimal (the decimal point is not written in).

Examples of the Signiﬁcant Figure Rules:

1. All non-zero digits are signiﬁcant.

543 has 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

15

1.4. Mathematics Tools for Physics

www.ck12.org

22.437 has 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
1.321754 has 7 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

2. All zeros between non-zero digits are signiﬁcant.

7,004 has 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
10.3002 has 6 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
103 has 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

3. All beginning zeros are not signiﬁcant.

0.00000075 has 2 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
0.02 has 1 signiﬁcant ﬁgure.
0.003003 has 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

4. Ending zeros are signiﬁcant if the decimal point is actually written in but not signiﬁcant if the decimal point is an
understood decimal.

37.300 has 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
33.00000 has 7 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
100. has 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
100 has 1 signiﬁcant ﬁgure.
302,000 has 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
1,050 has 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Addition and Subtraction

The answer to an addition or subtraction operation must not have any digits further to the right than the shortest
addend. In other words, the answer should have as many decimal places as the addend with the smallest number of
decimal places.
Example:

13.3843 cm
1.012 cm
+ 3.22 cm
17.6163 cm = 17.62 cm

Notice that the top addend has a 3 in the last column on the right, but neither of the other two addends have a number
in that column. In elementary math classes, you were taught that these blank spaces can be ﬁlled in with zeros and
the answer would be 17.6163 cm. In the sciences, however, these blank spaces are unknown numbers, not zeros.
Since they are unknown numbers, you cannot substitute any numbers into the blank spaces. As a result, you cannot
know the sum of adding (or subtracting) any column of numbers that contain an unknown number. When you add
the columns of numbers in the example above, you can only be certain of the sums for the columns with known
numbers in each space in the column. In science, the process is to add the numbers in the normal mathematical
process and then round off all columns that contain an unknown number (a blank space). Therefore, the correct
answer for the example above is 17.62 cm and has only four signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

16

www.ck12.org

Multiplication and Division

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Physics

The answer for a multiplication or division operation must have the same number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures as the factor
with the least number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Example: (3.556 cm)(2.4 cm) = 8.5344 cm2 = 8.5 cm2
The factor 3.556 cm has four signiﬁcant ﬁgures, and the factor 2.4 cm has two signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Therefore the
answer must have two signiﬁcant ﬁgures. The mathematical answer of 8.5344 cm2 must be rounded back to 8.5 cm2
in order for the answer to have two signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Example: (20.0 cm)(5.0000 cm) = 100.00000 cm2 = 100. cm2
The factor 20.0 cm has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures, and the factor 5.0000 cm has ﬁve signiﬁcant ﬁgures. The answer
must be rounded to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Therefore, the decimal must be written in to show that the two ending
zeros are signiﬁcant. If the decimal is omitted (left as an understood decimal), the two zeros will not be signiﬁcant
and the answer will be wrong.
Example: (5.444 cm)(22 cm) = 119.768 cm2 = 120 cm2
In this case, the answer must be rounded back to two signiﬁcant ﬁgures. We cannot have a decimal after the zero in
120 cm2 because that would indicate the zero is signiﬁcant, whereas this answer must have exactly two signiﬁcant
ﬁgures.

Summary

• Mathematics is a major tool for doing physics.
• The very large and very small measurements in physics make it useful to express numbers in scientiﬁc notation.
• There is uncertainty in all measurements.
• The use of signiﬁcant ﬁgures is one way to keep track of uncertainty.
• Measurements must be written with the proper number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures and the results of calculations

must show the proper number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

• Rules for Determining the Number of Signiﬁcant Figures:

– All non-zero digits are signiﬁcant.
– All zeros between non-zero digits are signiﬁcant.
– All beginning zeros are not signiﬁcant.
– Ending zeros are signiﬁcant if the decimal point is actually written in but not signiﬁcant if the decimal

point is an understood decimal (the decimal point is not written in).

Physics is the branch of science that primarily studies matter, energy, and their interactions. Using the scientiﬁc
method, physicists hypothesize relationships, design experiments, and complete tests to turn those hypotheses
into theories. Physicists around the world not only work from the same body of knowledge—the same laws and
theories—but they also use standard units and the SI system of measurement to ensure that the replication of their
experiments is possible. Physics is more than numbers and equations; it is about asking how and why things work
and questioning everything we see in the natural world.

Everything in our universe moves. People, planets, and even galaxies are in constant motion. Physics gives us
ways to explain motion using not only words, but also equations and graphs. This description of motion, called
“kinematics,” involves properties such as position, speed, velocity, and acceleration. In this chapter, you will explore
kinematics in one dimension.

Chapter 2. Motion in a Straight Line

2.1 Position and Displacement

• Understand an object’s frame of reference.
• Describe the difference between distance and displacement.
• Identify the position, distance, and displacements in various descriptions of motions.

In stockcar races, drivers often travel 500 miles or more, but their ﬁnal displacement is only a few feet. Why?

Position, Distance, and Displacement

In order to study how something moves, we must know where it is. This location is an object’s position. To visualize
position for objects moving in a straight line, you can imagine the object is on a number line. It may be placed at
any point on the number line in the positive numbers or the negative numbers. It is common to choose the original
position of the object to be on the zero mark. In making the zero mark the reference point, you have chosen a frame
of reference. The exact position of an object is the separation between the object and the reference point.
When an object moves, we often refer to the amount it moves as the distance. Distance does not need a reference
point and does not need a direction. If an automobile moves 50 kilometers, the distance traveled is 50 kilometers
regardless of the starting point or the direction of movement. If we wish to ﬁnd the ﬁnal position of the automobile,
however, just having the distance traveled will not allow us to determine the ﬁnal position. We need to know the
starting point and the direction of the motion. The change in the position of the object is called its displacement. The
displacement must include a direction because the ﬁnal position may be either in the positive or negative direction
along the number line from the initial position. The displacement is a vector quantity and vectors are discussed in
the chapter "Vectors".
To return to the ﬁrst image, these cars travel a distance of 500 miles over the course of the race. However, they

21

2.1. Position and Displacement

www.ck12.org

are traveling in a circle, and the start and ﬁnish line are the same. Therefore, when the car ﬁnishes the race, it is in
essentially the same position it was when it started. The car’s total displacement is only a few feet.

Summary

• The length traveled by an object moving in any direction or even changing direction is called distance.
• The location of an object in a frame of reference is called position.
• For straight line motion, positions can be shown using a number line.
• The separation between original and ﬁnal position is called displacement.

• Explain the difference between speed and velocity.
• Deﬁne the concept of average velocity.
• Determine how to calculate average velocity using the equation, vav = ∆x
∆t

Test Pilot Neil Armstrong (later to become a famous astronaut) is seen here next to the X-15 ship after a research
ﬂight. The servo-actuated ball nose, seen at Armstrong’s right hand, provided accurate measurement of air speed at
hypersonic speeds. The X-15 was ﬂown over a period of nearly 10 years, and set the world’s unofﬁcial speed record
of 4,250 mph.
Average Velocity
In ordinary language, the words speed and velocity both refer to how fast an object is moving, and are often used
In physics, however, they are fundamentally different. Speed is the magnitude of an object’s
interchangeably.
motion, with no regard for the direction. Velocity, on the other hand, includes direction. It is a vector, and thus must
have a magnitude and a direction.
Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance travelled by the time interval. For example, someone who
takes 40 minutes to drive 20 miles north and then 20 miles south (to end up at the same place), has an average
speed of 40 miles divided by 40 minutes, or 1 mile per minute (60 mph). Average velocity, however, involves total
displacement, instead of distance. It is calculated by dividing the total displacement by the time interval. In this
example, the driver’s displacement is zero, which makes the average velocity zero mph.
Neither average speed nor average velocity implies a constant rate of motion. That is to say, an object might travel
at 10 m/s for 10 s and then travel at 20 m/s for 5 s and then travel at 100 m/s for 5 s. This motion would cover a

24

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Motion in a Straight Line

distance of 700 m in 20 s and the average speed would be 35 m/s. We would report the average speed during this 20
s interval to be 35 m/s and yet at no time during the interval was the speed necessarily 35 m/s.
Constant velocity is very different from average velocity. If an object traveled at 35 m/s for 20 s, it would travel the
same distance in the same time as the previous example but in the second case, the object’s velocity would always
be 35 m/s.
Example: The position of a runner as a function of time is plotted as moving along the x-axis of a coordinate
system. During a 3.00 s time interval, the runner’s position changes from x1 = 50.0 m to x2 = 30.5 m. What was
the runner’s average velocity?
Solution:
Displacement = 30.5 m− 50.0 m = −19.5 m (the object was traveling back toward zero)
∆t = 3.00 s
vave = ∆x

3.00 s = −6.50 m/s

∆t = −19.5 m

Summary

• Average speed is distance divided by time.
• Average velocity is displacement divided by time.

2.3 Instantaneous Velocity

• Deﬁne instantaneous velocity.
• Plot and interpret position vs time graphs.
• Determine the slope of a curve on a position vs time graph.
• Understand the difference between position vs time and velocity vs time graphs.

In a footrace such as the one shown here, the initial velocity of a runner is zero. The runner increases his velocity
out of the starting blocks and his velocity continues to increase as the race proceeds. For the well-trained athlete, his
highest velocity is maintained through the ﬁnish line.

Instantaneous Velocity

The instantaneous velocity of an object is the velocity of the object at a given moment. If the object is moving with
constant velocity, then the instantaneous velocity at every moment, the average velocity, and the constant velocity
are all the same.

Position vs Time Graphs

Consider a position versus time graph for an object starting at t = 0 and x = 0 that has a constant velocity of 80. m/s.

27

2.3. Instantaneous Velocity

www.ck12.org

The velocity of an object can be found from a position vs time graph. On a position vs time graph, the displacement is
the vertical separation between two points and the time interval is the horizontal separation. The ratio of displacement
to time interval is the average velocity. This ratio is also the slope of the line. Therefore, the slope of the straight
line is the average velocity. For the motion pictured above,
slope = rise
For accelerated motion (the velocity is constantly changing), the position vs time graph will be a curved line. The
slope of the curved line at any point is the instantaneous velocity at that time. If we were using calculus, the slope of
a curved line could be calculated. Without calculus, we approximate the instantaneous velocity at a particular point
by laying a straight edge along the curved line and estimating the slope.

In the image above, the red line is the position vs time graph and the blue line is an approximated slope for the line at
t = 2.5 seconds. The rise for this slope is approximately 170 m and the time interval (run) is 4.0 seconds. Therefore,
the approximated slope is 43 m/s.

Summary

• The slope of a position versus time graph is the velocity.
• For constant velocity motion, the slope gives the constant velocity, the average velocity, and the instantaneous

velocity at every point.

2.4 Average Acceleration

• Deﬁne average acceleration.
• Understand the mathematical relationship between initial velocity, acceleration, time, and ﬁnal velocity.

To escape from Earth’s orbit, space shuttles such as the Atlantis shown here must accelerate to 28,968 kilometers
per hour, called the shuttle’s escape velocity.

Average Acceleration

An object whose velocity is changing is said to be accelerating. Average acceleration, a is deﬁned as the rate of
change of velocity, or the change in velocity per unit time. The units of acceleration are distance over time squared.
A symbol with a bar over it is read as average – so a-bar is average acceleration.
Example: A car accelerates along a straight road from rest to +60.0 km/h in 5.00 s. What is the magnitude of its
average acceleration?
Solution:
The acceleration in this problem is read as kilometers per hour per second. In general, it is undesirable to have
two different units for the same quantity in a unit expression. In this case, it is undesirable to have both hours and
seconds. To eliminate this problem, we convert the hour units to seconds. Converting the original 60.0 km/h to m/s,
gives 17.0 m/s.
17.0 m/s
5.00 s = 3.40 m/s2
The acceleration is 3.40 m/s2.
Example: An automobile is moving along a straight highway in the positive direction and the driver steps on
the brakes. If the initial velocity is +15.0 m/s and 5.0 s is required to slow down to +5.0 m/s, what was the car’s
acceleration?

Note that an acceleration is merely a change in velocity. This change can be either positive or negative. A negative
change, such as that in the example problem above, is sometimes called negative acceleration or deceleration.

Acceleration that does not change in time is called uniform or constant acceleration. The velocity at the beginning
of the time interval is called initial velocity, vi, and the velocity at the end of the time interval is called ﬁnal velocity,

tion

• Plot and interpret a velocity vs time graph.
• Find the area under a curve on a velocity vs time graph and calculate the displacement from such a graph.
• Calculate the displacement of an object undergoing uniform acceleration when given two of the three quanti-

ties acceleration, time, velocity.

Long distance runners try to maintain constant velocity with very little acceleration or deceleration to conserve
energy.

Displacement During Constant Acceleration

When acceleration is constant, there are three equations that relate displacement to two of the other three quantities
we use to describe motion –time, velocity, and acceleration. These equations only work when acceleration is
constant, but there are, fortunately, quite a few cases of motion where the acceleration is constant. One of the
most common, if we ignore air resistance, are objects falling due to gravity.
When an object is moving with constant velocity, the displacement can be found by multiplying the velocity by the
time interval, as shown in the equation below
d = vt

If the object is moving with constant acceleration, but not a constant velocity, we can use a derivation of this equation.
Instead of using v, as velocity, we must calculate and use the average velocity using this equation:

36

www.ck12.org

vave = 1

2 (v f + vi)

Chapter 2. Motion in a Straight Line

The distance, then, for uniformly accelerating motion can be found by multiplying the average velocity by the time.
d = 1

(Equation 1)

2 (v f + vi)(t)

We know that the ﬁnal velocity for constantly accelerated motion can be found by multiplying the acceleration times
time and adding the result to the initial velocity, v f = vi + at.
The second equation that relates displacement, time, initial velocity, and ﬁnal velocity is generated by substituting
this equation into equation 1.
Start by distributing the 1/2 in equation 1 through:

d =

1
2

(v f + vi)(t) =

1

v f t +

2at2

2vit + 1

2vit + 1

2at2

(Equation 2)

= vit + 1
The third equation is formed by combining v f = vi + at and d = 1
and then substitute into the second equation, we get

d =(cid:0) 1

If we solve the ﬁrst equation for t

And solving for v f

(Equation 3)

Keep in mind that these three equations are only valid when acceleration is constant. In many cases, the initial
velocity can be set to zero and that simpliﬁes the three equations considerably. When acceleration is constant and
the initial velocity is zero, the equations can be simpliﬁed to:

Suppose we plot the velocity versus time graph for an object undergoing uniform acceleration. In this ﬁrst case, we
will assume the object started from rest.
If the object has a uniform acceleration of 6.0 m/s2 and started from rest, then each succeeding second, the velocity
will increase by 6.0 m/s. Here is the table of values and the graph.

In displacement versus time graphs, the slope of the line is the velocity of the object. In this case of a velocity versus
time graph, the slope of the line is the acceleration. If you take any segment of this line and determine the ∆y to ∆x

• There are three equations we can use when acceleration is constant to relate displacement to two of the other

three quantities we use to describe motion –time, velocity, and acceleration:

• When the initial velocity of the object is zero, these three equations become:

• The slope of a velocity versus time graph is the acceleration of the object.
• The area under the curve of a velocity versus time graph is the displacement that occurs during the given time

interval.

2.7 Acceleration Due to Gravity

• Describe the acceleration of falling objects due to gravity.
• Explain why falling objects with different masses accelerate at the same rate.

It’s a good thing this mountain climber’s safety gear is working, because it’s a long way down to the ground! If
he were to fall, he’d be moving really fast by the time he got there. The higher any object starts falling from
above Earth’s surface, the faster it’s traveling by the time it reaches the ground. Do you know why? The reason is
gravity.

Speeding up While Falling Down

Gravity is a force that pulls objects down toward the ground. When objects fall to the ground, gravity causes them
to accelerate. Acceleration is a change in velocity, and velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of
motion. Gravity causes an object to fall toward the ground at a faster and faster velocity the longer the object falls.
In fact, its velocity increases by 9.8 m/s2, so by 1 second after an object starts falling, its velocity is 9.8 m/s. By 2
seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 19.6 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s), and so on. The acceleration of a falling
object due to gravity is illustrated in the Figure 2.1. For a more detailed explanation of acceleration due to gravity,

Mass and Acceleration Due to Gravity

What if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the same distance above the ground?
The bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball, so the pull of gravity on it is greater. Would it fall to the
ground faster? No, the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time. The reason? The
more massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass, so it ends up moving at the same
acceleration as the soccer ball. This is true of all falling objects. They all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity,
unless air resistance affects one object more than another. For example, a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance
more than a falling acorn because of the leaf’s greater surface area. You can simulate the effect of air resistance on
acceleration due to gravity by doing the interactive animation at this URL: http://www.science-animations.com/su
pport-ﬁles/freefall.swf
Q: If a leaf and an acorn were to fall to the ground in the absence of air (that is, in a vacuum), how would this affect
their acceleration due to gravity?
A: They would both accelerate at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time.

Summary

• When gravity pulls objects toward the ground, it always causes them to accelerate at a rate of 9.8 m/s2.
• Regardless of differences in mass, all objects accelerate at the same rate due to gravity unless air resistance

affects one more than another.

What is a force? A force is a push or a pull. The movement experienced by the man above can be explained as
a combination of forces. Though gravitational force pulls him downward, the water shooting out of his jet pack
provides a force pushing him up. Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was the ﬁrst to study forces as the cause for
acceleration. The connections he understood are known as Newton’s Laws of Motions, and are explained in this
chapter.

This image is of Buzz Aldrin, one of the ﬁrst men to walk on the moon. Apollo 11 was the spaceﬂight that landed
the ﬁrst humans, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, on the moon on July 20, 1969. Armstrong became the ﬁrst to
step onto the lunar surface 6 hours later on July 21. As you probably already know, men weigh less on the moon
than on Earth; this is because the force of gravity is less on the moon than on Earth.

Newton’s First and Second Laws of Motion

A force is a push or a pull on an object. When you place a book on a table, the book pushes downward on the table
and the table pushes upward on the book. The two forces are equal and there is no resulting motion of the book. If,
on the other hand, you hold the book in the air and let go, the force of gravity will pull the book to the ground.
If you slide a book across the ﬂoor or a table, the book will experience a frictional force, which acts in the opposite
direction of the motion. This force will slow down the motion of the book and eventually bring it to rest. A smoother
surface has a smaller force of friction, which will allow the book to slide further before coming to rest. If a perfectly
smooth ﬂoor could be created, there would be no friction and the book would slide forever at constant speed.
Newton’s First Law of Motion states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will remain in
motion. It describes a phenomenon called inertia. Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist change in its state
of motion. In the absence of any force, an object will continue to move at the same constant speed and in the same
straight line. If the object is at rest, in the absence of any force, it will remain at rest. Newton’s First Law states that
an object with no force acting on it moves with constant velocity. (The constant velocity could, of course, be 0 m/s.)

m or more commonly, F = ma

Newton’s First Law is equivalent to saying that “if there is no net force on an object, there will be no acceleration.”
In the absence of acceleration, an object will remain at rest or will move with constant velocity in a straight line. The
acceleration of an object is the result of an unbalanced force. If an object undergoes two forces, the motion of the
object is determined by the net force. The magnitude of the acceleration is directly proportional to the magnitude of
the unbalanced force. The direction of the acceleration is the same direction as the direction of the unbalanced force.
The magnitude of the acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the object; the more massive the object,
the smaller the acceleration produced by the same force.
These relationships are stated in Newton’s Second Law of Motion: "the acceleration of an object is directly
proportional to the net force on the object and inversely proportional to the mass of the object."
Newton’s Second Law can be summarized in an equation:
a = F
According to Newton’s Second Law, a new force on an object causes it to accelerate. However, the larger the mass,
the smaller the acceleration. We say that a more massive object has a greater inertia.
The units for force are deﬁned by the equation for Newton’s Second Law. Suppose we wish to express the force that
will give a 1.00 kg object an acceleration of 1.00 m/s2.
F = ma = (1.00 kg)(1.00 m/s2) = 1.00 kg· m/s2
This unit is deﬁned as 1.00 newton or 1.00 N.
kg·m
s2 = newton
Example Problem: What force is required to accelerate a 2000. kg car at 2.000 m/s2?
Solution: F = ma = (2000. kg)(2.000 m/s2) = 4000. N
Example Problem: A net force of 150 N is exerted on a rock. The rock has an acceleration of 20. m/s2 due to this
force. What is the mass of the rock?
Solution: m = F

= 7.5 kg

a = (150 N)
(20. m/s2

)

Example Problem: A net force of 100. N is exerted on a ball. If the ball has a mass of 0.72 kg, what acceleration
will it undergo?
Solution: a = F

= 140 m/s2

m = (100. N)
(0.72 kg)

Summary

• A force is a push or pull on an object.
• Newton’s First Law states that an object with no net force acting on it remains at rest or moves with constant

velocity in a straight line.

• Newton’s Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force on the

object and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
• Newton’s Second Law is expressed as an equation, F = ma.

3.2 Newton’s Third Law of Motion

• Explain Newton’s Third Law of Motion
• Understand the theory of equal and opposite forces

The image above is a NASA artist’s conceptual illustration of a space elevator. It was imagined as a geo-stationary
transfer station for passengers and cargo between Earth and space. This idea was not pursued beyond the initial
discussion and evaluation stage, but the scientists involved believe the concept will become truly possible with the
expected technological advances of the late 21st century.

Newton’s Third Law of Motion

Where do forces come from? Observations suggest that a force applied to an object is always applied by another
object. A hammer strikes a nail, a car pulls a trailer, and a person pushes a grocery cart. Newton realized that forces
are not so one-sided. When the hammer exerts a force on the nail, the nail also exerts a force on the hammer—after
all, the hammer comes to rest after the interaction. This led to Newton’s Third Law of Motion, which states that
whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object also exerts a force on the ﬁrst object, equal
in magnitude and opposite in direction.
This law is sometimes paraphrased as: “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.” A very important
point to remember is that the two forces are on different objects—never on the same object. It is frequently the
case that one of the objects moves as a result of the force applied but the motion of the other object in the opposite
direction is not apparent. Consider the situation where an ice skater is standing at the edge of the skating rink
holding on to the side rail. If the skater exerts a force on the rail, the rail is held in place with tremendous friction
and therefore, will not move in any noticeable way. The skater, on the other hand, had little friction with the ice, and
therefore will be accelerated in the direction opposite of her original push. This is the process people use to jump
up into the air. The person’s feet exert force on the ground and the ground exerts an equal and opposite force on the

49

3.2. Newton’s Third Law of Motion

www.ck12.org

person’s feet. The force on the feet is sufﬁcient to raise the person off the ground. The force on the ground has little
effect because the Earth is so large. One of the accelerations is visible but the other is not visible.
A case where the reaction motion due to the reaction force is visible is the case of a person throwing a heavy object
out of a small boat, such as a kayak. The object is accelerated in one direction and the boat is accelerated in the
opposite direction. In this case, both the motion of the object is visible and the motion of the boat in the opposite
direction is also visible.
Rockets also work in this manner. It is a misconception that the rocket moves forward because the escaping gas
pushes on the ground or the surrounding air to make the rocket go forward. Rockets work in outer space where there
is no ground or surrounding air. The rocket exerts a force on the gases causing them to be expelled and the gases
exert a force on the rocket causing it to be accelerated forward.

Summary

• A force applied to an object is always applied by another object.
• Newton’s Third Law of Motion states, “Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second

object also exerts a force on the ﬁrst object, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.”

3.3 Mass versus Weight

• Distinguish between mass and weight.
• Understand the relationship between mass and weight due to the acceleration of gravity.
• Know how to determine if a number gives mass or weight based on the units.

Astronauts in training often ﬂy in the KC-135 training aircraft to experience near-weightlessness. Three Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency astronauts—Akihiko Hoshide, Satoshi Furukawa, and Naoko Yamazaki—are shown
here during such an exercise. Though they experience near-weightlessness, we can see that their mass has not
changed. What is the relationship between mass and weight?

Mass and Weight

The mass of an object is deﬁned as the amount of matter in the object. The amount of mass an object has does not
change; a moon rock that has been returned to Earth has the same mass on the Earth’s surface as it had on the moon.
The amount of mass in an object is measured by comparing the object to known masses on an instrument called a
balance.

51

3.3. Mass versus Weight

www.ck12.org

Using the balance shown here, the object would be placed in one pan and known masses would be placed in the
other pan until the pans were exactly balanced. When balanced, the mass of the object would be equal to the sum
of the known masses in the other pan. A balance will work in any location; whether on the moon or on Earth, the
moon rock mentioned earlier will have the same mass.
The weight of an object is the force pulling the object downward. On Earth, this would be the gravitational force
of the Earth on the object. On the moon, this would be the gravitational force of the moon on the object. The
gravitational force of the moon is one-sixth the magnitude of the gravitational force of the Earth; the weight of the
moon rock on the moon will be one-sixth the weight of the moon rock on the Earth’s surface. Weight is measured in
force units—newtons—by a calibrated spring scale as shown here.

The force of gravity is given by Newton’s Second Law, F = ma, where F is the force of gravity in newtons, m is
the mass of the object in kilograms, and a is the acceleration due to gravity, 9.81 m/s2. When the formula is used
speciﬁcally for ﬁnding weight from mass or vice versa, it may appear as W = mg.
Example Problem: What is the weight of an object sitting on the Earth’s surface if the mass of the object is 43.7
kg?
Solution: W = mg = (43.7 kg)(9.81 m/s2) = 429 N
Example Problem: What is the mass of an object whose weight sitting on the Earth is 2570 N?
m = W

a = 2570 N

9.81 m/s2 = 262 kg

3.4 Friction

• Explain the causes of surface friction.
• Deﬁne the coefﬁcient of friction.
• Calculate frictional forces.
• Calculate net forces when friction is involved.

Tennis is played on a variety of court surfaces: grass, clay, hardcourt, and even carpet. Players know that matches
on different surfaces are distinctly different games. The ball bounces differently, and shoes slip on some surfaces
but stick on others. These differences are a result of friction.

Friction

Friction is the force that resists motion. In most beginning physics classes, friction is ignored. Concepts can be
understood and calculations made assuming friction to be nonexistent. Whenever physics intersects with the real
world, however, friction must be taken into account. Friction exists between two touching surfaces because even the
smoothest looking surface is quite rough on a microscopic scale.

54

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Forces

Every surface has microscopic bumps, lumps, and imperfections, emphasized as in the image above. If we try to
slide the top block over the lower block, there will be numerous collisions as the bumps impact each other. The
forward motion causes the collisions with bumps which then exert a force in opposite way the block is moving. The
force of friction always opposes whatever motion is causing the friction.
The force of friction between these two blocks is related to two factors. The ﬁrst factor is the roughness of the
surfaces that are interacting, which is called the coefﬁcient of friction, µ (Greek letter mu). The second factor is the
magnitude of the force pushing the top block down onto the lower block. It is reasonable that the more forcefully
the blocks are pushed together, the more difﬁcult it will be for one to slide over the other. The force pushing these
blocks together is the result of gravity acting on the top block and pressing it against the bottom block, which resists
the weight with an equal and opposite force called the normal force. The force of friction can be calculated by
Ffriction = µ× Fnormal and the normal force will be equal to the force of gravity on the object, if the object is on a ﬂat
surface (one parallel to the ground).
This is an approximate but reasonably useful and accurate relationship. It is not exact because µ depends on a variety
of factors, including whether the surface is wet or dry.
The frictional force we have been discussing is referred to as sliding friction; it is involved when one surface is
sliding over another. If you have ever tried to slide a heavy object across a rough surface, you may be aware that it
is a great deal easier to keep an object sliding than it is to start the object sliding in the ﬁrst place. When the object
to slide is resting on a surface with no movement, the force of friction is called static friction and it is somewhat
greater than sliding friction. Surfaces that move against one another will have both a coefﬁcient of static friction
and a coefﬁcient of sliding friction, and the two values will not be the same. For example, the coefﬁcient of sliding
friction for ice on ice is 0.03 whereas the coefﬁcient of static friction for ice on ice is 0.10—more than three times
as great.
Example Problem: A box weighing 2000. N is sliding across a cement ﬂoor. The force pushing the box is 500. N,
and the coefﬁcient of sliding friction between the box and the ﬂoor is 0.20. What is the acceleration of the box?
Solution: In this case, the box is sliding along the ground, so the normal force for the box is equal to its weight.
Using the normal force and the coefﬁcient of friction, we can ﬁnd the frictional force. We can also ﬁnd the mass
of the box from its weight since we know the acceleration due to gravity. Then we can ﬁnd the net force and the
acceleration.

Example Problem: Two boxes are connected by a rope running over a pulley, as shown in the ﬁgure below. The
coefﬁcient of sliding friction between box A and the table is 0.20. (Ignore the masses of the rope and the pulley and
any friction in the pulley.) The mass of box A is 5.0 kg and the mass of box B is 2.0 kg. The entire system (both
boxes) will move together with the same acceleration and velocity. Find the acceleration of the system.

55

3.4. Friction

www.ck12.org

Solution: The force acting to move the system is the weight of box B, and the force resisting the movement is the
force of friction between the table and box A. The mass of the system is the sum of the masses of both boxes. The
acceleration of the system can be found by dividing the net force by the total mass.
FN(box A) = mg = (5.0 kg)(9.8 m/s2) = 49 N
Ffriction = µFN = (0.20)(49 N) = 9.8 N
Weight of box B = mg = (2.0 kg)(9.8 m/s2) = 19.6 N
FNET = 19.6 N− 9.8 N = 9.8 N
a = FNETmass = 9.8 N

To understand physics, it is necessary to understand how objects move. Acted on by forces, objects are subject to
Newton’s Three Laws of Motion. The most widespread force is gravity, which has the same effect on all objects all
over the world; it is the force of gravity that gives an object of some mass its weight. Finally, a signiﬁcant force often
overlooked in elementary physics courses is friction, but understanding friction equations and friction’s inﬂuence on
an object’s motion is necessary to properly calculate its trajectories.

Vectors

Drifting is a driving technique in which the driver intentionally over-steers while cornering—causing loss of traction
in the rear wheels—but still maintains control. Though the wheels indicate the car is traveling in one direction,
it is actually traveling a different way. Regardless, the car’s motion can be described by its speed and direction.
Some quantities do not have a direction associated with them. Mass, for example, is a measured number but has no
associated direction. The quantities that do require direction are called vectors. All forces that act on objects are
vector quantities, and most objects are acted upon by multiple forces. To understand how the object moves under
inﬂuence of multiple forces, it is often necessary to sum up different vectors. This chapter explains vectors, as well
as how to break them down and add them together.

Graphical Methods Vector Addition

In physics, a quantity, such as mass, length, or speed that is completely speciﬁed by its magnitude and has no
direction is called a scalar. A vector, on the other hand, is a quantity possessing both magnitude and direction. A
vector quantity is typically represented by an arrow-tipped line segment. The length of the line, drawn to scale,
represents the magnitude of the quantity. The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the vector. Not only
can vectors be represented graphically, but they can also be added graphically.
For one dimensional vector addition, the ﬁrst vector is placed on a number line with the tail of the vector on the
origin. The second vector is placed with its tail exactly on the arrow head of the ﬁrst vector. The sum of the two
vectors is the vector that begins at the origin and ends at the arrow head of the ﬁnal added vector.
Consider the following two vectors.

Chapter 4. Vectors

The red vector has a magnitude of 11 in the positive direction on the number line. The blue vector has a magnitude
of -3, indicating 3 units in the negative direction on the number line. In order to add these two vectors, we place one
of the vectors on a number line and then the second vector is placed on the same number line such that its origin is
on the arrow head of the ﬁrst vector.

The sum of these two vectors is the vector that begins at the origin of the ﬁrst vector (the red one) and ends at the
arrow head of the second (blue) vector. So the sum of these two vectors is the purple vector, as shown below.

The vector sum of the ﬁrst two vectors is a vector that begins at the origin and has a magnitude of 8 units in the
positive direction.
If we were adding three or four vectors all in one dimension, we would continue to place them
head to toe in sequence on the number line. The sum would be the vector that begins at the beginning of the ﬁrst
vector and goes to the ending of the ﬁnal vector.

Adding Vectors in Two Dimensions

In the following image, vectors A and B represent the two displacements of a person who walked 90. m east and
then 50. m north. We want to add these two vectors to get the vector sum of the two movements.

The graphical process for adding vectors in two dimensions is to place the tail of the second vector on the arrow
head of the ﬁrst vector as shown above.
The sum of the two vectors is the vector that begins at the origin of the ﬁrst vector and goes to the ending of the
second vector, as shown below.

4.1. Graphical Methods of Vector Addition

www.ck12.org

If we are using totally graphic means of adding these vectors, the magnitude of the sum would be determined by
measuring the length of the sum vector and comparing it to the original standard. We would also use a compass to
measure the angle of the summation vector.
If we are using calculation means, we can divide 50. m by 90. m and determine inverse tangent of the dividend.
The result of 29.05 indicates the angle of 29° north of east. The length of the sum vector can also be determined
mathematically by the Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2. In this case, the length of the hypotenuse would be the
square root of (8100 + 2500) or 103 m.
If three or four vectors are to be added by graphical means, we would continue to place each new vector head to toe
with the vectors to be added until all the vectors were in the coordinate system. The sum vector is the vector from
the origin of the ﬁrst vector to the arrowhead of the last vector. The magnitude and direction of the sum vector can
be measured.

Summary

• Scalars are quantities, such as mass, length, or speed, that are completely speciﬁed by magnitude and have no

direction.

• Vectors are quantities possessing both magnitude and direction and can be represented by an arrow; the
direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the quantity and the length of the arrow is proportional to
the magnitude.

• Vectors that are in one dimension can be added arithmetically.
• Vectors that are in two dimensions are added geometrically.
• When vectors are added graphically, graphs must be done to scale and answers are only as accurate as the

graphing.

Resolving Vectors into Axial Components

We know that when two vectors are in the same dimension, they can be added arithmetically. Suppose we have
two vectors that are on a north-south, east-west grid, as shown below. One of the methods we can use to add these
vectors is to resolve each one into a pair of vectors that lay on the north-south and east-west axes.

The two vectors we are to add is a force of 65 N at 30° north of east and a force of 35 N at 60° north of west.

We can resolve each of the vectors into two components on the axes lines. Each vector is resolved into a component
on the north-south axis and a component on the east-west axis.
Using trigonometry, we can resolve (break down) each of these vectors into a pair of vectors that lay on the axial
lines (shown in red above).
The east-west component of the ﬁrst vector is (65 N)(cos 30° ) = (65 N)(0.866) = 56.3 N east
The north-south component of the ﬁrst vector is (65 N)(sin 30°) = (65 N)(0.500) = 32.5 N north
The east-west component of the 2nd vector is (35 N)(cos 60°) = (35 N)(0.500) = 17.5 N west
The north-south component of the 2nd vector is (35 N)(sin 60°) = (35 N)(0.866) = 30.3 N north

Summary

• Vectors can be resolved into component vectors that lie on the axes lines.

Vector Addition

Adding Vectors in Two Dimensions
In the following image, vectors A and B represent the two displacements of a person who walked 90. m east and
then 50. m north. We want to add these two vectors to get the vector sum of the two movements.

The graphical process for adding vectors in two dimensions is to place the tail of the second vector on the arrow
head of the ﬁrst vector as shown above.
The sum of the two vectors is the vector that begins at the origin of the ﬁrst vector and goes to the ending of the
second vector, as shown below.

If we are using totally graphic means of adding these vectors, the magnitude of the sum can be determined by
measuring the length of the sum vector and comparing it to the original standard. We then use a compass to measure
the angle of the summation vector.

Chapter 4. Vectors

If we are using calculation, we ﬁrst determine the inverse tangent of 50 units divided by 90 units and get the angle
of 29° north of east. The length of the sum vector can then be determined mathematically by the Pythagorean
theorem, a2 + b2 = c2. In this case, the length of the hypotenuse would be the square root of (8100 + 2500), or 103
units.
If three or four vectors are to be added by graphical means, we would continue to place each new vector head to toe
with the vectors to be added until all the vectors were in the coordinate system. The resultant, or sum, vector would
be the vector from the origin of the ﬁrst vector to the arrowhead of the last vector; the magnitude and direction of
this sum vector would then be measured.

Mathematical Methods of Vector Addition

We can add vectors mathematically using trig functions, the law of cosines, or the Pythagorean theorem.
If the vectors to be added are at right angles to each other, such as the example above, we would assign them to the
sides of a right triangle and calculate the sum as the hypotenuse of the right triangle. We would also calculate the
direction of the sum vector by using an inverse sin or some other trig function.
Suppose, however, that we wish to add two vectors that are not at right angles to each other. Let’s consider the
vectors in the following images.

The two vectors we are to add are a force of 65 N at 30° north of east and a force of 35 N at 60° north of west.
We know that vectors in the same dimension can be added by regular arithmetic. Therefore, we can resolve each of
these vectors into components that lay on the axes as pictured below. The resolution of vectors reduces each vector
to a component on the north-south axis and a component on the east-west axis.

After resolving each vector into two components, we can now mathematically determine the magnitude of the
components. Once we have done that, we can add the components in the same direction arithmetically. This will
give us two vectors that are perpendicular to each other and can be the legs of a right triangle.
The east-west component of the ﬁrst vector is (65 N)(cos 30°) = (65 N)(0.866) = 56.3 N north

67

4.3. Vector Addition

(cid:112)

The north-south component of the ﬁrst vector is (65 N)(sin 30°) = (65 N)(0.500) = 32.5 N north
The east-west component of the second vector is (35 N)(cos 60°) = (35 N)(0.500) = 17.5 N west
The north-south component of the second vector is (35 N)(sin 60°) = (35 N)(0.866) = 30.3 N north
The sum of the two east-west components is 56.3 N - 17.5 N = 38.8 N east
The sum of the two north-south components is 32.5 N + 30.3 N = 62.8 N north
We can now consider those two vectors to be the sides of a right triangle and ﬁnd the length and direction of the
hypotenuse using the Pythagorean Theorem and trig functions.

38.82 + 62.82 = 74 N
74 so x = sin−1 0.84 so x = 58◦

c =
sin x = 62.8
The direction of the sum vector is 74 N at 58° north of east.
Perpendicular vectors have no components in the other direction. For example, if a boat is ﬂoating down a river due
south, and you are paddling the boat due east, the eastward vector has no component in the north-south direction
and therefore, has no effect on the north-south motion. If the boat is ﬂoating down the river at 5 mph south and
you paddle the boat eastward at 5 mph, the boat continues to ﬂoat southward at 5 mph. The eastward motion has
absolutely no effect on the southward motion. Perpendicular vectors have NO effect on each other.
Example Problem: A motorboat heads due east at 16 m/s across a river that ﬂows due north at 9.0 m/s.
(a) What is the resultant velocity of the boat?
(b) If the river is 135 m wide, how long does it take the boat to reach the other side?
(c) When the boat reaches the other side, how far downstream will it be?
Solution:
Sketch:

(a) Since the two motions are perpendicular to each other, they can be assigned to the legs of a right triangle and the
hypotenuse (resultant) calculated.

c =

(16 m/s)2 + (9.0 m/s)2 = 18 m/s

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Vectors

The resultant is 18 m/s at 30° north of east.
(b) The boat is traveling across the river at 16 m/s due to the motor. The current is perpendicular and therefore has
no effect on the speed across the river. The time required for the trip can be determined by dividing the distance by
the velocity.
v = 135 m
t = d
(c) The boat is traveling across the river for 8.4 seconds and therefore, it is also traveling downstream for 8.4
seconds. We can determine the distance downstream the boat will travel by multiplying the speed downstream by
the time of the trip.
ddownstream = (vdownstream)(t) = (9.0 m/s)(8.4 s) = 76 m

16 m/s = 8.4 s

Summary

• Vectors can be added mathematically using geometry and trigonometry.
• Vectors that are perpendicular to each other have no effect on each other.
• Vector addition can be accomplished by resolving the vectors to be added into components those vectors, and

then completing the addition with the perpendiuclar components.

4.4 Gravitational Force and Inclined Plane

• Resolve the weight of an object sitting on an inclined plane into the normal force and the parallel force.
• Calculate the acceleration of an object resting on an inclined plane given the angle of the incline and the

weight of the object.

This photograph was taken by Apollo 8 crewmember Bill Anders on December 24, 1968, showing the Earth rising
above the lunar surface. Gravitational forces keep the moon orbiting the Earth.

Gravitational Force and Inclined Planes

Every object has a center of gravity. The center of gravity is the point at which the entire weight of a body may
be considered to be concentrated; if supported at this point, the body would remain in equilibrium in any position.
For example, if we were discussing a 12-inch ruler, the center of gravity for the ruler would be at the center of the
6-inch line. You could put your ﬁnger directly under the 6-inch line to hold the ruler and it would not fall either left
or right. If you placed your ﬁnger underneath any other place on the ruler, it would fall off to one side or the other.
The force of gravity acting on an object is directed through this center of gravity and toward the center of the Earth.
The object’s weight, W , can be represented by a vector directed down (along the line the object would fall if it were
dropped). When this object is resting on a level surface, its weight acts perpendicularly to the surface and will be
equal to the normal force, which is the force keeping the object from falling through the table. The normal force is
always perpendicular to the surface; when the surface is not level, the normal force will be equal to some subset of
the weight. This is seen in the image below, which shows a box on an inclined plane.

71

4.4. Gravitational Force and Inclined Plane

www.ck12.org

The weight of the box acts through the center of gravity and directly towards the center of the Earth. The weight
vector in the sketch is red and labeled W. The normal force acts perpendicular to the surface of the inclined plane
to keep the box from falling through the plane. The force of the box on the plane is equal to the normal force (as
speciﬁed in Newton’s Third Law). Since the normal force and the force of the box acting on the plane are the same,
we can reference the force against the plane as the normal force. That force, FN, is purple in the image above. In
addition, there is a force acting on the box parallel to the surface of the plane and pushing the box down the plane.
This force is drawn in blue and is called the parallel force. The normal force and the parallel force add to give the
weight.
The triangle of the black inclined plane and the yellow triangle are similar triangles; the corresponding sides are
mutually perpendicular. Therefore, the angle at the top of the yellow triangle is also 30◦. For a right triangle, if we
know one other angle (the 30◦ angle) and one side (the weight), we can calculate the other two sides. Therefore, we
can calculate the parallel force pushing the box down the incline and we could also calculate the acceleration of the
box.
Example Problem: A 500. N box is resting on a plane inclined at 30◦ with the horizontal.
(a) Find the normal force and the parallel force acting on this box.
(b) Find the acceleration of the box.
Solution:
(a) FN = W cos30◦ = (500. N)(0.866) = 433 N
Fparallel = W sin30◦ = (500. N)(0.500) = 250. N
(b) mass of the box = 500. N

9.81 m/s2 = 51.0 kg

a =

Fparallel
mass = 250. N

51.0 kg = 4.90 m/s2 (The direction is down the plane.)

Summary

• Each object has a center of gravity, which is the point at which the weight can be considered to be concentrated

when balancing the object.

• The weight of an object is a vector that is directed toward the center of the Earth.
• When an object is placed on an inclined plane, its weight vector can be resolved into the normal force, which

• center of gravity: The point at which the entire weight of a body may be considered to be concentrated so

that if supported at this point the body would remain in equilibrium in any position.

• normal force: In mechanics, it is the component, perpendicular to the surface of contact, of the contact force
exerted on an object by, for example, the surface of a ﬂoor or wall, preventing the object from penetrating the
surface.

Vectors in one direction can be added arithmetically, and those in different directions can be added geometrically or
broken down into their components before being added. Perpendicular components of vectors have no inﬂuence
on each other, and addition of perpendicular vectors is easily accomplished with Pythagorean’s Theorem and
trigonometric functions.

the snowboarder as he jumped. You can clearly see that there are both vertical and horizontal components to his
overall parabolic motion. To complete calculations on this sort of two-dimensional motion, it is necessary to consider
the vertical and horizontal vectors separately. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to accurately estimate the

• Find the time for a horizontally launched projectile to strike the ground.
• Calculate the range of a horizontally launched projectile.

The activity of bike jumping, like other sports that involve vector motions in perpendicular directions, requires more
physical practice than mathematical analysis. The laws of physics apply to the activity, however, whether the biker
is aware of them or not.

Projectile Motion for an Object Launched Horizontally

Objects that are launched into the air are called projectiles. The path followed by a projectile in motion is called
a trajectory. The image of the snowboarder in the chapter introduction showed his trajectory; every object has a
trajectory even when we cannot see it. Projectile motion, or the object’s trajectory, is described in terms of position,
velocity, and acceleration. Even with only an object’s current location, velocity, and acceleration, we can calculate
when and where the object will land. Our knowledge that perpendicular components of vectors do not affect each
other allow us to easily analyze the motion of projectiles.

In the diagram, two balls (one red and one blue) are dropped at the same time. The red ball is released with no
horizontal motion and the blue ball is dropped but also given a horizontal velocity of 10 m/s. As the balls fall to the
ﬂoor, a photograph is taken every second so that in 5 seconds, we have 5 images of the two balls. Each vertical line
on the diagram represents 5 m. Since the blue ball has a horizontal velocity of 10 m/s, you will see that for every
second, the blue ball has moved horizontally 10 m. That is, in each second, the blue ball has increased its horizontal
distance by 10 m. This horizontal motion is due to the ball’s constant velocity.
The red ball was dropped straight down with no horizontal velocity and therefore, in each succeeding second, the
red ball falls straight down with no horizontal motion. The increasing distances between seconds in the red ball’s
motion indicates that this motion is accelerating.
A very important point here is that the vertical motion of these two balls is identical. That is, they each fall exactly
the same distance vertically in each succeeding second. The constant horizontal velocity of the blue ball has no
effect on its accelerated vertical motion. Therefore, the vertical motion of the blue ball can be analyzed exactly the
same as the vertical motion of the red ball.
Example Problem: If an arrow is ﬁred from a bow with a perfectly horizontal velocity of 60.0 m/s and the arrow
was 2.00 m above the ground when the it was released, how far will the arrow ﬂy horizontally before it strikes the
ground?
Solution: This problem is solved by determining how long it takes the arrow to fall to the ground in exactly the same
manner as if the arrow was dropped with no horizontal velocity. The time required for the arrow to fall to the ground
will be the same time that the arrow ﬂies horizontally at 60.0 m/s, so

base of the cliff. At what speed was it thrown?
Solution: We can calculate how long it takes for a rock to free fall 100.0 m and then divide this time into the
horizontal distance to get the horizontal velocity.

Projectile Motion for an Object Launched at an Angle

When an object is projected from rest at an upward angle, its initial velocity can be resolved into two components.
These two components operate independently of each other. The upward velocity undergoes constant downward
acceleration which will result in it rising to a highest point and then falling backward to the ground. The horizontal
motion is constant velocity motion and undergoes no changes due to gravity.The analysis of the motion involves
dealing with the two motions independently.

80

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Motion in Two Dimensions

Example Problem: A cannon ball is ﬁred with an initial velocity of 100. m/s at an angle of 45° above the
horizontal. What maximum height will it reach and how far will it ﬂy horizontally?
Solution: The ﬁrst step in the analysis of this motion is to resolve the initial velocity into its vertical and horizontal
components.
vi−up = (100. m/s)(sin45◦) = (100. m/s)(0.707) = 70.7 m/s
vi−horizontal = (100. m/s)(cos45◦) = (100. m/s)(0.707) = 70.7 m/s
We will deal with the vertical motion ﬁrst. The vertical motion is symmetrical. As the object rises to its highest
point and then falls back down, it will travel the same distance in each direction, and take the same amount of time.
This is often hard to accept, but the amount of time the object takes to come to a stop at its highest point is the same
amount of time it takes to return to where it was launched from. Similarly, the initial velocity upward will be the
same magnitude (opposite in direction) as the ﬁnal velocity when it returns to its original height. There are several
ways we could approach the upward motion. We could calculate the time it would take gravity to bring the initial
velocity to rest. Or, we could calculate the time it would take gravity to change the initial velocity from +70.7 m/s
to -70.0 m/s. Yet another way would be to calculate the time it takes for the object to return to its original height.
v f = vi + at
If we calculate the time required for the ball to rise up to its highest point and come to rest, the initial velocity is 70.7
m/s and the ﬁnal velocity is 0 m/s. Since we have called the upward velocity positive, then the acceleration must be
negative or -9.80 m/s2.

so t =

v f−vi
a

t =

v f−vi
a = 0 m/s−70.7 m/s

−9.80 m/s2 = 7.21 s

Since this is the time required for the cannon ball to rise up to its highest point and come to rest, then the time
required for the entire trip up and down would be double this value, or 14.42 s. The maximum height reached can be
calculated by multiplying the time for the upward trip by the average vertical velocity. Since the object’s velocity at
the top is 0 m/s, the average upward velocity during the trip up is one-half the initial velocity.

vup−ave =(cid:0) 1

(cid:1) (70.7 m/s) = 35.3 m/s

height = (vup−ave)(tup) = (35.3 m/s)(7.21 s) = 255 m
The horizontal distance traveled during the ﬂight is calculated by multiplying the total time by the constant horizontal
velocity.
dhorizontal = (14.42 s)(70.7 m/s) = 1020 m
Example Problem: A golf ball was hit into the air with an initial velocity of 4.47 m/s at an angle of 66° above

vi−up = (4.47 m/s)(sin66◦) = (4.47 m/s)(0.913) = 4.08 m/s

height = (vup−ave)(tup) = (2.04 m/s)(0.416 s) = 0.849 m
ttotal trip = (2)(0.416 s) = 0.832 s
dhorizontal = (0.832 s)(1.82 m/s) = 1.51 m
Example Problem: Suppose a cannon ball is ﬁred downward from a 50.0 m high cliff at an angle of 45° with an
initial velocity of 80.0 m/s. How far horizontally will it land from the base of the cliff?
Solution: In this case, the initial vertical velocity is downward and the acceleration due to gravity will increase this
downward velocity.
vi−down = (80.0 m/s)(sin45◦) = (80.0 m/s)(0.707) = 56.6 m/s
vi−hor = (80.0 m/s)(cos45◦) = (80.0 m/s)(0.707) = 56.6 m/s
d = vi−downt + 1
2at2
50.0 = 56.6t + 4.9t2
Changing to standard quadratic form yields 4.9t2 + 56.6t − 50.0 = 0
This equation can be solved with the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula will produce two possible solutions

= 0.816 s

t =
The other solution to the quadratic formula is -12.375 s. Clearly, the cannon ball doesn’t take -12 seconds to ﬂy.
Therefore, we take the positive answer. Using the quadratic formula will give you two answers; be careful to think
about the answer you get - does it make sense?
To solve the problem, we plug the speed and time into the equation for distance:
dhorizontal = (0.816 s)(56.6 m/s) = 46.2 m

Summary

• To calculate projectile motion at an angle, ﬁrst resolve the initial velocity into its horizontal and vertical

components.

• Analysis of projectile motion involves dealing with two motions independently.
• Vertical components will always have the acceleration of gravity acting on them.
• Vertical motion is symmetrical - the distance and time are the same in the rise as in the fall; the ﬁnal velocity

will have the same magnitude as the initial velocity but in the opposite direction.

• Horizontal components will never be effected by gravity; it is constant velocity motion.

Circular Motion

The earth is a sphere. If you draw a horizontal straight line from a point on the surface of the earth, the surface of
the earth drops away from the line. The distance that the earth drops away from the horizontal line is very small
–so small, in fact, that we cannot represent it well in a drawing. In the sketch below, if the blue line is 1600 m, the
amount of drop (the red line) would be 0.20 m. If the sketch were drawn to scale, the red line would be too short to
see.

Chapter 5. Motion in Two Dimensions

When an object is launched exactly horizontally in projectile motion, it travels some distance horizontally before it
strikes the ground. In the present discussion, we wish to imagine a projectile ﬁred horizontally on the surface of the
earth such that while traveling 1600 m horizontally, the object would fall exactly 0.20 m. If this could occur, then
the object would fall exactly the amount necessary during its horizontal motion to remain at the surface of the earth,
but not touching it. In such a case, the object would travel all the way around the earth continuously and circle the
earth, assuming there were no obstacles, such as mountains.
What initial horizontal velocity would be necessary for this to occur? We ﬁrst calculate the time to fall the 0.20 m:

(cid:114)2d

(cid:115)

t =

a =

(2)(0.20 m)
9.80 m/s2 = 0.20 s

The horizontal velocity necessary to travel 1600 m in 0.20 s is 8000 m/s. Thus, the necessary initial horizontal
velocity is 8000 m/s.
In order to keep an object traveling in a circular path, there must be an acceleration toward the center of the circle.
This acceleration is called centripetal acceleration. In the case of satellites orbiting the earth, the centripetal
acceleration is caused by gravity. If you were swinging an object around your head on a string, the centripetal
acceleration would be caused by your hand pulling on the string toward the center of the circle.
It is important to note that the object traveling in a circle has a constant speed but does not have a constant velocity.
This is because direction is part of velocity; when an object changes its direction, it is changing its velocity. Hence
the object’s acceleration. The acceleration in the case of uniform circular motion is the change in the direction of
the velocity, but not its magnitude.
For an object traveling in a circular path, the centripetal acceleration is directly related to the square of the velocity
of the object and inversely related to the radius of the circle.

ac =

v2
r

Taking a moment to consider the validity of this equation can help to clarify what it means. Imagine a yo-yo. Instead
of using it normally, let it fall to the end of the string, and then spin it around above your head. If we were to
increase the speed at which we rotate our hand, we increase the velocity of the yo-yo - it is spinning faster. As it
spins faster, it also changes direction faster. The acceleration increases. Now let’s think about the bottom of the
equation: the radius. If we halve the length of the yo-yo string (bring the yo-yo closer to us), we make the yo-yo’s
velocity greater. Again, it moves faster, which increases the acceleration. If we make the string longer again, this
decreases the acceleration. We now understand why the relationship between the radius and the acceleration is an
inverse relationship - as we decrease the radius, the acceleration increases, and visa versa.

Solution: We ﬁrst determine the velocity of the ball using the facts that the circumference of the circle is 2πr and
the ball goes around exactly twice per second.

We then use the velocity and radius in the centripetal acceleration equation.

Centripetal Force

Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration. Objects that move in uniform circular
motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the
center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or
the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a
massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain.
Newton’s second law shows the relationship between force and acceleration, F = ma. Since we have formulas
expressing the relationships for centripetal acceleration, they can easily be altered to show the relationships for
centripetal force.

Common Misconceptions

Chapter 5. Motion in Two Dimensions

Many people incorrectly use the term centrifugal force instead of centripetal force. Often, you will hear the term
centrifugal force used to describe the outward force pushing an object away from the center of a circle. In reality,
however, centrifugal forces are inertial, or ﬁctional, forces. They only exist in the frame of reference of the object
that is moving and, even then, are theoretical. Physicists dealing in a moving frame of reference use centrifugal
forces to ease calculations.

• State the relationships that exist between velocity, acceleration, and displacement in simple harmonic motion.
• Calculate any of the variables in the equation F = kx, when given the other two.
• Understand the relationship between simple harmonic motion and circular motion.

A Foucault pendulum is a pendulum suspended from a long wire, that is sustained in motion over long periods. Due
to the axial rotation of the Earth, the plane of motion of the pendulum shifts at a rate and direction dependent on its
latitude: clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. At the poles the
plane rotates once per day, while at the equator it does not rotate at all.

Simple Harmonic Motion

Many objects vibrate or oscillate –an object on the end of a spring, a tuning fork, the balance wheel of a watch, a
pendulum, the strings of a guitar or a piano. When we speak of a vibration or oscillation, we mean the motion of
an object that repeats itself, back and forth, over the same path. This motion is also known as simple harmonic
motion, often denoted as SHM.
A useful design for examining SHM is an object attached to the end of a spring and laid on a surface. The surface
supports the object so its weight (the force of gravity) doesn’t get involved in the forces. The spring is considered to
be weightless.

90

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Motion in Two Dimensions

The position shown in the illustration is the equilibrium position. This position is the middle, where the spring is
not exerting any force either to the left or to the right. If the object is pulled to the right, the spring will be stretched
and exert a restoring force to return to the weight to the equilibrium position. Similarly, if the object is pushed to
the left, the spring will be compressed and will exert a restoring force to return the object to its original position.
The magnitude of the restoring force, F, in either case must be directly proportional to the distance, x, the spring has
been stretched or compressed. (A spring must be chosen that obeys this requirement.)
F = −kx
In the equation above, the constant of proportionality is called the spring constant. The spring constant is repre-
sented by k and its units are N/m. This equation is accurate as long as the spring is not compressed to the point that
the coils touch nor stretched beyond elasticity.
Suppose the spring is compressed a distance x = A, and then released. The spring exerts a force on the mass pushing
it toward the equilibrium position. When the mass is at the maximum displacement position, velocity is zero because
the mass is changing direction. At the position of maximum displacement, the restoring force is at its greatest - the
acceleration of the mass will be greatest. As the mass moves toward the equilibrium position, the displacement
decreases, so the restoring force decreases and the acceleration decreases. When the mass reaches the equilibrium
position, there is no restoring force. The acceleration, therefore, is zero, but the mass is moving at its highest velocity.
Because of its inertia, the mass will continue past the equilibrium position, and stretch the string. As the spring is
stretched further, the displacement increases, the restoring force increases, the acceleration toward the equilibrium
position increases, and the velocity decreases. Eventually, when the mass reaches its maximum displacement on
this side of the equilibrium position, the velocity has returned to zero and the restoring force and acceleration have
returned to the maximum. In a frictionless system, the mass would oscillate forever, but in a real system, friction
gradually reduces the motion until the mass returns to the equilibrium position and motion stops.
Imagine an object moving in uniform circular motion. Remember the yo-yo we spin over our heads? In your mind,
turn the circle so that you are looking at it on edge; imagine you are eight feet tall, and the yo-yo’s circle is exactly
at eye level. The object will move back forth in the same way that a mass moves in SHM. It moves consistently
from the far left to the far right until you stop spinning the yo-yo. Another example is to imagine a glowing light
bulb riding a merry-go-round at night. You are sitting in a chair at some distance from the merry-go-round so that
the only part of the system that is visible to you is the light bulb. The movement of the light will appear to you to be
back and forth in simple harmonic motion. Circular motion and simple harmonic motion have a lot in common.
The greatest displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position is called the amplitude of the motion. One
cycle refers to the complete to-and-fro motion that starts at some position, goes all the way to one side, then all the
way to the other side, and returns to the original position. The period , T, is the time required for one cycle and the
frequency, f , is the number of cycles that occur in exactly 1.00 second. The frequency, in this case, is the reciprocal
of the period.

Example Problem: When a 500. kg crate of cargo is placed in the bed of a pickup truck, the truck’s springs
compress 4.00 cm. Assume the springs act as a single spring.
(a) What is the spring constant for the truck springs?
(b) How far with the springs compress if 800. kg of cargo is placed in the truck bed?
Solution:

Summary

• Simple harmonic motion occurs in many situations, including an object of the end of a spring, a tuning fork,

a pendulum, and strings on a guitar or piano.

• A mass oscillating on a horizontal spring is often used to analyze SHM.
• The restoring force for a mass oscillating on a horizontal spring is related to the displacement of the mass
from its equilibrium position, F = −kx.
• SHM is related to uniform circular motion when the uniform circular motion is viewed in one dimension.

1. In simple harmonic motion, when the speed of the object is maximum, the acceleration is zero.

1. True
2. False

2. In SHM, maximum displacement of the mass means maximum acceleration.

1. True
2. False

3. If a spring has a spring constant of 1.00 × 103 N/m, what is the restoring force when the mass has been

displaced 20.0 cm?

• simple harmonic motion: A type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the

displacement.

• restoring force: A force that tends to restore a system to equilibrium after displacement.
• spring constant: A characteristic of a spring which is deﬁned as the ratio of the force affecting the spring to

the displacement caused by it.

• amplitude: The maximum displacement from equilibrium that occurs in an oscillation.
• cycle: A complete revolution in any repeating motion.
• period: The time required for one complete cycle in any repeating motion.
• frequency: The number of complete cycles of any repeating motion that occurs in exactly one second.

Using kinematic equations and the understanding that vertical acceleration does not affect horizontal velocity, it
is easy to calculate the height from which an object is launched or the location at which it will land. These
equations can also be used to understand how satellites maintain a consistent orbit; circular motion and centripetal
acceleration equations can also serve this purpose. Perhaps most interestingly, everything that undergoes periodic
motion—including springs, pendulums, rotating disks, and orbiting satellites—can be understood using the simple
harmonic motion equations.

We know that gravity is the force that keeps us from falling away from the surface of the Earth. The force of gravity
reaches a signiﬁcant distance, though as the distance increases, the force decreases by the square of the distance.
However, Earth’s mass is so large, and its gravity so strong, that the force reaches beyond the surface and atmosphere
into space. The Gemini 4 ﬂight of June 1965, NASA’s second manned space ﬂight, circled the planet 66 times in
four days. Astronaut Edward H. White II was the ﬁrst American to take a space walk, held in place in Earth’s orbit
because of the force of gravity.

6.1 Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion

• Describe Kepler’s three laws.
• Calculate satellite periods given average radius and vice versa.

Though a drawing, not an accurate portrayal of the solar system, the elliptical appearance of the orbits is correct.
The elliptical orbits around the sun are not limited to the planets; comets, asteroids, and other orbiting objects also
follow elliptical paths.

Kepler’s Laws

Fifty years before Newton proposed his three laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation, Johannes Kepler
(1571 –1630) published a number of astronomical papers with detailed descriptions of the motions of the plan-
Included in those papers were the ﬁndings that we now refer to as Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion. These
ets.
are summarized below.
Kepler’s First Law: The path of each planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus.

Though it seems at ﬁrst glance that this law is incorrect (the sun appears to be in the center of our orbit), remember
that a perfect circle is an ellipse with the foci in the same place. Since the Earth’s orbit is nearly circular, the sun
appears to stay in the center.

96

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Universal Gravitation

Kepler’s Second Law: As a planet moves in its orbit, a line from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in
equal times.

The image above illustrates this relationship. Though the green wedges may appear signiﬁcantly different in area,
Kepler’s Second Law states that the areas are equal if the planet travels along the perimeter of the segments in equal
periods of time. From this, we can clearly see that the planet moves with greater speed when it is near the sun and
slower when it is far away.
Kepler’s Third Law: The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets revolving around the sun is equal to
the ratio of the cubes of their average distance from the sun.

(cid:19)2

T2

(cid:18)r1

(cid:19)3

r2

=

This is the only one of Kepler’s three laws that deals with more than one planet at a time.
This equation can be reworked to reveal that the ratio between the period and the radius of the planet’s orbit is always
the same:

(T1)2
(r1)3 =

(T2)2
(r2)3

In truth, it has been calculated that this ratio holds for all the planets in our solar system, in addition to moons and
other satellites.
Example Problem: The planet Venus has a mean distance from the sun of 108.2 ×106 km and a period of 0.615
years. The planet Mars has an average mean distance from the sun of 227.9 ×106 km and a period of 1.88 years. Do
these planets follow Kepler’s third law?
Solution: The average mean distance of Venus divided by the average mean distance of Mars = 0.475. The period
of Venus divided by the period of Mars = 0.327.
The square of the period ratio is 0.107 and the cube of the mean distance ratio is 0.107.
planets follow Kepler’s third law.

It is clear that these two

6.2 Universal Law of Gravity

• Describe and give the formula for Newton’s Universal Law of Gravity.
• Using Newton’s Law of Gravity and the equations of uniform circular motion, solve problems involving the

force of gravity.

In 1798, Henry Cavendish designed and created an apparatus and experiment to determine the density of the planet
and the value of the gravitational constant, G. His apparatus involved a light, rigid rod about 2-feet long with two
small lead spheres attached to the ends. The rod was suspended by a thin wire. When the rod rotated, the twisting of
the wire pushed backwards to restore the rod to the original position.

Force of Gravity

In the mid-1600’s, Newton wrote that the sight of a falling apple made him think of the problem of the motion of the
planets. He recognized that the apple fell straight down because the earth attracted it and thought this same force of
attraction might apply to the moon. It further occured to him that motion of the planets might be controlled by the
gravity of the sun. He eventually proposed the universal law of gravitational attraction as

F = G

m1m2
d2

where m1 and m2 are the masses being attracted, d is the distance between the centers of the masses, G is the universal
gravitational constant, and F is the force of attraction. The formula for gravitational attraction applies equally to two
rocks resting near each other on the earth and to the planets and the sun. The value for the universal gravitational

constant, G, was determined by Henry Cavendish (using the apparatus described in the introduction) to be 6.67 ×
10−11 N·m2/kg2.

The moon is being pulled toward the earth and the earth toward the moon with the same force but in the opposite
direction. The force of attraction between the two bodies produces a greater acceleration of the moon than the earth
because the moon has smaller mass. Even though the moon is constantly falling toward the earth, it never gets
any closer. This is because the velocity of the moon is perpendicular to the radius of the earth (as shown in the
image above) and therefore the moon is moving away from the earth. The distance the moon moves away from the
orbit line is exactly the same distance that the moon falls in the time period. This is true of all satellites and is the
reason objects remain in orbit. In the case of orbiting bodies, the centripetal force is the gravitational force, and they
undergo imperfect circular motion.
Example Problem: Since we know the force of gravity on a 1.00 kg ball resting on the surface of the earth is 9.80
N, and we know the radius of the earth is 6380 km, we can use the equation for gravitational force to calculate the
mass of the earth.
Solution: me = Fd2

(9.80 m/s2

=

(6.67×10−11 N·m2/kg2

)(1.00 kg)

Sample Problem: John and Jane step onto the dance ﬂoor about 20. m apart at the Junior Prom and they feel an
attraction to each other. If John’s mass is 70. kg and Jane’s mass is 50. kg, assume the attraction is gravity and
calculate its magnitude.

Solution: Fg = Gm1m2

d2 = (6.67×10−11 N·m2/kg2
(20. m)2

)(70. kg)(50. kg)

= 1.2× 10−8 N

This is an extremely weak force; it is probably not the force of attraction they truly felt.

6.3 Orbital Motion

• Learn to calculate how objects are put into orbit.
• Understand why objects in orbit are weightless.
• Using Newton’s Law of Gravity and the equations of uniform circular motion, solve problems involving orbital

velocity and period.

Orbital Motion

We commonly talk about satellites orbiting Earth. But what does that really mean? When a satellite, space shuttle,
or some other object is orbiting a planet, it maintains a circular orbit around the planet a constant distance off the
surface. Manmade satellites typically orbit between 200 and 400 miles. For example, the International Space Station
(ISS) orbits at 370 km, or 230 miles.
The ISS has an average velocity of 7.66 km/sec tangential to its orbit. An orbiting satellite is close enough to be
acted upon by Earth’s gravity. This force is constantly pulling the satellite in toward the center of the earth –it is
a centripetal force and causes a centripetal acceleration. At this height, however, Earth’s gravity is only about 8.7
m/s2. As was discussed in Motion in Two Dimensions: Circular Motion, the velocity and centripetal acceleration
are perpendicular.
NASA scientists, in designing this and all other satellites, must carefully calculate the velocity necessary to keep the
satellite orbiting. To keep the satellite from falling back to Earth, the horizontal velocity must be large enough. The
satellite must travel far enough horizontally that it follows the curve of the planet, as shown below.
When the satellite is orbiting in this way, it is falling straight down towards Earth. Imagine standing in an elevator
when the bottom drops out from under you. The elevator, you, and anything you might have had with you all fall
straight down. If you had a backpack on your back, the weight of the books can no longer be felt because the books

6.3. Orbital Motion

are in free fall as well. A similar thing is happening in the space shuttle or orbiting satellite, where objects are
weightless.
For a full description of weight, look at Forces: Mass versus Weight. In sum, weight is the result of the force of
gravity being opposed by the normal force. As we just learned, objects in orbit are in freefall; they have nothing
exerting a normal force against them and thus no weight.
Sample Problem: Consider a satellite of the earth orbiting at 225 km above the surface of the earth. Keep in mind
that this is NOT the radius of the satellite’s orbit. The satellite’s orbit is measured from the center of the earth, so
its radius will be the radius of the earth, 6.37 × 106 m, plus the 225,000 m. The mass of the earth is 5.98 × 1024
kg. What is the velocity of the satellite?
Solution: Since the centripetal force keeping this satellite traveling in orbit is provided by the gravitational force of
the earth, we can set the formula for centripetal force equal to the formula for gravitational force.

Summary

• A satellite in a circular orbit accelerates toward the object it is orbiting at a rate equal to the acceleration of

gravity at its orbital radius.

• As in a falling elevator, objects in orbit are in constant freefall.
• Objects in free fall have no normal force acting upon them, and thus no weight.

Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion and the fact that all objects, regardless of size or distance, exert a gravitational
pull on each other. Incorporating the lessons of circular motion from earlier, we explored satellite orbits and the
sensation of weightlessness in space.

Momentum

We use the terms “momentum” and “impulse” in daily life, but they have more speciﬁc meanings when used in
physics. Nonetheless, we can understand the ideas without proper deﬁnitions. If a speeding car comes to a rapid
stop, we understand that the people in the car have a forward momentum: after the car stops, they continue to go
forward. We usually use the word “impact” to refer to a result: cars have a negative impact on the environment,
airbags can impact us by saving our lives. In physics, however, “impact” refers to the time over which a force is
applied. Airbags do save lives, but they do so by reducing the impact of the passenger hitting the wheel or dash, by
increasing the time over which the force of the crash affects the passenger.

Rachel Flatt performs a layback spin at the 2011 Rostelecom Cup in Moscow, Russia.
When an ice skater spins, angular momentum must be conserved. When her arms or feet are far away from her body,
her spin slows; when she brings her arms and feet close in to her body, she spins faster.

Momentum and Impulse

If a bowling ball and a ping-pong ball are each moving with a velocity of 5 mph, you intuitively understand that it
will require more effort to stop the bowling ball than the ping pong ball because of the greater mass of the bowling
ball. Similarly, if you have two bowling balls, one moving at 5 mph and the other moving at 10 mph, you know
it will take more effort to stop the ball with the greater speed. It is clear that both the mass and the velocity of a
moving object contribute to what is necessary to change the motion of the moving object. The product of the mass
and velocity of an object is called its momentum. Momentum is a vector quantity that has the same direction as the
velocity of the object and is represented by a lowercase letter p.

You should note that the units for momentum are kg·m/s.
According to Newton’s ﬁrst law, the velocity of an object cannot change unless a force is applied. If we wish to
change the momentum of a body, we must apply a force. The longer the force is applied, the greater the change
in momentum. The impulse is the quantity deﬁned as the force multiplied by the time it is applied. It is a vector
quantity that has the same direction as the force. The units for impulse are N·s but we know that Newtons are
also kg·m/s2 and so N·s = (kg·m/s2)(s) = kg·m/s. Impulse and momentum have the same units; when an impulse is
applied to an object, the momentum of the object changes and the change of momentum is equal to the impulse.
Ft = ∆mv
Example Problem: Calculating Momentum
A 0.15 kg ball is moving with a velocity of 35 m/s. Find the momentum of the ball.
Solution: p = mv = (0.15 kg)(35 m/s) = 5.25 kg· m/s
Example Problem: If a ball with mass 5.00 kg has a momentum of 5.25 kg· m/s, what is its velocity?
Solution: v = p

m = 5.25 kg·m/s

5.00 kg = 1.05 m/s

= 14,000 N

t = (100. kg)(7.0 m/s)

It should be clear from the equation relating impulse to change in momentum, Ft = ∆mv, that any amount of force
would (eventually) bring a moving object to rest. If the force is very small, it must be applied for a long time, but a
greater force can bring the object to rest in a shorter period of time.
If you jump off a porch and land on your feet with your knees locked in the straight position, your motion would be
brought to rest in a very short period of time and thus the force would need to be very large –large enough, perhaps,
to damage your joints or bones.
Suppose that when you hit the ground, your velocity was 7.0 m/s and that velocity was brought to rest in 0.05 sec-
onds. If your mass is 100. kg, what force was required to bring you to rest?
F = ∆mv
If, on the other hand, when your feet ﬁrst touched the ground, you allowed your knees to ﬂex so that the period of
time over which your body was brought to rest is increased, then the force on your body would be smaller and it
would be less likely that you would damage your legs.
Suppose that when you ﬁrst touch the ground, you allow your knees to bend and extend the stopping time to 0.50
seconds. What force would be required to bring you to rest this time?
F = ∆mv
With the longer period of time for the force to act, the necessary force is reduced to one-tenth of what was needed
before.
Extending the period of time over which a force acts in order to lessen the force is a common practice in design.
Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase. The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an
accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop. Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the
highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time. These changes all serve to decrease the amount of force
it takes to stop the momentum in a car crash, which consequently saves lives.
Example Problem: An 0.15 kg baseball is thrown horizontally at 40. m/s and after it is struck by a bat, it is traveling
at -40. m/s.

t = (100. kg)(7.0 m/s)

(a) What impulse did the bat deliver to the ball?
(b) If the contact time of the bat and bat was 0.00080 seconds, what was the average force the bat exerted on the
ball?
(c) Calculate the average acceleration of the ball during the time it was in contact with the bat.
Solution: We can calculate the change in momentum and give the answer as impulse because we know that the
impulse is equal to the change in momentum.
(a)

p = m∆v = (0.15 kg)(−40. m/s− 40. m/s)

= (0.15 kg)(−80. m/s) = −12 kg· m/s

The minus sign indicates that the impulse was in the opposite direction of the original throw.
(b) F = ∆mv
Again, the negative sign indicates the force was in the opposite direction of the original throw.
(c) a = F

−12 kg·m/s
0.00080 s = −15000 N

t =

m = −15000 N

0.15 kg = −100,000 m/s2

• State the law of conservation of momentum.
• Use the conservation of momentum to solve one-dimensional collision problems.

For this whale to leap out of the water, something underwater must be moving in the opposite direction, and intuition
tells us it must be moving with relatively high velocity. The water that moves downward is pushed downward by the
whale’s tail, and that allows the whale to rise up.

Conservation of Momentum in One Dimension

When impulse and momentum were introduced, we used an example of a batted ball to discuss the impulse and
momentum change that occurred with the ball. At the time, we did not consider what had happened to the bat. Ac-
cording to Newton’s third law, however, when the bat exerted a force on the ball, the ball also exerted an equal and
opposite force on the bat. Since the time of the collision between bat and ball is the same for the bat and for the
ball, then we have equal forces (in opposite directions) exerted for equal times on the ball AND the bat. That means
that the impulse exerted on the bat is equal and opposite (-Ft) to the impulse on the ball (Ft) and that also means that
there was a change in momentum of the bat [−∆(mv)BAT] that was equal and opposite to the change in momentum
of the ball [∆(mv)BALL].
The change in momentum of the ball is quite obvious because it changes direction and ﬂies off at greater speed.
However, the change in momentum of the bat is not obvious at all. This occurs primarily because the bat is more
massive than the ball. Additionally, the bat is held ﬁrmly by the batter, so the batter’s mass can be combined with
the mass of the bat. Since the bat’s mass is so much greater than that of the ball, but they have equal and opposite
forces, the bat’s ﬁnal velocity is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of the ball.
Consider another system: that of two ice skaters. If we have one of the ice skaters exert a force on the other skater,
the force is called an internal force because both the object exerting the force and the object receiving the force

112

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Momentum

are inside the system. In a closed system such as this, momentum is always conserved. The total ﬁnal momentum
always equals the total initial momentum in a closed system. Conversely, if we deﬁned a system to contain just one
ice skater, putting the other skater outside the system, this is not a closed system. If one skater pushes the other, the
force is an external force because the receiver of the force is outside the system. Momentum is not guaranteed to be
conserved unless the system is closed.
In a closed system, momentum is always conserved. Take another example: if we consider two billiard balls colliding
on a billiard table and ignore friction, we are dealing with a closed system. The momentum of ball A before the
collision plus the momentum of ball B before collision will equal the momentum of ball A after collision plus the
momentum of ball B after collision. This is called the law of conservation of momentum and is given by the
equation

pAbefore + pBbefore = pAafter + pBafter

Example Problem: Ball A has a mass of 2.0 kg and is moving due west with a velocity of 2.0 m/s while ball B has
a mass of 4.0 kg and is moving west with a velocity of 1.0 m/s. Ball A overtakes ball B and collides with it from
behind. After the collision, ball A is moving westward with a velocity of 1.0 m/s. What is the velocity of ball B after
the collision?
Solution: Because of the law of conservation of momentum, we know that

pAbefore + pBbefore = pAafter + pBafter

.
mAvA + mBvB = mAv(cid:48)
(2.0 kg)(2.0 m/s) + (4.0 kg)(1.0 m/s) = (2.0 kg)(1.0 m/s) + (4.0 kg)(vB
4.0 kg· m/s + 4.0 kg· m/s = 2.0 kg· m/s + 4vB
4vB
vB
After the collision, ball B is moving westward at 1.5 m/s.
Example Problem: A railroad car whose mass is 30,000. kg is traveling with a velocity of 2.2 m/s due east and
collides with a second railroad car whose mass is also 30,000. kg and is at rest. If the two cars stick together after
the collision, what is the velocity of the two cars?
Solution: Note that since the two trains stick together, the ﬁnal mass is mA+mB, and the ﬁnal velocity for each object
is the same. Thus the conservation of momentum equation, mAvA + mBvB = mAv(cid:48)
B, can be rewritten mAvA +
mBvB = (mA + mB)v(cid:48)
(30,000. kg)(2.2 m/s) + (30,000. kg)(0 m/s) = (60,000. kg)(v(cid:48) m/s)
66000 + 0 = 60000v(cid:48)
v(cid:48) = 66000
60000 = 1.1 m/s
After the collision, the two cars move off together toward the east with a velocity of 1.1 m/s.

A + mBv(cid:48)

Summary

• A closed system is one in which both the object exerting a force and the object receiving the force are inside

the system.

• In a closed system, momentum is always conserved.

• Use the conservation of momentum and vector analysis to solve two-dimensional collision problems.
• Review vector components.

In a game of billiards, it is important to be able to visualize collisions in two dimensions –the best players not only
know where the target ball is going but also where the cue ball will end up.

Conservation of Momentum in Two Dimensions

Conservation of momentum in all closed systems is valid, regardless of the directions of the objects before and after
they collide. Most objects are not conﬁned to a single line, like trains on a rail. Rather, many objects, like billiard
balls or cars, can move in two dimensions. Conservation of momentum for these objects can also be calculated;
momentum is a vector and collisions of objects in two dimensions can be represented by axial vector components. To
review axial components, revisit Vectors: Resolving Vectors into Axial Components and Vectors: Vector Addition.
Example Problem: A 2.0 kg ball, A, is moving with a velocity of 5.00 m/s due west. It collides with a stationary
ball, B, also with a mass of 2.0 kg. After the collision, ball A moves off at 30° south of west while ball B moves off
at 60° north of west. Find the velocities of both balls after the collision.
Solution: Since ball B is stationary before the collision, then the total momentum before the collision is equal to
momentum of ball A. The momentum of ball A before collision is shown in red below, and can be calculated to
bep = mv = (2.00 kg)(5.00 m/s) = 10.0 kg m/s west

116

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Momentum

Since momentum is conserved in this collision, the sum of the momenta of balls A and B after collsion must be 10.0
kg m/s west.
pAafter = (10.0 kg m/s)(cos30◦) = (10.0 kg m/s)(0.866) = 8.66 kg m/s
pBafter = (10.0 kg m/s)(cos60◦) = (10.0 kg m/s)(0.500) = 5.00 kg m/s
To ﬁnd the ﬁnal velocities of the two balls, we divide the momentum of each by its mass. Therefore, vA = 4.3 m/s
and vB = 2.5 m/s.
Example Problem: A 1325 kg car moving north at 27.0 m/s collides with a 2165 kg car moving east at 17.0
m/s. The two cars stick together after the collision. What is the speed and direction of the two cars after the
collision?

Solution:
Northward momentum = (1325 kg)(27.0 m/s) = 35800 kg m/s
Eastward momentum = (2165 kg)(17.0 m/s) = 36800 kg m/s

Example Problem: A 6.00 kg ball, A, moving at velocity 3.00 m/s due east collides with a 6.00 kg ball, B, at rest.
After the collision, A moves off at 40.0° N of E and ball B moves off at 50.0° S of E.

a. What is the momentum of A after the collision?

c. What are the velocities of the two balls after the collision?

This is a right triangle in which the initial momentum is the length of the hypotenuse and the two momenta after the
collision are the legs of the triangle.

Summary

• The conservation of momentum law holds for all closed systems regardless of the directions of the objects

before and after they collide.

• Momentum is a vector; collisions in two dimensions can be represented by axial vector components.

they conclude this?

The momentum of an object, in physics terms, is mass multiplied by velocity. The impact of an object in a collision
is the force it applies multiplied by the amount of time that impact is applied for. Whether movement is in one or two
dimensions, the momentum of objects in a closed system is always conserved. The equations for this relationship
were presented in this chapter.

If you push against a wall with all your strength for a full minute, how much work have you done? You might think
you’ve worked very hard, but you actually haven’t completed any work, as deﬁned by physics. Completing work
from a physics standpoint requires not only force but also movement of an object.
Imagine trying to lift a 400-pound object, such as the orange box shown above. Could you do that by yourself? If
you simply leaned over and tried to pick it up, you’d never be able to. However, a series of pulleys such as the system
shown above would allow a single person to lift a 400-pound object without any other assistance.
This chapter examines physics’ deﬁnition of work, the relationship between work, force, and power, and the
mechanical assistance provided by simple machines.

8.1 Work

• Deﬁne work.
• Identify forces that are doing work.
• Given two of the three variables in the equation, W = Fd, calculate the third.

For some, the exciting part of a roller coaster is speeding down; for others it is the anticipation of climbing up. While
the coaster is being towed up, it is having work done on it. The work done towing it to the top of the hill becomes
potential energy stored in the coaster and that potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the coaster runs
down from the top of the hill to the bottom.

Work

The word work has both an everyday meaning and a speciﬁc scientiﬁc meaning. In the everyday use of the word,
work would refer to anything which required a person to make an effort. In physics, however, work is deﬁned as the
force exerted on an object multiplied by the distance the object moves due to that force.
W = Fd
In the scientiﬁc deﬁnition of the word, if you push against an automobile with a force of 200 N for 3 minutes but
the automobile does not move, then you have done no work. Multiplying 200 N times 0 meters yields zero work.
If you are holding an object in your arms, the upward force you are exerting is equal to the object’s weight. If
you hold the object until your arms become very tired, you have still done no work because you did not move the
object in the direction of the force. When you lift an object, you exert a force equal to the object’s weight and
the object moves due to that lifting force. If an object weighs 200. N and you lift it 1.50 meters, then your work
is W = Fd = (200. N)(1.50 m) = 300. N m.

Chapter 8. Work, Power, and Simple Machines

One of the units you will see for work is shown above: the Newton meter (Nm). More often, however, units of work
are given as the Joule (pronounced "jool") in honor of James Prescott Joule, a nineteenth century English physicist.
A Joule is a kg·m2/s2.
Example Problem: A boy lifts a box of apples that weighs 185 N. The box is lifted a height of 0.800 m. How much
work did the boy do?
Solution: W = Fd = (185 N)(0.800 m) = 148 N m = 148 Joules
Work is done only if a force is exerted in the direction of motion. If the motion is perpendicular to the force, no
work has been done. If the force is at an angle to the motion, then the component of the force in the direction of the
motion is used to determine the work done.
Example Problem: Suppose a 125 N force is applied to a lawnmower handle at an angle of 25° with the ground
and the lawnmower moves along the surface of the ground.
If the lawnmower moves 56 m, how much work was
done?

Solution: The solution requires that we determine the component of the force that was in the direction of the motion
of the lawnmower because the component of the force that was pushing down on the ground does not contribute to
the work done.
Fparallel = (Force)(cos25◦) = (125 N)(0.906) = 113 N
W = Fparalleld = (113 N)(56 m) = 630 J

Summary

• Work is the force exerted on an object multiplied by the distance the object moves due to that force.
• The unit for work is called the joule, which is a kg m2/s2.
• If the force is at an angle to the motion, then the component of the force in the direction of the motion is used

to determine the work done.

• work: A force is said to do work when it acts on a body so that there is a displacement of the point
of application, however small, in the direction of the force. Thus a force does work when it results in
movement. The work done by a constant force of magnitude F on a point that moves a distance d in the
direction of the force is the product, W = Fd.

• joule: The SI unit of work or energy, equal to the work done by a force of one Newton when its point of

application moves through a distance of one meter in the direction of the force.

8.2 Power

• Deﬁne power.
• Given two of the three variables in P = W

t , calculate the third.

Typical Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR), a type of nuclear power reactor originally built in the 1970s, produce
1100 to 1500 megawatts, or about 1,500,000,000 Joules/second. By comparison, a windmill farm with hundreds of
individual windmills produces about 5 megawatts (5,000,000 Joules/second).

Power

Power is deﬁned as the rate at which work is done, or the rate at which energy is transformed.

Power =

Work
Time

In SI units, power is measured in Joules per second, which is given a special name: the watt , W.

1.00 watt = 1.00 J/s

Another unit for power that is fairly common is horsepower.

1.00 horsepower = 746 watts

Example Problem: A 70.0 kg man runs up a long ﬂight of stairs in 4.0 s. The vertical height of the stairs is 4.5 m.
Calculate the power output of the man in watts and horsepower.

125

8.2. Power

www.ck12.org

t = Fd

t = F d

t = Fv

t = 3090 J

4.0 s = 770 J/s = 770 W

t and W = Fd, we can use these formulas to derive a formula relating power to the speed of the object

Solution: The force exerted must be equal to the weight of the man:mg = (70.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 686 N
W = Fd = (686 N)(4.5 m) = 3090 N m = 3090 J
P = W
P = 770 W = 1.03 hp
Since P = W
that is produced by the power.
P = W
The velocity in this formula is the average speed of the object during the time interval.
Example Problem: Calculate the power required of a 1400 kg car if the car climbs a 10◦ hill at a steady 80. km/h.
Solution: First convert 80. km/h to m/s: 22.2 m/s.
In 1.00 s, the car would travel 22.2 m on the road surface but the distance traveled upward would be (22.2 m)(sin 10◦) =
(22.2 m)(0.174) = 3.86 m. The force in the direction of the upward motion is the weight of the car: (1400 kg)(9.80 m/s2)
= 13720 N.
W = Fd = (13720 N)(3.86 m) = 53,000 J
Since this work was done in 1.00 second, the power would be 53,000 W.
This problem can be solved a different way; by calculating the upward component of the velocity of the car. The
process would be similar, and start with ﬁnding the vertical component of the velocity vector: (22.2 m/s)(sin 10◦) =
(22.2 m/s)(0.174) = 3.86 m/s. Again, calculate the weight of the car: (1400 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 13720 N. Finally, we
could use the formula relating power to average speed to calculate power.
P = Fv = (13720 N)(3.86 m/s) = 53,000 W

8.3 Simple Machines

• Name the simple machines.
• Deﬁne ideal mechanical advantage.
• Deﬁne actual mechanical advantage.
• Calculate both ideal and actual mechanical advantages for simple machines.
• Of the four variables, input force, output force, input distance, output distance, given three of them, calculate

the fourth for simple machines.

A "Rube Goldberg Machine" is a complex construction of many simple machines connected end-to-end in order to
accomplish a particular activity. By design, Rube Goldberg Machines are far more intricate than necessary, and may
be quite entertaining. Although this kind of construction may be extremely inefﬁcient, simple machines commonly
make work easier, and can be found all around us.

Machines

A machine is an object or mechanical device that receives an input amount of work and transfers the energy to an
output amount of work. For an ideal machine , the input work and output work are always the same. Remember that
work is force times distance; even though the work input and output are equal, the input force does not necessarily
equal the output force, nor does the input distance necessarily equal the output distance.
Machines can be incredibly complex (think of robots or automobiles), or very simple, such as a can opener. A simple
machine is a mechanical device that changes the magnitude or direction of the force. There are six simple machines
that were ﬁrst identiﬁed by Renaissance scientists: lever, pulley, inclined plane, screw, wedge, and wheel and axle.
These six simple machines can be combined together to form compound machines.
We use simple machines because they give us a mechanical advantage. Mechanical advantage is a measurement
of the force ampliﬁcation of a machine. In ideal machines, where there is no friction and the input work and output
work are the same,

Chapter 8. Work, Power, and Simple Machines

(Effort Force)(Effort Distance) = (Resistance Force)(Resistance Distance)
The effort is the work that you do. It is the amount of force you use times the distance over which you use it. The
resistance is the work done on the object you are trying to move. Often, the resistance force is the force of gravity,
and the resistance distance is how far you move the object.
The ideal mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the ratio between the distances:
IMA = effort distance
Again, the IMA assumes that there is no friction. In reality, the mechanical advantage is limited by friction; you must
overcome the frictional forces in addition to the resistance force. Therefore, the actual mechanical advantage is
the ratio of the forces:
AMA = resistance force
When simple machines are combined to form compound machines, the product of each simple machine’s IMA gives
the compound machine’s IMA.

Simple Machines

Lever

A lever consists of an inﬂexible length of material placed over a pivot point called a fulcrum. The resistance is the
object to be moved (shown here in red), and is placed to one side of the fulcrum. The resistance distance in a lever
is called the resistance arm. The effort is exerted elsewhere on the lever, and the effort distance is called the effort
arm or effort lever arm. The lever shown here is the most common type of lever, a Class One Lever, but there are
two other types of levers. If you would like to learn about the other types of levers, visit this website:
http://www.ohio.edu/people/williar4/html/haped/nasa/simpmach/lever.htm

The effort work is the effort force times the effort lever arm. Similarly, the resistance work is the resistance force
times the resistance lever arm. If we ignore any friction that occurs where the lever pivots over the fulcrum, this is an
ideal machine. Suppose the resistance force is 500. N, the resistance arm is 0.400 m, and the effort arm is 0.800m.
We can calculate exactly how much effort force is required to lift the resistance in this system:
Output Work = Input Work
(Resistance Force)(Resistance Arm) = (Effort Force)(Effort Arm)
(500. N)(0.400 m) = (x)(0.800 m)
x = 250. N
In this case, since the effort arm is twice as long as the resistance arm, the effort force required is only half the
resistance force. This machine allows us to lift objects using only half the force required to lift the object directly
against the pull of gravity. The distance the effort force is moved is twice as far as the resistance will move. Thus,
the input work and the output work are equal.

Example Problem:
(a) How much force is required to lift a 500. kg stone using an ideal lever whose resistance arm is 10.0 cm and
whose effort arm is 2.00 m?
(b) What is the IMA?
(c) If the actual effort force required to lift the stone was 305 N, what was the AMA?
Solution:
(a) (resistance force)(resistance arm) = (effort force)(effort arm)
effort force = (resistance force)(resistance arm)
= (4900 N)(0.100 m)
(b) IMA = effort arm
(c) AMA = resistance force

(effort arm)
resistance arm = 2.00 m
effort force = 4900 N

0.100 m = 20
305 N = 16

(2.00 m)

= 245 N

Pulley

A pulley is a wheel on an axle that is designed to rotate with movement of a cable along a groove at its circumference.
Pulleys are used in a variety of ways to lift loads, apply forces, and to transmit power, but the simplest of pulleys
serves only to reverse the direction of the effort force. It consists of a single pulley attached directly to a non-moving
surface with a rope or cable through it. As a downward force is applied to one side of the pulley, the other side of
the pulley, with the attached resistance force, is pulled upward. This type of pulley is called a ﬁxed pulley, and is
labeled A in the image below.

Another type of pulley is shown above as B. This type of pulley is called a movable pulley. A set of pulleys
assembled so they rotate independently on the same axle form a block. It is shown below in a system called a block
and tackle. A block and tackle consists of two blocks, in which one block is ﬁxed and the other is movable; the
movable block is attached to the load.
The IMA of a pulley system can be determined by counting the number of supporting strands of rope in the system.
Be careful though, because in some systems the rope to which the effort force is applied will be a supporting strand,
but in others it is not. For example, in the image above with the ﬁve pulley systems, the rope to which the effort
force is applied (the one with the arrowhead) in A is not a supporting strand because it does not hold up any of the
weight of the load. The IMA of A is 1. In B, however, the effort rope is supporting half of the weight of the load and
is therefore a supporting strand. B has 2 supporting strands and an IMA of 2.
Example Problem: Determine the IMA for C, D, and E in the image above.
Solution:

130

www.ck12.org

Chapter 8. Work, Power, and Simple Machines

C = 2 supporting strands; IMA = 2
D = 3 supporting strands; IMA = 3
E = 3 supporting strands; IMA = 3
If the direction of the effort force is in the same direction and the movement of the load, the effort strand will be a
supporting strand. If the direction of the effort force is in the same direction as the resistance force, the effort strand
is not a supporting strand. Look again at the ﬁve pulley systems to ensure this is true.

Example Problem: Consider the pulley system sketched above. Given that the resistance force is 8500. N, ﬁnd
(a) the IMA.
(b) the ideal effort force required to list this weight.
(c) the distance the weight will rise if the effort force moves 1.0 m.
(d) the AMA if the actual effort force is 2000. N.
Solution:
(a) Since the effort strand moves in the opposite direction of the resistance, it is not a supporting strand. Therefore,
there are 5 supporting strands and that makes the IMA = 5.
(b) Effort force = resistance force
(c) Since the IMA is 5, the resistance distace will be 1/5 of the effort distance: the resistance distance is 1.0m/5 =
0.20 m
(d) AMA = resistance force

5 = 1700 N

= 8500 N

IMA

effort force = 8500 N

2000 N = 4.25

Wheel and Axle

Just like it sounds, a wheel and axle is composed of two connected cylinders of different diameters. Since the
wheel has a larger radius (distance) than the axle, the axle will always have a larger force than the wheel. The ideal
mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle is dependent on the ratio between the radii:
IMA = Radius

8.3. Simple Machines

Inclined Plane

www.ck12.org

An inclined plane is also a simple machine. The resistance is the weight of the box resting on the inclined plane. In
order to lift this box straight up, the effort force would need to be equal to its weight. However, assuming no friction,
less effort (a smaller effort force) is required to slide the box up the incline. We know this intuitively; when movng
boxes into a truck or onto a platform, we use angled platforms instead of lifting it straight up.
The red triangle that hangs below the yellow box is a similar triangle to the inclined plane. The vector perpendicular
to the inclined surface is the normal force and this normal force is equal to the portion of the weight of the box that
is supported by the surface of the plane. The parallel force is the portion of the weight pushing the box down the
plane and is, therefore, the effort force necessary to push the box up the plane.

The effort distance, in the case of an inclined plane, is the length of the incline and the resistance distance is the
vertical height the box would rise when it is pushed completely up the incline. The mechanical advantages for an
inclined plane are
IMA = effort distance

resistance distance =

IMA = resistance force
Example Problem: Suppose, in the sketch above, the weight of the box is 400. N, the angle of the incline is 35°,
and the surface is frictionless. Find the normal force (by ﬁnding the portion of the weight acting perpendicular to
the plane), the parallel force, and the IMA for the box on this incline.
Solution:
Normal force = (400. N)(cos35◦) = (400. N)(0.82) = 330 N
Parallel force = (400. N)(sin35◦) = (400. N)(0.57) = 230 N
IMA = 1

0.57 = 1.74

sinθ = 1

sin35◦ = 1

Wedge

A wedge is essentially two inclined planes back to back. Like an inclined plane, the IMA of a wedge is the ratio
between the length of the wedge and the width of the wedge. Unlike an inclined plane, a wedge does not have a
right angle; the IMA of a wedge cannot be found with sines.

Screw

Chapter 8. Work, Power, and Simple Machines

A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. When on a screw, inclined planes are called threads, which
can be seen in the image above. The mechanical advantage of a screw increases with the density of the threads. The
calculations to determine the IMA for a screw involve the circumference of the head of the screw and the thread
width. When the screw is turned completely around one time, the screw penetrates by one thread width. So, if the
circumference of the head of a screw is 3.0 cm and the thread width is 0.60 cm, then the IMA would be calculated
by
IMA = effort distance
When simple machines are joined together to make compound machines, the ideal mechanical advantage of the
compound machine is found by multiplying the IMA’s of the simple machines.

resistance distance = 3.0 cm

0.60 cm = 5.

• simple machine: A mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force.
• ideal machine: An ideal simple machine in one in which the work input equals the work output.
• effort force: The force used to move an object over a distance.
• resistance force: The force which an effort force must overcome in order to do work on an object via a simple

machine.

• ideal mechanical advantage: The factor by which a mechanism multiplies the force put into it. The mechan-

ical advantage is called the ideal mechanical advantage if there is no friction or if friction is ignored.
Generally, the mechanical advantage is calculated as follows: MA =

distance over which effort is applied
distance over which the load is moved.
• actual mechanical advantage: The mechanical advantage of a real machine. Actual mechanical advantage
takes into consideration real world factors such as energy lost in friction.
In this way, it differs from the
ideal mechanical advantage, which, is a sort of ’theoretical limit’ to the efﬁciency. The AMA of a machine is
calculated with the following formula: AMA = resistance force

Work, measured in joules, is the measurement of the force exerted on an object in the direction it moves multiplied
by the distance the object moved. Power, measured in joules per second, is the amount of work done divided by the
time it took. Machines are devices that transform input work into equivalent amounts of output work in a different
form; a small force over a large distance may become a large force over a small distance. The six simple machines
discussed in this chapter are the building blocks of all machines.

The roller coaster shown here is a perfect example of different types of energy. Energy is either “potential,” meaning
that it is stored and not yet in use, or “kinetic,” meaning that it is energy in motion or in use. Common sources of
energy include gravity, chemicals, temperature differences, and solar energy. Energy continually surrounds us and
can easily be converted from one form to another. The chemical energy of the food in your last meal, for example,
has been transformed into a different form of chemical energy in your body, and may become kinetic energy at your
soccer practice this afternoon. This roller coaster converts kinetic to potential energy, and vice versa. You will learn
about several forms of energy and how they change from one to another in this chapter.

This military jet, like all jets, requires a large amount of work to get into the air; unlike most jets, this one is taking
off from the deck of aircraft carrier. This requires careful coordination of the plane’s engines and the ship’s catapults
and harnesses to accelerate the jet to about 270 km per hour in just two seconds. This incredible feat requires huge
energy conversions.

Kinetic Energy

Energy is the capacity of an object to do work, and like work, energy’s unit is the joule (J). Energy exists in many
different forms, but the one we think of most often when we think of energy is kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is
often thought of as the energy of motion because it is used to describe objects that are moving. Remember, though,
that energy is the ability of an object to do work. Any moving object has the capacity to cause another object to
move if they collide. This ability is what we mean when we refer to an object’s kinetic energy: the ability to change
another object’s motion or position simply by colliding with it. The equation of an object’s kinetic energy depends
on its mass and velocity:
KE = 1
The kinetic energy of a moving object is directly proportional to its mass and directly proportional to the square of
its velocity. This means that an object with twice the mass and equal speed will have twice the kinetic energy while
an object with equal mass and twice the speed will have quadruple the kinetic energy.
The kinetic energy of an object can be changed by doing work on the object. The work done on an object equals the
kinetic energy gain or loss by the object. This relationship is expressed in the work-energy theorem WNET = ∆KE.

Example Problem: How much work must be done on a 750. kg car to slow it from 100. km/h to 50.0 km/h?
Solution: From the previous example problem, we know that the KE of this car when it is moving at 50.0 km/h
If the same car is going twice as fast, its KE will be four times as great because KE is
is 72,300 Joules.
proportional to the square of the velocity. Therefore, when this same car is moving at 100. km/h, its KE is
289,200 Joules. Therefore, the work done to slow the car from 100. km/h to 50.0 km/h is (289,200 Joules)−
(72,300 Joules) = 217,000 Joules.

9.2 Potential Energy

• Deﬁne potential energy.
• Solve problems involving gravitational potential energy.
• Solve problems involving the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa.

Shooting an arrow from a bow requires work done on the bow by the shooter’s arm to bend the bow and thus produce
potential energy. The release of the bow converts the potential energy of the bent bow into the kinetic energy of the
ﬂying arrow.

Potential Energy

When an object is held above the earth, it has the ability to make matter move because all you have to do is let
go of the object and it will fall of its own accord. Since energy is deﬁned as the ability to make matter move, this
object has energy. This type of energy is stored energy and is called potential energy. An object held in a stretched
rubber band also contains this stored energy. Speciﬁcally, a rubber band (and the bow pictured above) has elastic
potential energy. If the stretched rubber band is released, the object will move. If you hold two positive charges near
each other, their electromagnetic potential energy pushes them apart when you let go. Potential energy is stored in
chemical bonds (chemical). When these bonds are broken, the excess energy is seen as molecular motion and heat.
If a cannon ball is ﬁred straight up into the air, it begins with a high kinetic energy. As the cannon ball rises, it slows
down due to the force of gravity pulling it toward the earth. As the ball rises, its gravitational potential energy is
increasing and its kinetic energy is decreasing. When the cannon ball reaches the top of its arc, its kinetic energy

140

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9. Energy

is zero and its potential energy is at the maximum. As gravity continues to pull the cannon ball toward the earth,
the ball will fall downwards, causing its height to decrease and its speed to increase. The ball’s potential energy
decreases and its kinetic energy increases. When the ball returns to its original height, its kinetic energy will be the
same as when it started upward.

When work is done on an object, the work may be converted into either kinetic or potential energy. Work resulting
in motion is caused when the work is converted into kinetic energy, while work resulting in a change of position
is caused by a conversion into potential energy. Work is also spent overcoming friction and that work would be
converted into heat, but we will consider primarily frictionless systems.
If we consider the potential energy of a bent stick or a stretched rubber band, the potential energy can be calculated
by multiplying the force exerted by the stick or rubber band by the distance over which the force will be exerted. The
formula for calculating this potential energy looks exactly like the formula for calculating work done: W = Fd. The
only difference is that work is calculated when the object actually moves and potential energy is calculated when the
system is still at rest, before any motion actually occurs.
In the case of gravitational potential energy, the force exerted by the object is its weight and the distance it can travel
is its height above the earth. Since the weight of an object is calculated by W = mg, then gravitational potential
energy can be calculated by PE = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h
is the height the object will fall.
Example Problem: A 3.00 kg object is lifted from the ﬂoor and placed on a shelf that is 2.50 m above the ﬂoor.
(a) What was the work done in lifting the object?
(b) What is the gravitational potential energy of the object sitting on the shelf?
(c) If the object falls off the shelf and falls to the ﬂoor in the absence of air resistance, what will its velocity be when
it hits the ﬂoor?
Solution: weight of the object = mg = (3.00 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 29.4 N
(a) W = Fd = (29.4 N)(2.50 m) = 73.5 J
(b) PE = mgh = (3.00 kg)(9.80 m/s2)(2.50 m) = 73.5 J
(c) KE = PE so 1

ball is pulled back until the rope makes an angle of 45◦ with the vertical.
(a) What is the potential energy of the ball?
(b) If the ball is released, how fast will it be traveling at the bottom of its arc?

Solution: You can use trigonometry to ﬁnd the vertical height of the ball in the pulled back position. This vertical
height is found to be 0.877 m.
PE = mgh = (7.58 kg)(9.80 m/s2)(0.877 m) = 65.1 J

Summary

attempting to move it.

9.3. Conservation of Energy

9.3 Conservation of Energy

• State the law of conservation of energy.
• Describe a closed system.
• Use the law of conservation of energy to solve problems.

There are many energy conversions between potential and kinetic energy as the cars travel around this double looping
roller coaster. Throughout the ride, however, there will always be the same total amount of energy.

Conservation of Energy

The law of conservation of energy states that within a closed system, energy can change form, but the total amount
of energy is constant. Another way of expressing the law of conservation of energy is to say that energy can neither
be created nor destroyed. An important part of using the conservation of energy is selecting the system. Just as in
conservation of momentum, energy is conserved only if the system is closed. In a closed system, objects may not
enter or leave, and it is isolated from external forces so that no work can be done on the system.
In the analysis of the behavior of an object, you must make sure you have included everything in the system that
is involved in the motion. For example, if you are considering a ball that is acted on by gravity, you must include
the earth in your system. If considered by itself, one can tell that the kinetic energy of the ball is increasing as it
falls, but only by including the earth in the system can you see that the increasing kinetic energy is balanced by an
equivalent loss of potential energy. The sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy of an object is often called
the mechanical energy.
Consider a box with a weight of 20.0 N sitting at rest on a shelf that is 2.00 m above the earth. The box has zero
kinetic energy but it has potential energy related to its weight and the distance to the earth’s surface.
PE = mgh = (20.0 N)(2.00 m) = 40.0 J
If the box slides off the shelf, the only force acting on the box is the force of gravity and so the box falls. We can
calculate the speed of the box when it strikes the ground by several methods. We can calculate the speed directly

Example Problem: Suppose a cannon is sitting on top of a 50.0 m high hill and a 5.00 kg cannon ball is ﬁred with
a velocity of 30.0 m/s at some unknown angle. What is the velocity of the cannon ball when it strikes the earth?
Solution: Since the angle at which the cannon ball is ﬁred is unknown, we cannot use the usual equations from
projectile motion. However, at the moment the cannon ball is ﬁred, it has a certain KE due to the mass of the ball
and its speed and it has a certain PE due to its mass and it height above the earth. Those two quantities of energy can
be calculated. When the ball returns to the earth, its PE will be zero. Therefore, its KE at that point must account
for the total of its original KE + PE. T

9.4 Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

• Describe the difference between elastic and inelastic collisions and indicate what is conserved in each case.
• Solve problems involving elastic collisions using both the conservation of momentum and the conservation of

kinetic energy.

This device is known as Newton’s cradle. As the balls collide with each other, nearly all the momentum and kinetic
energy is conserved. If one ball swings down, exactly one ball will swing up; if three balls swing down, exactly
three will swing back up. The collisions between the balls are very nearly elastic.

Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

For all collisions in a closed system, momentum is conserved. In some collisions in a closed system, kinetic energy is
conserved. When both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, the collision is called an elastic collision. Most
collisions are inelastic because some amount of kinetic energy is converted to potential energy, usually by raising
one of the objects higher (increasing gravitation PE) or by ﬂexing the object. Any denting or other changing of
shape by one of the objects will also be accompanied by a loss of kinetic energy. The only commonly seen elastic
collisions are those between billiard balls or ball bearings, because these balls do not compress. And, of course,
collisions between molecules are elastic if no damage is done to the molecules.
Much more common are inelastic collisions. These collisions occur whenever kinetic energy is not conserved,
primarily when an object’s height is increased after the collision or when one of the objects is compressed.
Example Problem: A 12.0 kg toy train car moving at 2.40 m/s on a straight, level train track, collides head-on with
a second train car whose mass is 36.0 kg and was at rest on the track. If the collision is perfectly elastic and all
motion is frictionless, calculate the velocities of the two cars after the collision.

• elastic collision: One in which both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.

Regardless of what events occur, in all closed systems, energy will be conserved. Most of what we think of as
“energy” is in fact kinetic energy, or the energy of motion. Energy that is stored for later use is called potential
energy. In elastic collisions, momentum and kinetic energy are conserved; in these cases, it is possible to calculate
the colliding objects’ initial and ﬁnal velocities using the conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic
energy equations.

We often think of temperature and heat as the same thing. While they both involve molecular motion, they are not in
fact interchangeable. Thermal energy, or heat, depends on more than just the temperature. In the image above of a
river running across the surface of a glacier, the liquid water and the ice have the same temperature, and yet they are
in different states. In this chapter, we will uncover the realities of thermal energy, heat, temperature, and changes in

as material cools to 630 degrees Celsius; faint red glow persists down to about 480 degrees Celsius. For comparison,
a pizza oven is commonly operated at temperatures ranging from 260 to 315 degrees Celsius.

Heat, Temperature, and Thermal Energy Transfer

The ﬁrst theory about how a hot object differs from a cold object was formed in the 18th century. The suggested
explanation was that when an object was heated, an invisible ﬂuid called “caloric” was added to the object. Hot
objects contained more caloric than cold objects. The caloric theory could explain some observations about heated
objects (such as that the fact that objects expanded as they were heated) but could not explain others (such as why
your hands got warm when you rub them together).
In the mid-19th century, scientists devised a new theory to explain heat. The new theory was based on the assumption
that matter is made up of tiny particles that are always in motion. In a hot object, the particles move faster and
therefore have greater kinetic energy. The theory is called the kinetic-molecular theory and is the accepted theory
of heat. Just as a baseball has a certain amount of kinetic energy due to its mass and velocity, each molecule has a
certain amount of kinetic energy due to its mass and velocity. Adding up the kinetic energy of all the molecules in

Chapter 10. Thermal Energy

an object yields the thermal energy of the object.

When a hot object and a cold object touch each other, the molecules of the objects collide along the surface where
they touch. When higher kinetic energy molecules collide with lower kinetic energy molecules, kinetic energy is
passed from the molecules with more kinetic energy to those with less kinetic energy. In this way, heat always ﬂows
from hot to cold and heat will continue to ﬂow until the two objects have the same temperature. The movement of
heat from one object to another by molecular collision is called conduction.
Heat is the energy that ﬂows as a result of a difference in temperature. We use the symbol Q for heat. Heat, like all
forms of energy, is measured in joules.
The temperature of an object is a measurement of the average kinetic energy of all the molecules of the object. You
should note the difference between heat and temperature. Heat is the sum of all the kinetic energies of all the
molecules of an object, while temperature is the average kinetic energy of the molecules of an object. If an object
was composed of exactly three molecules and the kinetic energies of the three molecules are 50 J, 70 J, and 90 J, the
heat would be 210 J and the temperature would be 70 J.
The terms hot and cold refer to temperature. A hot object has greater average kinetic energy but may not have greater
total kinetic energy. Suppose you were to compare a milliliter of water near the boiling point with a bathtub full of
water at room temperature. The bathtub contains a billion times as many water molecules, and therefore has a higher
total kinetic energy and more heat. Nonetheless, we would consider the bathtub colder because its average kinetic
energy, or temperature, is lower.
Temperature Scales: Celsius and Kelvin
A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to
reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is
based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain
liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than
the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster
than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then
be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to
make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively
common thermometers.
The most commonly used temperature scale in the United States is the Farenheit scale. However, this scale is rarely
used throughout the world; the metric temperature scale is Celsius. This scale, based on the properties of water, was
devised by the Swedish physicist, Anders Celsius (1704 – 1744). The freezing point of water is 0◦C and the boiling
point of water was assigned to be 100◦C. The kinetic energies between these two points was divided evenly into
100 “degrees Celsius”.
The Kelvin or “Absolute” temperature scale is the scale often used by chemists and physicists.
It is based on
the temperature at which all molecular motion ceases; this temperature is called absolute zero and is 0 K. This
temperature corresponds to -273.15◦C. Since absolute zero is the coldest possible temperature, there are no negative
values on the Kelvin temperature scale. Conveniently, the Kelvin and Celsius scales have the same deﬁnition of a
degree, which makes it very easy to convert from one scale to the other. The relationship between Celsius and Kelvin
temperature scales is given by:

K = ◦C + 273.15

On the Kelvin scale, water freezes at 273 K and boils at 373 K.
Example Problem: Convert 25◦C to Kelvin.
Solution: K = ◦C + 273 = 25◦C + 273 = 298 K

molten core and, when sufﬁcient pressure is built up, the water shoots out of the ground in an amazing display.

Speciﬁc Heat

When heat ﬂows into an object, its thermal energy increases and so does its temperature. The amount of temperature
increase depends on three things: 1) how much heat was added, 2) the size of the object, and 3) the material of which
the object is made. When you add the same amount of heat to the same mass of different substances, the amount of
temperature increase is different. Each substance has a speciﬁc heat, which is the amount of heat necessary to raise
one mass unit of that substance by one temperature unit.
In the SI system, speciﬁc heat is measured in J/kg•K.
(Occasionally, you may also see speciﬁc heat expressed
sometimes in J/g•K). The speciﬁc heat of aluminum is 903 J/kg•K. Therefore, it requires 903 J to raise 1.00 kg of
aluminum by 1.00 K.

The amount of heat gained or lost by an object when its temperature changes can be calculated by the formula
Q = mc∆t,
where Q is the heat gained or lost, m is the mass of the object, c is its speciﬁc heat, and ∆t is the change in temperature.
You should note that the size of a Celsius degree and a Kelvin degree are exactly the same, and therefore ∆t is the
same whether measured in Celsius or Kelvin.
Example Problem: A 0.500 kg block of zinc is heated from 295 K to 350. K. How much heat was absorbed by the
zinc?
Solution: Q = mc∆t = (0.500 kg)(388 J/kg· K)(350. K − 295 K) = 10,600 J
Example Problem: 845 J of heat are added to a 0.200 kg block of aluminum at a temperature of 312.00 K. How
high will the temperature of the aluminum rise?
Solution: (t2 −t1) = Q
t2 = t1 + 4.68 K = 312.00 K + 4.68 K = 316.68 K

10.3 Calorimetry

• Understand the function of a calorimeter.
• Apply the law of conservation of energy to calorimeter calculations of temperature changes due to heat

transfer.

Though not particularly beautiful machines, calorimeters are incredibly useful ones. They are used to determine the
calories (food energy) in food, as well as the average heat yield from burning various grades of coal and oil. The
price of coal is often dependent on the heat yield from samples burned in a calorimeter.

Calorimetry

A calorimeter is a device used to measure changes in thermal energy or heat transfer. More speciﬁcally, it measures
calories. A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by one degree Celsius. As such, the
calorimeter measures the temperature change of a known amount of water. If a reaction is carried out in the reaction
vessel, or if a measured mass of heated substance is placed in the water of the calorimeter, the change in the water
temperature allows us to calculate the change in thermal energy.

159

10.3. Calorimetry

www.ck12.org

The function of the calorimeter depends on the conservation of energy in a closed, isolated system. Calorimeters are
carefully insulated so that heat transfer in or out is negligible. Consider the following example.
Example Problem: A 0.500 kg sample of water in a calorimeter is at 15.0ºC. A 0.0400 kg block of zinc at 115.0ºC
is placed in the water. The speciﬁc heat of zinc is 388 J/kg•ºC. Find the ﬁnal temperature of the system.
Solution: The heat lost by the block of zinc will equal the heat gain by the water in the calorimeter. In order to set
heat gain mathematically equal to heat loss, either one of the terms must be made negative or the temperature change
must be reversed. You should also note that the ﬁnal temperature of the water and the block of zinc will be the same
when equilibrium is reached.

• Calculate heat transfers necessary for changes of state.

Before the internal combustion engine was invented, steam engines were the power source for ships, locomotives,
tractors, lumber saws, and most industrial machines. Coal or wood was burned to boil water into steam, which ran
the engine.

Change of State

Most substances may exist in any of the three common states of matter. In the gaseous state, the molecular motion
has completely overcome any attraction between the particles and the particles are totally separate from each other.
There are large spaces between the particles and they move large distances between collisions. In the liquid state, the
molecular motion and the molecular attractions are more balanced. While the particles stay more or less in contact
with each other, they are still free to move and can slide past one another easily. In the solid state, the attractive forces
dominate. The particles are pulled together into a tightly packed pattern which does not allow the particles to pass
each other. The molecular motion in this form is essentially reduced to vibration in place. Increasing the temperature
of a substance means increasing the molecular motion (kinetic energy) of the molecules in the substance. The phase
in which a substance exists is the result of a competition between attractive forces and molecular motion.

162

www.ck12.org

Chapter 10. Thermal Energy

For most substances, when the temperature of the solid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a liquid, and
when the temperature of the liquid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a gas. We typically visualize a
solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or
the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough
to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by
the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are
able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point.
In order for the molecules to actually separate from each other, more energy must be added. This energy, called heat
of fusion or heat of melting, is absorbed by the particles as potential energy as the solid changes to a liquid. Rec-
ognize that, once the temperature of a solid has been raised to the melting point, it is still necessary for the solid to
absorb additional thermal energy in the form of potential energy as the molecules separate.
The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the particles have sufﬁcient molecular motion to exist in
the form of a gas. Once again, however, in order for the particles to separate to the gaseous form, they must absorb
a sufﬁcient amount of potential energy. The amount of potential energy necessary for a phase change to gaseous
form is called the heat of vaporization. Consider the heating curve shown below.

The heating curve shown is for water but other substances have similarly shaped heating curves. Suppose you begin
with solid water (ice) at -30°C and add heat at a constant rate. The heat you add in the beginning will be absorbed

163

10.4. Change of State

www.ck12.org

as kinetic energy and the temperature of the solid will increase. When you reach a temperature of 0°C (the melting
point for water), the heat you add is no longer absorbed as kinetic energy. Instead, the added heat is absorbed as
potential energy and the particles separate from each other. During the ﬂat part of the curve labeled “melting”,
heat is being added constantly but the temperature does not increase. At the left edge of this ﬂat line, the water is
solid; by the time enough heat has been added to get to the right edge, the water is liquid, but maintains the same
temperature. Once all the water is in the liquid form, the added heat will once again be absorbed as kinetic energy
and the temperature will increase again. During the time labeled “water being heated as a liquid”, all the added heat
is absorbed as kinetic energy.
When a temperature of 100°C (the boiling point of water) is reached, the added heat is once again absorbed as
potential energy and the molecules separate from liquid form into gaseous form. When all the substance has been
converted into gas, the temperature will again begin to rise.

When the temperature of a substance is changing, we can use the speciﬁc heat to determine the amount of heat that
is being gained or lost. When a substance is changing phase, we can use the heat of fusion or heat of vaporization
to determine the amount of heat being gained or lost. When a substance freezes from liquid to solid, the amount of
heat given off is exactly the same as the amount of heat absorbed when the substance melts from solid to liquid. The
equations for heat gained or lost are given here:
The heat gained or lost during a temperature change: Q = mc∆t.
The heat gained or lost during a phase change of solid to liquid: Q = mHf .

different speciﬁc heats, meaning they change temperature at different rates. Temperature and heat, though closely
related, are not the same. While temperature is a measurement of the average kinetic energy of the molecules, heat
is the total kinetic energy. Calculations of changes in heat over phase changes depend not only on the speciﬁc heat,

In the photo above, we see the water line of a large cargo ship. For this cargo ship, as for any object submerged or
partially submerged in water, the upward force of the water that is displaced by the ship, called buoyancy, is exactly
equal to the weight of the displaced ship. This cargo ship is unloaded, which means that the ship sinks into the water
about 13 feet and that the water displaced by the volume of the ship underwater will have a weight equal to the
weight of the empty ship. As cargo, and therefore weight, is added to the ship, it will submerge further. This ship
can submerge another 9 feet as it is loaded with cargo. As it submerges, it displaces more water so that the buoyant
force can support more weight. In this chapter, you will learn about the forces involved in ﬂuids, in addition to ﬂuid
expansion and the laws governing the behavior of gases.

11.1 Pressure in Fluids

• Deﬁne pressure.
• Calculate the pressure below the surface of liquids using the formula P = ρgh.

This is the Russian ocean submersible “Mir.” Submersibles like this are necessary for research or work at great depths
in the ocean because of the massive pressure. This craft can operate as deep as 6000 meters below the surface. The
pressure at 6000 meters below the ocean surface exceeds 8500 pounds per square inch.

Pressure in Fluids

Pressure is deﬁned as force per unit area, where the force F is understood to be acting perpendicular to the surface
area, A.

Pressure = P =

F
A

The SI unit for pressure is N/m2. This unit is also known as a pascal (Pa): 1 Pa = 1 N/m2.
Example: Consider a 80.0 kg person whose two feet cover an area of 500. cm2. Determine the pressure applied to
the ground by his feet.
Solution: The force exerted by this person on the ground would be (80.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 784 N. The area over
which this force is exerted would be 0.0500 m2.

It has been determined experimentally that a ﬂuid exerts pressure equally in all directions. In the sketch below, from
any given point below the surface of the ﬂuid, the pressure in all directions is the same. The ﬂuid exerts the same
pressure upward from this point as it does downward.

We can calculate how the pressure of a ﬂuid varies with depth, assuming the ﬂuid has uniform density.
Consider a gigantic tub ﬁlled with water as shown below. A column of water with a cross-sectional area of 1.00 m2
is designated. If we multiply the cross-sectional area by the height of the column, we get the volume of water in
this column. We can then multiply this volume by the density of water, 1000. kg/m3, and get the mass of water in
the column. We then multiply this mass by the acceleration due to gravity, g, to get the weight of the water in this
column.

The pressure exerted by this force would be exerted over the area at the bottom of the column.

Fweight = (area)(height)(ρ)(g)

P =

F
A =

ρghA
A = ρgh

Therefore, the pressure of a column of ﬂuid is proportional to the density of the ﬂuid and to the height of the column
of ﬂuid above the level. This is the pressure due to the ﬂuid itself. If an external pressure is exerted at the surface,
this must also be taken into account.

Example Problem: The surface of the water in a storage tank is 30.0 m above a water faucet in the kitchen of a
house. Calculate the water pressure at the faucet.
Solution: The pressure of the atmosphere acts equally at the surface of the water in the storage tank and on the water
leaving the faucet –so it will have no effect. The pressure caused by the column of water will be:
P = ρgh = (1000. kg/m3)(9.80 m/s2)(30.0 m) = 294,000 Pa
The pressure of the earth’s atmosphere, as with any ﬂuid, increases with the height of the column of air. In the case of
earth’s atmosphere, there are some complications. The density of the air is not uniform but decreases with altitude.
Additionally there is no distinct top surface from which height can be measured. We can, however, calculate the
approximate difference in pressure between two altitudes using the equation P = ρg∆h. The average pressure of the
atmosphere at sea level is 1.013 × 105 Pa. This pressure is often expressed as 101.3 kPa.

11.2 Pascal’s Principle

• State Pascal’s Principle.
• Use Pascal’s Principle to make calculations on hydraulic systems.

A person is able to lift the entire rear end of the automobile using only one hand with the hydraulic jack shown
in the image. Hydraulic systems are similar to simple machines in that they can produce very large mechanical
advantages.

Pascal’s Principle

The earth’s atmosphere exerts a pressure on all objects with which it is in contact. Atmospheric pressure acting on
a ﬂuid is transmitted throughout that ﬂuid. For example, the water pressure at 100. m below the surface of a lake is
9.8 × 105 Pa. The total pressure at that point, however, is the pressure of the water plus the pressure of the air above
the water. The pressure of the air at the surface of the water is 1.0 × 105 Pa, or 1 atm (atmosphere). Therefore, the
total pressure at 100. m below the surface of the water is 9.8 × 105 Pa + 1.0 × 105 Pa = 10.8 × 105 Pa.
This is an example of Pascal’s Principle, which states that pressure applied to a conﬁned liquid increases the
pressure throughout by the same amount. A number of practical devices take advantage of this principle. Hydraulic
brakes, hydraulic lifts, and hydraulic presses are three useful tools that make use of Pascal’s Principle.
The sketch below is an example of a hydraulic lift. We have a conﬁned liquid in contact with two pistons (A and B)
of different sizes. The pressure of the liquid on these two pisons is the same (Pascal’s principle). Therefore, FA = FB,
and
Suppose that the area of piston A is 4.0 cm2 and the area of piston B is 200. cm2. If we place an automobile weighing
10,000 N on piston B, we can lift that car by exerting a force of 200 N on piston A. This is another form of simple
machine and its ideal mechanical advantage is 50. The ideal mechanical advantage of a hydraulic lift equals the
ratio of the large piston area to the small piston area.

• Describe buoyancy.
• Make calculations of buoyancy.
• Make calculations of ﬂoating objects’ displacement.

This cargo ship displaces an amount of water such that the weight of the displaced water is exactly equal to the
weight of the ship and its cargo. The displacement of water is what produces the buoyancy to ﬂoat this ship. When
this photo was taken, the ship was empty so it did not sink very deep in the water to displace the necessary weight.
When this ship is fully loaded with cargo, the water line will be where the black paint meets the red paint.

Archimedes’ Principle and Buoyancy

If an object is submerged in a liquid, the object displaces a volume of the liquid equal to the volume of the submerged
object. Legend has it that this observation was made by Archimedes when he sat in a bath tub that was ﬁlled to the
top of the tub. The volume of water that overﬂowed was equal to his own volume. The forces exerted by the ﬂuid on
the sides of the submerged object are balanced. However, the forces exerted by the ﬂuid on the top and bottom of the
object are not equal. The force exerted by the liquid below the object is greater than the force exerted by the liquid
above it; the liquid exerts a net upward force on the submerged or ﬂoating object. This force is called buoyancy, and
its magnitude is equal to the weight of the displaced water. Archimedes’ Principle states that the buoyant force is
equal to the weight of the displaced liquid.
Example Problem: The density of steel is 9000. kg/m3 and the density of water is 1000. kg/m3. If a cube of steel
that is 0.100 m on each side is placed in a tank of water and weighed while under water, what is the apparent weight
of the cube?

176

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. The Fluid States

Solution: The volume of the cube is 0.00100 m3.
The mass of the cube is 9.00 kg.
The weight of the cube when not submerged in water = (9.00 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 88.2 N
The mass of water displaced by the cube = 1.00 kg
The weight of the water displaced by the cube = 9.80 N
The buoyant force on the steel cube = 9.80 N
Apparent weight of cube under water = 88.2 N - 9.80 N = 78.4 N
Example Problem: A hollow metal cube 1.00 m on each side has a mass of 600. kg. How deep will this cube sink
when placed in a vat of water?
Solution: Since the weight of the cube is 5880 N, it will need to displace 5880 N of water in order to ﬂoat.
Volume of submerged portion of cube = (1.00 m)(1.00 m)(x m) = x m3
Mass of water displaced = 1000x kg
Weight of water displaced = 9800x N
9800x = 5880
x = 0.600 m
The cube will sink such that 0.60 m are underwater and 0.40 m are above water.

11.4 Combined Gas Law

• Understand Boyle’s, Charles’, and Gay-Lussac’s Laws.
• State the Combined Gas Law.
• Given ﬁve of the six unknowns in the combined gas law, solve for the sixth.

In order to design hot air balloons like these, engineers must make gas law calculations, buoyancy calculations, and
have knowledge of the density of air at different altitudes.

Combined Gas Law

For a given quantity of gas, it has been found experimentally that the volume of the gas is inversely proportional to
the pressure applied to the gas when the temperature is kept constant. That is,

V ∝ 1
P

at a constant T.

For example, if the pressure on a gas is doubled, the volume is reduced to half its original volume. This relationship
is known as Boyle’s Law. Boyle’s Law can also be written PV = constant at constant T . As long as the temperature
and the amount of gas remains constant, any variation in the pressure or volume will result in a change in the other
one, keeping the product at a constant value.
Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We’ve already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for
pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 105 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol:
Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm.

179

11.4. Combined Gas Law

www.ck12.org

For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as "millimeters mercury." Another pressure unit commonly used
in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units.
Temperature also affects the volume of a gas. Jacques Charles found that when the pressure is held constant, the
volume of a gas increases in direct proportion to its absolute temperature. This relationship became known as
Charles’ Law.

V ∝ T at constant P.

A third gas law, known as Gay-Lussac’s Law, states that at constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly
proportional to the absolute temperature.

P ∝ T at constant V.

The kinetic-molecular theory assumes that there are no attractive forces between the molecules and that the volume
of the molecules themselves is negligible compared to the volume of the gas. At high temperatures and low pressures,
these assumptions are true and the gases follow the gas laws very accurately. However, these three laws are true
only as long as the pressure and density are relatively low. When a gas is compressed to the point that the molecular
volume is a signiﬁcant portion of the gas volume, the gas laws begin to fail. Similarly, when gases become so dense
that the molecules begin to attract each other, the gas laws also fail. These changes are expressed in the Van der
Waals equations.
These three gas laws can be combined into the Combined Gas Law as follows:

PV ∝ T or

PV
T = constant

A commonly used form of the combined gas law states that, for a sample of gas, the ratio of the product of the
original pressure and volume to the original temperature will equal the ratio of the product of a new pressure and
volume to the new temperature, or

P1V1
T1

=

P2V2
T2

.

This equation is useful when operating with the same sample of gas, and given ﬁve of the variables, to solve for the
sixth.
When solving problems with temperature in them, the calculations require that temperatures be in Kelvin. Be careful
to convert to Kelvin when given temperatures in Celsius.
Example Problem: A sample of gas has a volume of 2.00 L and a pressure of 0.750 kPa when its temperature
is 25°C. If the volume is expanded to 4.00 L and the pressure reduced to 0.500 kPa, what must the temperature
become?
Solution: The relationships between volume and temperature and pressure and temperature expressed in the gas
laws are only true when the kinetic energy of the molecules are directly proportional to the temperature. Therefore,
when dealing with all gas laws, the temperatures must be expressed in Kelvin.

Compressed gases provide vital fuels for industry and for homes and farms in rural areas.

Universal Gas Law

The combined gas law, PV ∝ T , is true for a particular sample of gas. If any gas is added or allowed to leak out,
however, the relationship is lost. In order to get a relationship that is true for any sample of gas, it is necessary
to incorporate a term for the amount of gas. From observations as simple as blowing up a balloon, it is clear that
increasing the amount of gas increases the volume.
Because different gases have different weights per molecule, including a term for mass of gas does not produce a
consistent equation. If, however, we include a term expressing the number of moles of gas rather than its mass, we
can produce a constant proportionality. A mole is a unit representing the number of atoms present. The letter n is
used to represent the moles of substance. Incorporating n into the equation yields PV ∝ nT . If we insert a letter, R,
to represent the constant of proportionality, we get the normal form of the universal gas law, PV = nRT .
The unit term for n is always moles and T is always in Kelvin. The units for pressure and volume, however, may
vary. The value of R depends on the units that are used for pressure and volume.

Since the product of (liters)(atm) can be converted to joules, we also have a value for R where liters × atm have been
converted to joules, R = 8.314 J/mol·K. The two common values of the universal gas law constant R are 0.0821 L·
atm/mol· K and 8.314 J/mol· K.
Most universal gas law problems are calculated at STP. STP stands for standard temperature and pressure, which is
the most commonly calculated temperature and pressure value. STP is deﬁned as 1.00 atm and 0◦C, or 273 K.
Example Problem: Determine the volume of 1.00 mol of any gas at STP.
Solution: First isolate V from PV=nRT. Then plug in known values and solve.

V =

nRT
P =

(1.00 mol)(0.0821 L· atm/mol· K)(273 K)

(1.00 atm)

= 22.4 liters

For any gas at STP, one mole has a volume of 22.4 liters. This can be an extremely convenient conversion factor.
Example Problem: A sample of oxygen gas occupies 10.0 liters at STP. How many moles of oxygen are in the
container?
Solution:

n =

PV
RT =

(1.00 atm)(10.0 L)

(0.0821 L· atm/mol· K)(273 K)

= 0.446 moles

Summary

• The universal gas law is PV = nRT , where P is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles, R is the universal
gas law constant, and T is the absolute temperature.
• The value of R varies depending on the units used for P and V . Two common values are 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K
and R = 8.314 J/mol· K.
• STP is standard temperature and pressure; 273 K and 1.00 atm.
• One mole of a gas at STP has a volume of 22.4 liters.

• Universal gas law constant: Denoted by R, two common values are 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K and 8.314 J/mol·K.

Fluid pressure equations apply to all ﬂuids, including liquids and gases. Conﬁned liquids are subject to the same
pressure throughout, and gaseous ﬂuids exert equal pressures on all sides of an object. As such, objects partially
submerged in water are acted upon by a buoyant force, equal to the submerged weight. Finally, gases are subject
to laws regarding the relationships between pressure, temperature, and volume; these laws are compiled into the
Combined Gas Law and the Ideal Gas Law.

A surfer’s kinetic energy comes directly from the waves themselves. Of all the wave forms we will study, it is
with water waves that we have the most personal experience. Water waves in large bodies of water, however, have
movement that is not due to the natural characteristics of waves. In pure transverse waves—like water waves—the
particles of media move perpendicularly to the direction of the energy movement. If we were to create a perfect
water wave in a lab, the water molecules themselves would only move up and down, while the energy of the wave
would move horizontally toward the sides of the pan. In such a perfect wave, the apparent movement of water toward
the side of the pan is an illusion. After completing this chapter, you will understand different types of waves, as well
as their properties.

12.1 Transverse Waves

• Describe transverse waves.
• Explain how waves transfer energy without transferring matter.
• Deﬁne wavelength, frequency, and period of a transverse wave.
• State the relationship between speed, wavelength, and frequency.
• Solve problems using the relationships between speed, wavelength, frequency, and period.

This surfer rides a giant wave at the legendary big wave surf break known as as "Jaws" in Maui, HI. Massive waves,
such as this one, transfer huge amounts of energy.

Transverse Waves

Types of Waves

Water waves, sound waves, and the waves that travel along a rope are mechanical waves. Mechanical waves require
a material medium such as water, air, or rope. Light waves, however, are electromagnetic waves and travel without
a material medium. They are not mechanical waves.
In all types of mechanical waves, energy moves from one place to another while the media carrying the wave only
vibrates back and forth in position. One type of mechanical wave is the transverse wave. In the case of transverse
waves, the movement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of the energy movement.

188

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Waves and Energy Transfer

In the sketch above, consider the transverse wave produced when the boy jerks one end of a rope up and down while
the other end is tied to a tree. The energy spent by the boy transfers permanently down the rope to the tree. The
rope, however, only moves up and down. If we stuck a piece of tape somewhere on the rope, we would see that the
particles of medium do not travel with the energy. After the wave has passed by, the piece of tape would still be in the
same place it was before the wave approached. In all transverse waves, the movement media vibrates perpendicularly
to the direction of wave motion, and the medium is not permanently moved from one place to another.

Frequency, Wavelength, and Velocity

Waves are identiﬁed by several characteristics. There is a center line where the medium would be if there were
no wave, which is sometimes describes as the undisturbed position. The displacement of the medium above this
undisturbed position is called a crest and the displacement below the undisturbed position is called a trough. The
maximums of the crest and trough are equal and are called the amplitude. The distance between equivalent positions
on succeeding waves is called the wavelength. The wavelength could be measured from a crest to the next crest or
from a trough to the next trough, and is commonly represented with the Greek letter lambda, λ.

The time interval required for one complete wave to pass a point is called the period. During the period of the wave,
an entire wavelength from one crest to the next crest passes a position. The number of waves that pass a single
position in one second is called the frequency. The period of a wave and its frequency are reciprocals of each other.

f =

1
T

The units for the period are seconds and the units for frequency are s−1 or 1
Hertz (Hz).

s. This unit has also been given the name

189

12.1. Transverse Waves

www.ck12.org

Another important characteristic of a wave is its velocity. The wave velocity is different from the velocity of the
medium; the wave velocity is the velocity of the linearly transferred energy. Since the energy travels one wavelength,
λ, in one period, T , the velocity can be expressed as distance over time:

v =

λ
T .

Since period and frequency are reciprocals, the speed of the wave could also be expressed as v = λ f .
Example Problem: A sound wave has a frequency of 262 Hz. What is the time lapse between successive wave
crests?
Solution: The time lapse between successive crests would be the period and the period is the reciprocal of the
frequency.

T =

1
f =

262 s−1 = 0.00382 s

Example Problem: A sound wave has a frequency of 262 Hz has a wavelength of 1.29 m. What is the velocity of
the wave?
Solution: v = λ f = (1.29 m)(262 s−1) = 338 m/s

12.2 Longitudinal Waves

• Describe longitudinal waves.

Playing with a Slinky is a childhood tradition, but few children realize they are actually playing with physics.

Longitudinal Waves

Like transverse waves, longitudinal waves are mechanical waves, which means they transfer energy through a
medium. Unlike transverse waves, longitudinal waves cause the particles of medium to move parallel to the direction
of the wave. They are most common in springs, where they are caused by the pushing an pulling of the spring.
Although the surface waves on water are transverse waves, ﬂuids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) usually transmit
longitudinal waves.
As shown in the image below, longitudinal waves are a series of compressions and rarefactions, or expansions. The
wavelength of longitudinal waves is measured by the distance separating the densest compressions. The amplitude
of longitudinal waves is the difference in media density between the undisturbed density to the highest density in a
compression.

12.3 Doppler Shift

• Deﬁne the Doppler shift.
• Explain the Doppler shift with sound.
• Make calculations based on the Doppler shift.

At normal speeds, when an object generates sound, the sound travels away from the object and people hear the same
sound that was generated by the object. In some unusual cases, like this airplane, the object can travel as fast or
faster than the sounds it makes. The sound wave moves along with this airplane; as the airplane continues to generate
more sound, this sound is added to the old sound. When this extra large sound wave front arrives, the sound is much
louder than the sound that was originally generated. When this happens with airplanes, the sound is called a “sonic
boom.”

Doppler Shift

If an emitted sound is moving at a signiﬁcant fraction of the speed of sound relative to the receiver, it is possible for
the sound emitted by a source and the sound received by a receiver to be different. This is called a Doppler shift.
Suppose the trumpet player in the sketch below is playing a constant note with a wavelength equal to 1.00 m/s. If you
are sitting down the road a ways and the truck is stationary, then the wavelength of the sound that reaches you will
be 1.00 m long and you will hear a note corresponding to that wavelength. Suppose now, that the speed of sound is
333 m/s and this truck is moving toward you at 166. m/s. When the trumpet player begins playing the tone, the ﬁrst
crest will move toward you at 333 m/s. In the ﬁrst 0.003 seconds, that ﬁrst crest will move exactly 1.00 m (which
happens to be one wavelength for this sound). After the trumpet player generates the ﬁrst crest, however, the truck
also moves and in the ﬁrst 0.003 seconds, the truck moves 0.50 m. After the ﬁrst 0.003 seconds, the trumpet player
creates a second crest and sends it on its way. When this second crest is generated, the ﬁrst crest is only 0.50 m
away. If the truck did not move, the crests would reach your ear with a wavelength of 1.00 m, but because the truck
moves toward you at very high speed, the crests reach your ear at a distance of only 0.50 m apart. Therefore, the

195

12.3. Doppler Shift

www.ck12.org

sound you hear will have shorter wavelengths than the sound that was emitted by the trumpet player. The frequency
of the sound you hear would be double the frequency that was being emitted.

If the truck was moving away from you, the opposite change of frequency would occur. That is, the received
wavelength would be longer than the one emitted and the received frequency would be lower than the frequency
emitted. You may have noticed frequency changes in automobile sounds when you stand near a highway. Or that an
emergency vehicle’s siren is different when approaching you than when leaving.

You can also hear the Doppler shift in the classroom simply by striking a tuning fork and then moving the tuning
sharply toward you or away from you. Even though the tuning fork generates a constant tone, you will hear wavering
tones as you move the tuning fork around.

In terms of the listener, the train sketched on the left above is not moving and therefore the wavelengths and frequency
heard in all directions will be the same as the frequency being emitted. For the train on the right, however, since the
train is moving toward the right, the wavelengths measured to the right will be shorter than those emitted and the
wavelengths measured to the left will be longer than those emitted.
Christian Doppler (1803 –1853) did experiments in 1842 with trumpeters playing a single note as they sat on a
railroad ﬂatcar and were pulled back and forth past a stationary observer. The Doppler effect also occurs when the

source of the sound is stationary and the observer is moving (with a signiﬁcant fraction of the speed of sound). The
following formulas have been developed for calculating the observed frequency:
When the source is moving toward you, fo = f
1− vR
v
when the source is moving away from you, fo = f
1+
In the equations fo is the perceived frequency, f is the emitted frequency, vR is the relative velocity and v is the speed
of sound.
Example Problem: The speed of sound is 340. m/s and a train whistle with a frequency of 512 Hz is emitted from
a train coming toward you at 40.0 m/s. What frequency will you hear?
Solution: fo = f

12.4 Reﬂection of Mechanical Waves

• State the law of reﬂection.
• Solve problems using the law of reﬂection.
• Given data about the media on either side of a barrier, determine whether the reﬂected wave will be upright or

inverted.

When mechanical waves strike a barrier, at least part of the energy of the waves will be reﬂected back into the
media from which they came. You experience this every single day, when you look in the mirror and see your own
reﬂection.

Reﬂection of Mechanical Waves

When a wave strikes an obstacle or comes to the end of the medium it is traveling in, some portion of the wave is
reﬂected back into the original medium. It reﬂects back at an equal angle that it came in. These angles are called
the angle of incidence and the angle of reﬂection. The normal line, the incident and reﬂected rays, and the angles
of incidence and reﬂection are all shown in the diagram sketched above. The law of reﬂection states that the angle
of incidence equals the angle of reﬂection. These rules of reﬂection apply in the cases of water waves bouncing off
the side of a pool, sound waves echoing off a distant cliff, or wave pulses traveling down a rope or a slinky.
Consider the change that would occur with a light rope joined to a heavier rope. When a wave pulse travels down
the rope and encounters the media change, a reﬂection will occur. Look at the image below. In the top sketch, we
see a lightweight (black) rope attached to a heavier rope (red). There is a wave pulse traveling down the rope from
left to right. When the wave pulse encounters the barrier (the change in rope weight), part of the wave moves into
the new medium and part of the wave is reﬂected back into the old medium.
As you can see in the bottom half of the diagram, the transmitted portion of the wave continues into the new medium
right side up. The transmitted wave is somewhat diminished because some of the energy of the wave was reﬂected
and also because the rope to be lifted is heavier. The reﬂected wave is also diminished because some of the energy
was transmitted through the barrier. The reﬂected wave is also inverted (upside down). This is a general rule for
mechanical waves passing from a less dense medium into a more dense medium, that is, the reﬂected wave will be
inverted.

199

12.4. Reﬂection of Mechanical Waves

www.ck12.org

The situation changes when the wave is passing from a more dense medium into a less dense medium. As you can
see in the sketch below, when a wave pulse moving in denser medium encounters a media interface to a medium of
less density, the reﬂected wave is upright rather than inverted.

It is also possible for a mechanical wave to encounter an impenetrable barrier, that is, a barrier which does not allow
any transmission at all.
In such a case, the complete wave pulse will be reﬂected and the reﬂected wave will be
inverted.

Summary

• When a wave strikes an obstacle or comes to the end of the medium it is traveling in, some part of the wave is

reﬂected back into the original medium.

• The law of reﬂection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reﬂection.
• The general rule, for mechanical waves passing from a less dense medium into a more dense medium, the

reﬂected wave will be inverted.

• When a wave pulse moving in denser medium encounters a media interface to a medium of lesser density, the

reﬂected wave is upright rather than inverted.

• When a mechanical wave encounters an impenetrable barrier, the complete wave pulse will be reﬂected and

the reﬂected wave will be inverted.

12.5 Refraction of Mechanical Waves

• Deﬁne and describe refraction of mechanical waves.
• State and use the law of refraction.

A straw in a glass of water seen from the side often appears broken, even though it is not. The apparent break is due
to the bending of light rays leaving the straw; as the light passes from the water to the glass and from the glass to the
air, the light rays are bent. Nonetheless, your eye traces the light ray backward as if the light has followed a straight
path from its origin at the straw. Since the light appears to have come from a different place, your eye sees the straw
as being broken.

Refraction of Mechanical Waves

When any wave strikes a boundary between media, some of the energy is reﬂected and some is transmitted. When
the wave strikes the media interface at an angle, the transmitted wave will move in a slightly different direction than
the incident wave. This phenomenon is known as refraction.

Consider the image sketched above. Suppose that the waves represented here are water waves. The wave crests
are represented by the black lines in the image. As such, the distance between two consecutive black lines is the
wavelength. Let the red line represent a transition from deep to shallow water. This transition is called the media
interface. As the waves hit the boundary, the waves slow down. The right side of the wave reaches the boundary
before the left side of the wave, causing the left side to catch up and the angle of propagation to change slightly. This
change in direction can be seen in the yellow line, which is slightly angled at the boundary.

The refraction of waves across boundaries operates similarly to the method by which tanks are steered. Tanks do
not have a steering wheel. Instead, they have an accelerator to produce forward motion and separate brakes on each
tread. The operator uses brakes on both treads at the same time in order to stop, but brakes on only one tread to turn
the tank. By braking one side, the operator causes that side to slow down or stop while the other side continues at
the previous speed, causing the tank to turn towards the slower tread.
This sketch shows a wave ray striking an interface between old medium and new medium. A normal line has been
drawn as a dotted line perpendicular to the interface. The angle between the incident ray and the normal line is called
the angle of incidence, shown as θi, and the angle between the refracted ray and the normal line is called the angle
of refraction, θr.

We already understand that the change in the wave direction at the border depends on the difference between the two
velocities. This relationship is conveniently expressed in a mathematical relationship:

sinθr
sinθi

=

vr
vi

=

λr
λi

The ratio of the sine of the angle of refraction to the sine of the angle of incidence is the same as the ratio of the
velocity of the wave in the new medium to the velocity of the wave in the old medium and equal to the ratio of
wavelength (λ) in the old medium to the wavelength in the new medium.
Example Problem: A water wave with a wavelength of 3.00 m is traveling in deep water at 16.0 m/s. The wave
strikes a sharp interface with shallow water with an angle of incidence of 53.0◦. The wave refracts into the shallow
water with an angle of refraction of 30.0◦. What is the velocity of the wave in shallow water and what is its
wavelength in the new medium?
Solution: sinθr
sinθi
16.0 m/s = λr

16.0 m/s and vr = 10.0 m/s.

sin53◦ = vr

so sin30◦

= vr
vi

If the wavelength of a wave in a new medium is

= λr
λi

so 10.0 m/s

3.00 m and λr = 1.88 m.

vr
vi
Example Problem: The ratio of the sinθr to sinθi is 0.769 .
5.00× 10−9 m, what is its wavelength in the original medium?
Solution:

0.769 =

λr
λi

so λi =

5.00× 10−9 m

0.769

= 6.50× 10−9 m

Summary

• When any wave strikes a boundary between media, some of the energy is reﬂected and some is transmitted.
• When a wave strikes the media interface at an angle, the transmitted wave will move in a different direction

than the incident wave. This phenomenon is known as refraction.

• At any media interface, sinθr

The primary topic of this chapter was wave motion. Mechanical waves are either transverse, like a swinging jump
rope, or longitudinal, like a compressed slinky. Both types of waves have a wavelength, frequency, period, and
wave velocity, which can be easily calculated. Waves are also subject to the Doppler effect: the apparent frequency
of a wave can be lesser or greater than its actual, emitted frequency for an observer moving relative to its source,
depending on the two’s relative speed and whether they are approaching or retreating from each other. This effect
explains why the pitch of an emergency siren changes as it approaches a listener. Finally, this chapter explained why
and how waves are refracted and reﬂected as they move from one medium to another.

From 1665 to 1666, Isaac Newton studied sunlight and discovered that it can be broken down into a rainbow of colors
with a prism. Today, we know that the rainbow of colors is a consequence of bending the different wavelengths of
different colors. “White” sunlight is not really white—there is no wavelength of light that is white. Rather, it is a
mixture of many different colors that appears white to our brains after being processed by our eyes and optic nerves.

• Describe electromagnetic radiation.
• State the speed of light in air.
• Use the speed of light to solve problems.
• Deﬁne luminous, illuminated, transparent, translucent, opaque and polarized.
• Understand the difference between color from pigment and color from light.

White light is composed of an inﬁnite number of individual colors. Your eye blends the colors and your brain “sees”
white light. A prism, such as the one shown above and on Pink Floyd’s album cover, is able to resolve the light back
into individual colors.

Fundamentals of Light

Electromagnetic Radiation Spectrum

We only see objects that have light waves that travel from them to our eyes. Objects either generate light or reﬂect
it. Light is generated by incandescent and ﬂuorescent lamps, light emitting diodes, ﬂames, very hot objects, and even
some animals. Our major source of light is the sun. Light is a small fraction of the energy we call electromagnetic
radiation.
Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that consists of oscillating electric and magnetic ﬁelds traveling at the
speed of light. Electromagnetic waves carry this energy from one place to another and are similar to waves in a rope.
Unlike the wave in a rope, however, electromagnetic waves do not require a medium to travel; the most prevalent
electromagnetic waves we experience travel through the vacuum of outer space from the sun.

209

13.1. Fundamentals of Light

www.ck12.org

The energy of an electromagnetic wave travels in a straight line along the path of the wave. The moving light wave
has associated with it an oscillating electric ﬁeld and an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld. Scientists often represent the
electromagnetic wave with the image below.

The black line represents the straight path of the light itself. Along this path, there exists an electric ﬁeld that will
reach a maximum positive charge, slowly collapse to zero charge, and then expand to a maximum negative charge.
Similarly, there is an changing magnetic ﬁeld that oscillates from maximum north pole ﬁeld to maximum south pole
ﬁeld. Along the path of the electromagnetic wave, these changing ﬁelds repeat, oscillating over and over again.
However, the oscillating electric and magnetic ﬁelds demonstrate a weaving pattern that is not the way light travels.
For an electromagnetic wave, the crests and troughs represent the oscillating ﬁelds, not the path of the light.
Although light waves look different from waves in a rope, we still characterize light waves by their wavelength,
frequency, and velocity. We can measure along the path of the wave the distance the wave travels between one crest
and the succeeding crest, which is the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation. Like transverse waves through a
medium, the frequency of electromagnetic waves is the number of full cycles of waves that pass a certain point in a
set unit of time. The velocity for all electromagnetic waves traveling through a vacuum is the same: 3.00× 108 m/s,
which is symbolized by the lower case c. The relationship, then, for the velocity, wavelength, and frequency of
electromagnetic waves is: c = λ f .
The entire spectrum of electromagnetic waves includes very low energy electric waves up to very high energy
gamma rays. As you probably know, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and radio waves are also waves on the electromagnetic
spectrum. The full electromagnetic spectrum is shown below. You can see that visible light is a very small fraction
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Color

Chapter 13. Light

The colors that we see are blends of some number of individual frequencies of visible light. The surface of materials
have chemical structures that cause particular frequencies of light to be either absorbed or reﬂected. Our eyes pick
up the frequencies that are reﬂected (or generated) by the object and the frequencies are blended so that we see one
color. If the surface of an object absorbs all frequencies of light, we see black. If all frequencies are emitted or
reﬂected, we see white. If you had a book whose cover reﬂected only blue light and you placed this book in the
presence of white light from an incandescent light bulb, all the colors except blue would be absorbed and the blue
would be reﬂected, allowing you to see a blue book. If you placed the same book in the presence of only red light,
no light would be reﬂected from the book and you would see a black book.
Discussions of colors can sometimes become confusing because of the difference between light emitters and light
absorbers. Light absorbers, such as dyes and pigments, absorb frequencies from those that you see, while light
emitters add frequencies to what you see. If I were to shine red light, green light, and blue light into your eye all at
the same time, you would likely see some variation of white. If I were to mix red paint, green paint, and blue paint
together, you would likely see black or some very dark color.
If an object emits light waves, we say the object is luminous (generates light). If an object merely reﬂects light
that falls on it, we say the object is illuminated (reﬂects light). Many objects allow light rays to pass through them
without disrupting the organization of the rays. When this happens, you can clearly identify the objects from which
the light came. Objects that allow light to pass through undisrupted are said to be transparent. Air, glass, some
plastics, and some other materials are examples of transparent objects. There are also objects that allow light to pass
through them but they disrupt the rays so that the objects from which the light came cannot be identiﬁed. Objects
that allow light to pass through but disrupt images are said to be translucent. Lampshades, frosted light bulbs, and
fogged glass are examples of translucent materials. Many other objects do not allow any light to pass through. Such
objects are said to be opaque.

Polarization

Remember the illustration of electromagnetic radiation given above? These electric and magnetic waves may
oscillate in any direction. That is, the oscillating ﬁelds may be oscillating vertically, horizontally, and in every
other direction. Light typically consists of oscillating ﬁelds in all directions, but always travels in a straight line.
Filters can be constructed such that only light with the ﬁelds oscillating in a certain direction can pass through the
ﬁlter. This is much like having a large number of ropes passing through the slots in a picket fence. The ropes have
transverse waves oscillating in all possible directions moving toward the fence. When the waves encounter the fence,
only the oscillations that are vertical and ﬁt through the slots in the fence will be allowed to pass through. Light that
has all its ﬁeld oscillations in the same direction is said to be polarized.

Reﬂection of Light

Chapter 13. Light

The Law of Reﬂection

When a light ray strikes a reﬂecting surface, the angle of incidence (measured from the normal line) is equal to the
angle of reﬂection (also measured from the normal line). This is called the Law of Reﬂection.
If the reﬂecting surface is a very smooth surface, the reﬂection will be a regular reﬂection, in which the light rays
maintain their position relative to each other and objects will be visible and identiﬁable in the reﬂected image. If the
reﬂecting surface is rough, the reﬂection will be a diffuse reﬂection, and objects will not be visible or identiﬁable
in the reﬂection. When you are considering the size of things on the scale of wavelengths of light, even surfaces that
appear smooth may be very rough in terms of light waves, and most surfaces produce diffuse reﬂection.

Summary

• The law of reﬂection states that, when a light ray strikes a reﬂecting surface, the angle of incidence (measured

from the normal line) is equal to the angle of reﬂection (also measured from the normal line).

• If the reﬂecting surface is a very smooth surface, the reﬂection will be regular, in which the light rays maintain

their position relative to each other.

• If the reﬂecting surface is rough, the reﬂection will be diffuse and objects will be distorted in the reﬂection.
• Images in a plane mirror are reversed left and right but not reversed top and bottom.

• law of reﬂection: The law of reﬂection says that the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals

the angle at which it is reﬂected.

• regular reﬂection: If a parallel beams of light falls on a smooth surface, the reﬂected beams are also parallel.
• diffuse reﬂection: When the reﬂecting surface is rough, parallel incident beams of light would be reﬂected in

non-parallel, random directions.

13.3. Refraction of Light

www.ck12.org

13.3 Refraction of Light

• Deﬁne refraction.
• Given data about the optical density of the media, predict whether the light will bend toward the normal or

away from the normal.

• State Snell’s Law and solve refraction problems using it.
• Solve problems using the relationship between the index of refraction and the velocity of light in the media.
• Explain effects caused by the refraction of light.

When a light ray passes at an angle through the boundary between optically different media, the light does not travel
in a straight line. The pencil in the glass of liquid shown above is a normal straight pencil. The light that travels
from the pencil through the liquid, through the glass, and into the air is bent differently than light from the portion
of the pencil that is not in the liquid. Your eye assumes the light from both portions of the pencil moved in a straight
line, but the two portions of the pencil do not appear to be lined up. Your eye thinks the pencil is broken.

Refraction of Light

The speed of light is different in different media. If the speed of light is slower in a particular medium, that medium
is said to be more optically dense. When a wave front enters a new medium at an angle, it will change directions. If
the light is entering a more optically dense medium, the light bends toward the normal line. If the light is entering

218

www.ck12.org

Chapter 13. Light

a less optically dense medium, the light will bend away from the normal line. Remember that the normal line is the
line perpendicular to the medium interface.
In the sketch below, light wave fronts are moving upward from the bottom of the page and encounter a boundary
into a more optically dense medium. The light waves bend toward the normal line. Because the right end of the
wave fronts enter the new medium ﬁrst, they slow down ﬁrst. When the right side of the wave front is moving more
slowly that the left side, the wave front will change directions.

When light is traveling from air into another medium, Snell’s Law states the relationship between the angle of
incidence and angle of refraction is

n =

sinθi
sinθr

where θi is the angle of incidence, θr is the angle of refraction, and n is the ratio of the two sines and is called the
index of refraction. Snell’s Law may be stated that a ray of light bends in such a way that the ratio of the sine of
the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant.
The index of refraction is also related to the relative speeds of light in a vacuum and in the medium.

Effects of Refraction

Bending the Sun’s Rays

Because air is slightly more optically dense than a vacuum, when sunlight passes from the vacuum of space into our
atmosphere, it bends slightly towards the normal. When the sun is below the horizon and thus not visible on a direct
line, the light path will bend slightly and thus make the sun visible by refraction. Observers can see the sun before
it actually comes up over the horizon, or after it sets.

Mirages

In the Figure 13.2, the sun shines on the road, heating the air just above the road. The difference in density between
the hot air over the road and the surrounding air causes the hot air to refract light that passes through it. When you
look at the road, you see a mirage. What appears to be water on the road is actually light coming from the sky that
has been refracted as it passes through the hot air above the road. This phenomenon is common on hot roads and in
the desert.

Summary

• The speed of light is different in different media.
• When a wave front enters a new medium at an angle, it will change directions. If the light is entering a more
optically dense medium, the light bends toward the normal line. If the light is entering a less optically dense
medium, the light will bend away from the normal line.

13.4 Total Internal Reﬂection

• Describe total internal reﬂection.
• Use the critical angle to determine when total internal reﬂection will occur.

Total internal reﬂection allows the light to travel down the optical ﬁber and not pass through the sides of the
tube. The light continuously reﬂects from the inside of the tube and eventually comes out the end. Optical ﬁbers
make interesting lamps but they are also used to transport telephone and television signals.

Total Internal Reﬂection

We already know that when light passes from one medium into a second medium where the index of refraction is
smaller, the light refracts away from the normal.
In the image below, the light rays are passing into an optically less dense medium; therefore, the rays bend away from
the normal. As the angle of incidence increases, the light ray bends even further away from the normal. Eventually,
the angle of incidence will become large enough that the angle of refraction equals 90◦ , meaning the light ray will
not enter the new medium at all.

223

13.4. Total Internal Reﬂection

www.ck12.org

Consider a ray of light passing from water into air. The index of refraction for air is 1.00 and for water is 1.36. Using
Snell’s Law, ni sinθi = nr sinθr, and allowing the angle of refraction to be 90◦, we can solve for the angle of incidence
which would cause the light ray to stay in the old medium.
ni sinθi = nr sinθr
(1.36)(sinθi) = (1.00)(sin90◦)
sinθi = 0.735 and θi = 47◦
This result tells us that when light is passing from water into air, if the angle of incidence exceeds 47◦, the light ray
will not enter the new medium. The light ray will be completely reﬂected back into the original medium. This is
called total internal reﬂection. The minimum angle of incidence for total internal reﬂection to occur is called the
critical angle.
Total internal reﬂection is the principle behind ﬁber optics. A bundle of ﬁbers made out of glass or plastic only a
few micrometers in diameter is called a light pipe since light can be transmitted along it with almost no loss. Light
passing down the ﬁbers makes glancing collisions with the walls so that total internal reﬂection occurs.

Summary

• When light passes from one medium into a second medium with a smaller index of refraction, the light refracts
away from the normal.
• If the angle of incidence becomes large enough that the angle of refraction equals 90◦, the light ray will not
enter the new medium with the smaller angle of refraction.

• Total internal reﬂection means the light ray will not enter the new medium but will be completely reﬂected

back into the original medium.

In this video, a hole is drilled in the side of a plastic bottle ﬁlled with liquid. An arc of liquid shoots out through
the hole. A laser pointer is aimed through the opposite side of the bottle so that the light also exits through the
hole. The stream of liquid acts like an optical ﬁber and the light undergoes total internal reﬂection as it follows the
stream of liquid. As the amount of liquid in the bottle decreases, the arc of the stream of liquid changes and the
direction of the light follows the stream of liquid. Toward the end, the light beam is shining almost 90◦ from the

Like transverse waves, light waves are characterized by amplitude, wavelength, and velocity. Unlike other waves,
light waves—and all electromagnetic waves—can be transmitted through a vacuum, because they propagate as a
result of oscillating electric and magnetic ﬁelds. They can reﬂect off surfaces and be refracted, and the change in
angle as they travel from one medium to another can be calculated using Snell’s Law. When the angle is large
enough, the light rays can undergo total internal reﬂection.

We’ve all seen the message, shown above, written on the side-view mirror of cars: “Objects in mirror are closer than
they appear.” Side-view mirrors are convex mirrors, which makes objects appear smaller, or farther away, then they
actually are. Some mirrors, such as those in your bathroom, display accurately sized images, while others create
images that are larger or smaller than reality. Lenses can be used to magnify or reduce images as well. This chapter
will introduce you to convex and concave mirrors, lenses, and the properties of each.

14.1 Images in a Plane Mirror

• Describe the image produced by a plane mirror.
• Understand a virtual image.

Is this a picture of one girl in front of a mirror or is this a picture of twins designed to look like a mirror image? The
writing on the shirt is properly mirror reversed, and, as in plane mirror images, the right hand of the object becomes
the left hand of the image. However, if you look closely, you will see that in the picture one girl is wearing a ring
and the other isn’t.

Image in a Plane Mirror

The sketch below shows how we see an image in a plane mirror. Plane mirrors work because the light rays create
a virtual image behind the mirror. Light rays from the object strike the mirror and reﬂect according to the law of
reﬂection. When some of the light rays enter our eye, our eye and brain interpret these rays as having traveled in a
straight line path. Therefore, our eye and brain track the light rays backward to a position from which they appear
to have come. At this position, we see an image.

228

www.ck12.org

Chapter 14. Geometric Optics

In a plane mirror, the image will be the same size as the object and will be the same distance behind the mirror as the
object is in front of the mirror. This image is called a virtual image because the light does not actually pass through
the image.
Example Problem: A person 1.80 m tall stands in front of a plane mirror. What is the minimum height of the
mirror, and how high must its lower edge be above the ﬂoor for the person to be able to see his/her whole body?
Assume the person’s eyes are 6.0 cm below the top of the head.
Solution: The law of reﬂection tells us that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reﬂection. From this, we know
that the light ray leaving the person’s toes will strike the mirror halfway between his toes and his eyes. The distance
from the person’s toes to eyes is 1.74 m, so the bottom of the mirror must be 0.87 m above the ﬂoor. The light ray
that leaves the top of the person’s head and reﬂects from the mirror into his eyes must strike the mirror 3.0 cm below
the top of his head.

Therefore, the top of the mirror is 1.77 m above the ﬂoor and the bottom of the mirror is 0.87 m above the ﬂoor. The
height of the mirror is 1.77 m− 0.87 m = 0.90 m.
It doesn’t take much analysis to recognize that the distance the person stands from the mirror does NOT affect
the results. If you can’t see your feet in a mirror, getting closer or farther away from the mirror won’t make any
difference.
When you look at an image of yourself in a plane mirror, there are some differences that are apparent. In the image
below, you see a woman cleaning a mirror. The object woman has the cleaning cloth in her left hand. The image

woman, however, is holding the cleaning cloth in her right hand. Images in a plane mirror are reversed left and right
but are not reversed top and bottom.

Summary

• Our eye and brain interpret any light rays that enter an eye as having traveled in a straight line path.
• For a plane mirror, the image will be the same size as the object and will be the same distance behind the

mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.

• Since the light forming the image does not pass through the image, it is called a virtual image.
• Images in a plane mirror are reversed left and right but are not reversed top and bottom.

14.2 Images in a Concave Mirror

• Deﬁne the focal point and focal length.
• Explain the rules of ray tracing in concave mirrors.
• Deﬁne spherical aberration.
• Predict real or virtual images based object position for concave mirror.
• Locate concave mirror images with ray diagrams.
• Calculate image position and magniﬁcation using the mirror equation.

Concave mirrors are used in a number of applications. They form upright, enlarged images, and are therefore useful
in makeup application or shaving. They are also used in ﬂashlights and headlights because they project parallel
beams of light, and in telescopes because they focus light to produce greatly enlarged images.
The photograph above shows the grinding of the primary mirror in the Hubble space telescope. The Hubble Space
Telescope is a reﬂecting telescope with a mirror approximately eight feet in diameter, and was deployed from the
Space Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990.

Image in a Concave Mirror

Reﬂecting surfaces do not have to be ﬂat. The most common curved mirrors are spherical. A spherical mirror is
called a concave mirror if the center of the mirror is further from the viewer than the edges are. A spherical mirror
is called a convex mirror if the center of the mirror is closer to the viewer than the edges are.
To see how a concave mirror forms an image, consider an object that is very far from the mirror so that the incoming
rays are essentially parallel. For an object that is inﬁnitely far away, the incoming rays would be exactly parallel.
Each ray would strike the mirror and reﬂect according to the law of reﬂection (angle of reﬂection is equal to the
angle of incidence). As long as the section of mirror is small compared to its radius of curvature, all the reﬂected
rays will pass through a common point, called the focal point (f).

232

www.ck12.org

Chapter 14. Geometric Optics

If too large a piece of the mirror is used, the rays reﬂected from the top and bottom edges of the mirror will not pass
through the focal point and the image will be blurry. This ﬂaw is called spherical aberration and can be avoided
either by using very small pieces of the spherical mirror or by using parabolic mirrors.
A line drawn to the exact center of the mirror and perpendicular to the mirror at that point is called the principal
axis. The distance along the principle axis from the mirror to the focal point is called the focal length. The focal
length is also exactly one-half of the radius of curvature of the spherical mirror. That is, if the spherical mirror has a
radius of 8 cm, then the focal length will be 4 cm.

Objects Outside the Center Point

Above is a spherical mirror with the principle axis, the focal point, and the center of curvature (C) identiﬁed on
the image. An object has been placed well beyond C, and we will treat this object as if it were inﬁnitely far away.
There are two rays of light leaving any point on the object that can be traced without any drawing tools or measuring
devices. The ﬁrst is a ray that leaves the object and strikes the mirror parallel to the principle axis that will reﬂect
through the focal point. The second is a ray that leaves the object and strikes the mirror by passing through the focal
point; this ray will reﬂect parallel to the principle axis.
These two rays can be seen in the image below. The two reﬂected rays intersect after reﬂection at a point between
C and F. Since these two rays come from the tip of the object, they will form the tip of the image.

233

14.2. Images in a Concave Mirror

www.ck12.org

If the image is actually drawn in at the intersection of the two rays, it will be smaller and inverted, as shown below.
Rays from every point on the object could be drawn so that every point could be located to draw the image. The
result would be the same as shown here. This is true for all concave mirrors with the object outside C: the image
will be between C and F, and the image will be inverted and diminished (smaller than the object).

The heights of the object and the image are related to their distances from the mirror. In fact, the ratio of their heights
is the same ratio as their distances from the mirror. If do is object distance, di the image distance, ho the object height
and hi the image height, then

It can also be shown that do
di

= do− f

f

and from this, we can derive the mirror equation,

In this equation, f is the focal length do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.
The magniﬁcation equation for a mirror is the image size divided by the object size, where m gives the magniﬁcation
of the image.

m =

Example Problem: A 1.50 cm tall object is placed 20.0 cm from a concave mirror whose radius of curvature is 30.0
cm. What is the image distance and what is the image height?
Solution: 1
do
both sides by 60x to get 3x + 60 = 4x and x = 60.0 cm.
The image distance is 60.0 cm. The image is 3 times as far from the mirror as the object so it will be 3 times as large,
or 4.5 cm tall.

f The focal length is one-half the center of curvature so it is 15.0 cm.

Objects Between the Center Point and the Focal Point

Regardless of where the object is, its image’s size and location can be determined using the equations given earlier
in this section. Nonetheless, patterns emerge in these characteristics. We already know that the image of an object
outside the center point is closer and smaller than the object. When an object is between the center point and the
focal point, the image is larger and closer. These characteristics can also be determined by drawing the rays coming
off of the object; this is called a ray diagram.

234

www.ck12.org

Chapter 14. Geometric Optics

Look again at the image above that was shown earlier in the lesson. If you consider the smaller arrow to be the
object and follow the rays backward, the ray diagram makes it clear that if an object is located between the center
point and focal point, the image is inverted, larger, and at a greater distance.
Example Problem: If an 3.00 cm tall object is held 15.00 cm away from a concave mirror with a radius of 20.00
cm, describe its image.
Solution: To solve this problem, we must determine the height of the image and the distance from the mirror to the
image. To ﬁnd the distance, use the mirror equation:
1
di
Next determine the height of the image:

30 = 30cm

10 − 1

15 = 1

= 1

f − 1

do

ho
hi

=

do
di

=

3
hi

=

15
30

Using this equation, we can determine that the height of the image is 6 cm.
This image is a real image, which means that the rays of light are real rays. These are represented in the ray diagram
as solid lines, while virtual rays are dotted lines.

Objects Inside the Focal Point

Consider what happens when the object for a concave mirror is placed between the focal point and the mirror. This
situation is sketched at below.

Once again, we can trace two rays to locate the image. A ray that originates at the focal point and passes through the
tip of the object will reﬂect parallel to the principal axis. The second ray we trace is the ray that leaves the tip of the
object and strikes the mirror parallel to the principal axis.

235

14.2. Images in a Concave Mirror

www.ck12.org

Below is the ray diagram for this situation. The rays are reﬂected from the mirror and as they leave the mirror, they
diverge. These two rays will never come back together and so a real image is not possible. When an observer looks
into the mirror, however, the eye will trace the rays backward as if they had followed a straight line. The dotted
lines in the sketch show the lines the rays would have followed behind the mirror. The eye will see an image behind
the mirror just as if the rays of light had originated behind the mirror. The image seen will be enlarged and upright.
Since the light does not actually pass through this image position, the image is virtual.

Example Problem: A 1.00 cm tall object is placed 10.0 cm from a concave mirror whose radius of curvature is 30.0
cm. Determine the image distance and image size.
Solution: Since the radius of curvature is 30.0 cm, the focal length is 15.0 cm. The object distance of 10.0 cm tells
us that the object is between the focal point and the mirror.

x = 1

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 30x yields 3x + 30 = 2x and x = −30.0 cm.
The negative image distance indicates that the image is behind the mirror. We know the image is virtual because it is
behind the mirror. Since the image is 3 times as far from the mirror as the object, it will be 3 times as tall. Therefore,
the image height is 3.00 cm.

• For an object that is inﬁnitely far away, incoming rays would be exactly parallel.

through a common point, called the focal point.

14.3 Images in a Convex Mirror

• Understand the difference between concave and covex mirrors.
• Use ray diagrams to explain why convex mirrors form only virtual images.
• Use the mirror and equation and the magniﬁcation equation with convex mirrors.

Convex mirrors provide a wide angle view and they provide an upright image. Wide angle images have beneﬁts in
rearview mirrors, in-store customer monitors, and for viewing large areas like intersections and parking lots.

Images in a Convex Mirror

In convex mirrors, the reﬂecting surface is on the outside of the sphere, making the center of curvature and the
focal point on the opposite side of the mirror from the object. Since the focal point is on the opposite side of the
mirror from the object, the focal length is assigned a negative number.
Light rays that come to the mirror aimed at the focal point on the back side will be reﬂected parallel to the principal
axis. In the sketch, blue rays approach the mirror as if they would continue through the mirror toward the focal point
(dotted blue lines). They reﬂect along the purple lines parallel to the principal axis.

Chapter 14. Geometric Optics

Similarly, light rays that approach the mirror parallel to the principal axis reﬂect as if they came from the focal point.
Example Problem: A convex mirror has a radius of curvature of 40.0 cm. If the object distance is 1000.0 cm, ﬁnd
the image distance and the magniﬁcation.
x = 1−20.0
Solution: 1
do
Multiplying both sides by 1000x yields x + 1000 = −50x and 51x = −1000 and x = −19.6 cm.
Since the image distance is negative, it means the image is behind the mirror and is virtual. The image will be
upright.

The image is reduced by a factor of 51.
For a convex mirror, if the object is at inﬁnity, the image will be a dot on the focal point. As the object moves from
inﬁnity toward the mirror, the image moves along the principal axis toward the mirror. When the object right next to
the mirror, the image will be right next to the mirror on the other side.
All ray diagrams for convex mirrors look essentially like the image below, with the placement of the image some-
where between the mirror and the focal point.

The ray tracing for convex mirrors follow this general sketch. Two rays leave the tip of the object, one approaches the
mirror parallel and reﬂects as if it came from the focal point. The top blue dotted line shows this imaginary route.
The second ray leaves the object tip and approaches the mirror toward the focal point but reﬂects parallel at the
mirror. The green solid line shows the reﬂected ray and the dotted green line shows the imaginary route behind the
mirror. Where the two dotted lines intersect is the tip of the image. All images in convex mirrors are upright, virtual,
and diminished. As the object moves toward the mirror, the image also moves toward the mirror and increases in
size. This can be determined using the mirror and magniﬁcation equations.

• Explain how convex lenses form both real and virtual images.

Images in Double Convex Lenses

Lenses are made of transparent material such as glass or plastic with an index of refraction greater than that of air.
At least one of the faces is a part of a sphere; a convex lens is thicker at the center than the edges, and a concave
lens is thicker at the edges than the center. Convex lenses are called converging lenses, because they refract parallel
light rays so that they meet. They are one of the most useful and important parts of all optical devices, and are found
in eyeglasses, telescopes, microscopes, magnifying glasses, cameras and many other objects.
Both the mirror equation and the magniﬁcation equation also apply to lenses. However, when dealing with lenses,
the mirror equation is renamed the Lens Equation.

14.4. Images in Double Convex Lenses

www.ck12.org

Double convex lenses have focal points on both sides of the lens, but it is also necessary to use points at twice the
focal length to locate objects and images. Therefore, along the principal axis, there are points identiﬁed as F and as
2F on both sides of the lens.
As with mirrors, we only need to trace two rays in order to locate the image for lenses. Both rays change direction
while inside the lens, and their convergence point on the opposite side of the lens is the image location. As can be
seen in the ﬁgure above, Ray 1 approaches the lens parallel to the principal axis and is refracted through the focal
point on the other side. Ray 2 travels through the focal point and is then refracted parallel to the principal axis. The
yellow arrow on the right of the lens is the inverted image.
The diagram above shows the situation when the object is outside 2F. In this situation, the image will be between
F and 2F on the other side and will be inverted, diminished, and real. A real image can be projected on a screen.
That is, if you placed a sheet of paper at the image position, the image would actually appear on the paper.
If the object is placed between 2F and F, the image will appear beyond 2F on the other side. The image will be real,
inverted, and enlarged. You can do a ray tracing like the one shown to demonstrate this is true.
If the object is placed inside F (between F and the lens), the image will be on the same side of the lens as the object
and it will be virtual, upright, and enlarged.
In the sketch below, the object is red and has been placed inside F. The ray that approaches the mirror parallel to
the principal axis is dotted yellow. It refracts through the focal point, also shown in dotted yellow. The ray that
approaches the mirror through the focal point is dotted blue and refracts parallel to the principal axis, also shown in
dotted blue. As you can see, the refracted rays diverge, so there will be no real image. If the eye is placed beyond the
object around the 2F shown in the sketch, the eye will see the rays as if they have traveled in a straight line. These
imaginary rays will converge at the tip of the green arrow which is the image position.

14.5 Images in Double Concave Lenses

• Describe the formation of virtual images by concave lenses.
• Use the lens equation to locate images formed by concave lenses.

The three light rays traveling into the concave lens shown above travel away from each other. For this reason,
concave lens are also called diverging lenses. As a result of this light divergence, concave lenses create only virtual
images.

Images in Double Concave Lenses

Every concave lens causes all rays to diverge. Rays that approach the lens parallel to the principal axis refract as if
they came from the focal point.

245

14.5. Images in Double Concave Lenses

www.ck12.org

As you can see in the ﬁgure above, the light rays hit the lens and refract away from each other. Since none of these
rays will intersect, a real image cannot exist. Instead, all images created by a double concave lens are virtual images.
Like in all ray diagrams, images can be found using two rays.

The ﬁrst ray, shown above, begins from the tip of the image and travels to the lens parallel to the principal axis.
Within the lens, this ray is refracted away from the principal axis such that the virtual ray (shown as a dotted line)
travels back to the focal point. The second ray also leaves from the tip of the object, and travels straight through the
center of the lens. The image will be where these two rays intersect - one real and one virtual. Since one ray is a
virtual ray, the image will always be virtual, as well as upright and diminished.
Like for convex lenses, the lens equation and magniﬁcation equations can be used to calculate image size and
distance for double concave lenses. When using the lens equation with a concave lens, however, the focal length
must be assigned a negative value.

Summary

• A concave lens causes all rays to diverge.
• Concave lenses create only virtual images. After the rays are refracted, they never converge and so there will

be no real images.

• All concave lens images will be upright, virtual, and diminished, and can be found between the F and the lens.
• When using the lens equation with a concave lens, the focal length must be assigned a negative value.

As light rays reﬂect off of mirrors and pass through lenses, they create images of the object emitting or reﬂecting
the light. In plane mirrors, the images are reversed left to right, though they remain upright. In curved mirrors and
lenses, the interactions between objects and their images are more complex. Convex and concave mirrors and lenses

DOUBLE SLIT INTERFERENCE
SINGLE SLIT INTERFERENCE
DIFFRACTION GRATINGS
REFERENCES

Light interference occurs when two light waves interact with each other. Light interference often creates beautiful
patterns, such as those on the surface of the bubbles shown above. When light hits a soap bubble, one light ray is
reﬂected by the outer layer of soap, while another light ray will travel through that layer and get reﬂected by the
inner layer of soap. Since these waves have traveled slightly different differences, the waves are no longer perfectly
synchronized; this interference results in iridescent patterns.

15.1 Double Slit Interference

• Deﬁne diffraction of light.
• Deﬁne wave interference.
• Describe double slit interference patterns.
• Explain Thomas Young’s contibutions to physics.
• Calculate the wavelength from a double slit interference pattern.

When waves strike a small slit in a wall, they create circular wave patterns on the other side of the barrier. This is
seen in the image above, where ocean waves create precise circular waves. The circular waves undergo constructive
and destructive interference, which generates a regular interference pattern.

Diffraction and Interference

When a series of straight waves strike an impenetrable barrier, the waves stop at the barrier. However, the last
particle of the medium at the back corner of the barrier will create circular waves from that point, called the point
source. This can be seen in the image below. This phenomenon is called diffraction, and it occurs in liquid, sound,
and light waves. While the waves become circular waves at the point source, they continue as straight waves where
the barrier does not interfere with the waves.

250

www.ck12.org

Chapter 15. Diffraction and Interference of Light

Any two waves in the same medium undergo wave interference as they pass each other. At the location where the
two waves collide, the result is essentially a summation of the two waves. In some places, a wave crest from one
source will overlap a wave crest from the other source. Since both waves are lifting the medium, the combined wave
crest will be twice as high as the original crests. Nearby, a wave trough will overlap another wave trough and the new
trough will be twice as deep as the original. This is called constructive interference because the resultant wave is
larger than the original waves. Within the interference pattern, the amplitude will be twice the original amplitude.
Once the waves pass through each other and are alone again, their amplitudes return to their original values.
In other parts of the wave pattern, crests from one wave will overlap troughs from another wave. When the two
waves have the same amplitude, this interaction causes them to cancel each other out. Instead of a crest or a trough,
there is nothing. When this cancellation occurs, it is called destructive interference.

.
It is easy to see how waves emanating from multiple sources, such as drops of rainwater in still water, create inter-
ference patterns. But a single source of waves can create interference patterns with itself as a result of diffraction.

The Double Slit Experiment

A similar situation to the raindrops above occurs when straight waves strike a barrier containing two slits. These
waves are cut off everywhere except for where the waves that pass through the two slits. The medium in the slits
again acts as a point source to produce circular waves on the far side of the barrier.

As long as these two circular waves have the same wavelength, they interfere constructively and destructively in
a speciﬁc pattern. This pattern is called the wave interference pattern and is characterized by light and dark
bands. The light bands are a result of constructive interference, and the dark bands occur because of destructive
interference.

15.1. Double Slit Interference

www.ck12.org

In the early 1800s, light was assumed to be a particle. There was a signiﬁcant amount of evidence to point to
that conclusion, and famous scientist Isaac Newton’s calculations all support the particle theory. In 1803, however,
Thomas Young performed his famous Double Slit Experiment to prove that light was a wave. Young shined a light
onto the side of a sealed box with two slits in it, creating an interference pattern on the inside of the box opposite
the slits. As seen above, interference patterns are characterized by alternating bright and dark lines. The bright lines
are a result of constructive interference, while the dark lines are a result of destructive interference. By creating this
interference pattern, Young proved light is a wave and changed the course of physics.

Calculating Wavelength from Double Slit Pattern

Using the characteristics of the double slit interference pattern, it is possible to calculate the wavelength of light
used to produce the interference. To complete this calculation, it is only necessary to measure a few distances. As
can be seen below, ﬁve distances are measured. In the sketch, L is the distance from the two slits to the back wall
where the interference pattern can be seen. d is the distance between the two slits. To understand x, look again at the
interference pattern shown above. The middle line, which is the brightest, is called the central line. The remaining
lines are called fringes. The lines on either side of the central line are called the ﬁrst order fringes, the next lines are
called the second order fringes, and so on. x is the distance from the central line to the ﬁrst order fringe.

r1 and r2 are the distances from the slits to the ﬁrst order fringe. We know that the fringes are a result of constructive
interference, and that the fringe is a result of the crest of two waves interfering. If we assume that r2 is a whole
number of wavelengths (conﬁrm for yourself that this is a logical assumption), then r1 must be one more wavelength.
This is because r1 and r2 are the distances to the ﬁrst order fringe. Mathematically, we can let
r2 = nλ and r1 = nλ + λ, where λ is the wavelength and n is a constant.
Using this relationship, we determine that r1 − r2 = λ.
Looking again at the diagram, the red and blue triangles are similar, which means that the ratios of corresponding
sides are the same. The ratio of x to L in the red triangle is equal to the ratio of λ to d in the blue triangle. For
proof of this, visit http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/light/u12l3c.cfm . From this, we can determine that the
wavelength is dependent on x, d, and L:

Summary

• The last particle of medium at the back corner of an impenetrable barrier will act as a point source and produce

circular waves.

• Diffraction is the bending of waves around a corner.
• Constructive interference occurs when two wave crests overlap, doubling the wave amplitude at that location.
• Destructive interference occurs when a wave crest overlaps with a trough, causing them to cancel out.
• Light is a wave, and creates an interference pattern in the double slit experiment.
• An interference pattern consists of alternating bright and dark lines; the bright lines are called fringes.
• In a double slit experiment, the wavelength can be calculated using this equation: λ = xd

15.2 Single Slit Interference

• Explain how single slit diffraction patterns occur.
• Use single slit diffraction patterns to calculate wavelength.

Though it looks like a double slit interference pattern, the pattern on the screen are actually the results of light
diffracting through a single slit with the ensuing interference.

Single Slit Interference

Interference patterns are produced not only by double slits but also by single slits, otherwise known as single slit
interference. In the case of a single slit, the particles of medium at both corners of the slit act as point sources,
producing circular waves from both edges. These circular waves move across to the back wall and interfere in the
same way that interference patterns were produced by double slits.
In the sketch at below, the black lines intersect at the center of the pattern on the back wall. This center point is
equidistanct from both edges of the slit. Therefore, the waves striking at this position will be in phase; that is, the
waves will produce constructive interference. Also shown in the sketch, just above the central bright spot where the
red lines intersect, is a position where destructive interference occurs. One of these red lines is one-half wavelength
longer than the other, causing the two waves to hit the wall out of phase and undergo destructive interference. A
dark bank appears at this position.

255

15.2. Single Slit Interference

www.ck12.org

Just as in double slit interference, a pair of similar triangles can be constructed in the interference pattern. The
pertinent values from these triangles are the width of the slit, w, the wavelength, λ, the distance from the central
bright spot to the ﬁrst dark band, x, and the distance from the center of the slit to back wall, L. The relationship of
these four values is
λ
L or λ = wx
w = x
L .

Example Problem: Monochromatic light of wavelength 605 nm falls on a slit of width 0.095 mm. The slit is located
85 cm from a screen. How far is the center of the central bright band to the ﬁrst dark band?
Solution: x = λL

w = (6.05×10−7 m)(0.85 m)

= 0.0054 m

(9.5×10−5 m)

Summary

• Interference patterns can also be produced by single slits.
• In the case of a single slit, the particles of medium at both corners of the slit act as point sources, and produce

circular waves from both edges.

• The wavelength can be determined by this equation: λ

w = x

L or λ = wx

15.3 Diffraction Gratings

• Understand the structure of a diffraction grating.
• Explain the interference pattern formed by diffraction gratings.
• Use diffraction grating interference patterns to calculate the wavelength of light.

Suppose we had a light bulb that emitted exactly four frequencies of light; one frequency in each of the colors red,
yellow, green, and blue. To our eye, this bulb would appear white because the combination of those four colors
produces white light. If viewed through a diffraction grating, however, each color of light would be visible. The
original white light bulb is visible in the center of the image, and interference causes the light bulb to appear in each
color to the left and the right.

Diffraction Gratings

Diffraction gratings are composed of a multitude of slits lined up side by side, not unlike a series of double slits
next to each other. They can be made by scratching very ﬁne lines with a diamond point on glass, or by pressing
plastic ﬁlm on glass gratings so that the scratches are replicated. The clear places between the scratches behave as
slits similar to the slits in a double slit experiment and the gratings form interference patterns in the same general
way that double slits do. With more slits, there are more light waves out of phase with each other, causing more
destructive interference. Compared to the interference pattern of a double slit, the diffraction grating interference
pattern’s colors are spread out further and the dark regions are broader. This allows for more precise wavelength
determination than with double slits. The image below shows the diffraction pattern emanating from a white light

L = d sinθ (Note that x

L = sinθ, using the small angle approximation theorem.)

.
Also in this image is the measurement for θ, which can be used to calculate the wavelength of the original light
source. The equation from the double slit experiment can be adjusted slightly to work with diffraction gratings.
Where λ is the wavelength of light, d is the distance between the slits on the grating, and θ is the angle between the
incident (original) light and the refracted light,
λ = xd
Looking at the equation, x = λL
d , it should be apparent that as the distance between the lines on the grating become
smaller and smaller, the distance between the images on the screen will become larger and larger. Diffraction
gratings are often identiﬁed by the number of lines per centimeter; gratings with more lines per centimeter are
usually more useful because the greater the number of lines, the smaller the distance between the lines, and the
greater the separation of images on the screen.
Example Problem: A good diffraction grating has 2500 lines/cm. What is the distance between two lines on the
grating?
Solution: d =
Example Problem: Using a diffraction grating with a spacing of 0.00040 cm, a red line appears 16.5 cm from the
central line on the screen. The screen is 1.00 m from the grating. What is the wavelength of the light?
Solution: λ = xd

= 6.6× 10−7 m

2500 cm−1 = 0.00040 cm

L = (0.165 m)(4.0×10−6 m)

Summary

• Diffraction gratings can be made by blocking light from traveling through a translucent medium; the clear

places behave as slits similar to the slits in a double slit experiment.

• Diffraction gratings form interference patterns much like double slits, though brighter and with more space

between the lines.

• The equation used with double slit experiments to measure wavelength is adjusted slightly to work with

diffraction gratings. λ = xd

L = d sinθ

This chapter discussed the nature of interference and interference patterns, the diffraction of light waves, and the use
of diffraction gratings. Regardless of the number of slits, light shining through small slits in a blocking object will
create an interference pattern. In single slits, this pattern is a result of light diffraction around the back of each side
of the slit, while double slits and diffraction gratings create interference due to light shining through each slit.

Electricity is very rarely visible, but it can be seen in the form of lightning. Lightning is a large spark that occurs
when many electrons move very quickly to even out an unequal distribution of electrons. Other, smaller sparks can
be seen when you scuff your feet across carpet and then touch a metal doorknob. Both these sparks represent the
same form of electricity: static electricity. Static electricity is also responsible for allowing a balloon that you rubbed
on your sweater to cling to a wall and for causing your clothes to come out of the dryer stuck together.

16.1 Forces on Charged Objects

• Describe the changes that occur in the sub-atomic arrangement in matter when charged.
• Describe how to charge an object.
• Deﬁne conductors and insulators.
• Understand the difference between conduction and induction.
• Summarize the forces between charged objects.

Lightning is the discharge of static electricity that has built up on clouds. Every year, the earth experiences an
average of 25 million lightning strikes. Lightning bolts travel at speeds up to 60,000 miles per second, and can reach
temperatures of 50,000°F, which is ﬁve times the temperature of the surface of the sun. The energy contained in a
single lightning strike could light a 100 Watt light bulb 24 hours per day for 90 days.

Forces on Charged Objects

Electric charges exist within the atom. At the turn of the 20th century, J. J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford
determined that atoms contain very light-weight negatively charged particles called electrons and more massive,
positively charged particles called protons. The protons are lodged in the nucleus of the atoms, along with the
neutrally charged particles called neutrons, while the electrons surround the nucleus. When the number of electrons
in the electron cloud and the number of protons in the nucleus are equal, the object is said to be neutral.
Changes to the nucleus of an atom require tremendous amounts of energy, so protons are not easily gained or lost
by atoms. Electrons, on the other hand, are held fairly loosely and can often be removed quite easily. When an
object loses some electrons, the remaining object is now positively charged because it has an excess of protons. The
electrons may either remain free or may attach to another object. In that case, the extra electrons cause that object to
become negatively charged. Atoms that have lost electrons and become positively charged are called positive ions,
and atoms that have gained electrons and become negatively charged are called negative ions.
Electrons can be removed from some objects using friction, simply by rubbing one substance against another
substance. There are many examples of objects becoming charged by friction, including a rubber comb through

263

16.1. Forces on Charged Objects

www.ck12.org

hair, and a balloon on a sweater. In both these instances, the electrons move from the second object to the ﬁrst,
causing the ﬁrst object to become negatively charged and the second one positively charged. Friction between the
tires on a moving car and the road cause the tires to become charged, and wind causes friction between clouds and
air which causes clouds to become charged and can result in tremendous bolts of lightning.

A common method of producing charge in the lab is to rub cat or rabbit fur against stiff rubber, producing a negative
charge on the rubber rod. If you hold a rubber rod on one end and rub only the tip of the other end with a fur, you
will ﬁnd that only the tip becomes charged. The electrons you add to the tip of the rod remain where you put them
instead of moving around on the rod. Rubber is an insulator. Insulators are substances that do not allow electrons to
move through them. Glass, dry wood, most plastics, cloth, and dry air are common insulators. Materials that allow
electrons to ﬂow freely are called conductors. Metals have at least one electron that can move around freely, and
all metals are conductors.
Forces are exerted on charged objects by other charged objects. You’ve probably heard the saying "opposites attract,"
which is true in regards to charged particles. Opposite charges attract each other, while like charges repulse each
other. This can be seen in the image below. When two negatively charged objects are brought near each other, a
repulsive force is produced. When two positively charged objects are brought near each other, a similar repulsive
force is produced. When a negatively charged object is brought near a positively charged object, an attractive force
is produced. Neutral objects have no inﬂuence on each other.

A laboratory instrument used to analyze and test for static charge is called an electroscope. Seen below, an
electroscope consists of a metal knob connected by a metal stem to two very lightweight pieces of metal called
leaves, shown in yellow. The leaves are enclosed in a box to eliminate stray air currents.

264

www.ck12.org

Chapter 16. Static Electricity

When a negatively charged object is brought near the knob of a neutral electroscope, the negative charge repels the
electrons in the knob, and those electrons move down the stem into the leaves. Excess electrons ﬂow from the rod
into the ball, and then downwards making both leaves negatively charged. Since both leaves are negatively charged,
they repel each other. When the rod is removed, the electroscope will remain charged because of the extra electrons
added to it.

Conversely, if the rod is brought near the knob but doesn’t touch it, the electroscope will appear the same while
the rod is near. That is, the negative charge in the rod repels the electrons in the ball, causing them to travel down
to the leaves. The leaves will separate while the rod is nearby. No extra electrons were added to the electroscope,
meaning that the electrons in the electroscope will redistribute when the negatively charged rod is taken away. The
leaves return to neutral, and they stop repelling each other. If the rod touches the knob, the electroscope leaves are
permanently charged but if the rod is brought near but does not touch the knob, the electroscope leaves are only
temporarily charged.
If the leaves are permanently charged and the rod removed, the electroscope can then be used to determine the type
of unknown charge on an object. If the electroscope has been permanently negatively charged, and a negatively
charge object is brought near the knob, the leaves will separate even further, showing the new object has the same
charge as the leaves. If a positively charged object is brought near a negatively charged electroscope, it will attract
some of the excess electrons up the stem and out of the leaves, causing the leaves to come slightly together.
Similar to the results of a negatively charged rod, if a positively charged rod is brought near the knob of a neutral
electroscope, it will attract some electrons up from the leaves onto the knob. That process causes both of the leaves to

265

16.1. Forces on Charged Objects

www.ck12.org

be positively charged (excess protons), and the leaves will diverge. If the positively charged rob is actually touched
to the knob, the rob will remove some electrons and then when the rob is removed, the electroscope will remain
positively charged. This is a permanent positive charge.

Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a
charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both
objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object
can also be charged using a method called charging by induction. This process allows a change in charge without
actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near
the knob, but not touching.
If we place a ﬁnger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body,
instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our ﬁnger and the negatively charged rod are removed,
the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that
charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object,
while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge.

Summary

• Electric charges exist with the atom.
• Atoms contain light-weight, loosely held, negatively charged particles called electrons and heavier, tightly-

held, positvely charged particles called protons.

• When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, the object is neutral.
• The loss of electrons gives an ion a positive charge, while the gain of electrons gives it a negative charge.
• Materials that allow electrons to ﬂow freely are called conductors, while those that do not are called insulators.
• Opposite charges attract, and like charges repel.
• Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction.

• State Coulomb’s Law.
• Describe how electric force varies with charge and separation of charge.
• State the SI unit of charge.
• Solve problems using Coulomb’s Law.

Electric cars are becoming more popular. One large advantage for electric cars is the low cost of operation, which
may become an ever bigger advantage as gas prices climb. Energy costs for electric cars average about one-third of
the cost for gasoline engine cars, but they can only travel about 200 miles per charge at this point. These cars run
using the science of electrical charges and forces.

Coulomb’s Law

The questions regarding the relationship between the electrical force, the size of the charge, and the separation
between the charges were solved by Charles Coulomb in 1785. He determined that electrical force between two
charges is directly related to the size of the charges and inversely proportional to the distance between the charges.
This is known as Coulomb’s Law.
Fe = Kq1q2
d2
In this equation, q1 and q2 are the two charges, d is the distance between the two charges, and K is a constant of
proportionality. Fe is the electric force, which occurs as a result of interactions between two charged particles. For
the purpose of calculating electric forces, we assume all charge is a point charge, in which the entire charge of the
particle is located in a massless point.
The SI unit of charge is the coulomb, C, which is the charge of 6.25×1018 electrons. The charge on a single electron
is 1.60× 10−19 C. The charge on a single electron is known as the elementary charge. The charge on a proton is
the same magnitude but opposite in sign. When the charges are measured in coulombs, the distance in meters, and
the force in Newtons, the constant K is 9.0× 109 N · m2/C2.
The electrical force, like all forces, is a vector quantity. If the two charges being considered are both positive or both

270

www.ck12.org

Chapter 16. Static Electricity

negative, the sign of the electrical force is positive and this force is repulsive. If the two charges are opposite in sign,
the force will have a negative sign and the force is attractive.
Example Problem: Object A has a positive charge of 6.0× 10−6 C. Object B has a positive charge of 3.0× 10−6 C.
If the distance between A and B is 0.030 m, what is the force on A?
Solution: Fe = Kq1q2

d2 = (9.0×109 N·m2/C2)(6.0×10−6 C)(3.0×10−6 C)

= 180 N

(0.030 m)2

The positive sign of the force indicates the force is repulsive. This makes sense, because both objects have a positive
charge.
Example Problem: In the sketch below, the charges are q1 = 10.0× 10−6 C, q2 = 2.0× 10−6 C, and q3 = −6.0×
10−6 C. Calculate the total force on q2.

Solution: Fe = Kq1q2

d2 = (9.0×109 N·m2/C2)(10.0×10−6 C)(2.0×10−6 C)

(2.0 m)2

= 0.045 N (towards q3)

d2 = (9.0×109 N·m2/C2)(2.0×10−6 C)(−6.0×10−6 C)

Fe = Kq2q3
Since the two forces act in the same direction, their absolute values can be added together; the total force on q2 is
0.052 N towards q3.

= −0.007 N (towards q3)

(4.0 m)2

Summary

• Coulomb determined that electrical force between two charges is directly related to the size of the charges and
inversely proportional to the distance between the charges: Fe = Kq1q2
d2
• The SI unit of charge is the coulomb, C, which is the charge of 6.25× 1018 electrons.
• The charge on a single electron is 1.60× 10−19 C and is known as the elementary charge.

• Coulomb’s Law: States the force of attraction or repulsion acting along a straight line between two electric
charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely to the square of the distance between
them.

Matter is made up of atoms, which consist of small, charged particles. The tightly held, heavier, positively charged
particles are called protons, while the loosely held, lighter, negatively charged particles are called electrons. When
there are excess electrons in an object, it is considered to be negatively charged; when there is a deﬁcit of electrons,
the object is considered positively charged. Charged objects exert a force on each other, which can be calculated
based on the objects’ charges and distance from each other using Coulomb’s Law. Some materials transmit electrons
easily and are called conductors, while other materials, called insulators, restrict the transmission of electrons.

When two objects are electrically charged, they exert a force on each other. If the objects have like charges, they
repel; if they have opposite charges, they attract. The child above has become negatively charged after his ride down
the slide. Since each of his individual strands of hair is negatively charged, they repel each other. The force of the
attraction or repulsion between charges can be calculated using Coulomb’s Law. On some occasions, however, it is
difﬁcult to identify and/or quantify one of the charges involved. To work with such a situation, physicists consider
what is called an electric ﬁeld. These ﬁelds exist in the area around charged particles and exert forces on all charges
within the ﬁeld. By using the ﬁeld for calculations, we need not know anything about the charge itself.

• Deﬁne an electric ﬁeld.
• Solve problems relating to ﬁeld, force, and charge.

A plasma globe, such as the one pictured above, is ﬁlled with a mixture of noble gases and has a high-voltage
electrode at the center. The swirling lines are electric discharge lines that connect from the inner electrode to the
outer glass insulator. When a hand is placed on the surface of the globe, all the electric discharge travels directly to
that hand.

The Electric Field

Coulomb’s Law gives us the formula to calculate the force exerted on a charge by another charge. On some occasions,
however, a test charge suffers an electrical force with no apparent cause. That is, as observers, we cannot see or detect
the original charge creating the electrical force. Michael Faraday dealt with this problem by developing the concept
of an electric ﬁeld. According to Faraday, a charge creates an electric ﬁeld about it in all directions. If a second
charge is placed at some point in the ﬁeld, the second charge interacts with the ﬁeld and experiences an electrical
force. Thus, the interaction we observe is between the test charge and the ﬁeld and a second particle at some distance
is no longer necessary.
The strength of the electric ﬁeld is determined point by point and can only be identiﬁed by the presence of test
charge. When a positive test charge, qt, is placed in an electric ﬁeld, the ﬁeld exerts a force on the charge. The ﬁeld
strength can be measured by dividing the force by the charge of the test charge. Electric ﬁeld strength is given the
symbol E and its unit is Newtons/coulomb.

is 0.60 N. What is the electric ﬁeld intensity at the location of the test charge?

The Electric Potential in a Uniform Field

Electric Potential
In the study of mechanics, the concept of energy, and the conservation thereof, was extremely useful. The same will
be true for the study of electrical interactions. The work done moving a charged particle in an electric ﬁeld can result
in the particle gaining or losing both kinetic and potential energy.
Lifting an object in a gravitational ﬁeld requires work and increases the object’s potential energy. A similar situation
occurs when you move two charged objects relative to each other. We already know that each object has an electric
ﬁeld surrounding it, which effects the other charge. If the two charged objects have the same charge, they repel each
other. Moving these two objects closer to each other requires working against the repulsive force, which increases
the potential energy of the system. Conversely, moving two like charges apart will decrease the potential energy. If
the objects attract each other, the opposite situtations occur: if you pull them apart, you do work against the force,
which increases the potential energy of the system, but bringing attractive charges closer together decreases the
potential energy.
It is often easy to think of the change in energy as a mountain or an inverted cone, depending on the situation.
Imagine a positive point charge, with the corresponding electric ﬁeld around it. If you are moving another positive
point charge, the situation is like a mountain, with the original point charge at the peak. As the second charge moves

278

www.ck12.org

Chapter 17. Electric Fields

towards the ﬁrst, it must go up the mountain. This requires work, and increases the potential energy of the system.
If, however, the second charge is a negative point charge, the two charges attract each other and the situation is like
a cone: the second charge easily falls towards the ﬁrst, decreasing the potential energy. It would then require work
to get the second charge up and out of the cone, away from the ﬁrst charge.

Uniform Electric Fields

As we know from Coulomb’s law, the electric ﬁeld around a point charge decreases as the distance from the point
increases. However, it is possible to create a constant electric ﬁeld between two large, ﬂat conducting plates parallel
to each other. If one of the plates is positively charged and the other negatively charged, the space between the plates
will have a constant electric ﬁeld except near the edges of the plates.

A uniform electric ﬁeld makes it easier to measure the difference in electric potential energy. This energy, also called
the electric potential difference is commonly referred to as the voltage, based on the unit, volt (V). To measure the
voltage across some distance, it is necessary to pick a position to be the relative zero, because voltage is the change in
potential difference. Any point in a system can be given the value of zero volts, but it is typically the point of a point
charge or one plate in a uniform electric ﬁeld as shown above. The voltage is measured using a voltmeter, which
measures the electric potential difference across two points.
The electrical potential difference between the two plates is expressed as V = Ed, the electric ﬁeld strength times the
distance between the plates. The units in this expression are Newtons/coulomb times meters, which gives the ﬁnal
units Joules/coulomb. Voltage is an expression of the amount of potential energy per unit charge. The work done
moving a charge against the ﬁeld can be calculated by multiplying the electric ﬁeld potential by the charge, W = V q.
Example Problem: Two large parallel metal plates are 5.0 cm apart. The magnitude of the electric ﬁeld between
them is 800. N/C.
(a) What is the potential difference between the plates?
(b) What work is done when one electron is moved from the positive to the negative plate?
Solution: (a) V = Ed = (800. N/C)(0.050 m) = 40. J/C = 40. V
(b) W = V q = (40.0 J/C)(1.6× 10−19 C) = 6.4× 10−18 J
Example Problem: A voltmeter measures the potential difference between two large parallel plates to be 50.0 volts.
The plates are 3.0 cm apart. What is the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld strength between the plates?
Solution: E = V

d = 50.0 volts

0.030 m = 1700 N/C

17.3 Millikan Oil Drop Experiment

• Explain how Millikan used electric ﬁelds to ﬁnd the charge of the electron.

This is the original equipment used by Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in 1909 at the Univeristy of Chicago
to measure the electric charge on a single electron. With incredible perserverence, they were able to determine the
charge to within 1% of the currently accepted value.

Millikan Oil Drop Experiment

The sketch below shows a diagram of the Millikan oil drop experiment. Two parallel charged plates are placed
with the positively charged plate above and the negatively charged plate below. The positively charged plate has a
pinhole opening in its center. An atomizer is used to spray drops of oil into the apparatus. The friction of the oil
passing through the narrow opening puts a charge on many of the oil drops. As the oil drops fall, one or more pass
through the pinhole opening and enter the area between the plates.

281

17.3. Millikan Oil Drop Experiment

www.ck12.org

The charge on the plates is adjustable. By measuring the terminal velocity of the oil drops with the electric ﬁeld
off, Millikan could determine the mass of the drops. Millikan and his graduate assistant were able to determine the
force of the ﬁeld on the drops when it was turned on by comparing the velocity of the drops with the ﬁeld on to their
velocity with the ﬁeld off. This is easily determined when the oil drop is stationary; namely, when the downward
gravitational force exactly equals the upward electrical force on the drop.
Example Problem: An oil drop weighs 1.9 × 10−14 N.
It is suspended in an electric ﬁeld whose intensity is
4.0×104 N/C. Since the oil drop is suspended, the gravitational force, 1.9×10−4 N, is equal to the electrical force,
FE = Eq. What is the charge on the oil drop?
Solution: q = weight
The charge on this particular oil drop was 4.8 × 10−19 C.
In doing his experiment, however, Millikan faced a
problem. When the oil is sprayed through the atomizer, some oil drops are negatively charged, but we don’t know
how many extra electrons the drops acquire. The charge on this oil drop could be the result of having one extra
electron, or having ﬁve extra electrons.
In order to determine the charge on one electron, the oil drop experiment was carried out many times, and the charges
on many oil drops was determined. The smallest charge was found to be 1.6× 10−19 C, and all the other charges
on oil drops were found to be whole number multiples of 1.6× 10−19 C. In the example problem above, we would
conclude that the oil drop held three extra electrons.

4.0×104 N/C = 4.8× 10−19 C

E = 1.9×10−14 N

Summary

• Using a uniform electric ﬁeld between two charged parallel plates and oil drops, Millikan determined the

charge on a single electron.

• The friction of the oil passing through the narrow opening puts charges on many of the oil drops.
• When an oil drop is stopped by adjusting the charge on the plates, its weight, mg, downward equals the

electrical force, Eq, upward.

own often look much like the one shown above. Many circuit boards have capacitors, including this one. Capacitors
can be used to smooth out electrical impulses or to turn constant electric currents into a series of impulses.

The Capacitor

Sharing Charge

We already know that insulators are materials that do not allow electrons to ﬂow through them easily. When you
place excess electrons on an insulator, the electrons remain where you put them and do not move around. Conversely,
conductors are materials that allow electrons to ﬂow thorugh them freely. Since electrons repel each other, excess
electrons on a conductor move to positions as far apart as possible. The difference can be seen in the image below,
where the electrons on the insulator remain clumped near each other, while the electrons on the conductor have
spread out to cover the whole surface.

Chapter 17. Electric Fields

Consider a charged conductor and an uncharged conductor. When the charged conductor is touched to the uncharged
conductor, as far as the electrons are concerned, it has become one large piece of conducting material. The electrons
on the charged object will run onto the uncharged object until the density of the charge is evenly distributed over the
entire surface of both objects. If the objects are the same size, the charge will be shared equally throughout. This
method is occasionally used to divide a charge by half.
The earth is also a conductor. Touching a charged object to the earth is called grounding. When you touch a
conductor to the earth, you allow the earth to share the charge. Since the earth is billions of times bigger than the
object, the earth takes nearly all of the charge. The charged object that was grounded now has zero charge.

It is very easy to ground an object. All that is necessary is to touch a conducting wire to both the object and the earth.
Electrical devices that run the risk of picking up a large static charge are grounded, meaning they are connected to
the earth via such a conducting wire. Virtually all household appliances, especially washers and dryers, are grounded
in this way to eliminate static charge. Similarly, large trucks, especially gasoline tankers, are grounded via a large
chain hanging off the back to prevent sparks when fuel is being unloaded.
Spheres, whether hollow or ﬁlled, will always have the excess charge on the surface. In hollow spheres, the only
place for an electron to exist is on the surface. Similarly, in a solid conducting sphere all the excess charge sits on
the surface. This conclusion is a result of Gauss’s Law, which tells us that the symmetry of the sphere and the fact
that the electric ﬁeld within the sphere is 0 forces the charge to the outside.

Capacitors Store Charge

Pieter Van Musschenbroek, a Dutch physician, invented a device in 1746 that could store electric charge. Though he
named the device a Leyden jar, similar devices today are called capacitors. A typical capacitor consists of a pair of
parallel plates of area A separated by a small distance d. The space between the two plates is most often ﬁlled with
an insulator and frequently the plates are rolled into the form of a cylinder.

285

17.4. The Capacitor

www.ck12.org

If voltage is applied to a capacitor, it quickly becomes charged. One of the parallel plates acquires a negative charge
and the other an equal amount of positive charge. For a given capacitor, the amount of charge, Q, acquired by each
plate is proportional to the potential difference, V .

Q = CV

Q is the charge in coulombs, V is the voltage in volts, and C is the particular capacitor’s constant of proportionality.
C is also called the capacitance of the capacitor. The capacitance is the voltage the capacitor can reach before it
discharges, allowing the voltage across the capacitor to drop to zero and the current to cross the capacitor. The SI
unit for capacitance, according to the equation above, will be coulombs/volt, and this unit has been given the name
farad (F). Most capacitors have capacitances in the range of one picofarad (10−12 F) to one microfarad (10−6 F).
Example Problem: A sphere has a potential difference between it and the earth of 60.0 V when charged with
3.0×10−6 C. What is the capacitance?
V = 3.0×10−6 coulombs
Solution: C = Q

= 5.0× 10−8 farads

60.0 volts

Summary

• Since electrons repel each other, when excess electrons are placed on a conductor, they will move to positions

as far away from each other as possible.

• When a charged conductor is touched to an uncharged conductor, the electrons will migrate until the density

of the charge becomes evenly distributed over the entire surface.

CONTROLLING CURRENT IN ELECTRIC CIRCUITS

One of the most important characteristics of electrical energy is its ability to be transferred over long distances. High-
voltage electric power distribution lines can be found scattered everywhere throughout the United States. They are a
common reminder of our dependence on electricity. A great deal of engineering has gone into making those power
distribution lines reliable and efﬁcient. The enormous amount of potential energy harnessed by a power station like
the Grand Coulee Dam is of no value to a factory ten miles away unless that energy can be transferred efﬁciently
from the dam to the factory. This chapter will explore how electric currents function and how we control them.

You’ve probably heard of vacuum tubes and large transistors, which were once common in electronics like tele-
visions. These individual devices were mounted on large printed circuit boards. Then, in 1959, two researchers
working independently developed the ﬁrst integrated circuits. These circuits could combine several transistors and
resistors into one circuit on one small chip of silicon. These chips, like the one pictured above, are used today in
virtually every electrical device.

Electric Current and Circuits

Electric Current

Remember that it often requires work to force electrons into a speciﬁc location. If we have two conducting spheres
and we have forced excess electrons onto one of the spheres by doing work on the electrons, then that sphere, and
those electrons, will have a higher potential energy than those on the uncharged sphere. If the two spheres are
touched together, electrons will ﬂow from the sphere with excess electrons to the sphere with no excess electrons.
That is, electrons will ﬂow from the high potential energy position to the lower potential energy position. The ﬂow
will continue until the electrons on the two spheres have the same potential energy. A ﬂow of charged particles such
as this is called an electric current.
It is possible for an electric current to be either a ﬂow of positively charged particles or negatively charged particles.
In gases, both positive and negative ions can ﬂow. The difﬁculty of freeing protons, however, makes it extremely

rare to have an electric current of positive particles in solid conductors. Virtually all electric currents consist of the
movement of electrons.

Common Misconceptions

It is easy to assume that current is the ﬂow of positive charges. In fact, when the conventions of positive and negative
charge were invented two centuries ago, it was assumed that positive charge ﬂowed through a wire.
In reality,
however, we know now that the ﬂow of positive charge is actually a ﬂow of negative charge in the opposite direction.
That is, when an electron moves from position A to position B, it is the same as a positive hole moving from B to A.
Today, even though we know it is not correct, we still use the historical convention of positive current ﬂow when
discussing the direction of a current. Conventional current, the current we commonly use and discuss, is the
direction positive current would ﬂow. When we want to speak of the direction of electron ﬂow, we will speciﬁcally
state that we are referring to electron ﬂow.
Electric current ﬂows from positions of higher potential energy to positions of lower potential energy. Electrons
acquire higher potential energy from an electron pump that does work on the electrons, moving them from positions
of lower PE to positions of higher PE. Electrons in galvanic cells (several cells together comprise a battery) have
higher potential energy at one terminal of the battery that at the other. This difference in potential is related to
chemical energy. When the two terminals of the battery are connected to each other via a conducting wire, the
electric current will travel from the terminal with higher potential energy to that with lower potential energy. This
setup is the most simple of electric circuits.

Electric Circuits

An electric circuit is any closed loop that goes from one battery terminal to the other and allows current to ﬂow
through it. A relatively simple circuit is shown in the image below. The charges move from the higher potential
energy terminal on the battery, through the light bulb, through the switch, and back to the lower potential energy
terminal on the battery.

A circuit consists of a battery, or a charge pump, which increases the potential energy of the charges, and one or more
devices that decrease the potential energy. As the potential energy is reduced, it is converted into some other form
of energy. In the image above, the device that decreases the charges’ potential energy is the light bulb; the excess
energy is converted into light energy. Any device that reduces the potential energy of the charge ﬂowing through it

is said to have resistance because it resists the ﬂow of charge. Other resistors include motors, which convert energy
into kinetic energy, and heaters, which convert it into thermal energy.
The charges in the circuit can neither be created nor destroyed, nor can they pile up in one spot. The charged particles
moving through the circuit move the same everywhere in the circuit. If one coulomb of charge leaves the charge
pump, then one coulomb of charge moves through the light, and one coulomb of charge moves through the switch.
The net change of energy through the circuit is zero. That is, the increase in potential energy through the charge
pump is exactly equal to the potential drop through the light. If the generator (charge pump) does 120 J of work on
each coulomb of charge that it transfers, then the light uses 120 J of energy as the charge passes through the light.
The electric current is measured in coulombs per second. A ﬂow of one coulomb per second is called one ampere,
A, of current.

The energy carried by an electric current depends on the charge transferred and the potential difference across which
it moves, E = qV . The voltage or potential difference is expressed in Joules/coulomb and multiplying this by the
charge in coulombs yields energy in Joules.

• electric current: A measure of the amount of electrical charge transferred per unit time. It represents the ﬂow
of electrons through a conductive material or, in the case of conventional current, the ﬂow of positive holes
through a conductive material.

• conventional current: In a majority of electric currents, the moving charges are negative electrons. However,
due to historical reasons dating back to Ben Franklin, we say that conventional current ﬂows in the direction
positive charges would move. Although inconvenient, it’s fairly easy to keep straight if you just remember
that the actual moving charges, the electrons, ﬂow in a direction opposite that of the electric current.

18.2 Resistance and Ohm’s Law

• Deﬁne resistance.
• Understand the unit for resistance: ohms.
• Use Ohm’s Law to solve problems involving current, potential difference, and resistance.

The bands of color on a resistor are a code that indicates the magnitude of the resistance of the resistor. There are
four color bands identiﬁed by letter: A, B, C, and D, with a gap between the C and D bands so that you know which
end is A. This particular resistor has a red A band, blue B band, green C band, and gold D band, but the bands can be
different colors on different resistors. Based on the colors of the bands, it is possible to identify the type of resistor.
the A and B bands represent signiﬁcant digits; red is 2 and blue is 6. The C band indicates the multiplier, and green
indicates 105. These three together indicate that this particular resistor is a 26,000 Ohm resistor. Finally, the D band
indicates the tolerance, in this case 5%, as shown by the gold band. These terms will be explained over the course
of this lesson.

Resistance and Ohm’s Law

When a potential difference is placed across a metal wire, a large current will ﬂow through the wire. If the same
potential difference is placed across a glass rod, almost no current will ﬂow. The property that determines how much
current will ﬂow is called the resistance. Resistance is measured by ﬁnding the ratio of potential difference, V , to
current ﬂow, I.

R =

V
I

When given in the form V = IR, this formula is known as Ohm’s Law, after the man that discovered the relationship.
The units of resistance can be determined using the units of the other terms in the equation, namely that the potential
difference is in volts (J/C) and current in amperes (C/s):

The units for resistance have been given the name ohms and the abbreviation is the Greek letter omega, Ω. 1.00 Ω
is the resistance that will allow 1.00 ampere of current to ﬂow through the resistor when the potential difference is
1.00 volt. Most conductors have a constant resistance regardless of the potential difference; these are said to obey
Ohm’s Law.
There are two ways to control the current in a circuit. Since the current is directly proportional to the potential
difference and inversely proportional to the resistance, you can increase the current in a circuit by increasing the
potential or by decreasing the resistance.
Example Problem: A 50.0 V battery maintains current through a 20.0 Ω resistor. What is the current through the
resistor?
Solution: I = V

R = 50.0 V

20.0 Ω = 2.50 amps

Summary

• Resistance is the property that determines the amount of current ﬂow through a particular material.
• V = IR is known as Ohm’s Law.
• The unit for resistance is the ohm, and it has the abbreviation Ω.

18.3 Energy Transfer in Electric Circuits

• Explain how devices convert electrical energy to other forms.
• Use P = I2R and E = I2Rt for calculations involves energy transfer in electrical circuits.
• Describe the reason for the use of high voltage lines for transmitting electrical energy.
• Deﬁne the kilowatt-hour.

Part of the electrical grid, an electrical transmission sub-station receives extremely high current levels, then passes
the electrical energy on to as many as 200,000 homes. Approximately 5000 megawatt-hours of energy passes through
this particular substation each year.

Energy Transfer in Electric Circuits

Electric power is the energy per unit time converted by an electric circuit into another form of energy. We already
know that power through a circuit is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current in a circuit: P = V I. It is possible
to determine the power dissipated in a single resistor if we combine this expression with Ohm’s Law, V = IR. This
becomes particularly useful in circuits with more than one resistor, to determine the power dissipated in each one.
Combining these two equations, we get an expression for electric power that involves only the current and resistance
in a circuit.

P = I2R

The power dissipated in a resistor is proportional to the square of the current that passes through it and to its
resistance.

297

18.3. Energy Transfer in Electric Circuits

www.ck12.org

Electrical energy itself can be expressed as the electrical power multiplied by time:
E = Pt
We can incorporate this equation to obtain an equation for electrical energy based on current, resistance, and time.
The electrical energy across a resistor is determined to be the current squared multiplied by the resistance and the
time.
E = I2Rt
This equation holds true in ideal situations. However, devices used to convert electrical energy into other forms of
energy are never 100% efﬁcient. An electric motor is used to convert electrical energy into kinetic energy, but some
of the electrical energy in this process is lost to thermal energy. When a lamp converts electrical energy into light
energy, some electrical energy is lost to thermal energy.
Example Problem: A heater has a resistance of 25.0 Ω and operates on 120.0 V.

a. How much current is supplied to the resistance?
b. How many joules of energy is provided by the heater in 10.0 s?

Solution:

a. I = V
b. E = I2Rt = (4.8 A)2(25.0 Ω)(10.0 s) = 5760 joules

25.0 Ω = 4.8 A

R = 120.0 V

Think again about the power grid. When electricity is transmitted over long distances, some amount of energy is lost
in overcoming the resistance in the transmission lines. We know the equation for the power dissipated is given by
P = I2R. The energy loss can be minimized by choosing the material with the least resistance for power lines, but
changing the current also has signiﬁcant effects. Consider a reduction of the current by a power of ten:
How much power is dissipated when a current of 10.0 A passes through a power line whose resistance is 1.00
Ω? P = I2R = (10.0 A)2(1.00 Ω) = 100. Watts
How much power is dissipated when a current of 1.00 A passes through a power line whose resistance is 1.00
Ω? P = I2R = (1.00 A)2(1.00 Ω) = 1.00 Watts
The power loss is reduced tremendously by reducing the magnitude of the current through the resistance. Power
companies must transmit the same amount of energy over the power lines but keep the power loss minimal. They
do this by reducing the current. From the equation P = V I, we know that the voltage must be increased to keep the
same power level.

The Kilowatt-Hour

Even though the companies that supply electrical energy are often called “power” companies, they are actually
selling energy. Your electricity bill is based on energy, not power. The amount of energy provided by electric current
can be calculated by multiplying the watts (J/s) by seconds to yield joules. The joule, however, is a very small unit of
energy and using the joule to state the amount of energy used by a household would require a very large number. For
that reason, electric companies measure their energy sales in a large number of joules called a kilowatt hour (kWh).
A kilowatt hour is exactly as it sounds - the number of kilowatts (1,000 W) transferred per hour.
1.00 kilowatt hour = (1000 J/s)(3600 s) = 3.6× 106 J
Example Problem: A color television uses about 2.0 A when operated on 120 V.

a. How much power does the set use?
b. If the TV is operated for 8.00 hours per day, how much energy in kWh does it use per day?
c. At $0.15 per kWh, what does it cost to run the TV for 30 days?

E = Pt, and can also be calculated using E = I2Rt.
• Electric companies measure their energy sales in a large number of joules called a kilowatt hour (kWh) which
is equivalent to 3.6× 106 J.

The amount of electric current that passes through a circuit depends on the voltage pushing the current and the
resistance opposing the ﬂow of current. Circuits are designed for a speciﬁc voltage and resistance so that the current
ﬂow will be known. If the current is too large, the heat loss can damage the circuit, burn the resistors, or even burn
the surrounding objects. Even with circuits designed to prevent such situations, accidents can happen, such as when
wires touch each other unexpectedly. To prevent disasters, electrical circuits contain devices such as electrical fuses,
circuit breakers, and surge protectors to control the amount of current in the circuit. Examples of these devices are
shown above, and explained below.

Controlling Current in Electric Circuits

In the wiring of a building, the wires carrying the current in and out are different and never touch directly. The
charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another
resistor, which limits the amount of current that can ﬂow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current
at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in
control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the
current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is
called a short circuit. In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to
push a huge current through the wires.
For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100
ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm
resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000

301

18.4. Controlling Current in Electric Circuits

www.ck12.org

amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a ﬁre in
the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something
overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be
something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once
the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat.
There are multiple ways to prevent these situations from occurring. The three most common protective devices are
fuses, circuit breakers, and surge protectors.

Fuses

An electrical fuse is a device that sacriﬁces itself to provide over-current protection in an electrical circuit.
Conducting wires have a small electrical resistance. The electrical resistance of a conducting wire is related to the
type of metal used and inversely related to the cross-sectional area of the wire. The larger the diameter of a wire,
the greater the cross-sectional area, and the lower the electrical resistance will be. When electrons ﬂow through a
wire, they repel each other and interfere with the passage of other electrons. If there are a very large number of
electrons passing through a wire with small diameter, the electrons will experience a greater resistance than if the
wire diameter were larger and the electrons had more space between them.

The image above is one type of electrical fuse. This fuse has a specially designed wire inside glass housing. The wire
inside the glass is made of a particular metal and with a particular thickness to give the wire an exact resistance. This
resistance will allow passage of normal current plus a marginal percentage more. If, however, the current exceeds
the allowed value, the wire in the fuse will heat and melt, thus interrupting current ﬂow through the circuit. The
fuse wire is placed in the glass housing and a fuse mount to insulate the melting wire from its surroundings. Any
unintended increase in current, such as short circuits, overloading, mismatched loads, or device failure will cause
the fuse to burn out –protecting the other parts of the circuit from overheating and further damage.
This ’wire in glass’ fuse is only one type of electrical fuse. Most fuses consist of a wire with small cross-sectional
area compared to the circuit conductors, mounted between electrical terminals, and enclosed in a non-combustible
housing. Regardless of the speciﬁc type of fuse, it is placed such that it carries all the current passing through
the protected circuit. If the current ﬂow gets too high, the fuse will melt. This destroys the fuse, but protects the
remainder of the circuit.

Circuit Breakers

The problem with fuses is they only work once. Every time you blow a fuse, you have to replace it with a new one.
Like a fuse, a circuit breaker opens the circuit if the current reaches unsafe levels. Unlike a fuse, however, a circuit

302

www.ck12.org

Chapter 18. Current Electricity

breaker can be used over and over again. The basic circuit breaker consists of a simple switch, connected to an
electromagnet. The diagram below shows a typical basic circuit breaker design.

The red wire is the electrical circuit and is closed when the two contact points are connected. When the switch is
in the on position, electricity can ﬂow through the red circuit, through the electromagnet, and out into the rest of the
circuit.
The electricity magnetizes the electromagnet. Increasing the current boosts the electromagnet’s magnetic force,
while decreasing the current reduces the magnetic force. When the current reaches an unsafe level, the electromag-
net’s magnetic ﬁeld becomes strong enough to act on the soft iron bar, which is holding the left red wire in contact.
When the soft iron bar is pulled down, the spring attached to the left red wire will lift the wire and break the circuit,
causing the electricity to shut off. Once the circuit is broken, the electromagnet no longer emits a magnetic ﬁeld,
and the system can be reset by pushing the reset button. The reset button pushes the left red wire back in contact
with the right red wire and also re-engages the soft iron bar that holds the contact in place.
More advanced circuit breakers use electronic components (semiconductor devices) to monitor current levels rather
than simple electrical devices. These elements are a lot more precise, and they shut down the circuit more quickly,
but they are also a lot more expensive. For this reason, most houses still use conventional electric circuit breakers.
When circuit breakers pop open due to excessive current, you do not have to replace the circuit breaker, you simply
push a reset button. Of course, if the reason that the circuit breaker popped open is still present (like a short circuit),
the circuit will simply pop open again when you reset it. When a circuit breaker pops open, you should determine
the reason it opened and ﬁx the problem before resetting the circuit breaker.

Surge Protection

A standard surge protector passes the electrical current along from the outlet to a number of electrical and electronic
devices plugged into the power strip. If the voltage from the outlet surges or spikes (rises above the accepted level)
the surge protector diverts the extra electricity into the outlet’s grounding wire.
The most common type of surge protector contains a component called a metal oxide varistor, or MOV, which
diverts the extra voltage. As you can see in the diagram below, an MOV forms a connection between the hot power
line and the grounding line.

303

18.4. Controlling Current in Electric Circuits

www.ck12.org

An MOV has three parts: a piece of metal oxide material in the middle and two semiconductors that join it to the
power and grounding lines. These semiconductors have a variable resistance that is dependent on voltage. When
voltage is below a certain level, the electrons in the semiconductors ﬂow in such a way as to create a very high
resistance. When the voltage exceeds that level, the electrons behave differently, creating a much lower resistance.
When the voltage is low, an MOV does nothing. When voltage is too high, an MOV can conduct a lot of current to
the ground line, thus eliminating the extra voltage.
As soon as the extra current is diverted into the MOV and to ground, the voltage in the hot line returns to a
normal level, causing the MOV’s resistance to shoot up again. In this way, the MOV only diverts the surge current,
while allowing the standard current to continue powering whatever machines are connected to the surge protector.
Essentially, the MOV acts as a pressure release valve, only opening when the voltage exceeds set values.

Summary

• An electrical fuse is a device that sacriﬁces itself to provide over-current protection in an electrical circuit. If
too much current ﬂows, the fuse wire rises to a higher temperature and melts, thus opening the circuit, but
destroying the fuse.

• A circuit breaker opens a circuit as soon as the current climbs to unsafe levels, and can be used repeatedly.
• A standard surge protector passes a constant electrical current forward by diverting any extra electricity into a

grounding wire.

• short circuit: A device in a circuit is said to be short-circuited if it is by-passed by a conductor of nearly
zero resistance so that the voltage across the device drops to almost zero and the current in the by-pass circuit
becomes huge.

current ﬂow, but their resistance decreases greatly when voltage sharply increases.

Electrical power is the product of voltage, which is measured in watts, and current, which is measured in amperes.
Resistance to the ﬂow of electricity is measured in ohms. Anything in an electrical circuit that makes use of the ﬂow
of electricity provides some resistance. Electrical resistance within a wire is dependent not only on the material of
the wire, but also on the length of the wire and the amount of current ﬂowing through it. By converting electrical
power to high voltage and low current, power companies can efﬁciently transfer energy over great distances with
little loss. The power must be converted back at its destination for use in homes and businesses. Circuit breakers and

The string of Christmas lights on this tree may have cost $5 or $25, depending on how its circuit is constructed. One
possibility is that the lights are connected along a single path, in a series circuit. In this case, if the ﬁlament in one of
the bulbs were to burn out, then all the lights would go out. You wouldn’t be able to tell which one malfunctioned,
unless you go through the string and replace each bulb one at a time. The only advantage to such a design is that it is
inexpensive. Alternatively, each bulb could be placed in its own separate branch of the circuit. Since there are now
multiple paths by which charge can travel through the circuit, a burnt out bulb would not affect the rest of the lights,
and it’d be obvious which one would need to be replaced. Of course, a string of lights with this design, known as
a parallel circuit, would cost much more than the ﬁrst. In this chapter, we will examine and learn the mathematics
involved in series circuits, parallel circuits, and those that are a combination of both.

• Describe a series circuit.

• Understand resistance in a series circuit with multiple resistors.
• Calculate current, voltage drops, and equivalent resistances for devices connected in a series circuit.

Resistors, including electrical appliances, have a particular current at which they operate most effectively and safely,
and excessive current can cause irreparable damage. Therefore, it is important to limit the amount of current that
may pass through a particular electrical circuit. There are a number of safety devices used in electrical circuits to
limit the current: fuses, circuit breakers, and surge suppressors. When fuses, such as those shown above, are placed
in an electrical circuit, all the current must pass through the wire in the fuse.

Series Circuits

Electrical circuits are often modeled by using water in a river. The potential energy of the water is the highest at
the source of the river and decreases as the water ﬂows down the river toward the end. When the water reaches the
ocean, its potential energy has become zero. The circuit shown below has a similar situation. The current in this
circuit is drawn in the direction of the electron ﬂow. It starts at the battery on the left, where electrons leave the
negative terminal and travel around the circuit. Since all of the current travels across each resistor, these resistors are
said to be in series. A series circuit is one in which all of the current must pass through every resistor in the circuit.
Returning to the water analogy, there is only one riverbed from the top of the mountain to the ocean.

309

19.1. Series Circuits

www.ck12.org

Consider the series circuit sketched above. This circuit has a voltage drop for the entire circuit of 120 V and has
three resistors connected in series. The current in this circuit is drawn in terms of electron ﬂow. The electrons leave
the potential difference source at the negative terminal and ﬂow through the three resistors, starting with R3. Though
they have a small amount of resistance, the resistance of the connecting wires is so small in relation to the resistors
that we ignore it. Therefore, we say that there is no voltage drop when the current passes through the connecting
wires. The voltage drops occur when the current passes through each of the resistors and the total voltage drop for
the entire circuit is equal to the sum of the voltage drops through the three resistors.
VT = V1 +V2 +V3
The current through each of the resistors must be exactly the same because the current in a series circuit is the same
everywhere. The current is moving in the entire circuit at the same time.
IT = I1 = I2 = I3
Since the current passes through each resistor, the total resistance in the circuit is equal to the sum of the resistors.
In the circuit above, the total resistance is:
RT = R1 + R2 + R3 = 30 Ω + 15 Ω + 15 Ω = 60 Ω
Therefore, the total current and the current through each resistor is

I =

V
R =

120 V
60 Ω = 2.0 A.

The individual voltage drops can be calculated using the current through each resistor and each resistor’s individual
resistance.
V1 = I1R1 = (2.0 A)(30 Ω) = 60 V
V2 = I2R2 = (2.0 A)(15 Ω) = 30 V
V3 = I3R3 = (2.0 A)(15 Ω) = 30 V
Example Problem: Four 15 Ω resistors are connected in series with a 45 V battery. What is the current in the
circuit?
Solution: RT = 15 Ω + 15 Ω + 15 Ω + 15 Ω = 60 Ω
I = V

R = 45 V

60 Ω = 0.75 A

Electrical circuits are everywhere: skyscrapers, jumbo jets, arcade games, lights, heating, security... Very few
complex things work without electrical circuits. Since the late 1970s, electrical circuits have primarily looked like
this. The circuits are formed by a thin layer of conducting material deposited on the surface of an insulating board.
Individual components are soldered to the interconnecting circuits. Circuit boards are vastly more complicated than
the series circuits previously discussed, but operate on many similar principles.

Parallel Circuits

Parallel circuits are circuits in which the charges leaving the potential source have different paths they can follow
to get back to the source. In the sketch below, the current leaves the battery, passes through the orange switch, and
then has three different paths available to complete the circuit. Each individual electron in this circuit passes through
only one of the light bulbs. After the current passes through the switch, it divides into three pieces and each piece
passes through one of the bulbs. The three pieces of current rejoin after the light bulbs and continue in the circuit to
the potential source.

Chapter 19. Electrical Circuits

In the design of this parallel circuit, each resistor (light bulb) is connected across the battery as if the other two
resistors were not present. Remember that the current going through each resistor goes through only the one resistor.
Therefore, the voltage drop across each resistor must be equal to the total voltage drop though the circuit.
VT = V1 = V2 = V3
The total current passing through the circuit will be the sum of the individual currents passing through each resistor.
IT = I1 + I2 + I3
If we return to the analogy of a river, a parallel circuit is the same as the river breaking into three streams, which
later rejoin to one river again. The amount of water ﬂowing in the river is equal to the sum of the amounts of water
ﬂowing in the individual streams.
Ohm’s Law applies to resistors in parallel, just as it did to resistors in a series. The current ﬂowing through each
resistor is equal to the total voltage drop divided by the resistance in that resistor.

19.3 Combined Series-Parallel Circuits

• Solve problems of combined circuits.

Electrical circuits can become immensely complicated. This circuit is a polynomial plotter, which allows users to
plot polynomials and evaluate functions at various x values.

Combined Series-Parallel Circuits

Most circuits are not just a series or parallel circuit; most have resistors in parallel and in series. These circuits are
called combination circuits. When solving problems with such circuits, use this series of steps.

1. For resistors connected in parallel, calculate the single equivalent resistance that can replace them.
2. For resistors in series, calculate the single equivalent resistance that can replace them.
3. By repeating steps 1 and 2, you can continually reduce the circuit until only a single equivalent resistor
remains. Then you can determine the total circuit current. The voltage drops and currents though individual
resistors can then be calculated.

Example Problem: In the combination circuit sketched below, ﬁnd the equivalent resistance for the circuit, ﬁnd the
total current through the circuit, and ﬁnd the current through each individual resistor.

99 Ω

We then simplify R1 and R23 which are series resistors.
RT = R1 + R23 = 110 Ω + 99 Ω = 209 Ω
We can then ﬁnd the total current, IT = VT
RT
All the current must pass through R1, so I1 = 0.11 A.
The voltage drop through R1 is (110 Ω)(0.11 A) = 12.6 volts.
Therefore, the voltage drop through R2 and R3 is 11.4 volts.
I2 = V2
220 Ω = 0.052 A
R2

180 Ω = 0.063 A and I3 = V3
R3

= 11.4 V

= 24 V

209 Ω = 0.11 A.

= 11.4 V

19.4 Ammeters and Voltmeters

• Describe the primary difference between the construction of ammeters and voltmeters.
• Describe whether ammeters should be placed in circuits in series or parallel and explain why.
• Describe whether voltmeters should be placed in circuits in series or parallel and explain why.

This photo is of the interior of the control room for a nuclear power plant. Many of the meters are reading information
about the water temperature and the nuclear reaction that is occurring, but the majority of the meters are reading data
about the electric energy being generated.

Ammeters and Voltmeters

Ammeters and voltmeters are cleverly designed for the way they are used. Ammeters measure the current of a
circuit, and voltmeters measure the voltage drop across a resistor. It is important in the design and use of these
meters that they don’t change the circuit in such a way as to inﬂuence the readings. While both types of meters are
technically resistors, they are speciﬁcally designed to make their readings without changing the circuit itself.

19.4. Ammeters and Voltmeters

www.ck12.org

Ammeter

An ammeter measures the current traveling through the circuit. They are designed to be connected to the circuit
in series, and have an extremely low resistance. If an ammeter were connected in parallel, all of the current would
go through the ammeter and very little through any other resistor. As such, it is necessary for the ammeter to be
connected in series with the resistors. This allows the ammeter to accurately measure the current ﬂow without
causing any disruptions. In the circuit sketched above, the ammeter is m2.

Voltmeter

In contrast, a voltmeter is designed to be connected to a circuit in parallel, and has a very high resistance. A voltmeter
measures the voltage drop across a resistor, and does not need to have the current travel through it to do so. When a
voltmeter is placed in parallel with a resistor, all the current continues to travel through the resistor, avoiding the very
high resistance of the voltmeter. However, we know that the voltage drop across all resistors in parallel is the same,
so connecting a voltmeter in parallel allows it to accurately measure the voltage drop. In the sketch, the voltmeter is
m1.

Summary

• Ammeters measure the current through a resistor.
• Ammeters have low resistances and are placed in the circuit in series.
• Voltmeters measure the voltage drop across a resistor.
• Voltmeters have high resistances and are placed in the circuit in parallel.

Series circuits are simple and comparatively inexpensive to design, but require every resistor or device in the circuit
to be functional in order for the rest to work. Parallel circuits are more complex and expensive, but they have
some advantages that may be worth the cost. There are applications for each type of circuit. More commonly,
a combination of both types is used, which can offer capabilities and advantages that neither type can provide
individually. Ammeters and voltmeters are tools used to evaluate the ﬂow of current through a circuit and must be
connected to the circuit appropriately in order to measure the ﬂow without signiﬁcantly changing it.

The interaction between moving electrons and magnetic ﬁelds can produce electricity. If a metallic wire that is part
of a complete circuit is passed through a magnetic ﬁeld, the electrons in the wire are pushed through the circuit,
resulting in an electric current. An electric generator is any machine that is designed to generate electricity by
passing metal wires through a magnetic ﬁeld. All that is required is to spin the axle on the generator. The largest
generators rely on turbines, which contain fan blades that spin when ﬂuid—such as steam produced by burning coal
or wind blowing through a windmill—is forced through. The generation of hydroelectric power harnesses falling
water to spin turbines attached to electric generators. For instance, the Colorado River ﬂows through the turbines
of the Hoover Dam, shown above, generating more than 4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year for use in
Nevada, Arizona, and California.

20.1 Properties of Magnets

• Describe magnetic ﬁelds around permanent magnets.
• Understand ferromagnetism and magnetic domains.
• Describe some properties of magnets.

Some countries are using powerful electromagnets to develop high-speed trains, called maglev, or magnetic levita-
tion, trains. These trains use the repulsive force of magnets to ﬂoat over a guide way, removing the friction of steel
wheels and train tracks. Reducing this friction allows the trains to travel at much higher speeds.

Properties of Magnets

Any magnet, regardless of its shape, has two ends called poles where the magnetic effect is strongest. If a magnet is
suspended by a ﬁne thread, it is found that one pole of the magnet will always point toward the north. This fact has
been made use of in navigation since the eleventh century. The pole of the magnet that seeks the north pole is called
the north pole of the magnet, while the opposite side is the south pole.
It is a familiar fact that when two magnets are brought near one another, the magnets exert a force on each other. The
magnetic force can be either attractive or repulsive. If two north poles or two south poles are brought near each other,
the force will be repulsive. If a north pole is brought near a south pole, the force will be attractive.

325

20.1. Properties of Magnets

www.ck12.org

The Earth’s geographic north pole (which is close to, but not exactly at the magnetic pole) attracts the north poles
of magnets. We know, therefore, that this pole is actually the Earth’s magnetic south pole. This can be seen in the
image above; the geographic north and south poles are labeled with barber shop poles, and the Earth’s magnetic
poles are indicated with the double-headed arrow.
Only iron and few other materials such as cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium show strong magnetic effects. These
materials are said to be ferromagnetic. Other materials show some slight magnetic effect but it is extremely small
and can be detected only with delicate instruments.

Ferromagnetic Domains

Microscopic examination reveals that a magnet is actually made up of tiny regions known as magnetic domains,
which are about one millimeter in length and width. Each domain acts like a tiny magnet with a north and south
pole.

326

www.ck12.org

Chapter 20. Magnetic Fields

When the ferrous material is not magnetized, the domains are randomly organized so that the north and south poles
do not line up and often cancel each other. When the ferrous material is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld, the domains
line up with the magnetic ﬁeld so that the north poles are all pointed in the same direction and the south poles
are all pointed in the opposite direction. In this way, the ferrous material has become a magnet. In many cases,
the domains will remain aligned only while the ferrous material is in a strong magnetic ﬁeld; when the material
is removed from the ﬁeld, the domains return to their previous random organization and the ferrous material loses
any magnetic properties. Magnets that have magnetic properties while in the ﬁeld of another magnet but lose the
magnetic properties when removed from the ﬁeld are called temporary magnets. Under certain circumstances,
however, the new alignment can be made permanent and the ferrous substance becomes a permanent magnet.
That is, the ferrous object remains a magnet even when removed from the other magnetic ﬁeld.
The formation of temporary magnets allows a magnet to attract a non-magnetized piece of iron. You have most
likely seen a magnet pick up a paper clip. The presence of the magnet aligns the domains in the iron paper clip and
it becomes a temporary magnet. Whichever pole of the magnet is brought near the paper clip will induce magnetic
properties in the paper clip that remain as long as the magnet is near.
Permanent magnets lose their magnetic properties when the domains are dislodged from their organized positions
and returned to a random jumble. This can occur if the magnet is hammered on or if it is heated strongly.

Magnetic Fields

When we were dealing with electrical effects, it was very useful to speak of an electric ﬁeld that surrounded an
electric charge. In the same way, we can imagine a magnetic ﬁeld surrounding a magnetic pole. The force that one
magnet exerts on another can be described as the interaction between one magnet and the magnetic ﬁeld of the other
magnet. Magnetic ﬁeld lines go from the north magnetic pole to the south magnetic pole. We deﬁne the magnetic
ﬁeld at any point as a vector (represented by the letter B) whose direction is from north to south magnetic poles.

• magnet: A body that can attract certain substances, such as iron or steel, as a result of a magnetic ﬁeld.
• magnetic pole: Either of two regions of a magnet, designated north and south, where the magnetic ﬁeld is
strongest. Electromagnetic interactions cause the north poles of magnets to be attracted to the south poles of
other magnets, and conversely. The north pole of a magnet is the pole out of which magnetic lines of force
point, while the south pole is the pole into which they point.

• ferromagnetic: A body or substance having a high susceptibility to magnetization, the strength of which
depends on that of the applied magnetizing ﬁeld, and which may persist after removal of the applied ﬁeld.
This is the kind of magnetism displayed by iron, and is associated with parallel magnetic alignment of adjacent
domains.

20.2 Electric Currents and Magnetic Fields

• Understand the shape of magnetic ﬁelds produced by moving current.
• Understand the effect of a magnetic ﬁeld on a moving charged particle.
• Explain the direction of the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic ﬁeld.
• Solve problems involving using the right and left hand rules.

Powerful electromagnets are commonly used for industrial lifting. Here, a magnet is lifting scrap iron and loading
it onto a railroad car for transporting to a scrap iron recovery plant. Other uses for lifting magnets include moving
cars in a junk yard, lifting rolls of steel sheeting, and lifting large steel parts for various machines. Electromagnets
are usually used for these jobs because they are magnets only when the electric current is on. The magnet will hold
the iron object when the current is on and release it when the current is off.

Electric Currents and Magnetic Fields

Electricity and magnetism are inextricably linked. Under certain conditions, electric current causes a magnetic ﬁeld.
Under other conditions, a magnetic ﬁeld can cause an electric current. A moving charged particle creates a magnetic
ﬁeld around it. Additionally, when a moving charged particle moves through a different magnetic ﬁeld, the two
magnetic ﬁelds will interact. The result is a force exerted on the moving charged particle.
Magnetic Field Around a Current Carrying Wire
In sketch (a) above, a current is being pushed through a straight wire. Small compasses placed around the wire point
in a circle, instead of all towards the north pole. This demonstrates the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld around the wire.
If the current is turned off, the compass points return to pointing north.
The current moving in a straight wire produces a circular magnetic ﬁeld around the wire. When using conventional
current, the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld is determined by using the right hand rule. The rule says to curl your

330

www.ck12.org

Chapter 20. Magnetic Fields

FIGURE 20.1

right hand around the wire such that your thumb points in the direction of the conventional current. Having done
this, your ﬁngers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. Note that the right hand rule is
for conventional current. If you are dealing with an electron ﬂow current, the charges are ﬂowing in the opposite
direction, so you must use your left hand. That is, curl your left hand around the wire with your thumb pointing in
the direction of the electron ﬂow and your ﬁngers will point in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Charged Particles Moving Through a Magnetic Field

When a charged particle moves through a magnetic ﬁeld at right angles to the ﬁeld, the ﬁeld exerts a force on the
charged particle in a different direction.

In the case sketched above, an electron is moving downward through a magnetic ﬁeld. The motion of the electron is
perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The force exerted on the electron can be calculated by the equation,
F = Bqv, where B is the strength of the ﬁeld, q is the charge on the particle and v is the velocity of the particle.
B is expressed in Newtons
as a Tesla, after the Serbian physicist Nikola Tesla.
You can see that the product of these three units is Newtons, the appropriate unit for force.

Amp·meter ,while q is expressed in coulombs and v is expressed in m/s. The unit N

A·m is also known

Amp·meter · coulomb · meter

s

and since amperes are coulomb

F = Bqv = Newtons
cancels meters. The only unit remaining is Newtons.
Again, we can determine the direction of the force acting upon the electron using a hand rule. Since the electron has
a negative charge, the left hand rule is used. The ﬁngers of the left hand are pointed in the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld and the thumb points in the direction of the initial electron movement. The direction of the force acting on
the electron is the direction the palm of the left hand faces. The direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, the direction of the
moving charge, and the direction of the force on the particle are all perpendicular to each other.

second , amps cancels coulombs/second and meters

331

20.2. Electric Currents and Magnetic Fields

www.ck12.org

In most situations, a positive test charged is used, instead of an electron. In these circumstances, the right hand
rule is used. The right hand rule is the same as the left hand rule; the thumb is the direction of initial charge
movement, the ﬁngers are the direction of the ﬁeld, and the palm is the direction of the acting force.

In dealing with the relationships that exist between magnetic ﬁelds and electric charges, there are both left hand and
right hand rules that we use to indicate various directions –directions of ﬁelds, directions of currents, directions of
motion. To avoid errors, it is absolutely vital to know and express whether the system we are observing is using
conventional current or electron current. This allows us to use the appropriate rule.
Example Problem: An electron traveling at 3.0× 106 m/s passes through a 0.0400 N/amp· m uniform magnetic
ﬁeld. The electron is moving at right angles to the magnetic ﬁeld. What force acts on the electron?
Solution: F = Bqv = (0.0400 N/amp· m)(1.6× 10−19 C)(3.0× 106 m/s)
= 1.9× 10−14 N
When the current is traveling through a magnetic ﬁeld while inside a wire, the magnetic force is still exerted but now
it is calculated as the force on the wire rather than on the individual charges in the current.
The equation for the force on the wire is given as F = BIL, where B is the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld, I is the
current in amps and L is the length of the wire in and perpendicular to the ﬁeld.
Example Problem: A wire 0.10 m long carries a current of 5.0 A. The wire is at right angles to a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld. The force the ﬁeld exerts on the wire is 0.20 N. What is the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld?

Summary

• A moving charged particle creates a magnetic ﬁeld around it.
• Charge through a wire creates a magnetic ﬁeld around it, the properties of which can be determined using a

right hand rule.

• When a moving charged particle moves through another magnetic ﬁeld, that ﬁeld will exert a force on the

moving charged particle that can be expressed using F = Bqv.

• The relationships between the moving charged particle, magnetic ﬁeld, and the force exerted can be determined

using the right hand rule if the particle is positive, or the left hand rule if it is negative.

• When the current is traveling through a magnetic ﬁeld while inside a wire, the magnetic force is still exerted
but now it is calculated as the force on the wire rather than on the individual charges in the current, calculated
using F = BIL.

• Explain the design and operation of an electric motor.

As gas prices continue to rise, electric cars and hybrids are becoming increasingly popular. These cars are certainly
a part of our future. On the left in the image above is an all-electric vehicle, and on the right is a hybrid vehicle that
uses gas part time and electricity part time.

Electric Motors

In an earlier concept, we described and calculated the force that a magnetic ﬁeld exerts on a current carrying wire.
Since you are familiar with Newton’s third law of motion, you know that if the magnetic ﬁeld exerts a force on the
current carrying wire, then the current carrying wire also exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction
on the magnetic ﬁeld.

In the sketch above, a circuit is connected to a battery, with one part of the circuit placed inside a magnetic ﬁeld.
When current runs through the circuit, a force will be exerted on the wire by the magnetic ﬁeld, causing the wire to

move. If we choose to consider electron current in this case, the electrons ﬂow from the back of the sketch to the
front while the magnetic ﬁeld is directed upward. Using the left hand rule for this, we ﬁnd that the force on the wire
is to the right of the page. Had we chosen to consider the current to be conventional current, then the current would
be ﬂowing from the front of the sketch to the back and we would use the right hand rule. The force on the wire
would, once again, be toward the right. This movement is harnessed in electrical motors.
Electrical motors change electrical energy into mechanical energy. The motor consists of an electrical circuit with
part of the wires inside a magnetic ﬁeld. This can be seen below. Positive charges move through the circuit in the
direction of the light purple arrows. When the charges move up through the part of the coil that is right next to the
north pole, the right hand rule tells us that the wire suffers the force, F, pushing the wire in the direction of the blue
arrow, toward the back of the sketch. On the other side of the coil, where the charges are moving down through
the ﬁeld, the right hand rule shows the force would push this side of the coil toward the front. These two forces are
working together, rotating the coil in the direction of the circular red arrow.

Where the rotating coil (in grey) meets the wires attached to the power source (black), we ﬁnd a split ring commu-
tator. The coil turns, but the commutator and power source do not. As the coil turns, it moves off of the blue box
connector and as it continues to turn, it connects to the other blue box connector. As the coil turns, it reverses its
connections to the external circuit. Therefore, inside the coil, the current is always ﬂowing in the same direction
because the left side of the coil is always attached to the left side of the external circuit. This allows the coil, or
armature, to continue to spin the same direction all the time.
In electrical motors, these coils often consist of not just one, but many wires, as can be seen here:

sides every half turn.

20.4 Electromagnets

• Deﬁne and describe a solenoid.
• Deﬁne and describe an electromagnet.
• Determine the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld inside a solenoid given the direction of current ﬂow in the coil

wire.

• Understand why an electromagnet has a stronger magnetic ﬁeld than a solenoid.

One of the most famous electric car companies is Tesla, named after Nikola Tesla. These electric cars, and all others,
require an electromagnet to run the engine.

Electromagnets

A long coil of wire consisting of many loops of wire and making a complete circuit is called a solenoid. The magnetic
ﬁeld within a solenoid can be quite large since it is the sum of the ﬁelds due to the current in each individual loop.

339

20.4. Electromagnets

www.ck12.org

The magnetic ﬁeld around the wire is determined by a hand rule. Since this description doesn’t mention electron
ﬂow, we must assume that the current indicated by I is conventional current (positive). Therefore, we would use a
right hand rule. We grasp a section of wire with our right hand pointing the thumb in the direction of the current
ﬂow and our ﬁngers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, the ﬁeld points down
the cavity in these loops from right to left as shown in the sketch.
If a piece of iron is placed inside the coil of wire, the magnetic ﬁeld is greatly increased because the domains of
the iron are aligned by the magnetic ﬁeld of the current. The resulting magnetic ﬁeld is hundreds of time stronger
than the ﬁeld from the current alone. This arrangement is called an electromagnet. The picture below shows an
electromagnet with an iron bar inside a coil.

Our knowledge of electromagnets developed from a series of observations. In 1820, Hans Oersted discovered that a
current-carrying wire produced a magnetic ﬁeld. Later in the same year, André-Marie Ampere discovered that a coil
of wire acted like a permanent magnet and François Arago found that an iron bar could be magnetized by putting
it inside of a coil of current-carrying wire. Finally, William Sturgeon found that leaving the iron bar inside the coil
greatly increased the magnetic ﬁeld.
Two major advantages of electromagnets are that they are extremely strong magnetic ﬁelds, and that the magnetic
ﬁeld can be turned on and off. When the current ﬂows through the coil, it is a powerful magnet, but when the current
is turned off, the magnetic ﬁeld essentially disappears.
Electromagnets ﬁnd use in many practical applications. Electromagnets are used to lift large masses of magnetic
materials such as scrap iron, rolls of steel, and auto parts.

The overhead portion of this machine (painted yellow) is a lifting electromagnet. It is lowered to the deck where
steel pipe is stored and it picks up a length of pipe and moves it to another machine where it is set upright and
lowered into an oil well drill hole.
Electromagnets are essential to the design of the electric generator and electric motor and are also employed in
doorbells, circuit breakers, television receivers, loudspeakers, electric dead bolts, car starters, clothes washers,
atomic particle accelerators, and electromagnetic brakes and clutches. Electromagnets are commonly used as
switches in electrical machines. A recent use for industrial electromagnets is to create magnetic levitation systems
for bullet trains.

Summary

• A solenoid is a long coil of wire consisting of many loops of wire that makes a complete circuit.
• An electormagnet is a piece of iron inside a solenoid.
• While the magnetic ﬁeld of a solenoid may be quite large, an electromagnet has a signiﬁcantly larger magnetic

ﬁeld.

• Electromagnets’ magnetic ﬁelds can be easily turned off by just halting the current.

which a current is passed.

• magnetic levitation: The suspension of an object above a second object by means of magnetic repulsion.

Magnets can be temporary or permanent, depending on their ability to retain charge when not in contact with another
magnet. Ferromagnetic materials are substances that can be made into magnets. A ferromagnetic core wrapped with
a current-carrying wire forms an electromagnet that can be many times stronger than the magnet alone. Magnets
emit magnetic ﬁelds, and passing a wire connected to a complete circuit through such ﬁelds induces current through
the circuit. This is the basic premise behind electric generators, which effectively convert the mechanical energy of
the motion of the wire into electrical energy.

If you have ever looked up at power lines, you’ve surely seen these barrel-shaped devices attached to utility poles.
The devices are called transformers. To understand their purpose, you should know that all metal transmission wires
have some amount of resistance to the passage of electric current, which means that a fraction of electric power
is converted to heat. The amount of energy lost to the surroundings is proportional to the square of the electric
current. The electric power transmitted over these lines can be expressed in watts and is equal to the voltage times
the amperage of the current. A current of 100 amps and a voltage of 50,000 volts transmits the same amount of
power as 5 amps and 1,000,000 volts. Since the energy loss is related to the amperage squared, using the 5-amp
current instead of the 100-amp current would make a tremendous difference in terms of efﬁciency. It is clearly
wise to increase a current’s voltage and reduce its strength before sending it over long transmission lines. When the
current reaches houses and other buildings, however, the appliances at those destinations cannot use a current of 5
amps with a voltage of 1,000,000 volts. Therefore, the most efﬁcient system for the transmission of electric power
is to “step-up” transform the current to a higher voltage before long-distance transmission and then “step-down”
transform the current to a lower voltage to ready it for use. These transformations are carried out by the transformers
on the power lines. In this chapter, you will learn more about transformers and other applications of electromagnetic
induction.

21.1 Electromotive Force

• Deﬁne EMF.
• Calculate EMF for a wire moving in a magnetic ﬁeld.

Electrical generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Every electrical generator needs some method
for spinning the coil inside the magnetic ﬁeld. Hydroelectric generators use water pressure to spin the coil while
windmills, of course, use the wind to spin the coil. The image here is a combination of steam turbine and generator.
The steam can be produced by burning coal or diesel fuel or by a nuclear reaction and the steam then turns the coil
and generates electricity.

Electromotive Force

When an individual charge ﬂies through a magnetic ﬁeld, a force is exerted on the charge and the path of the charge
bends. In the case shown in the sketch below, the charge is positive and the right hand rule shows us the force will
be upward, perpendicular to both the ﬁeld and the path of the charge.

345

21.1. Electromotive Force

www.ck12.org

If a wire that is part of a complete circuit is moved through a magnetic ﬁeld, the force on the individual electrons in
the wire occurs in exactly the same manner. Since the electrons in the wire are negatively charged, the force would
be in the opposite direction but otherwise the situation is the same. When the wire is pulled downward through the
magnetic ﬁeld, the force on the electrons cause them to move within the wire. Since the charges are negative, the
left hand rule shows that the electrons would move as diagrammed in the sketch. (Point ﬁngers in the direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld, point thumb in the direction of wire movement, and palm shows direction of electron ﬂow.) No
current will ﬂow, of course, unless the section of wire is part of a complete circuit.

This process allows us to convert mechanical energy (the motion of the wire) into electrical energy (the current). This
is the opposite of what happens in an electric motor where electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy.
In order to maintain a constant current ﬂow, it is necessary to have a potential difference or voltage in the circuit.
The voltage or potential difference is also frequently referred to electromotive force. The term electromotive force,

346

www.ck12.org

Chapter 21. Electromagnetic Induction

like many historical terms, is a misnomer. Electromotive force is NOT a force, it is a potential difference or potential
energy per unit charge and is measured in volts. The potential difference in the case of moving a wire through a
magnetic ﬁeld is produced by the work done on the charges by whatever is pushing the wire through the ﬁeld.
The EMF (or voltage) depends on the magnetic ﬁeld strength, B, the length of the wire in the magnetic ﬁeld, l, and
the velocity of the wire in the ﬁeld.

EMF = Blv

This calculation is based on the wire moving perpendicularly through the ﬁeld. If the wire moves an angle to the
ﬁeld, then only the component of the wire perpendicular to the ﬁeld will generate EMF.
Example Problem: A 0.20 m piece of wire that is part of a complete circuit moves perpendicularly through a
magnetic ﬁeld whose magnetic induction is 0.0800 T. If the speed of the wire is 7.0 m/s, what EMF is induced in
the wire?
Solution:
EMF = Blv = (0.0800 N/A· m)(0.20 m)(7.0 m/s) = 0.11 N · m/C = 0.11 J/C = 0.11 V

Summary

• If a wire that is part of a complete circuit is moved through a magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬁeld exerts a force

on the individual electrons in the wire, which causes a current to ﬂow.

• The potential difference in the case of moving a wire through a magnetic ﬁeld is produced by the work done

on the charges by whatever is pushing the wire through the ﬁeld.

• The EMF (or voltage) depends on the magnetic ﬁeld strength, B, the length of the wire in the magnetic ﬁeld,

l, and the velocity of the wire in the ﬁeld, EMF = Blv.

21.2 Electric Generators

• Explain how an electric generator works.
• Explain the difference between an electric generator and an electric motor.
• Explain the difference between peak and effective voltage and current from a generator.

These large machines are electric generators. This particular row of generators is installed in a hydroelectric power
station. The insides of these generators are coils of wire spinning in a magnetic ﬁeld. The relative motion between
the wire and the magnetic ﬁeld is what generates electric current. In all generators, some mechanical energy is used
to spin the coil of wire in the generator. In the case of hydroelectric power, the coil of wire is spun by water falling
from higher PE to lower PE. Windmills and steam turbines are used in other types of power generators to spin the
coil.

Electric Generators

Electric generators convert mechanical energy to electric energy. The generator consists of some number of wire
loops wrapped around an iron core and placed in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. The loops of wire and the iron core are
called the armature. The armature is mounted so that it can rotate freely inside the magnetic ﬁeld. Mechanical
energy is used to spin the armature in the ﬁeld so that the wire loops cut across the ﬁeld and produce electric current.
The EMF of this current is calculated by EMF = Blv.

349

21.2. Electric Generators

www.ck12.org

Consider the coil and magnetic ﬁeld sketched above. When the right hand side of the coil moves up through the
ﬁeld, the left hand rule indicates that the electron ﬂow will be from the front to the back in that side of the coil. The
current generated will have the greatest EMF as the wire is cutting perpendicularly across the ﬁeld. When the wire
reaches the top of its arc, it is moving parallel to the ﬁeld and therefore, not cutting across the ﬁeld at all. The EMF
at this point will be zero. As that same wire then cuts down through the ﬁeld as it continues to spin, the left hand
rule indicates that the electron ﬂow will be from the back to the front in that side of the coil. In this second half of
the arc, the direction of the electron ﬂow has reversed. The magnitude of the EMF will reach maximum again as the
wire cuts perpendicularly down through the ﬁeld and the EMF will become zero again as the wire passes through
the bottom of the arc. The current produced as the armature goes around will resemble a sine wave where the EMF
reaches a maximum in one direction, then goes to zero, then goes to a maximum in the other direction. This type
of current is called alternating current. By having more and more loops of wire on the armature, the crests and
troughs overlap and ﬁll in until a constant current is produced.

A direct current is one that always ﬂows in the same direction rather than alternating back and forth. Batteries
produce direct currents. A generator can also produce direct current by using a split ring commutator that changes
external connections every half turn of the armature so that even though the current in the coil changes direction,
every time the current in the coil changes direction, the external connection switches so that the external current
always goes in the same direction.
Generators and motors are almost identical in construction but convert energy in opposite directions. Generators
convert mechanical energy to electrical energy and motors convert electrical energy to mechanical.
Because of the alternating direction in alternating current, the average value is less than the power supplied by a
direct current. In fact, the average power of an AC current is one-half its maximum power and one-half the power of
an equivalent DC current. The effective current of an AC generator is 0.707 times its maximum current. The same
is true for the effective voltage of an AC generator.

• State Lenz’s law.
• Explain back EMF and explain how it affects motors and generators.

This is a diagram of a hand-cranked demonstration generator. Turning the hand crank spins a coil inside horseshoe
magnets and generates an electric current that lights the bulb. In order to generate an electric current in a conductor,
the conductor must be part of a complete circuit. If the light bulb is removed from this apparatus, the crank is very
easy to turn. If the light bulb is absent, the circuit is incomplete and no current is generated. When the light bulb is
place in the circuit, the circuit is complete and turning the crank will generate a current and light the bulb. When the
crank is turned with bulb in the circuit, it is more difﬁcult to turn the crank. A great deal more effort is needed to

In the sketch below, moving the wire downward through the magnetic ﬁeld causes electrons to ﬂow in the wire as
diagrammed. This is because relative motion between charged particles and magnetic ﬁelds produces a force on the
charged particles . . . so the downward movement of the wire causes a force which moves the electrons, producing a
current. When the electrons begin to ﬂow, however, there is a second motion of the charged particles and this second
motion will produce a second force on the particles.

21.3. Lenz’s Law

www.ck12.org

If we use the left hand rule on the electron ﬂow, we point our ﬁngers in the direction of the ﬁeld and our thumb in
the direction of electron movement and the palm of our hand indicates the direction of the force –UP !
This secondary force always opposes the ﬁrst movement of the wire. Lenz’s law states the induced current produces
a magnetic ﬁeld that opposes the motion that caused the induced current.
“An induced electromotive force generates a current that induces a counter magnetic ﬁeld that opposes the magnetic
ﬁeld generating the current.”
Lenz’s law also applies to electric motors. When an EMF is sent through a motor (aka, a current is passed through
the armature of a motor) a force is produced that causes the armature to turn. This is electric energy converted to
mechanical energy. The spin of the armature, however, now causes the motor to act like a generator and generate an
EMF. The direction of the EMF is always the opposite of the original EMF that was sent through the motor. This
second EMF is called back-EMF.

Summary

• Lenz’s law states, “An induced electromotive force generates a current that induces a counter magnetic ﬁeld

that opposes the magnetic ﬁeld generating the current.”

• The spin of the armature, however, now causes the motor to act like a generator and generate an EMF. The

direction of the EMF is always the opposite to the original EMF that was sent through the motor.

21.4 Transformers

• Describe the function of a transformer.
• Explain the relationship between turns and voltage ratio.
• Solve mathematical problems involving transformers.

Power loss in long transmission lines is related to the magnitude of the current. Speciﬁcally, the power loss can be
decreased by decreasing the magnitude of the current.
The amount of power passed through transmission lines can be calculated by multiplying voltage by current. The
same power can be transmitted using a very high voltage and a very low current as with a low voltage and high
current.
Since power companies do not wish to waste power as it is transmitted to homes and businesses, they deliberately
’step up’ the voltage and reduce the current before transmitting the power over extended distances. That type of
power transmits well without great loss of energy but it cannot be used in household appliances. It becomes necessary
to convert it back (’step down’) to low voltage and high current for household use. That is the job of electrical
transformers –those big gray barrels you see on power poles.

Transformers

When we move a wire through a magnetic ﬁeld, a force is exerted on the charges in the wire and a current is induced.
Essentially the same thing happens if we hold the wire steady and move the magnetic ﬁeld by moving the magnet.
Yet a third way of causing relative motion between the charges in a wire and a magnetic ﬁeld is to expand or contract
the ﬁeld through the wire.

356

www.ck12.org

Chapter 21. Electromagnetic Induction

When a current begins to ﬂow in a wire, a circular magnetic ﬁeld forms around the wire. Within the ﬁrst fractional
second when the current begins to ﬂow, the magnetic ﬁeld expands outward from the wire. If a second wire is placed
nearby, the expanding ﬁeld will pass through the second wire and induce a brief current in the wire.

Consider the sketch above. When the knife switch is closed, current begins to ﬂow in the ﬁrst circuit and therefore,
a magnetic ﬁeld expands outward around the wire. When the magnetic ﬁeld expands outward from the wire on the
right side, it will pass through the wire in the second circuit. This relative motion between wire and ﬁeld induces a
current in the second circuit. The magnetic ﬁeld expands outward for only a very short period of time and therefore,
only a short jolt of current is induced in the second circuit. You can leave the knife switch closed and the current
will continue to ﬂow in the ﬁrst circuit but no current is induced in the second circuit because the ﬁeld is constant
and therefore there is no relative motion between the ﬁeld and the wire in the second circuit. When the knife switch
is opened, the current in the ﬁrst circuit ceases to ﬂow and the magnetic ﬁeld collapses back through the wire to
zero. As the magnetic ﬁeld collapses, it passes through the wire and once again we have relative motion between the
wire in the second circuit and the magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, we once again have a short jolt of current induced in
the second circuit. This second jolt of induced current will be ﬂowing in the opposite direction of the ﬁrst induced
current. We can produce an alternating current in the second circuit simply by closing and opening the knife switch
continuously in the ﬁrst circuit.
Obviously, a transformer would have little use in the case of DC current because current is only induced in the second
circuit when the ﬁrst circuit is started or stopped. With AC current, however, since the current changes direction 60
times per second, the magnetic ﬁeld would constantly be expanding and contracting through the second wire.
A transformer is a device used to increase or decrease alternating current voltages. They do this with essentially
no loss of energy. A transformer has two coils, electrically insulated from each other as shown in the sketch. One
coil is called the primary coil and the other is called the secondary coil. When the primary coil is connected to a
source of AC voltage, the changing current creates a varying magnetic ﬁeld. The varying magnetic ﬁeld induces a
varying EMF in the secondary coil. The EMF induced in the secondary coil is called the secondary voltage and is
proportional to the primary voltage. The secondary voltage also depends on the ratio of turns on the secondary coil
to turns on the primary coil.

This photograph is of the world’s ﬁrst observation of a neutrino in a hydrogen bubble chamber. The event was
produced in a synchronized cyclotron on November 13, 1970. The invisible neutrino followed the dashed yellow
line and struck a proton at the point from which the three particle tracks originate. The neutrino then turned into a
muon, whose path is traced by the long blue line. The short red track, labeled “p,” follows the proton. The orange
track marks the path of a pi-meson created by the collision. In this chapter, you will learn about the basic structure
of the atomic nucleus.

22.1 Isotopes

• Deﬁne atomic number.
• Deﬁne mass number.
• State the charge and mass of a nucleus.
• Deﬁne isotopes.
• Given the atomic and mass numbers of a nuclide, ﬁnd the numbers of protons, electrons, and neutrons.

The nuclei of atoms contain protons and neutrons while electron clouds surrounding the nuclei contain the electrons.
The positively charged protons are very close together in an atomic nucleus and the repulsive force of the like charges
is tremendous. The strong force is a type of interaction that binds together protons and neutrons. Without the strong
force, the positively charged protons would blow the nucleus apart.

Isotopes

Until 1932, the positively charged nucleus of an atom was known to exist, but it was believed to contain only protons.
The nucleus was known to be surrounded by enough negatively charged electrons to make the atom electrically
neutral. Most of the atom was empty space, with its mass concentrated in the tiny nucleus.
Twelve years earlier, Lord Ernest Rutherford, a pioneer in atomic structure, had postulated the existence of a third,
neutral, sub-atomic particle, with the approximate mass of a proton, that could result from the capture of an electron
by a proton. This postulation stimulated a search for the particle. However, its electrical neutrality complicated the
search because almost all experimental techniques of this period measured charged particles.
James Chadwick bombarded hydrogen atoms in parafﬁn with beryllium emissions. By comparing the energies
of recoiling charged particles from different targets, he proved that the beryllium emissions contained a neutral
component with a mass approximately equal to that of the proton. He called it the neutron in a paper published in
1932.

Since the identiﬁcation of the neutron, the model of the atomic nucleus has changed very little. According to this
model, a nucleus is considered to be an aggregate of protons and neutrons. A proton has a positive charge of 1.6×
10−19 C and a mass of 1.673× 10−27 kg. The neutron is electrically neutral and has a mass of 1.675× 10−27 kg.
These two constituents of a nucleus are referred to collectively as nucleons.
Although the hydrogen nucleus consists of a single proton, the nuclei of all other elements contain both neutrons
and protons. The different types of nuclei are referred to as nuclides. The number of protons in a nucleus is called
the atomic number and is designated by the symbol Z. The total number of nucleons, neutrons and protons, is
designated by the symbol A and is called the mass number. A nuclide with 7 protons and 8 neutrons thus has Z = 7
and A = 15. The number of neutrons, N, is N = A−Z. To specify a given nuclide, we need give only A and Z. These
can be shown in a complete nuclear symbol which takes the form

A
ZX

where X is the chemical symbol for the element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number. For example, a
nitrogen nucleus containing 7 protons and 8 neutrons would be 15
7 N. Since all nitrogen atoms have 7 protons in their
nucleus, sometimes the 7 is omitted and the symbol is written simply as 15N. This same nuclide is also sometimes
written as nitrogen-15.
The identity of an atom is determined by the number of protons in the nucleus. All hydrogen atoms must have
exactly 1 proton in the nucleus. The number of neutrons in the nuclei of atoms of a particular element, however,
may vary. For example, a hydrogen atom will always have 1 proton, but may have zero, one, or two neutrons in the
nucleus - as long as it has 1 proton, it is a hydrogen atom.
Nuclei that have the same number of protons in the nucleus but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes.
Hydrogen has three isotopes.

1
1H

2
1H

3
1H

One isotope of hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons in the nucleus so it has a mass number of 1. Another isotope
of hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 neutron in the nucleus so it has a mass number of 2. The third isotope of hydrogen
has 1 proton and 2 neutrons in the nucleus so it has a mass number of 3. (The isotope of hydrogen with a mass
number of 2 is sometimes called deuterium and the isotope of hydrogen with a mass number of 3 is sometimes
called tritium, but they are all hydrogen.) Carbon has six isotopes; carbon-11, carbon-12, carbon-13, carbon-14,
carbon-15, and carbon-16. The isotopes of a given element are not all equally abundant. For example, 98.9% of all
naturally occurring carbon is carbon-12 and about 1.1% is carbon-13. The other isotopes of carbon are even less
abundant.
The periodic table is a complete listing of all the known elements.
Each element has its own square in the periodic table. The square contains the chemical symbol for the element, the
atomic number, and the atomic weight. The atomic weight of an element is a weighted average of its isotopes.

• Deﬁne binding energy and its relationship to nuclear force.
• Describe nuclear disintegration.
• Deﬁne three modes of radioactive decay and write balanced nuclear equations for all three.

The machines in the image are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs). These are small nuclear reactors used for the
generation of power. Primarily the nuclear energy is used to change water into steam and the steam then runs the
machinery. Several hundred PWRs are used for propulsion in military vessels such as aircraft carriers, submarines,
and ice breakers. These nuclear reactors were originally designed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for use as
nuclear submarine power plants.

Radioactivity

The total mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons.
This is known as mass defect. As an example of this, consider the mass of a 4
2He nucleus compared to the sum of
the masses of its constituent nucleons.
The mass of a 4
2He nucleus is 4.002603 amu. The mass of two neutrons and two protons is (2)(1.008665 amu) +
(2)(1.007825 amu) = 4.032980 amu. Thus, the mass of the helium-4 nucleus is 0.030377 amu less than the masses
of its constituents. The lost mass has gone into energy that is called binding energy. The binding energy is equal
to the amount of energy that would have to be put into the helium-4 nucleus in order to break it into its constituent
protons and neutrons. Without the binding energy, the repulsion between the protons would blow this nucleus apart.
We often refer to the average binding energy per nucleon which is deﬁned as the total binding energy of a nucleus
divided by the number of nucleons in the nucleus.

367

22.2. Radioactivity

www.ck12.org

Each nucleus, therefore, has competing forces. The repulsive force between the protons tends to blow the nucleus
apart and the binding energy tends to hold the nucleus together. If the average binding energy per nucleon overcomes
the repulsion, the nucleus stays together and it referred to as stable. If the repulsion overcomes the average binding
energy per nucleon, the nucleus may blow apart or undergo nuclear disintegration. When a nucleus disintegrates,
it throws off pieces of itself and energy in the form of gamma rays. This disintegration process came to be called
radioactivity.
Early researchers in radioactivity found that the emissions from radioactivity could be classiﬁed into three distinct
types according to their penetrating power. One type of radiation could barely penetrate a sheet of paper. The second
type could pass through as much as 3 mm of aluminum. The third type was extremely penetrating and could pass
through several centimeters of lead. They named these three types of radiation alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma
(γ) respectively. Eventually, each type of radiation was further identiﬁed. Alpha particles are the nuclei of helium
atoms, 4
2He. Beta particles are electrons, and gamma rays are very high energy photons (even higher energy than
x-rays).
When a nucleus emits an α particle, the remaining particle will contain two less protons and two less neutrons. The
new particle will have an atomic number two less and a mass number four less than the original nuclide.

The symbol 0−1e represents an electron whose charge corresponds to Z = −1 and since it has no nucleons, A = 0. It
must be carefully noted that the electron released during beta decay is NOT an orbital electron but an electron whose
origin was in the nucleus. The process has one neutron becoming one proton and one electron and the electron being
emitted as a beta particle. Since a neutron has been lost AND a proton has been gained, the mass number does not
change. The atomic number, however, has increased one due to the gain of a proton. Therefore, as a result of beta
decay, the daughter product will have the same mass number as the parent and an atomic number one greater than
the parent.

neutrons. This is known as mass defect.

22.3 Nuclear Reactions

• Write correct equations for nuclear reactions.
• Deﬁne half-life.
• Calculate amount of material remaining after a given number of half-lives.

Operation Castle was a series of nuclear tests that the United States conducted in 1954 in the Bikini and Enewetok
atolls in the Marshall Islands of the Paciﬁc. The purpose of the tests was to validate the designs of different
thermonuclear weapons.

Nuclear Reactions

In all nuclear reactions, the total of the atomic numbers on the left side of the equation must equal the total of the
atomic numbers on the right side of the equation. Furthermore, the sum of the mass numbers on the left of the
equation must equal the sum of the mass numbers on the right of the equation. In addition to alpha and beta decay,
there are a number of other types of nuclear reactions. Bombardment of nuclei with alpha particles or neutrons can
often produce a nuclear reaction. Consider the bombardment of nitrogen-14 by an alpha particle,

Large unstable nuclei often become more stable by breaking into smaller pieces. The breakup of a larger nucleus
into two or more smaller nuclei is called ﬁssion. Small nuclei often become more stable by joining together to form
larger nuclei. This process is called fusion.

The disintegration of unstable nuclei does not occur all at once. The rate of disintegration is a statistical process. The
most convenient way to consider it is by a concept known as half-life. The time required for half of the atoms in any
given quantity of a radioactive substance to decay is the half-life of that element. Each particular isotope has its own
half-life. For example, the half-life of radium-226 is 1600 years. That is, beginning with 1.00 gram of radium-226,
it would take 1600 years for half of it to decay and leave 0.50 gram remaining. After another 1600 years, only 0.25
gram would remain. In each half-life, exactly half of the beginning amount decays.

22.4 Quarks

• Describe the quark content of the proton and neutron.
• Describe the additional quarks in the quark model.

The ﬁrst suggestion of the existence of quarks was presented in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig.
They suggested that protons and neutrons were composed of three quarks called up (u), down (d), and strange (s).
A fourth quark was hypothesized just for reasons of symmetry and the name “charm” was suggested for the fourth
quark by Sheldon Glashow and James Bkorken. The ﬁrst evidence for quarks was produced by an experiment in the
Stanford Linear Accelerator by James Bkorken and Richard Feynman in 1968. In 1974, Burton Richter and Samuel
Ting, separately, announce on the same day that they discovered the same new particle. Ting and his collaborators
at Brookhaven called this particle the “J” particle, whereas Richter and his collaborators at SLAC called this particle
the psi particle. Since the discoveries are given equal weight, the particle is commonly known as the J/psi particle.
The J/psi particle is a charm-anti-charm meson. After eighteen years of searching at many accelerators, experiments
at Fermilab in 1995 discovered the top quark.

Quarks

When the atomic theory was ﬁrst suggested, the atoms were considered to be indivisible. Sometime later, it
was determined that, in fact, atoms were not indivisible but had component parts, namely protons, neutrons, and

373

22.4. Quarks

www.ck12.org

electrons. At the time those particles were hypothesized, they were considered to be indivisible, having no smaller
parts. In 1964, it was ﬁrst suggested that protons and neutrons do have smaller component parts, namely quarks.
The quark model was accepted very slowly because quarks had not been observed and weren’t all observed until
1995. The known quarks are divided into three families, low energy, medium energy, and high energy.

Particles that are composed of three quarks are called baryons. The two best known baryons are protons and
neutrons. A proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark (uud). The charge on the proton is the result

of adding the charges on these quarks(cid:0)+ 2
quarks (udd). The charge on the neutron is the result of adding the charges on these quarks(cid:0)+ 2

3 = 0(cid:1).

Everyday objects are made up of quarks from the lowest energy family, namely up and down quarks. Quarks in the
middle energy family are found in cosmic rays and are produced in particle accelerators. Particles in the high energy
family are believed to have existed brieﬂy during the earliest moments of the Big Bang and are created only in high
energy collisions.

• The known quarks are divided into three families, low energy, medium energy, and high energy.

22.5 Nuclear Reactors

• Identify the uranium isotope that is ﬁssionable.
• Trace the energy transfers that occur in a nuclear power plant from the energy released in a nuclear reaction to

the electricity that leaves the plant.

• Deﬁne a breeder reactor.

There are many applications of radioactivity. The applications range from scientiﬁc research in physics, medicine,
and agriculture to industrial measuring, nuclear weapons, and electricity generation. The particular application
shown in the photo is the USS Newport News Attack Nuclear Submarine. In terms of nuclear fuel supply, the USS
Newport News leaves port with sufﬁcient fuel to remain underwater for 20 years.
In nuclear naval vessels, the
nuclear reaction produces steam and the steam then runs the ship.

Fission Reactors

A nuclear reactor is a device in which a nuclear chain reaction is carried out at a controlled rate. When the controlled
chain reaction is a ﬁssion reaction, the reactor is called a ﬁssion reactor. Fission reactors are used primarily for the
production of electricity, although there are a few ﬁssion reactors used for military purposes and for research. The
great majority of electrical generating systems all follow a reasonably simple design. The nuclear reaction boils
water into steam, the steam is used to spin a turbine, and the turbine turns an electrical generator. After the water is
turned into steam, the sequence in a fossil fuel generating plant and a nuclear generating plant are approximately the
same. Of course, with the nuclear plant, the reaction chamber must be inside a containment building.

Fissionable Fuel

Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235
(1%). It is the uranium-235 that is ﬁssionable (will undergo ﬁssion) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than

376

Chapter 22. The Nucleus

can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased
to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the
two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by
chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The
only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated
by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass.
Once the supply of U-235 is acquired, it is placed in a series of long cylindrical tubes called fuel rods. These fuel
cylinders are bundled together with control rods (see diagram below) made of neutron-absorbing material. The
amount of heat generated by the chain reaction is controlled by the rate at which the nuclear reaction occurs. The
rate of the nuclear reaction is dependent on how many neutrons are emitted by one U-235 nuclear disintegration and
how many strike a new U-235 nucleus to cause another disintegration. The purpose of the control rods is to absorb
some of the neutrons and thus stop them from causing further disintegrations. The control rods can be raised or
lowered into the fuel rod bundle. When the control rods are lowered all the way into the fuel rod bundle, they absorb
so many neutrons that the chain reaction essentially stops. When more heat is desired, the control rods are raised so
that the chain reaction speeds up and more heat is generated. The control rods are operated in a fail-safe system so
that power is necessary to hold them up. During a power failure, gravity will pull the control rods down to shut off
the system.

U-235 nuclei can capture neutrons and disintegrate more efﬁciently if the neutrons are moving slower than the speed
at which they are released. Fission reactors use a moderator surrounding the fuel rods to slow down the neutrons.
Water is not only a good coolant but also a good moderator, so a common type of ﬁssion reactor has the fuel core
submerged in a huge pool of water. This type of reactor is called a light water reactor or LWR. All public electricity
generating ﬁssion reactors in the United States are LWRs.

You can follow the operation of an electricity-generating ﬁssion reactor in the image above. The reactor core is
submerged in a pool of water. The heat from the ﬁssion reaction heats the water, which is pumped into a heat
exchange container. There the heated water boils the water in the heat exchanger. The produced steam is forced
through a turbine that spins a generator and produces electricity. After the water passes through the turbine, it is
condensed back to liquid water and pumped back to the heat exchanger.

94Pu

92U → 0−1e + 239

U-235 is the only naturally occurring ﬁssile isotope, and it constitutes less than 1% of naturally occurring uranium.
A ﬁssile substance is a substance capable of sustaining a chain reaction of nuclear ﬁssion. It has been projected that
the world’s supply of U-235 will be exhausted in less than 200 years. It is possible, however, to convert U-238 to a
ﬁssionable isotope that will function as a fuel for nuclear reactors. The ﬁssionable isotope is plutonium-239 and is
produced by the following series of reactions:
93Np → 0−1e + 239
92U + 1
238
The ﬁnal product from this series of reactions is plutonium-239, which has a half-life of 24,000 years and is another
nuclear reactor fuel. This series of reactions can be made to occur inside an operating nuclear reactor by replacing
some of the control rods with rods of U-238. As the nuclear decay process proceeds inside the reactor, it produces
more fuel than it uses. It would take about 20 such breeder reactors to produce enough fuel to operate one additional
reactor. The use of breeder reactors would extend the fuel supply a hundred fold. The problem with breeder
reactors, however, is that plutonium is an extremely deadly poison. Furthermore, unlike ordinary ﬁssion reactors, it
is possible for out-of-control breeder reactors to explode. None of the civilian nuclear power plants in the U.S. are
breeder reactors.

• LWR: the light water reactor (LWR) is a type of nuclear reactor that uses normal water, as opposed to heavy
water, as its coolant and neutron moderator and a solid compound of ﬁssile element as its fuel. Light water
reactors are the most common type of nuclear reactor.

• PWR: Pressurized water reactors (PWRs) constitute the large majority of all Western nuclear power plants. A
PWR is one of three types of LWRs. In a PWR, the primary coolant (water) is pumped under high pressure to
the reactor core where it is heated by the energy generated by the ﬁssion of atoms. The heated water then ﬂows
to a steam generator where it transfers its thermal energy to a secondary system where steam is generated and
ﬂows to turbines which, in turn, spin an electric generator.

Atoms of the same element always have the same number of protons in their nuclei, but they may have differing
numbers of electrons or neutrons. Radioactivity is the result of nuclear decay and the emission of subatomic particles.
Quarks are the smallest particles known to date; they are the building blocks of the primary subatomic particles.
Nuclear reactors can release vast quantities of energy by harnessing the interactions of atomic nuclei.

The Atom

Illustrated above is a spectrum tube containing helium. The light stripes to the right are the individual frequencies
of light emitted by helium atoms. The color of the tube is the result of the eye mixing all the individual frequencies
together. When electric current is passed through a tube ﬁlled with the gaseous atoms of an individual element, light
is emitted. In the illustration above, the pinkish-colored tube on the left is a tube ﬁlled with gaseous helium, which
has electric current passing through. When the light from this tube is passed through a prism, the light is separated
into the individual frequencies that compose it. The spectrum of light from helium atoms contains around 9 separate
frequencies. All helium samples emit exactly the same frequencies when excited. The frequencies emitted by the
various elements are so speciﬁc that the spectra can be used to identify the element involved. It was these emissions
of speciﬁc frequencies from atoms that led to the Bohr model of the atom and its successor, the quantum mechanical
model. This chapter will investigate the historical development of the model of the atom.

• Calculate energy levels.
• Describe the shortcomings of the Bohr model of the atom.

The gold foil experiment was conducted under the supervision of Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester
in 1909 by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. The popular theory of atomic structure at the time of Rutherford’s
experiment was the “plum pudding model.” This theory held that the negatively charged electrons in an atom were
ﬂoating in a sea of positive charge (the electrons playing the role of plums in a bowl of plum pudding). Rutherford’s
gold foil experiment demonstrated that almost all of the mass of an atom is in a tiny volume in the center of the atom
which Rutherford called the nucleus. This positively charged mass was responsible for deﬂecting alpha particles
propelled through the gold foil. Rutherford’s “nuclear model” of the atom replaced the plum pudding model in
1911.

The Bohr Model of the Atom

Early History of the Atom

Hypotheses concerning the existence of atoms as indivisible particles were known as early as the ancient Greek
philosophers Democritus and Epicurus. The concepts of atoms that prevailed in the 17th and 18th centuries were
poorly deﬁned. Some scientists supposed that atoms could combine into more complex particles but speciﬁc
chemical and physical properties were not attributed to atoms. In the period 1780-1803, Lavoisier made careful
quantitative measurements which allowed the compositions of compounds to be determined accurately, Proust es-
tablished the Law of Deﬁnite Proportions (each compound always contained the same proportions of elements), and
John Dalton had developed the Law of Simple Proportions (compounds composed of the same elements contained
simple multiples of component elements). These laws provided a solid foundation for a more thorough atomic
theory.

Dalton’s Atomic Theory

John Dalton developed his atomic theory in 1803. Dalton’s theory was different from previous discussions of
atoms because it had the weight of careful chemical measurements behind it. Dalton’s theory went beyond just

383

23.1. The Bohr Model of the Atom

www.ck12.org

a philosophical statement that there are atoms. Dalton’s theory proposed a number of basic ideas: 1) All matter is
composed of indivisible, tiny particles called atoms, 2) atoms can neither be created nor destroyed, 3) all atoms of the
same element are identical (have the same mass), 4) elements differ from one another because they have different
types of atoms (different mass), 5) compounds are composed of combinations of different elements because the
atoms of different elements are bonded to one another, and 6) chemical reactions occur when atoms in compounds
are rearranged.
Dalton’s theory did not convince everyone immediately. It did convince a number of chemists right away but several
decades were required for all opposition to cease. Dalton’s theory underwent a number of modiﬁcations in the next
150 years but many of its ideas are still part of the modern atomic theory. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev ascertained
that there were groups of elements which had the same (or very similar) chemical properties, the same valence, and
similar physical properties and showed that the chemical and physical properties of the elements were periodically
repeated. His periodic table remains a major idea in chemistry today.

Discovery of Electrons and Radioactivity

During the investigation of the ﬂow of electric current through gases, scientists discovered rays that were emitted
from a cathode discharge tube and had the property of being deﬂected in electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
It was
determined that these rays consisted of rapidly moving, negatively charged particles called electrons. It was also
determined that upon heating or illumination by light, metals emitted electrons. Logically, neutral atoms containing
electrons must also contain positively charged particles. Thus, the indivisibility of the atom was disproved. This
was further emphasized by Marie Curie’s discoveries that through alpha and beta decay, atoms of one element
could transmute into other elements. Curie’s discoveries also determined that atoms of the same element may have
different masses (isotopes) and thus the idea that all the atoms of the same element are identical was also lost.

Rutherford’s Planetary Model of the Atom

Now that it was known that the atom had component parts, a new model was needed. In the model proposed by J.
J. Thomson in 1903, the atom was represented as a positively charged sphere with the negatively charged electrons
distributed around the exterior. This was the so-called “plum-pudding” model with the positive charge playing the
role of the pudding and the electrons playing the role of the plums. The next big step in the development of the
model of the atom occurred in 1911 with Rutherford’s gold foil experiment. In the Thomson model of the atom, the
density of the atom was necessarily small. The mass of the atom divided by the volume of the atom and assuming
an even distribution of mass resulted in a low density for the atom.
In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium compounds emitted penetrating rays, some of which were mas-
sive, high speed, positively charged particles which were later named alpha particles (α). These alpha particles
would be detected by a zinc sulﬁde coated screen (scintillation counter) that emitted a small ﬂash of light every
time an alpha particle hit it. Rutherford used these alpha particles and the zinc sulﬁde coated screen in his gold
foil experiment. The alpha particles were ﬁred at a very thin sheet of gold foil. It was thought that all of the alpha
particles would pass straight through the gold foil with no deﬂection. This was because the alpha particles were
known to be very dense and, due to the “plum pudding” model of the atom where the mass of the atom was spread
out evenly over the volume of the atom, the atoms of gold were thought to have very low density.
While the great majority of the alpha particles did pass straight through the foil with no deﬂection, to everyone’s
surprise, some alpha particles were deﬂected. In fact, some alpha were bounced almost straight backward by the
foil. Rutherford, using Coulomb’s law and Newton’s laws found that the results could be explained only if all the
positive charge of the atom were concentrated in a tiny, central core, now called the nucleus. Rutherford’s model of
the atom is therefore, called the nuclear model of the atom. All of the positive charge and essentially all of the mass
of the atom are in its nucleus. The atom is 10,000 times as large as the nucleus and is mostly empty space. It was
known that electrons are outside the nucleus but how the electrons were arranged in an atom was still a mystery.

Problems with the Planetary Model

The planetary model had two major problems immediately. According to classical mechanics, a charged particle
being accelerated (speeding up, slowing down, or turning a corner) would always emit electromagnetic radiation.
That means that an orbiting electron would constantly emit energy and thus move closer to the nucleus until
eventually it would collapse into the nucleus. Clearly this doesn’t happen and thus it opposes the idea that electrons
move like planets. The second problem was that atoms gain energy (in the form of heat or light) and re-emit the
energy in an exact set of light frequencies. The magnitude of the energy involved in this light emission is too small to
be involved with nuclear changes and therefore, the electron conﬁguration must be responsible for the light emission
by atoms. The planetary model offered no explanation for the light spectrum of atoms.

A major clue to the electron arrangement in an atom came from studying the light emitted by atoms. When electricity
is passed through gaseous atoms, the atoms emit a spectrum of light that is speciﬁc for that element. The hydrogen
atom, for example, emits a pinkish light but when that light is passed through a prism, we see a very few frequencies
of light that are quite speciﬁc for hydrogen. The energies of these light frequencies is much too small to be involved in
the nucleus of atoms, therefore, any explanation of these wavelengths would have to involve the electron arrangement
in atoms.

The Bohr Model of the Atom

Niels Bohr attempted to join the nuclear model of the atom with Einstein’s quantum theory of light and with his own
idea of electron energy levels to explain the electron arrangement within the atom. Bohr started with the planetary
model of electron arrangement but postulated that electrons in stable orbits would not radiate energy even though the
electrons were being accelerated by traveling in circular paths. Bohr hypothesized that the electrons were organized
into stepwise energy levels within the electron cloud and only radiated energy when the electrons moved from one
energy level to another. Bohr’s hypothesis suggested that the energy of atomic electrons came in packages and only
whole packages could be absorbed or emitted. This quantization of energy allowed electrons to only absorb or emit
exact amounts of energy to move from one energy level to another.
The quantization of energy is not apparent in everyday experience. If we could observe molecular sized automobiles
traveling down miniature roads, we would see cars traveling at 7 miles per hour, or 14 miles per hour, or 21 miles
per hour, but never at 9 or 17 miles per hour. The quantization of energy means that energy comes in packages and
when energy is added to an object, whole packets of energy must be added. This is the explanation for why atomic
electrons are only allowed to have certain amounts of energy and therefore, occupy certain energy levels. The lowest
energy level for an electron is near the nucleus and each quanta of energy added moves the electron to the next
distant energy level. Einstein’s theory says that each light photon has an energy of h f , where h is Planck’s constant,

385

23.1. The Bohr Model of the Atom

www.ck12.org

and f is the frequency. The emission of a photon of light from an atom indicates a change in energy level for an
electron such that
h f = Ehigher − Elower.
The energy of an orbit is related to the inverse of the square of the orbit number. The energy of an electron in a given
energy level of hydrogen is calculated by

En = (−2.17× 10−18 J)(cid:0) 1

(cid:1).

n2

The radius of an orbit is related to the square of the orbit number.
Bohr calculated allowed electron energy levels for the hydrogen atom and found the emission spectrum of hydrogen
to match perfectly with particular electron transitions between his suggested energy levels. Other electron transitions
predicted electromagnetic frequencies outside the visible range and when those were looked for, they were present
and also matched precisely with theoretical calculations.
Example Problem: For the hydrogen atom, determine

a. the energy of the innermost energy level (n = 1).
b. the energy of the second energy level.
c. the difference between the ﬁrst and second energy levels.

Solution:

a. En = (−2.17× 10−18 J)(cid:0) 1
b. En = (−2.17× 10−18 J)(cid:0) 1

(cid:1) = −2.17× 10−18 J
(cid:1) = −5.43× 10−19 J

c. E2−1 = (−5.43× 10−19 J)− (−2.17× 10−18 J) = 1.63× 10−18 J

22

This is the amount of energy that would need to be added to a 1st energy level electron to raise it to the second energy
level.
Example Problem: According to the Bohr model, how many times larger is the second level hydrogen orbit
compared to the ﬁrst level hydrogen orbit?
Solution: 4 times

Erwin Schrödinger (1887 – 1961) was an Austrian physicist who achieved fame for his contributions to quantum
mechanics, especially the Schrödinger equation, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1933. His development
of what is known as Schrödinger’s wave equation was made during the ﬁrst half of 1926. It came as a result of his
dissatisfaction with the quantum condition in Bohr’s orbit theory and his belief that atomic spectra should really be
determined by some kind of discrete energy value.

The Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom

Most deﬁnitions of quantum theory and quantum mechanics offer the same description for both. These deﬁnitions
essentially describe quantum theory as a theory in which both energy and matter have characteristics of waves under
some conditions and characteristics of particles under other conditions.
Quantum theory suggests that energy comes in discrete packages called quanta (or, in the case of electromagnetic
radiation, photons). Quantum theory has some mathematical development, often referred to as quantum mechanics,
that offers explanations for the behavior of electrons inside the electron clouds of atoms.
The wave-particle duality of electrons within the electron cloud limits our ability to measure both the energy and
the position of an electron simultaneously. The more accurately we measure either the energy or the position of

388

www.ck12.org

Chapter 23. The Atom

an electron, the less we know about the other. Our fact that we cannot accurately know both the position and the
momentum of an electron at the same time causes an inability to predict a trajectory for an electron. Consequently,
electron behavior is described differently than the behavior of normal sized particles. The trajectory that we normally
associate with macroscopic objects is replaced for electrons in electron clouds, with statistical descriptions that show,
not the electron path, but the region where it is most likely to be found. Since it is the electron in the electron cloud
of an atom that determines its chemical behavior, the quantum mechanics description of electron conﬁguration is
necessary to understanding chemistry.
The most common way to describe electrons in atoms according to quantum mechanics is to solve the Schrodinger
equation for the energy states of the electrons within the electron cloud. When the electron is in these states, its
energy is well-deﬁned but its position is not. The position is described by a probability distribution map called an
orbital.
Schrodinger’s equation is shown below.

where i is the imaginary number,
¯h is Planck’s constant divided by 2π
ψ (r,t) is the wave function
m is the mass of the particle
∇2 is the Laplacian operator, ∂2
V (r,t) is the potential energy inﬂuencing the particle
It should be quite clear that without years of high level mathematics, just seeing the equation is no value at all.
Without understanding the math, the equation makes no sense.
The stable energy levels for an electron in an electron cloud are those that have integer values in three positions in
the equation. Schrodinger found that having integer values in these three places in the equation produced a wave
function that described a standing wave. These three integers are called quantum numbers and are represented by
the letters n, l, and m.
Solutions to Schrödinger’s equation involve four special numbers called quantum numbers. (Three of the numbers,
n, l, and m, come from Schrödinger’s equation, and the fourth one comes from an extension of the theory). These
four numbers completely describe the energy of an electron. Each electron has exactly four quantum numbers, and
no two electrons have the same four numbers. The statement that no two electrons can have the same four quantum
numbers is known as the Pauli exclusion principle.
The principal quantum number, n, is a positive integer (1,2,3, . . .n) that indicates the main energy level of an electron
within an atom. According to quantum mechanics, every principal energy level has one or more sub-levels within
it. The number of sub-levels in a given energy level is equal to the number assigned to that energy level. That is,
principal energy level 1 will have 1 sub-level, principal energy level 2 will have two sub-levels, principal energy
level 3 will have three sub-levels, and so on. In any energy level, the maximum number of electrons possible is 2n2.
Therefore, the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the ﬁrst energy level is 2(2× 12). For energy level 2,
the maximum number of electrons is 8(2× 22), and for the 3rd energy level, the maximum number of electrons is
18(2×32). The Table 23.1 lists the number of sub-levels and electrons for the ﬁrst four principal quantum numbers.

The largest known atom contains slightly more than 100 electrons. Quantum mechanics sets no limit as to how
many energy levels exist, but no more than 7 principal energy levels are needed to describe all the electrons of all the
known atoms. Each energy level can have as many sub-levels as the principal quantum number, as discussed above,
and each sub-level is identiﬁed by a letter. Beginning with the lowest energy sub-level, the sub-levels are identiﬁed
by the letters s, p, d, f , g, h, i, and so on. Every energy level will have an s sub-level, but only energy levels 2
and above will have p sub-levels. Similarly, d sub-levels occur in energy level 3 and above, and f sub-levels occur
in energy level 4 and above. Energy level 5 could have a ﬁfth sub-energy level named g, but all the known atoms
can have their electrons described without ever using the g sub-level. Therefore, we often say there are only four
sub-energy levels, although theoretically there can be more than four sub-levels.
The principal energy levels and sub-levels are shown in the following diagram. The principal energy levels and
sub-levels that we use to describe electrons are in red. The energy levels and sub-levels in black are theoretically
present but are never used for known atoms.

The sub-energy levels are identiﬁed by the azimuthal quantum number, l.
When the azimuthal quantum number l = 0, the sub-level = s.
When the azimuthal quantum number l = 1, the sub-level = p.
When the azimuthal quantum number l = 2, the sub-level = d.
When the azimuthal quantum number l = 3, the sub-level = f .
Quantum mechanics also tells us how many orbitals are in each sub-level. In Bohr’s model, an orbit was a circular
path that the electron followed around the nucleus. In quantum mechanics, an orbital is deﬁned as an area in the
electron cloud where the probability of ﬁnding the electron is high. The number of orbitals in an energy level is
equal to the square of the principal quantum number. Hence, energy level 1 will have 1 orbital (12), energy level 2
will have 4 orbitals (22), energy level 3 will have 9 orbitals (32), and energy level 4 will have 16 orbitals (42).
The s sub-level has only one orbital. Each of the p sub-levels has three orbitals. The d sub-levels have ﬁve orbitals,
and the f sub-levels have seven orbitals. If we wished to assign the number of orbitals to the unused sub-levels, g
would have nine orbitals and h would have eleven. You might note that the number of orbitals in the sub-levels
increases by odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9,11, . . .). As a result, the single orbital in energy level 1 is the s orbital. The

four orbitals in energy level 2 are a single 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. The nine orbitals in energy level 3 are a
single 3s orbital, three 3p orbitals, and ﬁve 3d orbitals. The sixteen orbitals in energy level 4 are the single 4s orbital,
three 4p orbitals, ﬁve 4d orbitals, and seven 4 f orbitals.

The Table 23.2 shows the relationship between n (the principal quantum number), the number of orbitals, and the
maximum number of electrons in a principal energy level. Theoretically, the number of orbitals and number of
electrons continue to increase for higher values of n. However, no atom actually has more than 32 electrons in any
of its principal levels.
Each orbital will also have a probability pattern that is determined by interpreting Schrödinger’s equation. The 3-
dimensional probability pattern for the single orbital in the s sub-level is a sphere. The probability patterns for the
three orbitals in the p sub-levels are shown below. The three images on the left show the probability pattern for the
three p orbitals in each of the three dimensions. On the far right is an image of all three p orbitals together. These p
orbitals are said to be shaped like dumbbells (named after the objects weight lifters use), water wings (named after
the ﬂoating balloons young children use in the swimming pool), and various other objects.

The probability patterns for the ﬁve d orbitals are more complicated and are shown below.

391

The seven f orbitals shown below are even more complicated.

You should keep in mind that no matter how complicated the probability pattern is, each shape represents a single
orbital, and the entire probability pattern is the result of the various positions that either one or two electrons can
take.

23.3 Lasers

• Describe a laser and the properties of laser light.

An U. S. Air Force scientist operates a laser in a test environment. The United States Air Force Research Laboratory
(AFRL) conducts research on a variety of solid-state and chemical lasers. Most types of laser are an inherently
pure source of light; they emit near-monochromatic light with a very well deﬁned range of wavelengths. By careful
design of the laser components, the purity of the laser light can be improved more than the purity of any other light
source. Lasers are used in spectroscopy, range ﬁnding, photochemistry, and microscopy. Military uses for lasers
may include target designation, communications, and directed energy weapons.

Laser

Light is emitted by atoms that have been excited by thermal excitation, electron collision, or collisions with photons
of exactly the right frequency. Light is emitted by an incandescent source at many different wavelengths and
in all directions. Light produced by an atomic gas consists of only a few different wavelengths but still in all
directions. Both of these light sources produce light waves that are not in step or at the same point in their cycle.
Groups of light waves that are not at the same point in their cycle are called incoherent light.
Einstein considered what would happen to an atom already in an excited state that is struck by another photon of the
same energy as the original photon that put the atom in the excited state. He showed that the atom will emit a photon
of the same energy and go to a lower state. This process is called stimulated emission. The two photons leaving
the atom will not only have the same wavelength, they will also be in step (at the same point in their cycle). Either
of the two photons can now strike other excited atoms and produce additional photons that are also in step. This
group of light rays are called coherent light. A device that produces such light was invented in 1959 and is called a
laser. The word laser is an acronym. It stands for Light Ampliﬁcation by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
A continuous electric discharge like that in a neon sign can be used to put atoms in the excited state. The laser light
resulting from this process is continuous rather than pulsed. The helium-neon lasers often seen in science classrooms

394

www.ck12.org

Chapter 23. The Atom

and used as laser pointers are continuous lasers. The photons emitted by the atoms are collected by placing the glass
tube containing the atoms between two parallel mirrors. One mirror reﬂects all the light striking it while the other
mirror allows some small percentage of the light to pass through. The light which passes out of the tube produces
the laser beam.
Laser light is highly directional because of the parallel mirrors. The laser beam is very small, typically around 1
2 mm
in diameter. The light is monochromatic, coherent, and very intense. The concentrated power of laser light is used
in a variety of ways. In medicine, lasers can be used to repair the retina in an eye. Lasers can also be used in surgery
in place of a knife to cut ﬂesh with little loss of blood (the laser cauterizes as it cuts). In industry, lasers are used to
cut steel and to weld materials together. Lasers may, in the future, be used to start nuclear fusion reactions.

One of the most recognized constellations is Orion, with its three prominent belt stars and four stars in the trapezium.
This constellation can be seen at night ascending in the east, visible from all parts of the globe. In November of 2012,
an international team of astrophysicists announced the result of their work in computer modeling, which suggests
that a famous nebula –or cloud –in Orion known as the Orion Nebula has a black hole at its heart, whose mass is
some 200 times the mass of our sun.

The History of Astronomy

Astronomy and the Ancient Greeks

The Astronomy of the ancient Greeks was linked to mathematics, and Greek astronomers sought to create geomet-
rical models that could imitate the appearance of celestial motions. This tradition originated around the 6th century
BCE, with the followers of the mathematician Pythagoras (~580 –500 BCE). Pythagoras believed that everything
was related to mathematics and that through mathematics everything could be predicted and measured in rhythmic
patterns or cycles. He placed astronomy as one of the four mathematical arts, the others being arithmetic, geometry
and music.

While best known for the Pythagorean Theorem, Pythagoras did have some input into astronomy. By the time
of Pythagoras, the ﬁve planets visible to the naked eye - Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - had long
been identiﬁed. The names of these planets were initially derived from Greek mythology before being given the
equivalent Roman mythological names, which are the ones we still use today. The word ’planet’ is a Greek term
meaning ’wanderer’, as these bodies move across the sky at different speeds from the stars, which appear ﬁxed in
the same positions relative to each other.

For part of the year Venus appears in the eastern sky as an early morning object before disappearing and reappearing
a few weeks later in the evening western sky. Early Greek astronomers thought this was two different bodies and
assigned the names ’Phosphorus’ and ’Hesperus’ to the morning and evening apparitions respectively. Pythagoras
is given credit for being the ﬁrst to realize that these two bodies were in fact the same planet, a notion he arrived at
through observation and geometrical calculations.
Pythagoras was also one of the ﬁrst to think that the Earth was round, a theory that was ﬁnally proved around 330
BCE by Aristotle. (Although, as you are probably aware, many people in 1642 CE still believed the earth to be ﬂat.)
Aristotle (384 BCE –322 BCE) demonstrates in his writings that he knew we see the moon by the light of the sun,
how the phases of the moon occur, and understood how eclipses work. He also knew that the earth was a sphere.
Philosophically, he argued that each part of the earth is trying to be pulled to the center of the earth, and so the earth
would naturally take on a spherical shape. He then pointed out observations that support the idea of a spherical earth.
First, the shadow of the earth on the moon during a lunar eclipse is always circular. The only shape that always casts
a circular shadow is a sphere. Second, as one traveles more north or south, the positions of the stars in the sky
change. There are constellations visible in the north that one cannot see in the south and vice versa. He related this
to the curvature of the earth. Aristotle talked about the work of earlier Greeks, who had developed an earth centered
model of the planets. In these models, the center of the earth is the center of all the other motions. While it is not
sure if the earlier Greeks actually thought the planets moved in circles, it is clear that Aristotle did.
Aristotle rejected a moving earth for two reasons. Most importantly he didn’t understand inertia. To Aristotle,
the natural state for an object was to be at rest. He believed that it takes a force in order for an object to move.
Using Aristotle’s ideas, if the earth were moving through space, if you tripped, you would not be in contact with
the earth, and so would get left behind in space. Since this obviously does not happen, the earth must not move.
This misunderstanding of inertia confused scientists until the time of Galileo. A second, but not as important, reason
Aristotle rejected a moving earth is that he recognized that if the earth moved and rotated around the sun, there would
be an observable parallax of the stars. One cannot see stellar parallax with the naked-eye, so Aristotle concluded
that the earth must be at rest. (The stars are so far away, that one needs a good telescope to measure stellar parallax,
which was ﬁrst measured in 1838.)
Aristotle believed that the objects in the heavens are perfect and unchanging. Since he believed that the only
eternal motion is circular with a constant speed, the motions of the planets must be circular. This came to be
called “The Principal of Uniform Circular Motion.” Aristotle and his ideas became very important because they
became incorporated into the Catholic Church’s theology in the twelfth century by Thomas Aquinas. In the early
16th century, the Church banned new interpretations of scripture and this included a ban on ideas of a moving earth.
Claudius Ptolemy (90 –168 CE) was a citizen of Egypt which was under Roman rule during Ptolemy’s lifetime.
During his lifetime he was a mathematician, astronomer, and geographer. His theories dominated the world’s
understanding of astronomy for over a thousand years.
While it is known that many astronomers published works during this time, only Ptolemy’s work The Almagest
survived. In it, he outlined his geometrical reasoning for a geocentric view of the Universe. As outlined in the
Almagest, the Universe according to Ptolemy was based on ﬁve main points: 1) the celestial realm is spherical, 2)
the celestial realm moves in a circle, 3) the earth is a sphere, 4) the celestial realm orbit is a circle centered on the
earth, and 5) earth does not move. Ptolemy also identiﬁed eight circular orbits surrounding earth where the other
planets existed. In order, they were the moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the sphere of
ﬁxed stars.
A serious problem with the earth-centered system was the fact that at certain times in their orbits, some of the planets
appeared to move in the opposite direction of their normal movement. This reverse direction movement is referred
to as “ retrograde motion.” If the earth was to remain motionless at the center of the system, some very intricate
designs were necessary to explain the movement of the retrograde planets.
In the Ptolemaic system, each retrograde planet moved by two spheres.

Chapter 24. Astrophysics

The Ptolemaic system had circles within circles that produced epicycles. In the sketch above on the left, the red ball
moved clockwise in its little circle while the entire orbit also orbited clockwise around the big circle. This process
produced a path like that shown in the sketch above on the right. As the red ball moved around its path, at some
times it would be moving clockwise and then for a short period, it would move counterclockwise. This motion was
able to explain the retrograde motion noted for some planets.

Astronomy and the Late Middle Ages

It was not until 1543, when Copernicus (1473 –1543) introduced a sun-centered design ( heliocentric), that Ptolemy’s
astronomy was seriously questioned and eventually overthrown.
Copernicus studied at the University of Bologna, where he lived in the same house as the principal astronomer there.
Copernicus assisted the astronomer in some of his observations and in the production of the annual astrological
forecasts for the city. It is at Bologna that he probably ﬁrst encountered a translation of Ptolemy’s Almagest that
would later make it possible for Copernicus to successfully refute the ancient astronomer.
Later, at the University of Padua, Copernicus studied medicine, which was closely associated with astrology at that
time due to the belief that the stars inﬂuenced the dispositions of the body. Returning to Poland, Copernicus secured
a teaching post at Wroclaw, where he primarily worked as a medical doctor and manager of Church affairs. In
his spare time, he studied the stars and the planets (decades before the telescope was invented), and applied his
mathematical understanding to the mysteries of the night sky. In so doing, he developed his theory of a system in
which the Earth, like all the planets, revolved around the sun, and which simply and elegantly explained the curious
retrograde movements of the planets.
Copernicus wrote his theory in De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (“On the Revolutions of the Celestial Orbs”).
The book was completed in 1530 or so, but it wasn’t published until the year he died, 1543. It has been suggested
that Copernicus knew the publication would incur the wrath of the Catholic church and he didn’t want to deal with
problems so he didn’t publish his theory until he was on his death bed. Legend has it that a copy of the printer’s
proof was placed in his hands as he lay in a coma, and he woke long enough to recognize what he was holding before
he died.
Tycho Brahe (1546 –1601) was born in a part of southern Sweden that was part of Denmark at the time. While
attending the university to study law and philosophy, he became interested in astronomy and spent most evenings
observing the stars. One of Tycho Brahe’s ﬁrst contributions to astronomy was the detection and correction of
several serious errors in the standard astronomical tables. Then, in 1572, he discovered a supernova located in the
constellation of Cassiopeia. Tycho built his own instruments and made the most complete and accurate observations
available without the use of a telescope. Eventually, his fame led to an offer from King Frederick II of Denmark
& Norway to fund the construction of an astronomical observatory. The island of Van was chosen and in 1576,
construction began. Tycho Brahe spent twenty years there, making observations on celestial bodies.
During his life, Tycho Brahe did not accept Copernicus’ model of the universe. He attempted to combine it with
the Ptolemaic model. As a theoretician, Tycho was a failure but his observations and the data he collected was far
superior to any others made prior to the invention of the telescope. After Tycho Brahe’s death, his assistant, Johannes
Kepler used Tycho Brahe’s observations to calculate his own three laws of planetary motion.

401

24.1. The History of Astronomy

www.ck12.org

In 1600, Johannes Kepler (1571 –1630) began working as Tycho’s assistant. They recognized that neither the
Ptolemaic (geocentric) or Copernican (heliocentric) models could predict positions of Mars as accurately as they
could measure them. Tycho died in 1601 and after that Kepler had full access to Tycho’s data. He analyzed the data
for 8 years and tried to calculate an orbit that would ﬁt the data, but was unable to do so. Kepler later determined
that the orbits were not circular but elliptical.

Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion

1. The orbits of the planets are elliptical.
2. An imaginary line connecting a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal time intervals.
(Therefore, the earth’s orbital speed varies at different times of the year. The earth moves fastest in its orbit
when closest to the sun and slowest when farthest away.) Kepler’s Second Law of Planetary Motion was
calculated for Earth, then the hypothesis was tested using data for Mars, and it worked!

3. Kepler’s Third Law of Planetary Motion showed the relationship between the size of a planet’s orbit radius,
R ( 1
2 the major axis), and its orbital period, T . R2 = T 3 This law is true for all planets if you use astronomical
units (that is, distance in multiples of earth’s orbital radium and time in multiples of earth years). Kepler’s
three laws replaced the cumbersome epicycles to explain planetary motion with three mathematical laws
that allowed the positions of the planets to be predicted with accuracies ten times better than Ptolemaic or
Copernican models.

Galileo and Newton

Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy, both because of
his contributions directly to astronomy, and because of his work in physics. He provided the crucial observations that
proved the Copernican hypothesis, and also laid the foundations for a correct understanding of how objects moved
on the surface of the earth and of gravity. One could, with considerable justiﬁcation, view Galileo as the father both
of modern astronomy and of modern physics.
Galileo did not invent the telescope, but he was the ﬁrst to turn his telescope toward the sky to study the heavens
systematically. His telescope was poorer than even a cheap modern amateur telescope, but what he observed in
the heavens showed errors in Aristotle’s opinion of the universe and the worldview that it supported. Observations
through Galileo’s telescope made it clear that the “earth-centered” and “earth doesn’t move” solar system of Aristotle
was incorrect. Since church ofﬁcials had made some of Aristotle’s opinions a part of the religious views of the
church, proving Aristotle’s views to be incorrect also pointed out ﬂaws in the church.
Galileo observed four points of light that changed their positions around the planet Jupiter and he concluded that
these were moons in orbit around Jupiter. These observations showed that there were new things in the heavens that
Aristotle and Ptolemy had known nothing about. Furthermore, they demonstrated that a planet could have moons
circling it that would not be left behind as the planet moved around its orbit. One of the arguments against the
Copernican system had been that if the moon were in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun,
the Earth would leave the Moon behind as it moved around its orbit.
Galileo used his telescope to show that Venus, like the moon, went through a complete set of phases. This observation
was extremely important because it was the ﬁrst observation that was consistent with the Copernican system but not
the Ptolemaic system. In the Ptolemaic system, Venus should always be in crescent phase as viewed from the Earth
because the sun is beyond Venus, but in the Copernican system Venus should exhibit a complete set of phases over
time as viewed from the Earth because it is illuminated from the center of its orbit.
It is important to note that this was the ﬁrst empirical evidence (coming almost a century after Copernicus) that
allowed a deﬁnitive test of the two models. Until that point, both the Ptolemaic and Copernican models described
the available data. The primary attraction of the Copernican system was that it described the data in a simpler
fashion, but here ﬁnally was conclusive evidence that not only was the Ptolemaic universe more complicated, it also
was incorrect.

Chapter 24. Astrophysics

As each new observation was brought to light, increasing doubt was cast on the old views of the heavens. It also
raised the credibility issue: could the authority of Aristotle and Ptolemy be trusted concerning the nature of the
Universe if there were so many things in the Universe about which they had been unaware and/or incorrect?
Galileo’s challenge of the Church’s authority through his refutation of the Aristotelian concept of the Universe
eventually got him into deep trouble. Late in his life he was forced, under threat of torture, to publicly recant his
Copernican views and spent his last years under house arrest. Galileo’s life is a sad example of the conﬂict between
the scientiﬁc method and unquestioned authority.
Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), who was born the same year that Galileo died, would build on Galileo’s ideas to
demonstrate that the laws of motion in the heavens and the laws of motion on the earth were the same. Thus Galileo
began, and Newton completed, a synthesis of astronomy and physics in which astronomy was recognized as but a
part of physics, and that the opinions of Aristotle were almost completely eliminated from both.
Many scientists consider Newton to be a peer of Einstein in scientiﬁc thinking. Newton’s accomplishments had even
greater scope than those of Einstein. The poet Alexander Pope wrote of Newton:
Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night;
God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.
In terms of astronomy, Newton gave reasons for and corrections to Kepler’s Laws. Kepler had proposed three Laws
of Planetary motion based on Tycho Brahe’s data. These Laws were supposed to apply only to the motions of the
planets. Further, they were purely empirical, that is, they worked, but no one knew why they worked. Newton
changed all of that. First, he demonstrated that the motion of objects on the Earth could be described by three new
Laws of motion, and then he went on to show that Kepler’s three Laws of Planetary Motion were but special cases
of Newton’s three Laws when his gravitational force was postulated to exist between all masses in the Universe.
In fact, Newton showed that Kepler’s Laws of planetary motion were only approximately correct, and supplied the
quantitative corrections that with careful observations proved to be valid.

The Big Bang Theory

The Big Bang Theory is the dominant and highly supported theory of the origin of the universe. It states that the
universe began from an initial point which has expanded over billions of years to form the universe as we now know
it.
In 1922, Alexander Friedman found that the solutions to Einstein’s general relativity equations resulted in an
expanding universe. Einstein, at that time, believed in a static, eternal universe so he added a constant to his equations
to eliminate the expansion. Einstein would later call this the biggest blunder of his life.
In 1924, Edwin Hubble was able to measure the distance to observed celestial objects that were thought to be nebula
and discovered that they were so far away they were not actually part of the Milky Way (the galaxy containing our
sun). He discovered that the Milky Way was only one of many galaxies.
In 1927, Georges Lemaitre, a physicist, suggested that the universe must be expanding. Lemaitre’s theory was
supported by Hubble in 1929 when he found that the galaxies most distant from us also had the greatest red shift
(were moving away from us with the greatest speed). The idea that the most distance galaxies were moving away
from us at the greatest speed was exactly what was predicted by Lemaitre.
In 1931, Lemaitre went further with his predictions and by extrapolating backwards, found that the matter of the
universe would reach an inﬁnite density and temperature at a ﬁnite time in the past (around 15 billion years). This
meant that the universe must have begun as a small, extremely dense point of matter.
At the time, the only other theory that competed with Lemaitre’s theory was the “Steady State Theory” of Fred
Hoyle. The steady state theory predicted that new matter was created which made it appear that the universe was
expanding but that the universe was constant. It was Hoyle who coined the term “Big Bang Theory” which he used
as a derisive name for Lemaitre’s theory.

George Gamow (1904 –1968) was the major advocate of the Big Bang theory. He predicted that cosmic microwave
background radiation should exist throughout the universe as a remnant of the Big Bang. As atoms formed from
sub-atomic particles shortly after the Big Bang, electromagnetic radiation would be emitted and this radiation would
still be observable today. Gamow predicted that the expansion of the universe would cool the original radiation so
that now the radiation would be in the microwave range. The debate continued until 1965 when two Bell Telephone
scientists stumbled upon the microwave radiation with their radio telescope.

• Describe the life cycle of various size stars.

Rings of glowing gas encircling Supernova 1987A, about 179,000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud,
one of the Milky Way’s dwarf satellite galaxies.

The Life Cycle of Stars

Space may seem empty, but actually it contains thinly spread gas and dust, called interstellar medium, that
gradually collapses over immense stretches of time and collects into denser clouds of gas and dust. The atoms
of gas are mostly hydrogen and are typically about a centimeter apart. The dust is mostly carbon and silicon. In
some places, this interstellar medium is collected into particularly dense clouds of gas and dust known as a nebula.
A nebula is the birthplace of stars. Our sun was probably born in a nebula around 5 billion years ago.
Within a nebula, there are varying regions where gravity has caused the gas and dust to clump together. The
gravitational attraction of these clumps pull more atoms into the clump. As this accretion continues, the gas
pressure increases and the core of the protostar gets hotter and hotter. If the protostar gets dense enough and hot
enough, a fusion reaction will ignite and the star lights up. The minimum mass for the formation of a star is about
80 times the mass of Jupiter. A star is a very large, very hot ball of gas which has hydrogen fusing into helium in the
core. Stars spend the majority of their life fusing hydrogen into helium. When the hydrogen is nearly used up, the
star can fuse helium into heavier elements. Throughout this process, a battle goes on in the core of the star between
gravity trying to collapse the star and temperature-produced gas pressure pushing the material in the star outward.
During the life of a star, there is a balance between the gas pressure pushing out and gravity pushing in.
Once a star has achieved nuclear fusion in its core, it radiates energy into space. While the temperature-produced
gas pressure balances gravity, the star attains a stable state and enters the main sequence phase of its life. The
temperature of a main sequence star is about 15,000,000°C. For the major part of its life span, a star stays in this
main sequence phase, with hydrogen being fused into helium and a balance between force pushing out and force
pushing in.
How long a star lives depends on its initial size. Stars can live from many millions of years to many billions of
years. The most massive stars (many times the size of our sun) become extremely dense and hot in the core and

406

www.ck12.org

Chapter 24. Astrophysics

therefore, have a very high fusion rate. The largest stars use up their hydrogen fuel fastest and therefore live for the
shortest time, perhaps only millions of years. Stars that are the size of our sun fuse hydrogen much more slowly and
therefore live much longer. Medium sized stars live billions of years.
As a star begins to run low on hydrogen, since the initial quantity has been fused into the denser helium gas, the core
will contract due to gravity. The collapsing core increases temperature to the point that the star can begin to fuse
helium into carbon. When that happens, the outer portion of the star expands greatly due to the higher temperature.
The star can expand to 1000 times the diameter of the sun. At this point, the star is called a red giant. If our sun
became a red giant, its surface would expand out past the orbit of Mars. Red giants are red because the surface of
the star is cooler than white or blue stars, but remain highly visible because of their gigantic size.

After a star becomes a red giant, it will take one of several different paths to end its life. Which path is followed
by a star after the red giant phase depends on its mass. During the fusion life of a star, its size is the result of a
competition between fusion heat pushing the material out and gravity pulling the material in. At the end, gravity
always wins. After the star has lived through its red giant stage, the fusion essentially ends (the star runs out of fuel)
allowing gravity to collapse the star. Some of the outer layers of material will be blown away and the core becomes
smaller and denser. The core will become either a neutron star, a white dwarf, a black dwarf, or a black hole.
Low-mass stars (less than 0.5 times the mass of our sun) become a red giant and then blow off some outer material
which dissipates in the interstellar medium after a few hundred thousand years. The remainder of the star shrinks to
a white dwarf. After a few billion years, white dwarfs cool to become black dwarfs.
Medium-mass stars (less than 3 times the mass of our sun) become a red giants and eventually become a supernova.
A supernova is the massive explosion of a star accompanied by emission of light and matter so intense that it can
outshine an entire galaxy. After a supernove, when all the accessible fuel in a medium-mass star is exhausted,

407

24.2. The Life Cycle of a Star

www.ck12.org

the iron core collapses and proton-electron pairs are converted into neutrons. Such stars are called neutron stars.
Neutron stars might spin rapidly giving off light and X-rays or they might emit pulses of energy regularly and be
known as pulsars.
The largest-mass stars become black holes. These extremely large stars end their life in the same way as a medium-
mass star in that they become a supernova. After the outer layers are blown away in the supernova, however, the
core of the star shrinks down in volume but still has a huge mass. The density of this object is extremely high, even
denser than neutron stars. This dense object will have a gravitational force so large that not even light can escape
from the body. (A companion topic to this occurs in The General Theory of Relativity where we see than extremely
strong gravitational attraction can even attract light.) These objects appear black because light cannot leave them,
that is, they pull all light back to their surface. Black holes capture everything nearby due to their massive gravity
and so they grow in size. Black holes are a common topic for science ﬁction but keep in mind, they are simply a
very dense ball of matter with intense gravitational attraction.

Summary

• A star begins its life in a nebula, struggles to balance gravitational pull and internal pressure during its main
sequence period, and ends its life in an explosion to eventually become a white or black dwarf, or a neutron
star, or a black hole.

• interstellar medium: Material, mostly hydrogen gas, other gases, and dust, occupying the space between the

stars and providing the raw material for the formation of new stars.

• nebula: A visible, thinly spread cloud of interstellar gas and dust. Some nebulae are the remnants of a
supernova explosion, others are gravity-induced condensations of the gases in the interstellar medium which
in certain cases may become a site for the formation of new stars. The term was formerly used of any hazy,
seemingly cloud like object, including what are now recognized as other galaxies beyond the Milky Way; it is
restricted now to actual clouds of gas and dust within our own galaxy.

24.3 The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram

• Describe the stars present in each of the signiﬁcant areas on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram.

The star constellation “Orion, The Hunter”. Orion is one of the most beautiful of all constellations, and one of
the easiest to ﬁnd. It looks like a large (slightly twisted) rectangle high in winter’s south-southeastern sky. Two of
the brightest stars in the evening sky lie at opposite corners of the rectangle: bright orange-red Betelgeuse at the
northeastern corner (upper left in the photo) and even brighter Rigel at the southwest (lower right in the photo).
Betelgeuse is at least 300 times the Sun’s diameter, and perhaps much more. It puts out about 100,000 times more
energy than the Sun does. When Betelgeuse dies, it will create a ﬁreball that will brieﬂy outshine billions of normal
stars. Betelgeuse is a red giant and Rigel is a blue giant.

Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (often referred to as the H-R diagram) is a scatter graph that shows various
classes of stars in the context of properties such as their luminosity, absolute magnitude, color, and effective
temperature. Created around 1910 by Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell, the diagram provided a great
help in understanding stellar evolution.
There are several forms of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and the nomenclature is not very well deﬁned. The
original diagram displayed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the absolute magnitude on the vertical
axis. The form below shows Kelvin temperature along the horizontal axis going from high temperature on the left
to low temperature on the right and luminosity on the vertical axis. We can think of the luminosity as brightness in
multiples of the Sun. A luminosity of 100 on the axis would mean 100 times as bright as the Sun.

411

24.3. The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram

www.ck12.org

Most of the stars occupy a region in the diagram along a line called the Main Sequence. During that stage, stars are
fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. The position of the Sun in the main sequence is shown in the diagram.
You should note that the axial scales for this diagram are not linear. The vertical scale is logarithmic, each line is
100 times greater than the previous line. On the horizontal axis, as we move to the right, the temperature reduces by
between 1,000 and 10,000 degrees K between each line.
If all other factors were the same, the highest temperature stars would also be the most luminous (the brightest).
In the main sequence of stars, we see that as the temperature increases to the left, the luminosity also increases,
demonstrating that the hottest stars in this grouping are also the brightest. There are stars, however, that are less
bright than their temperature would predict. This group of stars is called white dwarfs. These stars are less bright
than expected because of their very small size. These dwarf stars are only one one-thousandth the size of stars in the
main sequence. There are also stars that are much brighter than their temperature would predict. This group of stars
are called red giants. They are brighter than their temperature would predict because they are much larger than stars
in the main sequence. These stars have expanded to several thousand times the size of stars in the main sequence.
Stars that are reddish in color are cooler than other stars while stars that are bluish in color are hotter than other stars.
A white dwarf is a stellar remnant that is very dense. A white dwarf’s mass is comparable to the Sun and its volume
is comparable to that of Earth. The very low brightness of a white dwarf comes from the emission of stored heat
energy.
White dwarfs are thought to be the ﬁnal evolutionary state of any star whose mass is not great enough to become a
neutron star. Approximately 97% of the stars in our galaxy will become neutron stars. After the hydrogen–fusing
lifetime of a main-sequence star of low or medium mass ends, it will expand to a red giant which fuses helium to
carbon and oxygen in its core. If a red giant has insufﬁcient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse
carbon, around 1 billion K, an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center. After blowing off its outer
layers to form a planetary nebula, the core will be left behind to form the remnant white dwarf. White dwarfs are
composed of carbon and oxygen.
A white dwarf is very hot when it is formed, but since it has no source of energy (no further fusion reactions), it will
gradually radiate away its energy and cool down. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool to temperatures at
which it will no longer emit signiﬁcant light, and it will become a cold black dwarf.
A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions

412

www.ck12.org

Chapter 24. Astrophysics

in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur
in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun.
When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth.
The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer
layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula
system.

Summary

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (often referred to as the H-R diagram) is a scatter graph that shows various classes
of stars in the context of properties such as their luminosity, absolute magnitude, color, and effective temperature.

Astronomy is a fantastically old science, and the accuracy of some historical observations is truly remarkable.
Stars function as immense fusion reactors, converting smaller into larger elements. All stars initially convert
hydrogen into helium, and the rate of conversion is dependent on the mass of the star. As the hydrogen is exhausted,
the increased density of star allows it to begin converting heavier elements, which releases exponentially more energy
and causes the star to expand once more. Depending on the initial mass of the star, it will end its life after millions
or billions of years as a white or brown dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole. The Hertzsprung-Russel diagram is
an image depicting the relationships between star size, color, and surface temperature.

Relativity

According to the Theory of Special Relativity, time on an object traveling near the speed of light passes more slowly
than time on a non-moving reference object. This phenomenon is called time dilation. There is an interesting
consequence of time dilation. Imagine two twins, one who stays on Earth (the non-moving reference object in this
case) while the other twin travels into space on a rocket traveling at 90% of the speed of light. After reaching some
distant point, the space-traveling twin immediately turns around and returns to Earth. If the trip covered a distance
of 4.3 light-years, the stay-at-home twin would perceive the trip as having taken 9.6 years on his normal clock. The
traveling twin would ﬁnd, however, that the trip according to his watch (having undergone acceleration and high
velocity) has taken only 4.0 years. The closer one gets to the speed of light, the slower time moves and the less one
ages. Therefore, when the traveling twin returns home, he will ﬁnd that his twin brother has aged 5.6 years more
than he has. In this chapter, you will come face-to-face with Einstein’s theories of relativity and some of the very
strange conclusions resulting from it.

The Theory of Special Relativity

The theory of relativity refers to two different elements of the same theory: special relativity and general relativity.
The theory of special relativity was ﬁrst introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905 and was later (1916) considered to
be a special case of the more comprehensive theory of general relativity.
The special theory of relativity was accepted reasonably quickly by physicists considering that it was introduced
in 1905 and widely accepted by 1920. The theory of general relativity was not accepted as quickly. Some physics
historians insist that considerable resistance to the theory existed even into the 1950’s and 1960’s. At least part of
the problem for the acceptance of the theory was that some conclusions from the theory went against common sense
and also, there was very little experimental evidence to support the theory.
The special theory of relativity essentially explains how to interpret motion between different inertial frames of
reference, that is, places that are moving at constant speeds relative to each other. Special relativity is based on two
postulates:

1. The laws of physics are the same for all observers within their own inertial reference frame.
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion or the motion

of the source of the light.

417

25.1. The Theory of Special Relativity

www.ck12.org

An inertial reference frame is one in which Newton’s ﬁrst law, the law of inertia, is valid. That is, if an object
experiences no net force due to other bodies, the object either remains at rest or remains in motion with constant
velocity in a straight line.

A Closer Look at Postulate 1

Consider dropping a child’s toy block in a railroad boxcar.

The block will fall straight down and come to rest on a spot directly underneath the position from which it was
dropped. For an observer inside a stationary boxcar, there will be a measureable distance the block fell, a time
required to fall and an average velocity for the fall. If the boxcar is moving at a constant horizontal velocity 10
m/s, the observer inside the boxcar will ﬁnd the all measurements to be exactly the same as when the boxcar was
stationary, including the spot where the block came to rest. For an observer inside the boxcar, the frame of reference
is the same whether the car is moving or not and all the laws of physics will be the same in both cases.

Consider the block falling in the moving boxcar as observed by a stationary observer outside the boxcar. As observed
in this frame of reference, the block does NOT fall straight down but rather follows a parabolic path. The distance it
falls is NOT the same and the average velocity calculated is NOT the same. For the outside observer, the block has
a constant horizontal velocity equal to the velocity of the boxcar and the vector sum of the horizontal velocity and
the vertical fall result in the parabolic path sketched. For the inside observer, there is no horizontal velocity. For the
outside observer, the distance traveled along the parabolic path is longer than the path straight down but the time for
the fall is the same. For the outside observer, the average velocity is greater.
Inside each frame of reference, all the laws of physics hold, but the measurements are not the same between the two
frames of reference.

A Closer Look at Postulate 2

Suppose you are sitting on the hood of a stationary car and your brother is standing alongside the road some 50 feet
ahead of the car. If you throw a ball to your brother with a velocity of 10 m/s, it will travel, relative to you, at a
velocity of 10 m/s and it will travel, relative to your brother, as 10 m/s. Suppose then, that you repeat the throw

418

www.ck12.org

Chapter 25. Relativity

except this time, you toss the ball while the car is moving toward your brother at 10 m/s. This time, the ball will
move, relative to you, with a velocity of 10 m/s but it will move, relative to your brother, with a velocity of 20 m/s.
In this case, the velocity of the source of the ball is added to the velocity of the ball to get the velocity relative to a
stationary observer.
Common sense would tell us that if we did this same experiment with light, that is, shine a ﬂashlight off the hood of
a moving car in the same direction the car is moving, the velocity of the light relative to a stationary observer would
be increased by the velocity of the car. In fact, such an increase in the speed of light has never been found. In fact, in
experiments carried out to test for the effect of the movement of the source on the speed of light (Michelson-Morley),
the results indicate that the speed of light is completely unaffected by the motion of the source. It appears that the
speed of light in a vacuum is constant regardless of relative motion. Hence, the suggestion in postulate 2. The speed
of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion or the motion of the source of
the light.
The special theory of relativity copes with the results of the Michelson-Morley experiments much better than does
classical mechanics, but it also has some surprising consequences. For example, according to the theory of special
relativity,

• Two events that occurred simultaneously for one observer were not simultaneous for another observer if the

two observers had relative motion to each other. (Relativity of simultaneity).

• Clocks in a moving frame of reference tick more slowly than an observer’s “stationary” clock. (Time dilation).
• Objects are measured to be shorter in the direction that they are moving with respect to a stationary observer.

(Length contraction).

• E = mc2, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable. (Mass-energy equivalence).
• No physical object can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. (Maximum speed is ﬁnite).

Time Dilation

Suppose we are in a rocket ship sitting at rest on the earth and we turn on an overhead light. The light will travel
downward (and all other directions as well) and land on the table below. The observer in the rocket ship can measure
the distance traveled to the table, the time required for the light to arrive on the table and an average velocity for
the light. If repeat the experiment in the rocket ship while the rocket is ﬂying past the earth at a constant horizontal
velocity, the observer inside will ﬁnd all the measurements and calculations to be exactly the same as when the
rocket was at rest.

419

25.1. The Theory of Special Relativity

www.ck12.org

Suppose now that the rocket ship is ﬂying past the earth at the same constant horizontal velocity and that the observer
is stationary on the earth. For the observer in the rocket ship, the light falls down on the table traveling at the regular
speed of light, c. For the observer on the earth, the light travels horizontally with the ship and also falls down onto
the table. For the observer on the earth, the path appears to be longer since the light not only went downward but
also horizontally.
However, since we have postulate 2, it is not allowed for the light to travel farther in the same time and therefore
have a greater average velocity. According to postulate 2, the speed of the light as observed inside the space ship
by that observer must be 3× 108 m/s and the speed of light observed by the observer on the earth (the light moving
diagonally) must ALSO be 3× 108 m/s.
So, how is it possible for both observers to measure the speed of light as the same number when the distance traveled
is clearly NOT the same? There is an unstated assumption involved here that indicates the passage of time in the
two reference frames is the same and that is where the special theory of relativity changes our ideas. The special
theory of relativity tells us that the observer on earth will see the clocks on the rocket ship ticking more slowly than
his own clocks. So, while the observer on the rocket ship sees the light travel a distance x meters in 1.00 second as
measured on his clock, the observer on the earth sees the light travel 2x meters in 2.00 seconds as measured by his
clock. In both cases, the speed of light is measured to be c. It is important to note that this is not an optical illusion
or some strange effect on the mechanical operation of the clock, the actual time on the ship slows down compared
to the time of the stationary observer. This is referred to as time dilation.
The equation for time dilation is ∆T =

∆t(cid:113)

1− v2
c2

where ∆t is the time interval between two events in the moving reference frame and ∆T is the time interval as
measured in a stationary frame of reference. “v” is the relative velocity of the moving reference frame and c is the
speed of light in a vacuum.
It should be clear from the equation that if the relative velocity between the two frames of reference is zero, then
∆T = ∆t and there is no time dilation. We can also use the equation to show that for relative speeds like 100 m/s,
which seems very fast to us, the comparison to the speed of light would show no noticeable time dilation.
∆T =

= 10 s

1−1×10−13 = 10 s

(cid:113)

∆t(cid:113)

=

1− v2
c2

10 s
1− 1002
(3×108)2

100 m/s is so slow compared to the speed of light, that it makes no difference in the time dilation formula. In order
for any noticeable effect to occur, the relative velocity of the reference frames must be a signiﬁcant fraction of the
speed of light.
Example Problem: A muon has a rest lifetime of 2.2× 10−6 s. If it travels with a speed of 0.95c relative to you,
how far will you see it travel before it decays?
Solution:
Muon’s lifetime according to your reference frame
∆T =

= 7.0× 10−6 s

(cid:113)

= 2.2×10−6 s
1− (0.95c)2

√
= 2.2×10−6 s
1− 0.90

1− v2
c2

distance = (3.0× 108 m/s)(0.95)(7.0× 10−6 s) = 2.0× 103 meters

The Twin Paradox

Shortly after Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity, an apparent paradox was pointed out. This paradox
involved a pair of twins, one of whom traveled away from the earth and returned at very high speeds. The other twin
remained at home on earth. Since one twin was traveling at very high speed, time for him was running slower than
for the twin who remained on earth. Thus the traveling twin would return home younger than the twin who remained
on earth.

420

www.ck12.org

Chapter 25. Relativity

The paradox comes about when each twin thinks that their frame of reference was at rest and the other twin’s frame
of reference was moving at high speed. Therefore, each twin would ﬁnd the other one to be younger. The resolution
lies in the fact that the traveling twin must accelerate at the beginning and end of the trip and this acceleration
guarantees that this twin is traveling and his clock is actually running slower. The traveling twin will return home
younger than his twin brother.
This result was tested in 1971 with a pair of very precise clocks. One clock was sent around the world in high speed
jet planes while the matched clock remained at rest. When the traveling clock was returned and placed next to the
other clock, the traveling clock had less time passed.

Length Contraction

In a similar manner, an observer on the rocket ship and an observer on the earth will not measure the length of the
rocket ship to be the same length in the direction of its motion. The observer on the ship takes out his meter stick and
measures the rocket ship to be 15 meters long while the ship sits at rest on the earth. An observer outside the ship,
standing on the earth, will also measure the ship to be 15 m with his meter stick. When the rocket ship ﬂies past the
earth at a signiﬁcant fraction of the speed of light, the observer on the ship takes out his meter stick and measures the
length of the ship and again ﬁnds it to be 15 m. The “stationary” observer on the earth with his meter stick measures
the moving rocket ship to be less than 15 m. Just for the sake of clarity, let’s say he measures the rocket ship to be
7.5 meters.

How is it possible that the two observers measure the same rocket ship to be two different lengths? When the rocket
ship is at rest on the earth, the on-ship meter stick and the off-ship meter stick are exactly the same but when the
rocket ship ﬂies past the earth at signiﬁcant fraction of the speed of light, the on-ship meter stick as seen by the on
earth observer has shrunk. When the observer on ship says the ship is still 15 m long, the observer on earth says,
“Nope, your meter stick has shrunk and so has your ship. The ship now measures 7.5 m long using my meter stick.”
The on-ship meter stick shrinks by the same percentage that the ship shrinks.

It is important to note that the shortening of the moving object does not produce just a smaller object of the same
shape. The object is only shortened in the direction of motion. Therefore, a long, slender rocket ship would NOT
become a smaller version of itself, but rather, would become a short, stubby rocket ship.

At some point in history, the length contraction was known as the Fitzgerald contraction and physicists have been
known to quote an applicable limerick.
There once was a young man named Fisk,
Whose fencing was exceedingly brisk,
So fast was his action,
The Fitzgerald contraction reduced his sword to a disk.
1− v2

The equation for length contraction is L = Lo
length measured on the stationary body, v is the relative speed of the reference frames, and c is the speed of light.
You can see by analysis of the equation that when the relative velocity is zero, the two lengths are the same, when the
relative speed is less than 1000 m/s, the effect is too small to notice, and only when the relative speed is a signiﬁcant
fraction of the speed of light is the contraction measureable.
Example Problem: A spaceship passes the earth at a speed v = 0.80 c.

a. What is the length of a meter stick laying on a table in the ship and pointing in the direction of motion of the

ship as measured by a person on the ship?

b. What is the length of a meter stick laying on a table in the ship and pointing in the direction of motion of the

ship as measured by a person on the earth?

Solution:

a. relative to a person on the ship, the meter stick is at rest and therefore its length is 1.0 m

= (1.0 m)

Relativistic Mass

The three basic mechanical quantities are length, time, and mass. Since length and time have been shown to be
relative (their value depends on the reference frame from which they are measured), it might be expected that mass
is also relative. Einstein showed that the mass of an object increases as its speed increases according to the formula

M =

mo(cid:113)

1− v2
c2

where M is the mass of the moving body, mo is the mass of the body at rest (or rest mass), v is the velocity of the
body and c is the velocity of light.
For many years it was conventional to enter the discussion of dynamics through derivation of the relativistic mass and
this is probably still the dominant mode in textbooks. More recently, however, it has been increasingly recognized
that relativistic mass is a troublesome and dubious concept. Many physicists reject the concept of relativistic mass
and oppose teaching the concept. Instead, they prefer to approach relativism through momentum rather than through
relativistic mass.
If momentum is the preferred place to express relativistic dynamics, the equation is

mov(cid:113)

1− v2
c2

p =

Chapter 25. Relativity

Where p is momentum, mo is rest mass, v is the velocity of the body and c is the velocity of light.
Example Problem: An electron has a rest mass of 9.1× 10−31 kg. If the electron were traveling at 0.50 c relative
to an observer, what electron mass would the observer measure?
Solution:
M =

= 1.1× 10−30 kg

(cid:113)

mo(cid:113)

The Ultimate Speed Limit

A result of the special theory of relativity is that no physical object can equal or exceed the speed of light. From
the equation for relativistic mass, it can be seen that as the object is accelerated faster and faster, its mass becomes
greater and greater. The greater mass would require an even greater force to accelerate it. If the velocity of the mass
ever reached the speed of light, the denominator of the equation would become zero and the mass would become
inﬁnite. The energy required to accelerate an inﬁnite mass would also be inﬁnite. The fact that light itself travels at
the speed c, implies that light has a zero rest mass. Of course, light is never at rest.

The Equivalence of Mass and Energy

The special theory of relativity is also the origin of Einstein’s most famous equation, E = mc2, and the concept
that mass and energy are different forms of the same thing. Einstein himself described the equivalence of mass and
energy as the “most important upshot of the special theory of relativity”. The idea is not that mass and energy can
be mathematically related but that they two are, in fact, simply different forms of the same thing. Each may be
converted into the other and the conversion factor is the speed of light squared.
Example Problem: How much energy would be released if a π meson (rest mass = 2.4×10−28 kg) was transformed
by decay completely into energy?
Solution: E = mc2 = (2.4× 10−28 kg)(3.0× 108 m/s)2 = 2.2× 10−11 joules

The Impact of the Theory of Special Relativity

A great many experiments have been performed to test the predictions of special relativity. No contradictions have
been found. Scientists have therefore accepted special relativity as an accurate description of nature. When the
relative velocities of objects are considerably less than the speed of light, the formulas for relativistic time, length,
and mass all reduce to the classical formulas. It is required that the two theories correspond where they overlap
at speeds much less than c. Special relativity does not contradict classical mechanics. Rather, it is a more general
theory needed for object speeds approaching the speed of light.

Summary

• The special theory of relativity essentially explains how to interpret motion between different inertial frames

of reference, that is, places that are moving at constant speeds relative to each other.

• Special relativity is based on two postulates:

1. The laws of physics are the same for all observers within their own inertial reference frame.
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion or the

motion of the source of the light.

• The special theory of relativity explains the unchangeable speed of light better than classical mechanics, but

it also has some surprising consequences. For example, according to the theory of special relativity,

– Two events that occurred simultaneously for one observer were not simultaneous for another observer if

the two observers had relative motion to each other. (Relativity of simultaneity).

– Clocks in a moving frame of reference tick more slowly than an observer’s “stationary” clock. (Time

dilation).

– Objects are measured to be shorter in the direction that they are moving with respect to a stationary

observer. (Length contraction).

– The mass of a moving object will be greater as measured by an observer at rest.
– E = mc2, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable. (Mass-energy equivalence).
– No physical object can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. (Maximum speed is ﬁnite).

• theory of special relativity: The theory proposed in 1905 by Einstein, which assumes that the laws of physics
are equally valid in all non-accelerated frames of reference and that the speed of electromagnetic radiation in
free space has the same value for all observers regardless of relative motion.

• theory of general relativity: The theory of gravitation, developed by Einstein in 1916, extending the special
theory of relativity to include acceleration and leading to the conclusion that gravitational forces are equivalent
to forces caused by acceleration and results in curved space.

• reference frames:An inertial reference frame can be deﬁned as either of the following:

– A reference frame in which Newton’s law of inertia is valid.
– A reference frame which isn’t accelerating.
– A reference frame in which all three of Newton’s laws are valid.

• time dilation: The relativistic effect of the slowing of a clock with respect to an observer. In Special Relativity,
a clock moving with respect to an observer appears to run more slowly than to an observer moving with the
clock. In General Relativity, time dilation is also caused by gravity; clocks on the earth’s surface, for example,
run more slowly than clocks at high altitudes, where gravitational forces are weaker.

• length contraction: One of the aspects of Einstein’s theory of special relativity is that the length of objects
moving at relativistic speeds undergoes a contraction along the dimension of motion. An observer at rest
(relative to the moving object) would observe the moving object to be shorter in length.

• mass and energy equivalence: The physical principle that a measured quantity of energy is equivalent to
a measured quantity of mass. Another way of stating it is that mass and energy are different forms of the
same thing. The equivalence is expressed by Einstein’s equation, E = mc2, where E represents energy, m the
equivalent mass, and c the speed of light.

The student will:

• state the conditions under which Einstein’s theory of gravity reduces to Newton’s theory of gravity.
• state two instances of experimental support for the general theory of relativity.

In a new study, scientists may have unexpectedly detected a merger of black holes about 160 million light-years
away in a galaxy dubbed NGC3393. Using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, investigators have detected two
black holes at its center, one about 30 million times the mass of the sun, and one at least 1 million times the mass of
the sun, separated by only about 490 light-years. They are the closest super-massive black holes to Earth ever seen,
according to a NASA statement. The scientists originally looked at this galaxy only to learn more about what they
thought was the sole black hole at its center.

The General Theory of Relativity

In 1905, Albert Einstein published the theory of special relativity, a theory about space and time. In the following
years, Einstein worked on the fact that acceleration produced the same effect as gravitation. For example, if you were
in an accelerating spaceship, or just an elevator, you could not tell if the force on you was from inertia or gravitation.
While Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation works well for ordinary gravitational ﬁelds, it is inaccurate when the
gravitational intensity is high. Albert Einstein formulated the theory of general relativity in 1914 as a new way to
explain gravity.
The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the
magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the
distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new
concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A
straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line.

426

www.ck12.org

Chapter 25. Relativity

Suppose we take a model of the earth in the shape of a globe and draw a straight line on the globe that travels from
Kodiak Island, Alaska to the southern tip of Greenland. This straight line passes northward of Hudson’s Bay, missing
it entirely.

Now suppose we take a map of Canada that has been ﬂattened to exist in two dimensions and once again, draw a
straight line from Kodiak Island, Alaska to the southern tip off Greenland.
This time, the straight line cuts right through the middle of Hudson’s Bay.

Why the difference? The actual space occupied by the earth is three dimensional and spherical. When that space
is altered in order to ﬁt it onto a two-dimensional sheet of paper, the actual geometry of the surface is altered. A
straight line on a curved surface does not mean the same thing as a straight line on a ﬂat surface. When an object
travels through curved space, it must follow the curvature of the space in order to move in a straight line.
When there is no mass in a volume of space, the space is not curved. An object passing through such space would
follow a straight line in our normal way of thinking of a straight line.

427

25.2. The Theory of General Relativity

www.ck12.org

When a large mass is placed in the space, however, the space is curved due to the presence of the mass. In this case,
an object passing through the space must follow the curvature of the space in order to follow a straight line. Thus
the path of the object bends toward the mass. The change in the direction the object appears to be exactly the same
as it would have been following Newton’s law of gravity.
In the general theory of relativity, objects move toward each other not because of a force that acts at a distance but
because they are following curved space. The mathematical expressions describing the properties of a gravitational
ﬁeld around a mass are given in a set of formulas called the Einstein Field Equations. These formulas are a highly
complex system of partial differential equations, which are beyond the scope of our material. Under normal levels
of gravitational ﬁeld strength, however, the relativistic mathematics for gravity reduce to Newton’s mathematics for
gravity. When gravitational ﬁeld strength is extremely high, however, the correct movement of objects can only be
calculated with Einstein’s relativistic gravity. Mass tells space how to curve and space tells mass how to move.
Experimental tests to garner support for the general theory of relativity were not easy to ﬁnd. The ﬁrst involved
the orbit of the planet Mercury. The orbit of Mercury (the closest planet to the sun) exhibits perturbations and a
precession that could not be fully explained by Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation. The motion of Mercury
was in much greater agreement with the predictions from the equations of general relativity. The acceptance of the
theory of general relativity increased greatly after it was shown to correctly predict the orbit of Mercury.
Both Newton’s theory of universal gravity and the theory of general relativity predict that light can be deﬂected by
gravity. The calculation of the amount of deﬂection predicted by Einstein’s theory was approximately double that
predicted by Newton’s theory. The deﬂection of light by gravity was tested in 1919, ﬁve years after general relativity
was proposed.
Two British groups took photographs of a region of the sky centered on the sun during the May 1919 total solar
eclipse and compared the positions of the photographed stars with those of the same stars photographed from the
same locations in July 1919 when the sun was far from that region of the sky.

The results showed that light was deﬂected when the sun was present, and also that this deﬂection was consistent
with general relativity but not with “Newtonian physics”. The subsequent publicity catapulted Einstein to world
fame. (To date, he is the only scientist to ever have a ticker-tape parade in New York City.)

Other Predictions of the General Theory of Relativity

Einstein’s general theory of relativity states that time is a fourth dimension adding to the three dimensions of space.
Einstein called this four-dimensional geometry spacetime. The general theory of relativity also predicted light
coming from a strong gravitational ﬁeld would have its wavelength shifted toward longer wavelengths, called a
red-shift. The theory also predicted that when gravity becomes great enough, it would produce objects called black
holes. Black holes are objects whose gravity is so massive that light cannot escape from the surface at all. Since
no light can escape, such objects would appear black. Both gravitational red-shift and black holes were considered
possible in the Newtonian theory, but measurements correspond better with Einstein’s theory.
There are also interesting effects having to do with the “curved time” predicted by the theory of relativity. This
effect manifests itself by causing time to go slower near a massive object. The theory suggests that time on the top
of a mountain runs faster than it does at sea level. Gravity’s slowing down of time also affects the frequency of light
waves and therefore their color. Light becomes bluer as it approaches a massive object and redder as it moves away.
This effect was ﬁrst observed in 1960 by Robert Pound and Glen Rebka, who shot gamma rays up to the top of a
building and measured the change in their color as they got farther away from the Earth.

Summary

• Masses placed in space cause the space to be curved.
• Curved space causes masses moving in a straight line to follow a curved path.
• Curved space also caused time to run more slowly.

• the general theory of relativity: Einstein’s Theory of Gravitation based on the postulate that the local effects

of a gravitational ﬁeld and of acceleration of an inertial system are identical.

The Theory of Special Relativity is very interesting and can be used to address some of the inconsistencies with
Newton’s Laws that crop up when dealing with objects in different frames of reference. It has been often stated that
the Theory of Special Relativity was “an idea whose time had come” and that if Einstein had not proposed it when he
did, someone else would have introduced the same concept before long. The Theory of General Relativity, however,
is considered to be one of the most fantastic achievements of the human mind in all of history. General relativity
explains how gravity affects both space and time, and its implications can be truly fascinating.
