Chapter  Outline 	  Earth science is the study of our home planet and all of its components: its lands, waters, atmosphere, and interior. In this book, some chapters are devoted to the processes that shape the lands and impact people. Other chapters depict the processes of the atmosphere and its relationship to the planets surface and all our living creatures. For as long as people have been on the planet, humans have had to live within Earths boundaries. Now human life is having a profound effect on the planet. Several chapters are devoted to the effect people have on the planet. Chapters at the end of the book will explore the universe beyond Earth: planets and their satellites, stars, galaxies, and beyond. The journey to better understanding Earth begins here with an exploration of how scientists learn about the natural world and introduces you to the study of Earth science.

Introduction 	  Science is a path to gaining knowledge about the natural world. The study of science also includes the body of knowledge that has been collected through scientific inquiry. To conduct a scientific investigation, scientists ask testable questions. To answer those questions, they make systematic observations and carefully collect relevant evidence. Then they use logical reasoning and some imagination to develop hypotheses and explanations. Finally, scientists design and conduct experiments based on their hypotheses. 
Goal of  Science 	  Scientists seek to understand the natural world. Scientists begin with a question and then try to answer the question with evidence and logic. A scientific question must be testable. It does not rely on faith or opinion. Our understanding of natural Earth processes help us to understand why earthquakes occur where they do and to understand the consequences of adding excess greenhouse gases to our atmosphere. Scientific research may be done to build knowledge or to solve problems. Scientific discoveries may lead to technological advances. Pure research often aids in the development of applied research. Sometimes the results of pure research may be applied long after the pure research was completed. Sometimes something unexpected is discovered while scientists are conducting their research. Some ideas are not testable. For example, supernatural phenomena, such as stories of ghosts, werewolves, or vampires, cannot be tested. Look at this website to see why astrology is not scientific: URL du/images/astrology_checklist.pdf . Scientists describe what they see, whether in nature or in a laboratory. Science is the realm of facts and observations. However, science does not make moral judgments, such as It is bad that the volcano erupted and opinions are not relevant to scientific inquiry. Scientists might enjoy studying tornadoes, but their opinion that tornadoes are exciting is not important to learning about them. Scientists increase our technological knowledge, but science does not determine how or if we use that knowledge. Scientists learned to build an atomic bomb, but scientists didnt decide whether or when to use it. Scientists have accumulated data on warming temperatures. Their models have shown the likely causes of this warming. But although scientists are largely in agreement on the causes of global warming, they cant force politicians or individuals to pass laws or change behaviors. For science to work, scientists must make some assumptions. The rules of nature, whether simple or complex, are the same everywhere in the universe. Natural events, structures, and landforms have natural causes. Evidence from the natural world can be used to learn about those causes. The objects and events in nature can be understood through careful, systematic study. Scientific ideas can change if we gather new data or learn more. An idea, even one that is accepted today, may need to be changed slightly or be entirely replaced if new evidence is found that contradicts it. Scientific knowledge can withstand the test of time. Accepted ideas in science become more reliable as they survive more tests. 
Scientific  Method 	  You have probably learned that the scientific method is the way scientists approach their work. The scientific method is a series of steps that help to investigate a question. Scientists use data and evidence gathered from observations, experience, or experiments to answer their questions. But scientific inquiry rarely proceeds in the same sequence of steps outlined by the scientific method. For example, the order of the steps might change because more questions arise from the data that is collected. Still, to come to verifiable conclusions, logical, repeatable steps of the scientific method must be followed, as seen in the Figure 1.1. A flow chart of how science works that is much more accurate than the simple chart in the Figure 1.1 is found here: URL . This video of The Scientific Method Made Easy explains scientific method succinctly and well (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1g, 1j, 1k IE Stand): URL (9:54). The basic sequence followed in the scientific method. 
Questions 	  The most important thing a scientist can do is to ask questions. Why is the sky blue? Why does California have many earthquakes while Kansas does not? Why does Earth have so many varied life forms but other planets in the solar system do not? Earth science can answer testable questions about the natural world. What makes a question impossible to test? Some untestable questions are whether ghosts exist or whether there is life after death. A testable question might be about how to reduce soil erosion on a farm ( Figure 1.2). A farmer has heard of a planting method called no-till farming. Using this process eliminates the need for plowing the land. The farmers question is: Will no-till farming reduce the erosion of the farmland? 
Research 	  To answer a question, a scientist first finds out what is already known about the topic by reading books and magazines, searching the Internet, and talking to experts. This information will allow the scientist to create a good experimental design. If this question has already been answered, the research may be enough or it may lead to new questions. Example: The farmer researches no-till farming on the Internet, at the library, at the local farming supply store, and elsewhere. He learns about various farming methods, as illustrated in the Figure 1.3. He learns what type of fertilizer is best to use and what the best crop spacing would be. From his research he learns that no-till farming can be a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, which helps in the fight against global warming. The farmer researches farming methods. 
Hypothesis 	  With the information collected from background research, the scientist creates a plausible explanation for the question. This is a hypothesis. The hypothesis must directly relate to the question and must be testable. Having a hypothesis guides a scientist in designing experiments and interpreting data. Example: The farmers hypothesis is this: No-till farming will decrease soil erosion on hills of similar steepness as compared to the traditional farming technique because there will be fewer disturbances to the soil. 
Data  Collection 	  To support or refute a hypothesis, the scientist must collect data. A great deal of logic and effort goes into designing tests to collect data so the data can answer scientific questions. Data is usually collected by experiment or observation. Sometimes improvements in technology will allow new tests to better address a hypothesis. Observation is used to collect data when it is not possible for practical or ethical reasons to perform experiments. Written descriptions are qualitative data based on observations. This data may also be used to answer questions. Scientists use many different types of instruments to make quantitative measurements. Electron microscopes can be used to explore tiny objects or telescopes to learn about the universe. Probes make observations where it is too dangerous or too impractical for scientists to go. Data from the probes travels through cables or through space to a computer where it is manipulated by scientists ( Figure 1.4). Scientists routinely travel to the bottom of the ocean in research submersibles to observe and collect samples. Experiments may involve chemicals and test tubes, or they may require advanced technologies like a high-powered electron microscope or radio telescope. Atmospheric scientists may collect data by analyzing the gases present in gas samples, and geochemists may perform chemical analyses on rock samples. A good experiment must have one factor that can be manipulated or changed. This is the independent variable. The rest of the factors must remain the same. They are the experimental controls. The outcome of the experiment, or what changes as a result of the experiment, is the dependent variable. The dependent variable depends on the independent variable. Example: The farmer conducts an experiment on two separate hills. The hills have similar steepness and receive similar amounts of sunshine. On one, the farmer uses a traditional farming technique that includes plowing. On the other, he uses a no-till technique, spacing plants farther apart and using specialized equipment for planting. The plants on both hillsides receive identical amounts of water and fertilizer. The farmer measures plant growth on both hillsides ( Figure 1.5). In this experiment: What is the independent variable? What are the experimental controls? What is the dependent variable? The independent variable is the farming techniqueeither traditional or no-tillbecause that is what is being manipulated. For a fair comparison of the two farming techniques, the two hills must have the same slope and the same amount of fertilizer and water. These are the experimental controls. The amount of erosion is the dependent variable. It is what the farmer is measuring. During an experiment, scientists make many measurements. Data in the form of numbers is quantitative. Data gathered from advanced equipment usually goes directly into a computer, or the scientist may put the data into a spreadsheet. The data then can be manipulated. Charts and tables display data and should be clearly labeled. Statistical analysis makes more effective use of data by allowing scientists to show relationships between different categories of data. Statistics can make sense of the variability in a data set. Graphs help scientists to visually understand the relationships between data. Pictures are created so that other people who are interested can see the relationships easily. In just about every human endeavor, errors are unavoidable. In a scientific experiment, this is called experimental error. What are the sources of experimental errors? Systematic errors may be inherent in the experimental setup so that the numbers are always skewed in one direction. For example, a scale may always measure one-half ounce high. The error will disappear if the scale is recalibrated. Random errors occur because a measurement is not made precisely. For example, a stopwatch may be stopped too soon or too late. To correct for this type of error, many measurements are taken and then averaged. If a result is inconsistent with the results from other samples and many tests have been done, it is likely that a mistake was made in that experiment and the inconsistent data point can be thrown out. 
Conclusions 	  Scientists study graphs, tables, diagrams, images, descriptions, and all other available data to draw a conclusion from their experiments. Is there an answer to the question based on the results of the experiment? Was the hypothesis supported? Some experiments completely support a hypothesis and some do not. If a hypothesis is shown to be wrong, the experiment was not a failure. All experimental results contribute to knowledge. Experiments that do or do not support a hypothesis may lead to even more questions and more experiments. Example: After a year, the farmer finds that erosion on the traditionally farmed hill is 2.2 times greater than erosion on the no-till hill. The plants on the no-till plots are taller and the soil moisture is higher. The farmer decides to convert to no-till farming for future crops. The farmer continues researching to see what other factors may help reduce erosion. 
Theory 	  As scientists conduct experiments and make observations to test a hypothesis, over time they collect a lot of data. If a hypothesis explains all the data and none of the data contradicts the hypothesis, the hypothesis becomes a theory. A scientific theory is supported by many observations and has no major inconsistencies. A theory must be constantly tested and revised. Once a theory has been developed, it can be used to predict behavior. A theory provides a model of reality that is simpler than the phenomenon itself. Even a theory can be overthrown if conflicting data is discovered. However, a longstanding theory that has lots of evidence to back it up is less likely to be overthrown than a newer theory. Watch this video to understand the difference between hypothesis and theory (1f IE Stand.): URL om/watch?v=jdWMcMW54fA (6:39). An interactive animation of how Darwin used finches ( Figure 1.6) to explain the origin of species using the Galapagos islands finches is found here: URL es_working.shtml . To explain how finches on the Galapagos islands had developed different types of beaks, Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution by natural selection. Nearly 150 years of research has supported Darwins theory. Science does not prove anything beyond a shadow of a doubt. Scientists seek evidence that supports or refutes an idea. If there is no significant evidence to refute an idea and a lot of evidence to support it, the idea is accepted. The more lines of evidence that support an idea, the more likely it will stand the test of time. The value of a theory is when scientists can use it to offer reliable explanations and make accurate predictions. 
Scientific  Models 	  A system, such as Earths surface or climate, can be very complex and can be difficult for scientists to work with. Instead, scientists may create models to represent the real system that they are interested in studying. Models are a useful tool in science. They help scientists efficiently demonstrate ideas and create hypotheses. Models are used to make predictions and conduct experiments without all of the difficulties of using real-life objects. Could you imagine trying to explain a plant cell by only using a real plant cell or trying to predict the next alignment of planets by only looking at them? But models have limitations that should be considered before any prediction is believed or any conclusion is seen as fact. Models are simpler than real life representations of objects or systems. One benefit to using a model is that it can be manipulated and adjusted far more easily than real systems. Models help scientists understand, analyze, and make predictions about systems that would be impossible to study without using models. The simplicity of a model, which makes it easier to use than the actual system, is also the reason why models have limitations. One problem with a simpler model is that it may not predict the behavior of the real system very accurately. Scientists must validate their ideas by testing. If a model is designed to predict the future, it may not be possible to wait long enough to see if the prediction was accurate. One way to test a model is to use a time in the past as the starting point and then have the model predict the present. A model that can successfully predict the present is more likely to be accurate when predicting the future. Many models are created on computers because only computers can handle and manipulate such enormous amounts of data. For example, climate models are very useful for trying to determine what types of changes we can expect as the composition of the atmosphere changes. A reasonably accurate climate model would be impossible on anything other than the most powerful computers. There are three types of models used by scientists. 
Physical  Models 	  Physical models are physical representations of the subject being studied. These models are typically smaller and simpler than the thing they are modeling, but they contain some of the important elements. A map or a globe are physical models of Earth and are smaller and much simpler than the real thing ( Figure 1.7). The Unisphere in Queens, New York is a physical model of Earth but is very different from the real thing. 
Conceptual  Models 	  A conceptual model ties together many ideas in an attempt to explain a phenomenon. A conceptual model uses what is known and must be able to incorporate new knowledge as it is acquired ( Figure 1.8). For example, a lot of data supports the idea that the Moon formed when a Mars-sized planet hit Earth, flinging a great deal of debris and gas into orbit that eventually coalesced to create the Moon. A good working idea is a conceptual model. 
Mathematical  Models 	  A mathematical model is an equation or set of equations that takes many factors or variables into account. Mathematical models are usually complex and often cannot account for not all possible factors ( Figure 1.9). These models may be used to predict complex events such as the location and strength of a hurricane. This climate model accounts for only a few factors in a small region of Earth. The best climate models are so complex that they must be created on supercomputers, and even they are simple compared to Earths climate. Modeling climate change is very complex because the model must take into account factors such as temperature, ice density, snow fall, and humidity. Many factors affect each other: If higher temperatures cause the amount of snow to decrease, the land surface is less able to reflect sunlight and temperature will increase more. 
The  Importance of  Community in  Science 	  Scientific discovery is best when it is the work of a community of scientists. For a hypothesis to be fully accepted, the work of many scientists must support it. The scientific process has built-in checks and balances. In general, the scientific community does a good job of monitoring itself. While new ideas are often criticized, if continued investigation supports them, they will eventually become accepted. Although each scientist may perform experiments in her lab alone or with a few helpers, she will write up her results and present her work to the community of scientists in her field ( Figure 1.10). Initially, she may present her data and conclusions at a scientific conference where she will talk with other scientists about those results. High school students share their research results to NASA scientists at a poster session. Using what shes learned, she will write a professional paper to be published in a scientific journal ( Figure 1.11). Before publication, several scientists will review the paper called peer review to suggest changes and then recommend or deny the paper for publication. Once it is published, other scientists in her field will learn about the work and will incorporate the results into their own research. They will try to replicate her results to prove whether the results are correct or incorrect. In this way, science builds toward a greater understanding of nature. The scientific community controls the quality and type of research that is done by project funding. Most scientific research is expensive, so scientists must write a proposal to a funding agency, such as the National Science Foundation or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), to pay for equipment, supplies, and salaries. Scientific proposals are reviewed by other scientists in the field and are evaluated for funding. In many fields, the funding rate is low and the money goes only to the most worthy research projects. The scientific community monitors scientific integrity. During their training, students learn how to conduct good scientific experiments. They learn not to fake, hide, or selectively report data, and they learn how to fairly evaluate data and the work of other scientists. Considering all the scientific research that is done, there are few incidences of scientific dishonesty, yet these are often reported with great vehemence by the media. Often this causes the public to mistrust scientists in ways that are unnecessary. Scientists who do not have scientific integrity are strongly condemned by the scientific community. 
Safety in  Science 	  Accidents happen from time to time in everyday life, and science is no exception. Indeed, scientists often work with dangerous materials and so scientists and even science students must be careful to prevent accidents ( Figure 1.12). If there is an accident, scientists must be sure to treat any injury or damage appropriately. Safety symbols: A. corrosive, B. oxidizing agent, C. toxic, D. high voltage 
Inside the  Science  Laboratory 	  If you work in the science lab, you may come across dangerous materials or situations. Sharp objects, chemicals, heat, and electricity are all used at times in earth science laboratories. By following safety guidelines, almost all accidents can be prevented or the damage can be minimized. For examples of safety equipment in the laboratory, refer to the Figure 1.13. Follow directions at all times. Obey safety guidelines given in lab instructions or by lab supervisor. A lab is not a play area. Use only the quantities of materials directed. Check with the person in charge before you deviate from the lab procedure. Tie back long hair. Wear closed toe shoes and shirts with no hanging sleeves, hoods, or drawstrings. Use gloves, goggles, or safety aprons when instructed to do so. Use extreme care with sharp or pointed objects like scalpels, knives, or broken glass. Never eat or drink anything in the science lab. Dangerous substances could be on the table tops. Keep your work area neat and clean. A messy work area could lead to spills and breakages. Clean and maintain materials like test tubes and beakers. Leftover substances could interact with other substances in future experiments. Be careful when you reach. Flames, heat plates, or chemicals could be below. Use electrical appliances and burners as instructed. Know how to use an eye wash station, fire blanket, fire extinguisher, or first aid kit. Alert the lab supervisor if something unusual occurs. An accident report may be required if someone is hurt; the lab supervisor must know if any materials are damaged or discarded. Safety equipment in the laboratory. 
Outside the  Laboratory 	  Many Earth scientists work outside in the field, as shown in the Figure 1.14. Working outside requires additional precautions, such as: Wear appropriate clothing; for example, hiking boots, long pants, and long sleeves. Bring sufficient food and water, even for a short trip. Dehydration can occur rapidly. Have appropriate first aid available. Tell others where you are going, what you will be doing, and when you will be returning. Take a map with you. It is also a good idea to leave a copy of the map with someone at home. Be sure you have access to emergency services and some way to communicate. Keep in mind that not many field areas are too remote for cellular phones to be useful. Be sure that you are accompanied by a person familiar with the area or familiar with the type of investigation that you doing if you are new to field work. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The goal of science is to ask and answer testable questions. Scientists use a sequence of logical steps, called the scientific method, which involves making observations, forming a hypothesis, testing that hypothesis, and forming a conclusion. Physical, conceptual, and mathematical models help scientists to discuss and understand scientific information and concepts. A scientific theory is a hypothesis that has been repeatedly tested and has not been proven false.

Identify the field of geology as a branch of Earth science dealing with the solid Earth. Describe oceanography as a branch of Earth science that has several subdivisions that deal with the various aspects of the ocean. Define meteorology as a branch of Earth science that deals with the atmosphere. Understand that astronomy is an extension of Earth science that examines other parts of the solar system and universe. List some of the other branches of Earth science, and how they relate to the study of the Earth. 
Introduction 	  Earth science is made of many branches of knowledge concerning all aspects of the Earth system. The main branches are geology, meteorology, climatology, oceanography, and environmental science. Astronomy uses principles understood from Earth to learn about the solar system, galaxy, and universe. 
Overview of  Earth  Science 	  Only recently have humans begun to understand the complexity of our planet Earth. We have only known for a few hundred years that Earth is just a tiny part of an enormous galaxy, which in turn is a tiny part of an even greater universe. Earth science deals with any and all aspects of the Earth: its lands, interior, atmosphere, and oceans. In all its wonder, Earth scientists seek to understand the beautiful sphere on which we live, shown in Figure 1.15. Earth is a very large, complex system or set of systems, so most Earth scientists specialize in studying one aspect of the planet. Since all of the branches of Earth science are connected, these researchers work together to answer complicated questions. The major branches of Earth science are described below. 
Geology 	  Geology is the study of the Earths solid material and structures and the processes that create them. Some ideas geologists might consider include how rocks and landforms are created or the composition of rocks, minerals, or various landforms. Geologists consider how natural processes create and destroy materials on Earth, and how humans can use Earth materials as resources, among other topics. Geology has many branches, only a few of which are described in Figure 1.16. As you learn about each branch of geology, think of an interesting question that you might like to try to answer. (a) Mineralogists study the composition and structure of minerals and may look for valuable minerals. (b) Planetary geologists study the geology of other planets. Lunar geologists study the Moon. (c) Seismologists study earthquakes and the geologic processes that create them. They monitor earthquakes worldwide to protect people and property. (d) Scientists interested in fossils are paleontologists. 
Oceanography 	  The study of water and its movements, distribution and quality is hydrology. Oceanography is more than just the hydrology of the oceans. Oceanography is the study of everything in the ocean environment, which covers about 70% of the Earths surface ( Figure 1.17). Recent technology has allowed people and probes to venture to the deepest parts of the ocean, but still much of the ocean remains unexplored. Physical oceanographers study the movements of ocean water such as currents, waves, and tides. Marine geologists learn about the rocks and geologic processes of the ocean basins. An animation of underwater high-resolution sonar can be found here: URL y.html . Marine biologists study life in the oceans. 
Climatology and  Meteorology 	  Meteorology includes the study of weather patterns, clouds, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Using modern technology such as radars and satellites, meteorologists are getting more accurate at forecasting the weather all the time ( Figure Climatologists study the whole atmosphere, taking a long-range view. Climatologists can help us better understand how and why climate changes ( Figure 1.19). Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is causing the global climate to change. 
Environmental  Science 	  Environmental scientists study the effects people have on their environment, including the landscape, atmosphere, water, and living things ( Figure 1.20). 
Astronomy 	  Astronomers are interested in outer space and the physical bodies beyond the Earth. They use telescopes to see things far beyond what the human eye can see. Astronomers help to design spacecraft that travel into space and send back information about faraway places or satellites ( Figure 1.21). 
Lesson  Summary 	  The study of Earth science includes many different fields, including geology, meteorology, oceanography, and astronomy. Each type of Earth scientist investigates the processes and materials of the Earth and beyond as a system. BrainPOP features in depth discussions of many topics in earth systems including text and movies: URL ww.brainpop.com/science/earthsystem/ .

Chapter  Outline 	  If youve seen the Grand Canyon or a photo of the Grand Canyon, youll know that this is not the Grand Canyon. Or is it? The rock colors seen above are not what a person standing at the rim on the canyon would see. From the rim, the Grand Canyon is mostly red with the prominent white stripe of the Coconino Sandstone near the top. The cliffs are more angular than the cliffs pictured here. NASA produced this image using data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emissions and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), one of five remote sensing devices aboard the Terra spacecraft. ASTER measures 14 different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from visible to infrared light, to give information on land surface temperature, reflectance, and elevation. The resolution is between 15 and 90 meters. So, is this the Grand Canyon? Any image or map of the Earths surface is just a representation. All maps show the data the map maker intended at the best level of accuracy possible. Each representation is valuable in its own way but has limitations. The only real Grand Canyon is the one you are looking at from the rim of the canyon. Or is that image altered by the tint of your sunglasses? NASA/GSFC/MITI/ERSDAC/JAROS and U.S./Japan ASTER Team.

Define destructive forces and give a few examples. constructive forces continent continental margin destructive forces landform mid-ocean ridge ocean basin ocean trench 
Introduction 	  Earths surface features are the result of constructive and destructive forces. Constructive forces cause landforms to grow. The eruption of a new volcano creates a new landform. Destructive forces wear landforms down. The slow processes of mechanical and chemical weathering and erosion work over time to change once high mountains into smooth flat plateaus. 
Earths  Features 	  The continents are large land areas extending from high mountaintops to sea level. The ocean basins extend from the edges of the continents down steep slopes to the ocean floor and into deep trenches. 
Continents 	  The oldest continental rocks are billions of years old, so the continents have had a lot of time for things to happen to them. Constructive forces cause physical features on Earths surface known as landforms to grow. Crustal deformation when crust compresses, pulls apart, or slides past other crust results in hills, valleys, and other landforms. Mountains rise when continents collide, when one slab of ocean crust plunges beneath another or a slab of continental crust to create a chain of volcanoes. Sediments are deposited to form landforms, such as deltas. Volcanic eruptions can also be destructive forces that blow landforms apart. The destructive forces of weathering and erosion modify landforms. Water, wind, ice, and gravity are important forces of erosion. Look for constructive and destructive landforms in Figure 2.2. This scene is within the East African Rift where the crust is being pulled apart to form a large valley. Which features result from constructive forces? Volcanoes have been constructed within the valley by rising magma. Which features result from destructive forces? Volcanic explosions or collapses have destroyed volcanic mountains to form craters. Fractures caused by the rifting in the valley are signs that the valley is breaking apart. Streams are eroding downward into the slopes of the volcanoes. Landslides erode the steep volcanoes. A landslide scar is seen on left side of the small, very steep volcanic cone near the center of the image, and landslide deposits have traveled outward from the scar. 
Ocean  Basins 	  The ocean basins are all younger than 180 million years. Although the ocean basins begin where the ocean meets the land, the continent extends downward to the seafloor, so the continental margin is made of continental crust. The ocean floor itself is not totally flat, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. The most distinctive feature is the mountain range that runs through much of the ocean basin, known as the mid-ocean ridge. The deepest places of the ocean are the ocean trenches, many of which are located around the edge of the Pacific Ocean. Chains of volcanoes are also found in the center of the oceans, such as in the area of Hawaii. Flat plains are found on the ocean floor with their features covered by mud. Landforms in this radar image of the Crater Highlands of Tanzania are accentuated by 2x vertical relief and also by color. The highest elevations are white and lowest elevations are green. 
Changing  Earth 	  Earths surface changes over short and long periods of time. Constructive forces cause new features to form by volcanic activity or uplift of the crust. Existing landforms are modified by destructive forces, perhaps even eroded away by water, wind, ice, and gravity. Beneath the oceans, volcanic activity forms new seafloor while old seafloor is destroyed at the trenches. You will explore many ways that the Earths surface changes as you proceed through this book. 
Lesson  Summary 	  For the most part, continents are much older than ocean basins. Both the continents and ocean basins are covered by many types of landforms, including mountains and flat plains. Constructive forces cause landforms to grow. Destructive forces modify or even destroy landforms. Earths surface is constantly changing. Change can happen rapidly, as when a volcano blows itself apart, or slowly, as in the grain by grain erosion of a stream into a canyon. What do they think now? Current ocean research with videos and explanations is found at URL . If erosion is constantly eating away at landforms, why isnt Earths land surface completely flat? Why do you think some regions of some continents, such as the middle part of the United States, are almost entirely flat? Why are continents higher than ocean basins? Understand the difference between location and direction. Know how a compass works and how to use one. Know how to determine location using latitude and longitude. compass compass rose direction elevation latitude location longitude relief sea level topography 
Introduction 	  Without being able to pinpoint a location, understanding Earths surface would be of little value. Scientists, and even people on the move, must have a system to locate themselves and important features on the Earth. 
Location 	  Perhaps you are sitting in the front office at Clovis West High School in California ( Figure 2.4). There are many ways to indicate your location, any of which can be used to find you. Any of these locations can be used and each has a different purpose. A postal worker might prefer to have a street address than to have to triangulate when delivering the mail. A geologist might want to know the latitude and longitude of an important feature. Triangulation is useful for locating where earthquakes and other things occur. 
Direction 	  A line connecting two different locations has direction. Directions are expressed as north (N), east (E), south (S), and west (W) with gradations in between. Clovis West High School is north of Santa Barbara, east-southeast of San Jose, and southwest of Auberry. Direction is important for describing moving objects. For example, the wind may be blowing from southwest to northeast. The most common way to describe direction in relation to the Earths surface is with a compass, a device with a floating needle that is actually a small magnet. The compass needle aligns itself with the Earths magnetic north pole, as demonstrated in the Figure 2.5. A compass rose ( Figure 2.5) is a figure drawn on a map or nautical chart that shows directions or degrees. Earths magnetic north pole is different from its geographic North Pole, known as true north. The geographic North Pole is the point where the axis upon which Earth rotates intersects the planets surface in the north. To find directions on a map using a compass you must correct for this discrepancy. The Figure 2.6 illustrates this offset between geographic and magnetic north. 
Latitude and  Longitude 	  Any location on Earths surface  or on a map  can be described by latitude and longitude. Latitude and longitude are expressed as degrees that are divided into 60 minutes. Each minute is divided into 60 seconds. (a) A compass is used to determine direction. A compass overlaid on a map can be used to show the directions the features are from each other. (b) This compass rose shows the major directions at 90 degrees and divides them into halves at 45 degrees northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW) and then divides them in half again at 22.5 degrees NNE, ENE, ESE, SSE, SSW, WSW, WNW, and NNW. Sometimes a compass rose just shows degrees. Earths magnetic north pole is 11.5 degrees offset from its geographic north pole on the axis of rotation. Latitude tells the distance north or south of the equator. Latitude lines start at the equator and circle around the planet. The equator is the line that falls equally between the North and South Poles. The latitude of the equator is 0. The North Pole is 90N, with 90 degree lines in the Northern Hemisphere. The South Pole is 90S, with 90 degree lines in the Southern Hemisphere ( Figure 2.7). The latitude of Clovis West High School ( Figure 2.4) is 36.85926N expressed in degrees and fractions of degrees. Longitude lines are circles that go around the Earth from north to south, like the sections of an orange. Longitude is measured perpendicular to the equator. The Prime Meridian is 0 longitude and passes through Greenwich, England. The International Date Line is the 180 meridian. The longitude of Clovis West High School is 119.76468W expressed in degrees and fractions of degrees. An interactive globe from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography helps with orienting by longitude: URL guide.ucsd.edu/earthguide/diagrams/globe/globe.swf . Since Earth is not flat, an accurate location must take into account the third dimension. Elevation is the height above or below sea level. Sea level is the average height of the oceans surface or the midpoint between high and low tide and is the same all around Earth. The topography of a region is the height or depth of that feature relative to sea level. Relief or terrain includes all the major features or landforms of a region. Figure 2.8 illustrates a topographic relief of California. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Location can be expressed in a variety of ways. Direction is useful for describing a moving object or the way to get between two locations. A compass needle aligns with magnetic north. Latitude indicates position north or south of the equator. Longitude indicates position relative to the Prime Meridian. Elevation is height above or below sea level. Topographic relief in California. Mt. Whitney is on the upper right, the highest point in the contiguous United States at 14,494 feet. Death Valley at -282 feet, the lowest contiguous point in the United States, does not appear in this figure but is SE of the Saline Valley, which it resembles. How might you create such a map?

Introduction 	  Different representations of Earths surface are valuable for different purposes. Accuracy, scale, portability, and features represented are among the many factors that determine which representation is most useful. 
Globe 	  Earth is best represented by a globe like the one seen in Figure 2.9 because Earth is a sphere. Sizes and shapes of features are not distorted and distances are true to scale. Globes usually have a geographic coordinate system and a scale. The shortest distance between two points is the length of the arc (portion of a circle) that connects them. Math problem: How would you measure the distance between two points on a globe in miles? Heres an idea: Pull a string taut between the two locations and mark both locations. Lay the string on the equator of the globe. Count the number of degrees between the marks, starting with one end at 0. The number of miles per degree at the equator is 69.17; now multiply the number of degrees by that number to get the distance in miles between the two locations. A location on a globe must be determined using polar coordinates because a globe is curved ( Figure 2.10). The polar coordinate system is useful for curved surfaces. Globes are difficult to make and carry around, and they cannot be enlarged to show the details of any particular area. As a result, people need maps. 
Maps as  Models 	  A map is a visual representation of a surface with symbols indicating important features. Different types of maps contain different information. Examples of some maps that are important in Earth science are: Relief maps use color to show elevations of larger areas ( Figure 2.1). Radar maps topography ( Figure 2.2) or weather. National Weather Service Doppler Radar maps are found here: URL . Satellite-view maps show terrains and vegetation, such as forests, deserts, and mountains ( Figure 2.8). Climate maps show average temperatures and rainfall. Climate maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are found here: URL . Weather maps show storms, air masses, and fronts. Weather maps, also from NOAA, are found here: URL ww.nws.noaa.gov/ . Topographic maps show elevations using contour lines to reveal landforms ( Figure 2.18). Geologic maps detail the types and locations of rocks found in an area ( Figure 2.25). 
Map  Projections 	  Maps are 2-dimensional (2D) representations of a 3-dimensional (3D) Earth. In a small area, Earth is essentially flat, so a flat map is accurate. But to represent a larger portion of Earth, map makers must use some type of projection to collapse the third dimension onto a flat surface. A projection is a way to represent the Earths curved surface on flat paper. One example of a projection is shown in the Figure 2.11. A	map	projection	translates	Earths curved surface onto two dimensions. There are two basic methods for making projections: The map maker slices the sphere in some way and unfolds it to make a flat map, like flattening out an orange peel. The map maker looks at the sphere from a certain point and then translates this view onto a flat paper. Lets look at a few commonly used projections. 
Mercator  Projection 	  In 1569, Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594) developed the Mercator projection (seen in the Figure 2.12). A flat piece of paper curves around the spherical Earth to make a cylinder. The paper touches the sphere at the equator, but the distance between the sphere and the paper increases toward the poles. The features of Earths surface are projected out onto the cylinder and then unrolled, creating a Mercator projection map. Where do you think a Mercator map is most accurate? Where is it least accurate? Near the equator the shapes and sizes of features are correct, but features get stretched out near the poles. For example, on a globe, Greenland is fairly small, but in a Mercator map, Greenland is stretched out to look almost as big the United States. A	Mercator	projection	translates	the curved surface of Earth onto a cylinder. In a Mercator projection, all compass directions are straight lines, but a curved line is the shortest distance between the two points. Many world maps still use Mercator projection today. Early explorers found Mercator maps useful because they visited the equatorial regions more frequently. A good explanation of the distortion that results from the projection of a sphere onto a flat surface can be seen in Alternative World Maps: URL . 
Conic  Projection 	  A conic map projection uses a cone shape to better represent regions and best depicts the area where the cone touches the globe. Looking at Figure 2.13, what is the advantage of a conic projection over a Mercator projection? A conic map projection wraps the Earth with a cone shape rather than a cylinder. 
Gnomonic  Projection 	  A gnomonic map projection is illustrated in Figure 2.14. With a gnomonic map projection, paper is placed on the area that you want to map. The projection is good for features near that point. The poles are often mapped this way. 
Robinson  Projection 	  In 1963, Arthur Robinson created an attractive map projection in which latitude lines are projected but meridians are curved, resulting in a map that is an ellipse rather than a rectangle (see Figure 2.15 for an example). This projection has less distortion near the poles, and features within 45 degrees of the equator are closer to their true dimensions. The distances along latitude lines are true, but the scales along each line of latitude are different. Robinson projections are still commonly used. 
Winkel  Tripel  Projection 	  The National Geographic Society uses the Winkel Tripel Projection, which uses mathematical formulas to create a map projection that is also distorted at the edges ( Figure 2.16). The Winkel Tripel Projection of Earth. Locations on a map are determined using rectangular coordinates (see Figure 2.17). Rectangular coordinates are useful for flat surfaces. Google Earth is a neat site to download to your computer: URL . The maps on this site allow you to zoom in or out, look from above, tilt your image, and a lot more. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Maps and globes are models of the Earths surface. Globes are the most accurate representations because they are spherical like the Earth is, but using a globe as a map has practical disadvantages. There are many ways to project the three-dimensional surface of the Earth on to a flat map. Each type of map has some advantages as well as disadvantages.

Introduction 	  Maps are extremely useful to Earth scientists to represent geographic features found above and below sea level and to show the geology of a region. Rock units and geologic structures are shown on geologic maps. What is a Topographic Map? Mapping is a crucial part of Earth science. Topographic maps represent the locations of geographical features, such as hills and valleys. Topographic maps use contour lines to show different elevations on a map. A contour line is a type of isoline; in this case, a line of equal elevation. If you walk along a contour line you will not go uphill or downhill. Mathematically, a contour line is a curve in two dimensions on which the value of a function f(x, y) is a constant. 
Contour  Lines and  Intervals 	  Contour lines connect all the points on a map that have the same elevation and therefore reveal the location of hills, mountains, and valleys. While a road map shows where a road goes, a topographic map shows why. For example, the road bends in order to go around a hill or stops at the top of a mountain. On a contour map: Each contour line represents a specific elevation and connects all the points that are at the same elevation. Every fifth contour line is bolded and labeled with numerical elevations. The contour lines run next to each other and NEVER cross. After all, a single point can only have one elevation. Two contour lines next to one another are separated by a constant difference in elevation (such as 20 ft or 100 ft). This difference between contour lines is called the contour interval. The map legend gives the contour interval. A topographic map of Stowe, Vermont. How would you calculate the contour interval on the map of Stowe, Vermont (see Figure 2.18)? Calculate the difference in elevation between two bold lines. Divide that difference by the number of contour lines between them. On the Stowe map, the difference between two bold lines is 100 feet and there are five lines between them, so the contour interval is 20 feet (100 ft/5 lines = 20 ft/line). 
The  Value of a  Topographic  Map 	  Swamp Canyon in Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah (shown in Figure 2.19) is very rugged, with steep canyon walls and a valley below. The visitors map of the area in Figure 2.20 shows important locations. Whats missing from this map? This map does not represent the landscape. With contour lines to indicate elevation, the topographic map in Figure 2.21 shows the terrain. 
View of  Swamp  Canyon in  Bryce  Canyon 	  National Park. Swamp Canyon Loop in Bryce Canyon National Park. The green line indicates the main road, black dotted lines are trails, and there are markers for campsites, a picnic area, and a shuttle bus stop. 
Interpreting  Contour  Maps 	  How does the map of Bryce Canyon reveal the terrain of the region? Several principles are important for reading a topographic map: Topographic map of Swamp Canyon Trail portion of Bryce Canyon National Park. Closely-spaced contour lines indicate a steep slope, because the elevation changes quickly in a small area. Contour lines that seem to touch indicate a very steep rise, like a cliff or canyon wall. Broadly spaced contour lines indicate a shallow slope. A portion of a USGS topographic map of Stowe, Vermont. Just to the right of the city of Stowe is a steep hill with a sharp rise of about 200 ft that becomes less steep toward the right. On a contour map, a circle with inward hatches indicates a depression. Start at the T in Stowe. A blue stream goes downhill (northwest) into a lake. Coming out of the T on the other side, you can follow the blue stream uphill (southeast). Where the water flow is light or nonexistent, there is no longer a blue line, but the contour lines point uphill indicating that the stream channel is still there (see the map of Stowe in Figure 2.18). An animation showing contour lines and the slopes they represent: URL w8 . Google Earth Topographic Map shows a 3D image with contour lines superimposed on it to show the relationship between the two (1h IE Stand.): URL (0:43). 
Bathymetric maps 	  The bathymetric map in the Figure 2.24 is like a topographic map with the contour lines representing depth below sea level, rather than height above. Numbers are low near sea level and become higher with depth. Bathymetric maps help oceanographers visualize the landforms at the bottoms of lakes, bays, and the ocean as if the water were removed. Loihi volcano growing on the flank of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii. Black lines in the inset show the land surface above sea level and blue lines show the topography below sea level. 
Geologic  Maps 	  A geologic map shows the geological features of a region (see examples in Figure 2.25 and Figure 2.26). Rock units are color-coded and identified in a key. In the map of Yosemite ( Figure 2.25), volcanic rocks are brown, the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite is peach, and the metamorphosed sedimentary rocks are green. Structural features, such as folds and faults, are also shown on a geologic map. The area around Mt. Dana on the east central side of the map has fault lines. This video shows a 3-dimensional interpretation of a geologic map from the Green River in Utah (1h IE Stand.): URL (1:34). This hour-long video is a tutorial on how to interpret a geologic map and construct a geological cross-section (1h IE Stand.): URL (59:56). 
Lesson  Summary 	  Topographic maps are 2-dimensional representations of the 3-dimensional surface features of an area. Topographic maps have contour lines that connect points of identical elevation above sea level. Contour lines run next to each other. Adjacent contour lines are separated by a constant difference in elevation, usually noted on the map. Topographic maps have a horizontal scale to indicate horizontal distances. People use topographic maps to locate surface features in a given area, to find their way through a particular area, and to determine the direction of water flow in a given area. Oceanographers use bathymetric maps to depict the features beneath a body of water. Geologic maps display rock units and geologic features of a region of any size. A small scale map displays individual rock units; a large scale map shows geologic provinces. a. a stream channel b. a hilltop c. depression d. a cliff What feature does that indicate?

Explain how a Global Positioning System (GPS) works. Explain how computers can be used to make maps. Geographic Information System (GIS) geostationary orbit Global Positioning System (GPS) polar orbit satellite 
Introduction 	  Modern technology is very useful for Earth scientists. Satellites give researchers a global perspective and can be used to monitor changes. Computers are used for making maps. 
Satellite  Data 	  A satellite is a small object that orbits a larger object. Satellites orbit Earth to get a large view of the planets surface and for hauling many different types of instruments to monitor all types of conditions ( Figure 2.27). Satellite views are important for visualizing global change; for example, the amount of sea ice that is present in the Arctic from winter to winter. Satellites travel in different orbits: In a geostationary orbit (illustrated in Figure 2.28), the satellite orbits at a distance of 36,000 km. Since it takes 24 hours to complete one orbit, which is the same amount of time it takes Earth to complete one rotation, the satellite hangs in the sky over the same spot. What is the value of a satellite in this type of orbit? From this orbit, weather satellites can observe changing weather conditions and communications satellites can relay signals. In a polar orbit, seen in Figure 2.29, the satellite orbits at a distance of several hundred kilometers. It makes one complete orbit around the Earth from the North Pole to the South Pole about every 90 minutes. Earth Satellites monitor and track hurricanes, reducing property damage and saving lives. This image shows Hurricane Rita on September 23, 2005 as it approaches Texas and Louisiana. Satellite in a geostationary orbit. rotates only slightly underneath the satellite, so the satellite can see the entire surface of the Earth in less than a day. What would be the value of this type of orbit? Weather satellites can get a picture of how the weather is changing globally. Some satellites that observe the lands and oceans use a polar orbit. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has launched a fleet of satellites to study Earth. The satellites are operated by several government agencies, including NASA, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Using different types of scientific instruments, satellites measure many things, including the temperatures of the land and oceans, amounts of gases such as water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the ability of the surface to reflect various colors of light, which indicates plant life, and even the height of the oceans surface. You can have lots of fun with satellite maps by playing around with Google maps: URL . Try searching for these interesting features: Goosenecks State Park, Utah; Mt. Whitney, Lone Pine, California; Empire State Building, New York; or your home. Note that you can zoom in and out to see features in more detail or to see how they fit into the area. 
Global  Positioning  System 	  Satellites help people locate their position on Earths surface. By 1993, the United States military had launched 24 satellites to help soldiers locate their positions on battlefields. This system of satellites was called the Global Positioning System (GPS). Later, the United States government allowed the public to use this system. GPS receivers, like the one pictured in image A of Figure 2.30, are now common. (a) This GPS receiver is located at 52 degrees N and 0 degrees E, on the Prime Meridian. (b) The receiver takes signals from 4 GPS satellites to calculate your location precisely. The GPS receiver detects radio signals from at least four nearby GPS satellites. There are precise clocks on each satellite and in the receiver. The receiver measures the time for radio signals from the satellite to reach it and then calculates the distance between the receiver and the satellite using the time and the speed of radio signals. The receiver triangulates by calculating distances from each of the four satellites. It then determines the location of the GPS receiver, as illustrated in image B of Figure 2.30. 
Computer- Generated  Maps 	  Computers have improved how maps are made and have increased the amount of information that can be displayed. Map makers use satellite images and computers to draw maps. Computers break apart the fine details of a satellite image, store the pieces of information, and put them back together in a 2D or 3D image ( Figure 2.31). Geographic Information Systems (GIS) use exact geographic locations from GPS receivers along with any type of spatial information to create maps and images ( Figure 2.32). The information might be of people living in an area, types of plants or soil, locations of groundwater, or levels of rainfall. Geologists use GIS to make maps of natural resource distributions. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Satellites give a larger view of the Earths surface and make many types of measurements that are of interest to Earth scientists. Scientists used computers and satellite images from Mars to create a 3D image of Valles Marineris. A GIS map of stroke death rates in the United States. Health rates may be affected by geographic region. A group of specialized satellites called Global Positioning Satellites help people to pinpoint their location.

Chapter  Outline 	  This is a picture of a mineral taken through a microscope. You may find it hard to believe that this is a mineral, but it is! This piece of orthopyroxene was cut very thin, mounted on a slide, and viewed in a polarizing light microscope. The image contains features you wouldnt be able to see by just looking at that piece of orthopyroxene with the unaided eye. A trained mineralogist can see that the orthopyroxene crystal formed first, then partly dissolved, and that augite crystals formed around the original crystals. Minerals are valuable resources for just about every aspect of our lives. When and where different minerals form are also important clues in telling the history of Earth.

Introduction 	  Minerals are made up of different chemical elements bound together. Understanding mineral chemistry aids in understanding how minerals form and why they have certain properties. 
Atoms and  Isotopes 	  A chemical element is a substance that cannot be made into a simpler form by ordinary chemical means. The smallest unit of a chemical element is an atom. An atom has all the properties of that element. These are the parts of an atom: At the center of an atom is a nucleus made up of subatomic particles called protons and neutrons. Protons have a positive electrical charge. The number of protons in the nucleus determines what element the atom is ( Figure 3.1). Neutrons are about the size of protons but have no charge. Tiny electrons, each having a negative electrical charge, orbit the nucleus at varying energy levels in a region known as the electron cloud. An introduction to the atom is seen on this Khan Academy video: URL n-to-the-atom . Major parts of an atom, although the electrons are more accurately represented in a cloud. What chemical element is this? (Hint: 3 protons, 3 electrons) Because electrons are minuscule compared with protons and neutrons, the number of protons plus neutrons gives the atom its atomic mass. All atoms of a given element always have the same number of protons but may differ in the number of neutrons found in its nucleus. Atoms of an element with differing numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. For example, carbon always has 6 protons but may have 6, 7, or 8 neutrons. This means there are three isotopes of carbon: carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14. How many protons and neutrons make up carbon-12? Carbon-13? Carbon-14? For a funny view of the chemical elements, check out this Tom Lehrer song: URL FIvXVMbII0 . 
Ions and  Molecules 	  Atoms are stable when they have a full outermost electron valence shell. To fill its outermost shell, an atom will give, take, or share electrons. When an atom either gains or loses electrons, this creates an ion. Ions have either a positive or a negative electrical charge. What is the charge of an ion if the atom loses an electron? An atom with the same number of protons and electrons has no overall charge, so if an atom loses the negatively charged electron, it has a positive charge. What is the charge of an ion if the atom gains an electron? If the atom gains an electron, it has a negative charge. Electron orbitals are described in this Khan Academy video: URL . When atoms chemically bond, they form compounds. The smallest unit of a compound with all the properties of that compound is a molecule. When two or more atoms share electrons to form a chemical bond, they form a molecule. The molecular mass is the sum of the masses of all the atoms in the molecule. 
Chemical  Bonding 	  Ions come together to create a molecule so that electrical charges are balanced; the positive charges balance the negative charges and the molecule has no electrical charge. To balance electrical charge, an atom may share its electron with another atom, give it away, or receive an electron from another atom. The joining of ions to make molecules is chemical bonding. There are three main types of chemical bonds: Ionic bond: Electrons are transferred between atoms. An atom of a metal will give one or more electrons to a non-metallic atom. Covalent bond: An atom shares one or more electrons with another atom. The sharing of electrons is not always evenly distributed within a molecule. If one atom has the electrons more often than another atom in the molecule, the molecule has a positive and a negative side. It is a polar molecule because it acts a little bit as if it had poles, similar to a magnet ( Figure 3.2). A great explanation of ionic and covalent bonding is found in this animation: URL atch?v=QqjcCvzWwww . Hydrogen bond: These weak, intermolecular bonds are formed when the positive side of one polar molecule is attracted to the negative side of another polar molecule. A video about chemical bonding, also from Khan Academy: URL d-metallic-bonds . Hydrogen and oxygen share electrons to form water, which is a covalently bonded, polar molecule. Watch this animation to see how it forms: URL . Water is a polar molecule. Because the oxygen atom has the electrons most of the time, the hydrogen side (blue) of the molecule has a slightly positive charge while the oxygen side (red) has a slightly negative charge. 
Lesson  Summary 	  An element is a substance that cannot be made into a simpler form by ordinary chemical means. It is made of atoms. An atoms nucleus contains positively charged protons and neutrally charged neutrons. The nucleus is orbited by negatively charged electrons found in the electron cloud. An ion is an atom that has gained or lost one or more electrons. Molecules form when electrons are transferred, creating ionic bonds, or when electrons are shared, forming covalent bonds.

Water has a lot of unusual properties: It forms droplets, lightweight insects can land on it, it is less dense in solid form (ice) than in liquid form. Can you link these properties to hydrogen bonding? Describe the characteristics that all minerals share. Identify the groups in which minerals are classified and their characteristics. chemical compound crystal inorganic mineral silicates 
Introduction 	  Minerals are categorized based on their chemical composition. Owing to similarities in composition, minerals within a same group may have similar characteristics. What is a Mineral? Minerals are everywhere! Figure 3.3 shows some common household items and the minerals used to make them. The salt you sprinkle on food is the mineral halite. Silver in jewelry is also a mineral. Baseball bats and bicycle frames both contain minerals. Although glass is not a mineral, it is produced from the mineral quartz. Scientists have identified more than 4,000 minerals in Earths crust. A few are common, but many are uncommon. Geologists have a very specific definition for minerals. A material is characterized as a mineral if it meets all of the following traits. A mineral is an inorganic, crystalline solid. A mineral is formed through natural processes and has a definite chemical composition. Minerals can be identified by their characteristic physical properties such as crystalline structure, hardness, density, flammability, and color. 
Crystalline  Solid 	  Minerals are crystalline solids. A crystal is a solid in which the atoms are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern ( Figure 3.4). The pattern of atoms in different samples of the same mineral is the same. Is glass a mineral? Without a crystalline structure, even natural glass is not a mineral. Silver and halite are minerals; the mineral quartz is used to make glass. Sodium ions (purple balls) bond with chloride ions (green balls) to make table salt (halite). All of the grains of salt that are in a salt shaker have this crystalline structure. 
Inorganic  Substances 	  Organic substances are the carbon-based compounds made by living creatures and include proteins, carbohydrates, and oils. Inorganic substances have a structure that is not characteristic of living bodies. Coal is made of plant and animal remains. Is it a mineral? Coal is a classified as a sedimentary rock but is not a mineral. 
Natural  Processes 	  Minerals are made by natural processes, those that occur in or on Earth. A diamond created deep in Earths crust is a mineral. Is a diamond created in a laboratory by placing carbon under high pressures a mineral? No. Do not buy a laboratory-made diamond for jewelry without realizing it is not technically a mineral. 
Chemical  Composition 	  Nearly all (98.5%) of Earths crust is made up of only eight elements oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium and these are the elements that make up most minerals. All minerals have a specific chemical composition. The mineral silver is made up of only silver atoms and diamond is made only of carbon atoms, but most minerals are made up of chemical compounds. Each mineral has its own chemical formula. Halite, pictured in the Figure 3.3, is NaCl (sodium chloride). Quartz is always made of two oxygen atoms bonded to a silicon atom, SiO2. If a mineral contains any other elements in its crystal structure, its not quartz. A hard mineral containing covalently bonded carbon is diamond, but a softer mineral that also contains calcium and oxygen along with carbon is calcite ( Figure 3.5). Some minerals have a range of chemical composition. Olivine always has silicon and oxygen as well as iron or magnesium or both, (Mg, Fe)2SiO4. 
Physical  Properties 	  The physical properties of minerals include: Color: the color of the mineral. Streak: the color of the minerals powder. Luster: the way light reflects off the minerals surface. Specific gravity: how heavy the mineral is relative to the same volume of water. Cleavage: the minerals tendency to break along flat surfaces. Fracture: the pattern in which a mineral breaks. Hardness: what minerals it can scratch and what minerals can scratch it. How physical properties are used to identify minerals is described in the lesson on Mineral Formation. 
Mineral  Groups 	  Minerals are divided into groups based on chemical composition. Most minerals fit into one of eight mineral groups. 
Silicate  Minerals 	  The roughly 1,000 silicate minerals make up over 90% of Earths crust. Silicates are by far the largest mineral group. Feldspar and quartz are the two most common silicate minerals. Both are extremely common rock-forming minerals. The basic building block for all silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron, which is illustrated in Figure 3.6. To create the wide variety of silicate minerals, this pyramid-shaped structure is often bound to other elements, such as calcium, iron, and magnesium. One silicon atom bonds to four oxygen atoms to form a silica tetrahedron. Silica tetrahedrons combine together in six different ways to create different types of silicates ( Figure 3.7). Tetrahedrons can stand alone, form connected circles called rings, link into single and double chains, form large flat sheets of pyramids, or join in three dimensions. 
Native  Elements 	  Native elements contain atoms of only one type of element. Only a small number of minerals are found in this category. Some of the minerals in this group are rare and valuable. Gold, silver, sulfur, and diamond are examples of native elements. 
Carbonates 	  The basic carbonate structure is one carbon atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. Carbonates include other elements, such as calcium, iron, and copper. Calcite (CaCO3) is the most common carbonate mineral ( Figure 3.8). Azurite and malachite, shown in the Figure 3.9, are carbonates that contain copper instead of calcium. 
Halides 	  Halide minerals are salts that form when salt water evaporates. Halite is a halide mineral, but table salt is not the only halide. The chemical elements known as the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) bond with various metallic atoms to make halide minerals (see Figure 3.10). 
Oxides 	  Oxides contain one or two metal elements combined with oxygen. Many important metals are found as oxides. Hematite (Fe2O3), with two iron atoms to three oxygen atoms, and magnetite (Fe3O4) ( Figure 3.11), with three iron atoms to four oxygen atoms, are both iron oxides. Magnetite is the most magnetic mineral. Magnetite attracts or repels other magnets. 
Phosphates 	  Phosphate minerals are similar in atomic structure to the silicate minerals. In the phosphates, phosphorus, arsenic, or vanadium bond to oxygen to form a tetrahedra. There are many different minerals in the phosphate group, but most are rare ( Figure 3.12). Turquoise is a phosphate mineral containing copper, aluminum, and phosphorus. 
Sulfates 	  Sulfate minerals contain sulfur atoms bonded to oxygen atoms. Like halides, they form where salt water evaporates. The sulfate group contains many different minerals, but only a few are common. Gypsum is a common sulfate with a variety of appearances ( Figure 3.13). Some gigantic 11-meter gypsum crystals have been found. That is about as long as a school bus! 
Sulfides 	  Sulfides are formed when metallic elements combine with sulfur. Unlike sulfates, sulfides do not contain oxygen. Pyrite, or iron sulfide, is a common sulfide mineral known as fools gold. People may mistake pyrite for gold because the two minerals are shiny, metallic, and yellow in color. 
Lesson  Summary 	  For a substance to be a mineral, it must be a naturally occurring, inorganic, crystalline solid that has a characteristic chemical composition and crystal structure. The atoms in minerals are arranged in regular, repeating patterns that can be used to identify that mineral. Minerals are divided into groups based on their chemical composition. The chemical feature of each groups is: native elements only one element; silicates silica tetrahedron; phosphates phosphate tetrahedron; carbonates one carbon atom with three oxygen atoms; halides a halogen bonded with a metallic atom; oxides a metal combined with oxygen; sulfates sulfur and oxygen; sulfides metal with sulfur, no oxygen.

Introduction 	  Minerals can be identified by their physical characteristics. The physical properties of minerals are related to their chemical composition and bonding. Some characteristics, such as a minerals hardness, are more useful for mineral identification. Color is readily observable and certainly obvious, but it is usually less reliable than other physical properties. How are Minerals Identified? Mineralogists are scientists who study minerals. One of the things mineralogists must do is identify and categorize minerals. While a mineralogist might use a high-powered microscope to identify some minerals, most are recognizable using physical properties. Check out the mineral in Figure 3.14. What is the minerals color? What is its shape? Are the individual crystals shiny or dull? Are there lines (striations) running across the minerals? In this lesson, the properties used to identify minerals are described in more detail. This mineral has shiny, gold, cubic crystals with striations, so it is pyrite. 
Color,  Streak, and  Luster 	  Diamonds are popular gemstones because the way they reflect light makes them very sparkly. Turquoise is prized for its striking greenish-blue color. Notice that specific terms are being used to describe the appearance of minerals. 
Color 	  Color is rarely very useful for identifying a mineral. Different minerals may be the same color. Real gold, as seen in Figure 3.15, is very similar in color to the pyrite in Figure 3.14. This mineral is shiny, very soft, heavy, and gold in color, and is actually gold. The same mineral may also be found in different colors. Figure 3.16 shows one sample of quartz that is colorless and another quartz that is purple. A tiny amount of iron makes the quartz purple. Many minerals are colored by chemical impurities. Purple quartz, known as amethyst, and clear quartz are the same mineral despite the different colors. 
Streak 	  Streak is the color of a minerals powder. Streak is a more reliable property than color because streak does not vary. Minerals that are the same color may have a different colored streak. Many minerals, such as the quartz in the Figure 3.16, do not have streak. To check streak, scrape the mineral across an unglazed porcelain plate ( Figure 3.17). Yellow-gold pyrite has a blackish streak, another indicator that pyrite is not gold, which has a golden yellow streak. The	streak	of	hematite	across	an unglazed porcelain plate is red-brown. 
Luster 	  Luster describes the reflection of light off a minerals surface. Mineralogists have special terms to describe luster. One simple way to classify luster is based on whether the mineral is metallic or non-metallic. Minerals that are opaque and shiny, such as pyrite, have a metallic luster. Minerals such as quartz have a non-metallic luster. Different types of non-metallic luster are described in Table 3.1. TABLE 3.1: Six types of non-metallic luster. 
Glassy 	  Can you match the minerals in Figure 3.18 with the correct luster from Table 3.1? 
Specific  Gravity 	  Density describes how much matter is in a certain amount of space: density = mass/volume. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. The amount of space an object takes up is described by its volume. The density of an object depends on its mass and its volume. For example, the water in a drinking glass has the same density as the water in the same volume of a swimming pool. Gold has a density of about 19 g/cm3; pyrite has a density of about 5 g/cm3 thats another way to tell pyrite from gold. Quartz is even less dense than pyrite and has a density of 2.7 g/cm3. The specific gravity of a substance compares its density to that of water. Substances that are more dense have higher specific gravity. 
Hardness 	  Hardness is a measure of whether a mineral will scratch or be scratched. Mohs Hardness Scale, shown in Table 3.2, is a reference for mineral hardness. TABLE 3.2: Mohs Hardness Scale: 1 (softest) to 10 (hardest). 
Diamond 	  With a Mohs scale, anyone can test an unknown mineral for its hardness. Imagine you have an unknown mineral. You find that it can scratch fluorite or even apatite, but feldspar scratches it. You know then that the minerals hardness is between 5 and 6. Note that no other mineral can scratch diamond. 
Cleavage and  Fracture 	  Breaking a mineral breaks its chemical bonds. Since some bonds are weaker than other bonds, each type of mineral is likely to break where the bonds between the atoms are weaker. For that reason, minerals break apart in characteristic ways. Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along certain planes to make smooth surfaces. Halite breaks between layers of sodium and chlorine to form cubes with smooth surfaces ( Figure 3.19). Mica has cleavage in one direction and forms sheets ( Figure 3.20). Minerals can cleave into polygons. Fluorite forms octahedrons ( Figure 3.21). One reason gemstones are beautiful is that the cleavage planes make an attractive crystal shape with smooth faces. Fracture is a break in a mineral that is not along a cleavage plane. Fracture is not always the same in the same mineral because fracture is not determined by the structure of the mineral. Minerals may have characteristic fractures ( Figure 3.22). Metals usually fracture into jagged edges. If a mineral splinters like wood, it may be fibrous. Some minerals, such as quartz, form smooth curved surfaces when they fracture. 
Other  Identifying  Characteristics 	  Some minerals have other unique properties, some of which are listed in Table 3.3. Can you name a unique property that would allow you to instantly identify a mineral thats been described quite a bit in this chapter? (Hint: It is most likely found on your dinner table.) TABLE 3.3: Some minerals have unusual properties that can be used for identification.

Lesson  Summary 	  Minerals have distinctive properties that can be used to help identify them. Color and luster describe the minerals outer appearance. Streak is the color of the powder. A mineral has a characteristic density. Mohs Hardness Scale is used to compare the hardness of minerals. Cleavage or the characteristic way a mineral breaks depends on the crystal structure of the mineral. Some minerals have special properties that can be used to help identify them.

Introduction 	  Minerals form under an enormous range of geologic conditions. There are probably more ways to form minerals than there are types of minerals themselves. Minerals can form from volcanic gases, sediment formation, oxidation, crystallization from magma, or deposition from a saline fluid, to list a few. Some of these methods of mineral formation will be discussed below. 
Formation from  Hot  Material 	  A rock is a collection of minerals. Imagine a rock that becomes so hot it melts. Many minerals start out in liquids that are hot enough to melt rocks. Magma is melted rock inside Earth, a molten mixture of substances that can be hotter than 1,000oC. Magma cools slowly inside Earth, which gives mineral crystals time to grow large enough to be seen clearly ( Figure 3.23). When magma erupts onto Earths surface, it is called lava. Lava cools much more rapidly than magma when it is below the surface. In a cooling lava, mineral crystals do not have time to form and are very small. The chemical composition will be the same as if the magma cooled slowly. Existing rocks may be heated enough so that the molecules are released from their structure and can move around. The molecules may match up with different molecules to form new minerals as the rock cools. This occurs during metamorphism, which will be discussed in the chapter Rocks. Granite is rock that forms from slowly cooled magma, containing the minerals quartz (clear), plagioclase feldspar (shiny white), potassium feldspar (pink), and biotite (black). 
Formation from  Solutions 	  Water on Earth, such as the water in the oceans, contains chemical elements mixed into a solution. Various processes can cause these elements to combine to form solid mineral deposits. 
Minerals from  Salt  Water 	  When water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid precipitate of minerals, as shown in Figure 3.24. When the water in glass A evaporates, the dissolved mineral particles are left behind. Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved minerals and salts. When the amount is too great to stay dissolved in the water, the particles come together to form mineral solids, which sink. Halite easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite. Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California ( Figure 3.25) or The Great Salt Lake in Utah, contain many mineral precipitates. Tufa towers form when calcium-rich spring water at the bottom of Mono Lake bubbles up into the alkaline lake. The tufa towers appear when lake level drops. 
Minerals from  Hot  Underground  Water 	  Magma heats nearby underground water, which reacts with the rocks around it to pick up dissolved particles. As the water flows through open spaces in the rock and cools, it deposits solid minerals. The mineral deposits that form when a mineral fills cracks in rocks are called veins ( Figure 3.26). Quartz veins formed in this rock. When minerals are deposited in open spaces, large crystals form ( Figure 3.27). Amethyst formed when large crystals grew in open spaces inside the rock. These special rocks are called geodes. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Mineral crystals that form when magma cools slowly are larger than crystals that form when lava cools rapidly. Minerals form when rocks are heated enough that atoms of different elements can move around and join into different molecules. Minerals are deposited from salty water solutions on Earths surface and underground. Gems and Where Theyre Found: URL . How to Grow Your Own Crystals: URL . Is a mineral a static thing or does it change? If it changes, on what time frame? When most minerals form, they combine with other minerals to form rocks. How can these minerals be used? The same mineral can be formed by different processes. How can the way a mineral forms affect how the mineral is used? Explain how minerals are mined. Describe how metals are made from mineral ores. Summarize the ways in which gemstones are used. Identify some useful minerals. gemstone ore ore deposit placer reclamation 
Introduction 	  Some minerals are very useful. An ore is a rock that contains minerals with useful elements. Aluminum in bauxite ore ( Figure 3.28) is extracted from the ground and refined to be used in aluminum foil and many other products. The cost of creating a product from a mineral depends on how abundant the mineral is and how much the extraction and refining processes cost. Environmental damage from these processes is often not figured into a products cost. It is important to use mineral resources wisely. 
Finding and  Mining  Minerals 	  Geologic processes create and concentrate minerals that are valuable natural resources. Geologists study geological formations and then test the physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks to locate possible ores and determine their size and concentration. A mineral deposit will only be mined if it is profitable. A concentration of minerals is only called an ore deposit if it is profitable to mine. There are many ways to mine ores. 
Surface  Mining 	  Surface mining allows extraction of ores that are close to Earths surface. Overlying rock is blasted and the rock that contains the valuable minerals is placed in a truck and taken to a refinery. As pictured in Figure 3.29, surface Aluminum is made from the aluminumbearing minerals in bauxite. mining includes open-pit mining and mountaintop removal. Other methods of surface mining include strip mining, placer mining, and dredging. Strip mining is like open pit mining but with material removed along a strip. Placers are valuable minerals found in stream gravels. Californias nickname, the Golden State, can be traced back to the discovery of placer deposits of gold in 1848. The gold weathered out of hard metamorphic rock in the western Sierra Nevada, which also contains deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, chromite, and other valuable minerals. The gold traveled down rivers and then settled in gravel deposits. Currently, California has active mines for gold and silver and for non-metal minerals such as sand and gravel, which are used for construction. 
Underground  Mining 	  Underground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into Earths surface. Miners blast and tunnel into rock to gain access to the ores. How underground mining is approached from above, below, or sideways depends on the placement of the ore body, its depth, concentration of ore, and the strength of the surrounding rock. Underground mining is very expensive and dangerous. Fresh air and lights must also be brought into the tunnels for the miners, and accidents are far too common. 
Ore  Extraction 	  The ores journey to becoming a useable material is only just beginning when the ore leaves the mine ( Figure 3.30). Rocks are crushed so that the valuable minerals can be separated from the waste rock. Then the minerals are separated out of the ore. A few methods for extracting ore are: heap leaching: the addition of chemicals, such as cyanide or acid, to remove ore. flotation: the addition of a compound that attaches to the valuable mineral and floats. smelting: roasting rock, causing it to segregate into layers so the mineral can be extracted. The de Young Museum in San Francisco is covered in copper panels. Copper is mined and extracted from copper ores. To extract the metal from the ore, the rock is melted at a temperature greater than 900C, which requires a lot of energy. Extracting metal from rock is so energy intensive that if you recycle just 40 aluminum cans, you will save the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline. 
Mining and the  Environment 	  Although mining provides people with many needed resources, the environmental costs can be high. Surface mining clears the landscape of trees and soil, and nearby streams and lakes are inundated with sediment. Pollutants from the mined rock, such as heavy metals, enter the sediment and water system. Acids flow from some mine sites, changing the composition of nearby waterways ( Figure 3.31). U.S. law has changed so that in recent decades a mine region must be restored to its natural state, a process called reclamation. This is not true of older mines. Pits may be refilled or reshaped and vegetation planted. Pits may be allowed to fill with water and become lakes or may be turned into landfills. Underground mines may be sealed off or left open as homes for bats. 
Valuable  Minerals 	  Some minerals are valuable because they are beautiful. Jade has been used for thousands of years in China. Diamonds sparkle on many engagement rings. Minerals like jade, turquoise, diamonds, and emeralds are gemstones. A gemstone, or gem, is a material that is cut and polished for jewelry. Many gemstones, including many in Figure 3.32, are minerals. Gemstones are usually rare and do not break or scratch easily. Most are cut along cleavage faces and then polished so that light bounces back off the cleavage planes ( Figure 3.33). Light does not pass through gemstones that are opaque, such as turquoise. Gemstones are not just used in jewelry. Diamonds are used to cut and polish other materials, such as glass and metals, because they are so hard. The mineral corundum, of which ruby and sapphire are varieties, is used in products such as sandpaper. Uncut (left) and cut (right) ruby. The cut and polished ruby sparkles. Minerals are used in much less obvious places. The mineral gypsum is used for the sheetrock in homes. Window glass is made from sand, which is mostly quartz. Halite is mined for rock salt. Copper is used in electrical wiring, and bauxite is the source for the aluminum used in soda cans. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Geologists use many methods to find mineral deposits that will be profitable to mine. Ore deposits can be mined by surface or underground mining methods. Mining provides important resources but has environmental costs. By U.S. law, currently mined land must undergo reclamation. This is not true for old mines. Metal ores must be melted to make metals. Many gems are cut and polished to increase their beauty. Minerals are used in a variety of ways. Aluminum and Bauxite: URL . Mining Diamonds: URL . Gems: URL and URL Lect2.html . Are all mineral deposits ores? Why might an open pit mine be turned into an underground mine? How well does reclaimed land resemble the land before mining began? Diamonds are not necessarily the rarest gem so why do people value them more than most other gems? Under what circumstances might a mineral deposit be an ore one day and not the next?

S  Rocks 	  This image is of an igneous rock, specifically an igneous intrusive rock called granite The rock was sliced very thin, mounted on a slide and viewed in a polarizing light microscope. In a photomicrograph, different minerals have different colors and shapes. The gray and black striped crystals are plagioclase, the blobby gray ones are quartz and the colored segmented ones are mica. Geologists like to use photomicrographs because the minerals are more identifiable. The textures are also easier to recognize, which gives the scientists clues about the rocks formation. All this makes a rock easier to identify. Thomas Bresson. commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Thomas_Bresson_?_Granite_vu_au_microscope_%28by%29.jpg. CC BY 2.0.

Introduction 	  There are three types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. Each of these types is part of the rock cycle. Through changes in conditions one rock type can become another rock type. Or it can become a different rock of the same type. What Are Rocks? A rock is a naturally formed, non-living earth material. Rocks are made of collections of mineral grains that are held together in a firm, solid mass ( Figure 4.1). How is a rock different from a mineral? Rocks are made of minerals. The mineral grains in a rock may be so tiny that you can only see them with a microscope, or they may be as big as your fingernail or even your finger ( Figure A pegmatite from South Dakota with crystals of lepidolite, tourmaline, and quartz (1 cm scale on the upper left). Rocks are identified primarily by the minerals they contain and by their texture. Each type of rock has a distinctive set of minerals. A rock may be made of grains of all one mineral type, such as quartzite. Much more commonly, rocks are made of a mixture of different minerals. Texture is a description of the size, shape, and arrangement of mineral grains. Are the two samples in Figure 4.3 the same rock type? Do they have the same minerals? The same texture? 
Sample 1 	  plagioclase, quartz, hornblende, pyroxene 
Magma	cooled 	  slowly 
Sample 2 	  plagioclase, hornblende, pyroxene 
Andesite 	  As seen in Table 4.1, these two rocks have the same chemical composition and contain mostly the same minerals, but they do not have the same texture. Sample 1 has visible mineral grains, but Sample 2 has very tiny or invisible grains. The two different textures indicate different histories. Sample 1 is a diorite, a rock that cooled slowly from magma (molten rock) underground. Sample 2 is an andesite, a rock that cooled rapidly from a very similar magma that erupted onto Earths surface. 
Three  Main  Categories of  Rocks 	  Rocks are classified into three major groups according to how they form. Rocks can be studied in hand samples that can be moved from their original location. Rocks can also be studied in outcrop, exposed rock formations that are attached to the ground, at the location where they are found. 
Igneous  Rocks 	  Igneous rocks form from cooling magma. Magma that erupts onto Earths surface is lava, as seen in Figure 4.4. The chemical composition of the magma and the rate at which it cools determine what rock forms as the minerals cool and crystallize. 
Sedimentary  Rocks 	  Sedimentary rocks form by the compaction and cementing together of sediments, broken pieces of rock-like gravel, sand, silt, or clay ( Figure 4.5). Those sediments can be formed from the weathering and erosion of preexisting rocks. Sedimentary rocks also include chemical precipitates, the solid materials left behind after a liquid evaporates. This sedimentary rock is made of sand that is cemented together to form a sandstone. 
Metamorphic  Rocks 	  Metamorphic rocks form when the minerals in an existing rock are changed by heat or pressure within the Earth. See Figure 4.6 for an example of a metamorphic rock. Quartzite is a metamorphic rock formed when quartz sandstone is exposed to heat and pressure within the Earth. A simple explanation of the three rock types and how to identify them can be seen in this video: URL be.com/watch?v=tQUe9C40NEE . This video discusses how to identify igneous rocks: URL . This video discusses how to identify a metamorphic rocks: URL . This Science Made Fun video discusses the conditions under which the three main rock types form (3c): URL ww.youtube.com/watch?v=G7AWGhQynTY (3:41). 
The  Rock  Cycle 	  Rocks change as a result of natural processes that are taking place all the time. Most changes happen very slowly; many take place below the Earths surface, so we may not even notice the changes. Although we may not see the changes, the physical and chemical properties of rocks are constantly changing in a natural, never-ending cycle called the rock cycle. The concept of the rock cycle was first developed by James Hutton, an eighteenth century scientist often called the Father of Geology (shown in Figure 4.7). Hutton recognized that geologic processes have no [sign] of a beginning, and no prospect of an end. The processes involved in the rock cycle often take place over millions of years. So on the scale of a human lifetime, rocks appear to be rock solid and unchanging, but in the longer term, change is always taking place. In the rock cycle, illustrated in Figure 4.8, the three main rock types igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic are shown. Arrows connecting the three rock types show the processes that change one rock type into another. The cycle has no beginning and no end. Rocks deep within the Earth are right now becoming other types of rocks. Rocks at the surface are lying in place before they are next exposed to a process that will change them. 
Processes of the  Rock  Cycle 	  Several processes can turn one type of rock into another type of rock. The key processes of the rock cycle are crystallization, erosion and sedimentation, and metamorphism. 
Crystallization 	  Magma cools either underground or on the surface and hardens into an igneous rock. As the magma cools, different crystals form at different temperatures, undergoing crystallization. For example, the mineral olivine crystallizes out of magma at much higher temperatures than quartz. The rate of cooling determines how much time the crystals will have to form. Slow cooling produces larger crystals. 
Erosion and  Sedimentation 	  Weathering wears rocks at the Earths surface down into smaller pieces. The small fragments are called sediments. Running water, ice, and gravity all transport these sediments from one place to another by erosion. During sedimentation, the sediments are laid down or deposited. In order to form a sedimentary rock, the accumulated sediment must become compacted and cemented together. 
Metamorphism 	  When a rock is exposed to extreme heat and pressure within the Earth but does not melt, the rock becomes metamorphosed. Metamorphism may change the mineral composition and the texture of the rock. For that reason, a metamorphic rock may have a new mineral composition and/or texture. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Rocks are collections of minerals of various sizes and types. The three main rock types are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Crystallization, erosion and sedimentation, and metamorphism transform one rock type into another or change sediments into rock. The rock cycle describes the transformations of one type of rock to another. An interactive, illustrated rock cycle diagram is seen here: URL agram.html. If Earths interior were no longer hot but all other processes on Earth continued unchanged, what would happen to the different rock types in the rock cycle? Stone tools were important to early humans. Are rocks still important to humans today? Describe how igneous rocks form. Describe the properties of some common types of igneous rocks. Relate some common uses of igneous rocks. 
Bowens  Reaction  Series 	  extrusive felsic fractional crystallization intermediate intrusive mafic partial melting pluton porphyritic ultramafic vesicular volcanic rock 
Introduction 	  Igneous rocks form from the cooling and hardening of molten magma in many different environments. These rocks are identified by their composition and texture. More than 700 different types of igneous rocks are known. 
Magma  Composition 	  The rock beneath the Earths surface is sometimes heated to high enough temperatures that it melts to create magma. Different magmas have different composition and contain whatever elements were in the rock that melted. Magmas also contain gases. The main elements are the same as the elements found in the crust. Table 4.2 lists the abundance of elements found in the Earths crust and in magma. The remaining 1.5% is made up of many other elements that are present in tiny quantities. 
Total 	  Whether rock melts to create magma depends on: Temperature: Temperature increases with depth, so melting is more likely to occur at greater depths. Pressure: Pressure increases with depth, but increased pressure raises the melting temperature, so melting is less likely to occur at higher pressures. Water: The addition of water changes the melting point of rock. As the amount of water increases, the melting point decreases. Rock composition: Minerals melt at different temperatures, so the temperature must be high enough to melt at least some minerals in the rock. The first mineral to melt from a rock will be quartz (if present) and the last will be olivine (if present). The different geologic settings that produce varying conditions under which rocks melt will be discussed in the Plate Tectonics chapter. As a rock heats up, the minerals that melt at the lowest temperatures will melt first. Partial melting occurs when the temperature on a rock is high enough to melt only some of the minerals in the rock. The minerals that will melt will be those that melt at lower temperatures. Fractional crystallization is the opposite of partial melting. This process describes the crystallization of different minerals as magma cools. Bowens Reaction Series indicates the temperatures at which minerals melt or crystallize ( Figure 4.9). An understanding of the way atoms join together to form minerals leads to an understanding of how different igneous rocks form. Bowens Reaction Series also explains why some minerals are always found together and some are never found together. To see a diagram illustrating Bowens Reaction Series, visit this website: URL ckMin/RockMin.html . This excellent video that explains Bowens Reaction Series in detail: URL e8 . If the liquid separates from the solids at any time in partial melting or fractional crystallization, the chemical composition of the liquid and solid will be different. When that liquid crystallizes, the resulting igneous rock will have a different composition from the parent rock. 
Intrusive and  Extrusive  Igneous  Rocks 	  Igneous rocks are called intrusive when they cool and solidify beneath the surface. Intrusive rocks form plutons and so are also called plutonic. A pluton is an igneous intrusive rock body that has cooled in the crust. When magma cools within the Earth, the cooling proceeds slowly. Slow cooling allows time for large crystals to form, so intrusive igneous rocks have visible crystals. Granite is the most common intrusive igneous rock (see Figure 4.10 for an example). Granite is made of four minerals, all visible to the naked eye: feldspar (white), quartz (translucent), hornblende (black), and biotite (black, platy). Igneous rocks make up most of the rocks on Earth. Most igneous rocks are buried below the surface and covered with sedimentary rock, or are buried beneath the ocean water. In some places, geological processes have brought igneous rocks to the surface. Figure 4.11 shows a landscape in Californias Sierra Nevada made of granite that has been raised to create mountains. Igneous rocks are called extrusive when they cool and solidify above the surface. These rocks usually form from a volcano, so they are also called volcanic rocks ( Figure 4.12). Extrusive igneous rocks form after lava cools above the surface. Extrusive igneous rocks cool much more rapidly than intrusive rocks. There is little time for crystals to form, so extrusive igneous rocks have tiny crystals ( Figure 4.13). Some volcanic rocks have a mixed texture. A rock such as an andesite may have large crystals set within a matrix of tiny crystals. In this case, the magma cooled enough to form some crystals before erupting. Once erupted, the rest of the lava cooled rapidly. This is called porphyritic texture. Cooling rate and gas content create other textures (see Figure 4.14 for examples of different textures). Lavas that cool extremely rapidly may have a glassy texture. Those with many holes from gas bubbles have a vesicular texture. 
Igneous  Rock  Classification 	  Igneous rocks are classified by their composition, from felsic to ultramafic. The characteristics and example minerals in each type are included in Table 4.3.

Granite 	  Some of the rocks in the Table 4.4 were pictured earlier in this chapter. Look back at them and, using what you know about the size of crystals in extrusive and intrusive rocks and the composition of felsic and mafic rocks, identify the rocks in the following photos in Figure 4.15: 
Uses of  Igneous  Rocks 	  Igneous rocks have a wide variety of uses. One important use is as stone for buildings and statues. Granite is used for both of these purposes and is popular for kitchen countertops ( Figure 4.16). Pumice, shown in Figure 4.14, is commonly used as an abrasive. Pumice is used to smooth skin or scrape up grime around the house. When pumice is placed into giant washing machines with newly manufactured jeans and tumbled, the result is stone-washed jeans. Ground up pumice stone is sometimes added to toothpaste to act as an abrasive material to scrub teeth. Peridotite is sometimes mined for peridot, a type of olivine that is used in jewelry. Diorite was used extensively by ancient civilizations for vases and other decorative artwork and is still used for art today ( Figure 4.17). 
Lesson  Summary 	  Igneous rocks form either when they cool very slowly deep within the Earth (intrusive) or when magma cools rapidly at the Earths surface (extrusive). Rock may melt to create magma if temperature increases, pressure decreases, or water is added. Different minerals melt at different temperatures. Igneous rocks are classified on their composition and grain size, which indicates whether they are intrusive or extrusive. Granite is an igneous rock used commonly in statues and building materials.

Introduction 	  The White House of the USA is made of a sedimentary rock called sandstone. The White House (shown in the Figure 4.18) is the official home and workplace of the President of the United States of America. Why do you think the White House is white? If you answered, Because it is made of white rock, you would be only partially correct. Construction for the White House began in 1792. Its outside walls are made of the sedimentary rock sandstone. This sandstone is very porous and is easily penetrated by rainwater. Water damage was common in the early days of construction for the building. To stop the water damage, workers covered the sandstone in a mixture of salt, rice, and glue, which help to give the White House its distinctive white color. 
Sediments 	  Sandstone is one of the common types of sedimentary rocks that form from sediments. There are many other types. Sediments may include: fragments of other rocks that often have been worn down into small pieces, such as sand, silt, or clay. organic materials, or the remains of once-living organisms. chemical precipitates, which are materials that get left behind after the water evaporates from a solution. Rocks at the surface undergo mechanical and chemical weathering. These physical and chemical processes break rock into smaller pieces. Physical weathering simply breaks the rocks apart. Chemical weathering dissolves the less stable minerals. These original elements of the minerals end up in solution and new minerals may form. Sediments are removed and transported by water, wind, ice, or gravity in a process called erosion ( Figure 4.19). Much more information about weathering can be found in the Weathering and Formation of Soil chapter. Erosion is described in detail in the Erosion and Deposition chapter. Streams carry huge amounts of sediment ( Figure 4.20). The more energy the water has, the larger the particle it can carry. A rushing river on a steep slope might be able to carry boulders. As this stream slows down, it no longer has the energy to carry large sediments and will drop them. A slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles. Sediments are deposited on beaches and deserts, at the bottom of oceans, and in lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, and swamps. Avalanches drop large piles of sediment. Glaciers leave large piles of sediments, too. Wind can only transport sand and smaller particles. The type of sediment that is deposited will determine the type of sedimentary rock that can form. Different colors of sedimentary rock are determined by the environment where they are deposited. Red rocks form where oxygen is present. Darker sediments form when the environment is oxygen poor. 
Sedimentary  Rock  Formation 	  Accumulated sediments harden into rock by lithification, as illustrated in the Figure 4.21. Two important steps are needed for sediments to lithify. The sediment size in clastic sedimentary rocks varies greatly (see Table 4.5).

Sands 	  This cliff is made of sandstone. were deposited and then lithified. A river dumps sediments along its bed and on its banks. When sediments settle out of calmer water, they form horizontal layers. One layer is deposited first, and another layer is deposited on top of it. So each layer is younger than the layer beneath it. When the sediments harden, the layers are preserved. Sedimentary rocks formed by the crystallization of chemical precipitates are called chemical sedimentary rocks. As discussed in the Earths Minerals chapter, dissolved ions in fluids precipitate out of the fluid and settle out, just like the halite in Figure 4.22. Biochemical sedimentary rocks form in the ocean or a salt lake. Living creatures remove ions, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, from the water to make shells or soft tissue. When the organism dies, it sinks to the ocean floor to become a biochemical sediment, which may then become compacted and cemented into solid rock ( Figure 4.23).

Uses of  Sedimentary  Rocks 	  Sedimentary rocks are used as building stones, although they are not as hard as igneous or metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary rocks are used in construction. Sand and gravel are used to make concrete; they are also used in asphalt. Many economically valuable resources come from sedimentary rocks. Iron ore and aluminum are two examples. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Weathering and erosion produce sediments. Sediments are transported by water, wind, ice, or gravity. After sediments are deposited, they undergo compaction and/or cementation to become sedimentary rocks. Biochemical sedimentary rocks form when living creatures using ions in water to create shells, bones, or soft tissue die and fall to the bottom as sediments.

Describe how metamorphic rocks form. Describe the properties of some common metamorphic rocks. Relate some common uses of metamorphic rocks. contact metamorphism foliation regional metamorphism 
Introduction 	  In the large outcrop of metamorphic rocks in Figure 4.24, the rocks platy appearance is a result of the process metamorphism. Metamorphism is the addition of heat and/or pressure to existing rocks, which causes them to change physically and/or chemically so that they become a new rock. Metamorphic rocks may change so much that they may not resemble the original rock. The platy layers in this large outcrop of metamorphic rock show the effects of pressure on rocks during metamorphism. 
Metamorphism 	  Any type of rock igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic can become a metamorphic rock. All that is needed is enough heat and/or pressure to alter the existing rocks physical or chemical makeup without melting the rock entirely. Rocks change during metamorphism because the minerals need to be stable under the new temperature and pressure conditions. The need for stability may cause the structure of minerals to rearrange and form new minerals. Ions may move between minerals to create minerals of different chemical composition. Hornfels, with its alternating bands of dark and light crystals, is a good example of how minerals rearrange themselves during metamorphism. Hornfels is shown in Table 4.7. Extreme pressure may also lead to foliation, the flat layers that form in rocks as the rocks are squeezed by pressure ( Figure 4.25). Foliation normally forms when pressure is exerted in only one direction. Metamorphic rocks may also be non-foliated. Quartzite and limestone, shown in Table 4.7, are nonfoliated. The two main types of metamorphism are both related to heat within Earth: Table 4.7 shows some common metamorphic rocks and their original parent rock.

Uses of  Metamorphic  Rocks 	  Quartzite and marble are commonly used for building materials and artwork. Marble is beautiful for statues and decorative items such as vases (see an example in Figure 4.26). Ground up marble is also a component of toothpaste, plastics, and paper. Quartzite is very hard and is often crushed and used in building railroad tracks (see Figure 4.27). Schist and slate are sometimes used as building and landscape materials. Graphite, the lead in pencils, is a mineral commonly found in metamorphic rocks. Crushed quartzite is sometimes placed under railroad tracks because it is very hard and durable. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Metamorphic rocks form when heat and pressure transform an existing rock into a new rock. Contact metamorphism occurs when hot magma transforms the rock that it contacts. Regional metamorphism transforms large areas of existing rocks under the tremendous heat and pressure created by geologic processes. Film: The Living Rock: Earths Continental Crust URL k .

Chapter  Outline 	  Much of Earths energy comes from the Sun. Nearly all life on Earth depends on solar energy since plants use sunlight to make food through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis was the process that fed plants and animals, which in turn, over the course of millions of years, became fossil fuels. The Sun heats some areas of Earth more than other areas, which causes wind. The Suns energy also drives the water cycle, which moves water over the surface of the Earth. Some of these types of energy can be harnessed for use by people. The other main source of energy is Earths internal heat. This heat has two origins: the breakdown of chemical elements by radioactivity, and the heat that is left over from when the planet came together. These two sources will be described in more detail in later chapters. Courtesy of NASA. earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=43717. Public Domain.

Introduction 	  Everything requires energy. Even when you are sitting as still as you possibly can, your body is using energy to breathe, circulate blood, digest food, and perform many other functions. Producing light or heat requires energy. Making something requires energy. Plants and animals all require energy to function. To repeat, everything requires energy! 
The  Need for  Energy 	  Energy is the ability to do work or produce change. Every living thing needs energy to perform its daily functions and even more energy to grow. Plants get energy from the food they make by photosynthesis, and animals get energy directly or indirectly from that food. People also use energy for many things, such as cooking food, keeping ice cream cold in the freezer, heating a house, constructing a skyscraper, or lighting their homes. Because billions of people all around the world use energy, there is a huge need for energy resources ( Figure 5.1). Energy conservation is something everyone can do now to help reduce the strain on energy resources. The law of conservation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed. This means that even though energy changes form, the total amount of energy always stays the same. How does energy get converted from one Electrical transmission towers like the one shown in this picture help deliver the electricity people use for energy every day. type to another when you kick a soccer ball? When your body breaks down the food you eat, it stores the energy from the food as chemical energy. Chemical energy is stored within chemical bonds. But some of this stored energy has to be released to make your leg muscles move. The chemical energy is converted to another form of energy called kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of anything in motion. Your muscles move your leg, your foot kicks the ball, and the ball gains kinetic energy from the kick. So you can think of the action of kicking the ball as a story of energy changing forms. To learn the quadratic equations related to getting a rapidly moving car to overcome its kinetic energy and come to a stop, watch this video ( IE 1e): URL (6:01). Potential energy is energy that is stored. Potential energy has the potential to do work or the potential to be converted into other forms of energy. If a ball is sitting on the very edge at the top of the hill, it is not moving, but it has a lot of potential energy. Animations showing the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy can be seen at the following sites: URL URL URL 
Energy,  Fuel, and  Heat 	  If you read a book beneath a lit lamp, that lamp has energy from electricity. The energy to make the electricity comes from fuel. Fuel has energy that it releases. A fuel is any material that can release energy in a chemical change. What are some examples of fuel, and what are they used for? For a fuel to be useful, its energy must be released in a way that can be controlled. Controlling the release of energy makes it possible for the energy to be used to do work. When fuel is used for its energy, it is usually burned, and most of the energy is released as heat ( Figure 5.2). The heat may then be used to do work. Think of a person striking a match to set some small twigs on fire. After the twigs burn for a while, they get hot enough to make some larger sticks burn. The fire keeps getting hotter, and soon it is hot enough to burn whole logs. Pretty soon the fire is roaring, and a pot of water placed on the fire starts to boil. Some of the liquid water evaporates. What is the source of energy for boiling and evaporating the water? Although some chemical energy from the match was put into starting the fire, the heat to boil and evaporate the water comes from the energy that was stored in the wood. The wood is the fuel for the fire. 
Types of  Energy  Resources 	  Energy resources are either renewable or non-renewable. Non-renewable resources are used faster than they can be replaced,so the supply available to society is limited (see example in Figure 5.3). Renewable resources will not run out because they are replaced as quickly as they are used. Can you think of some renewable and non-renewable energy sources? 
Non-renewable  Resources 	  Fossil fuels coal, oil, and natural gas are the most common example of non-renewable energy resources. Fossil fuels are formed from fossils, the partially decomposed remains of once living plants and animals. These fossils took millions of years to form. When fossil fuels are burned for energy, they release pollutants into the atmosphere. Fossil fuels also release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which are causing global temperatures to rise. The environmental effects of fossil fuel use are discussed in the Climate and Human Actions and the Atmosphere chapters. 
Renewable  Resources 	  Renewable energy resources include solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal. These resources are either virtually limitless like the Sun, which will continue to shine for billions of years, or will be replaced faster than we can use them. Amounts of falling water or wind will change over the course of time, but they are quite abundant. Biomass energy, like wood for fire, can be replaced quickly. The use of renewable resources may also cause problems. Some are expensive, while some, such as trees, have other uses. Some cause environmental problems. As the technology improves and more people use renewable energy, the prices may come down. At the same time, as we use up fossil fuels, coal, oil, and natural gas, these non-renewable resources will become more expensive. At some point, even if renewable energy costs are high, non-renewable energy will be even more expensive. Ultimately, we will have to use renewable sources. 
Important  Things to  Consider about  Energy  Resources 	  With both renewable and non-renewable resources, there are at least two important things to consider. One is that we have to have a practical way to turn the resource into a useful form of energy. The other is that we have to consider what happens when we turn the resource into energy. For example, if we get much less energy from burning a fuel than we put into making it, then that fuel is probably not a practical energy resource. On the other hand, if another fuel gives us large amounts of energy but creates large amounts of pollution, that fuel also may not be the best choice for an energy resource. 
D:  Climate  Watch:  Unlocking the  Grid 	  Today we rely on electricity more than ever, but the resources that currently supply our power are finite. The race is on to harness more renewable resources, but getting all that clean energy from production sites to homes and businesses is proving to be a major challenge. Learn more by watching the resource below: URL quest/television/climate-watch-unlocking-the-grid . 
Lesson  Summary 	  According to the law of conservation of energy, energy is neither created nor destroyed. Renewable resources can be replaced at the rate they are being used. Non-renewable resources are available in limited amounts or are being used faster than they can be replaced. Kydes, Andy, Primary Energy. Encyclopedia of Earth, 2006.

Introduction 	  Millions of years ago, plants used energy from the Sun to form sugars, carbohydrates, and other energy-rich carbon compounds that were later transformed into coal, oil, or natural gas. The solar energy stored in these fuels is a rich source of energy. Although fossil fuels provide very high quality energy, they are non-renewable. In large part, non-renewable energy sources are responsible for the worlds lights seen in this animation: URL ww.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/animate/LIGHTS_3.MPG . 
Formation of  Fossil  Fuels 	  Can you name some fossils? How about dinosaur bones or dinosaur footprints? Animal skeletons, teeth, shells, coprolites (otherwise known as feces), or any other remains or trace from a living creature that becomes a rock is a fossil. The same processes that formed these fossils also created some of our most important energy resources, fossil fuels. Coal, oil, and natural gas are fossil fuels. Fossil fuels come from living matter starting about 500 million years ago. As plants and animals died, their remains settled on the ground on land and in swamps, lakes, and seas ( Figure 5.4). This wetland may look something like an ancient coal-forming swamp. Over time, layer upon layer of these remains accumulated. Eventually, the layers were buried so deeply that they were crushed by an enormous mass of earth. The weight of this earth pressing down on these plant and animal remains created intense heat and pressure. After millions of years of heat and pressure, the material in these layers turned into chemicals called hydrocarbons ( Figure 5.5). An animated view of a hydrocarbon is seen here: URL ww.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/oilgas/CH4_3.MPG . Hydrocarbons are made of carbon and hydrogen atoms. This molecule with one carbon and four hydrogen atoms is methane. Hydrocarbons can be solid, liquid, or gaseous. The solid form is what we know as coal. The liquid form is petroleum, or crude oil. Natural gas is the gaseous form. 
Coal 	  Coal, a solid fossil fuel formed from the partially decomposed remains of ancient forests, is burned primarily to produce electricity. Coal use is undergoing enormous growth as the availability of oil and natural gas decreases and cost increases. This increase in coal use is happening particularly in developing nations, such as China, where coal is cheap and plentiful. 
Coal  Formation 	  Coal forms from dead plants that settled at the bottom of ancient swamps. Lush coal swamps were common in the tropics during the Carboniferous period, which took place more than 300 million years ago ( Figure 5.6). The climate was warmer then. The location of the continents during the Carboniferous period. Notice that quite a lot of land area is in the region of the tropics. Mud and other dead plants buried the organic material in the swamp, and burial kept oxygen away. When plants are buried without oxygen, the organic material can be preserved or fossilized. Sand and clay settling on top of the decaying plants squeezed out the water and other substances. Millions of years later, what remains is a carboncontaining rock that we know as coal. Coal is black or brownish-black. The most common form of coal is bituminous, a sedimentary rock that contains impurities such as sulfur ( Figure 5.7). Anthracite coal, seen in Figure 5.3, has been metamorphosed and is nearly all carbon. For this reason, anthracite coal burns more cleanly than bituminous coal. 
Coal  Use 	  Around the world, coal is the largest source of energy for electricity. The United States is rich in coal ( Figure 5.8). California once had a number of small coal mines, but the state no longer produces coal. To turn coal into electricity, the rock is crushed into powder, which is then burned in a furnace that has a boiler. Like other fuels, coal releases its energy as heat when it burns. Heat from the burning coal boils the water in the boiler to make steam. The steam spins turbines, which turn generators to create electricity. In this way, the energy stored in the coal is converted to useful energy like electricity. United States coal-producing regions in 1996. Orange is highest grade anthracite; red is low volatile bituminous; gray and gray-green is medium to high-volatile bituminous; green is subbituminous; and yellow is the lowest grade lignite. Coal that has been located but is not being used is part of our reserves. Reserves are important because if the price of the resource goes up or the cost of extracting it goes down, they may be useful. 
Consequences of  Coal  Use 	  For coal to be used as an energy source, it must first be mined. Coal mining occurs at the surface or underground by methods that are described in the Earths Minerals chapter ( Figure 5.9). Mining, especially underground mining, can be dangerous. In April 2010, 29 miners were killed at a West Virginia coal mine when gas that had accumulated in the mine tunnels exploded and started a fire. Some possible types of environmental damage from mining are discussed in the Earths Minerals chapter. Coal mining exposes minerals and rocks from underground to air and water at the surface. Many of these minerals contain the element sulfur, which mixes with air and water to make sulfuric acid, a highly corrosive chemical. If the sulfuric acid gets into streams, it can kill fish, plants, and animals that live in or near the water. 
Oil 	  Oil is a liquid fossil fuel that is extremely useful because it can be transported easily and can be used in cars and other vehicles. Oil is currently the single largest source of energy in the world. 
Oil  Formation 	  Oil from the ground is called crude oil, which is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons. Crude oil is a thick dark brown or black liquid hydrocarbon. Oil also forms from buried dead organisms, but these are tiny organisms that live on the sea surface and then sink to the seafloor when they die. The dead organisms are kept away from oxygen by layers of other dead creatures and sediments. As the layers pile up, heat and pressure increase. Over millions of years, the dead organisms turn into liquid oil. 
Oil  Production 	  In order to be collected, the oil must be located between a porous rock layer and an impermeable layer ( Figure 5.10). Trapped above the porous rock layer and beneath the impermeable layer, the oil will remain between these layers until it is extracted from the rock. Oil (red) is found in the porous rock layer (yellow) and trapped by the impermeable layer (brown). The folded structure has allowed the oil to pool so a well can be drilled into the reservoir. An animation of an oil deposit forming is shown here: URL /ENTRAP_3.MPG . The oil pocket is then drilled into from the surface. An animation of an oil deposit being drilled is shown here: URL . Sideways drilling allows a deposit that lies beneath land that cannot be drilled to be mined for oil: URL ww.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/oilgas/HORDRI_3.MPG . To separate the different types of hydrocarbons in crude oil for different uses, the crude oil must be refined in refineries like the one shown in Figure 5.11. Refining is possible because each hydrocarbon in crude oil boils at a different temperature. When the oil is boiled in the refinery, separate equipment collects the different compounds. Refineries like this one separate crude oil into many useful fuels and other chemicals. 
Oil  Use 	  Most of the compounds that come out of the refining process are fuels, such as gasoline, diesel, and heating oil. Because these fuels are rich sources of energy and can be easily transported, oil provides about 90% of the energy used for transportation around the world. The rest of the compounds from crude oil are used for waxes, plastics, fertilizers, and other products. Gasoline is in a convenient form for use in cars and other transportation vehicles. In a car engine, the burned gasoline mostly turns into carbon dioxide and water vapor. The fuel releases most of its energy as heat, which causes the gases to expand. This creates enough force to move the pistons inside the engine and to power the car. 
Consequences of  Oil  Use 	  The United States does produce oil, but the amount produced is only about one-quarter as much as the nation uses. The United States has only about 1.5% of the worlds proven oil reserves, and so most of the oil used by Americans must be imported from other nations. The main oil-producing regions in the United States are the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Alaska, and California. Most offshore drilling occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, but there are offshore platforms in California as well ( Figure 5.12). An animation of the location of petroleum basins in the contiguous United States can be seen here: URL e.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/oilgas/BASINS_3.MPG . As in every type of mining, mining for oil has environmental consequences. Oil rigs are unsightly ( Figure 5.13), and spills are too common ( Figure 5.14). 
Drill rigs at the  San  Ardo  Oil  Field in 	  Monterey, California. A deadly explosion on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 led to a massive oil spill. When this picture was taken in July 2010, oil was still spewing into the Gulf. The long-term consequences of the spill are being studied and are as yet unknown. 
Natural  Gas 	  Natural gas, often known simply as gas, is composed mostly of the hydrocarbon methane (refer to Figure 5.5 for the structure). 
Natural  Gas  Formation 	  Natural gas forms under the same conditions that create oil. Organic material buried in the sediments harden to become a shale formation that is the source of the gas. Although natural gas forms at higher temperatures than crude oil, the two are often found together. The formation of a minable oil and gas deposit is seen in this animation: URL gsnps/oilgas/PETSYS_3.MPG . The largest natural gas reserves in the United States are in the Appalachian Basin, Texas, and the Gulf of Mexico region ( Figure 5.15). California also has natural gas, found mostly in the Central Valley. In the northern Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento Delta, a sediment-filled trough formed along a location where crust was pushed together (an ancient convergent margin). An animation of global natural gas reserves is seen here: URL lgas/GLOBE_3.MPG . 
Natural  Gas  Use 	  Like crude oil, natural gas must be processed before it can be used as a fuel. Some of the chemicals in unprocessed natural gas are poisonous to humans. Other chemicals, such as water, make the gas less useful as a fuel. Processing natural gas removes almost everything except the methane. Once the gas is processed, it is ready to be delivered and used. Natural gas is delivered to homes for uses such as cooking and heating. Like coal and oil, natural gas is also burned to generate heat for powering turbines. The spinning turbines turn generators, and the generators create electricity. 
Consequences of  Natural  Gas  Use 	  Natural gas burns much cleaner than other fossil fuels, meaning that it causes less air pollution. Natural gas also produces less carbon dioxide than other fossil fuels do for the same amount of energy, so its global warming effects are less ( Figure 5.16). See the pollution created by a car burning gasoline and a car burning natural gas in this animation: URL ww.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/oilgas/GASPOL_3.MPG . Unfortunately, drilling for natural gas can be environmentally destructive. One technique used is hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, which increases the rate of recovery of natural gas. Fluids are pumped through a borehole to create fractures in the reservoir rock that contains the natural gas. Material is added to the fluid to prevent the fractures from closing. The damage comes primarily from chemicals in the fracturing fluids. Chemicals that have been found in the fluids may be carcinogens (cancer-causing), radioactive materials, or endocrine disruptors, which interrupt hormones in the bodies of humans and animals. The fluids may get into groundwater or may runoff into streams and other surface waters. 
Fossil  Fuel  Reserves 	  Fossil fuels provide about 85% of the worlds energy at this time. Worldwide fossil fuel usage has increased many times over in the past half century (coal 2.6x, oil 8x, natural gas 14x) because of population increases, because of increases in the number of cars, televisions, and other fuel-consuming uses in the developed world, and because of lifestyle improvements in the developing world. Past and predicted use of different types of energy in the United States can be seen in this animation: URL ww.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/oilgas/MAXGAS_3.MPG . The amount of fossil fuels that remain untapped is unknown but can likely be measured in decades for oil and natural gas and in a few centuries for coal ( Figure 5.17). Alternative sources of fossil fuels, such as oil shales and tar sands, are increasingly being exploited ( Figure 5.18). The environmental consequences of mining these fuels, and of fossil fuel use in general, along with the fact that these fuels do not have a limitless supply, are prompting the development of alternative energy sources. 
Nuclear  Energy 	  When the nucleus of an atom is split, it releases a huge amount of energy called nuclear energy. For nuclear energy to be used as a power source, scientists and engineers have learned to split nuclei and to control the release of energy ( Figure 5.19). 
Nuclear  Energy  Use 	  Nuclear power plants, such as the one seen in Figure 5.20, use uranium, which is mined, processed, and then concentrated into fuel rods. When the uranium atoms in the fuel rods are hit by other extremely tiny particles, they split apart. The number of tiny particles allowed to hit the fuel rods needs to be controlled or they would cause a dangerous explosion. The energy from a nuclear power plant heats water, which creates steam and causes a turbine to spin. The spinning turbine turns a generator, which in turn produces electricity. Many countries around the world use nuclear energy as a source of electricity. In the United States, a little less than 20% of electricity comes from nuclear energy. 
Consequences of  Nuclear  Power 	  Nuclear power is clean. It does not pollute the air or release carbon dioxide. However, the use of nuclear energy does create other environmental problems. Uranium must be mined ( Figure 5.21). The process of splitting atoms Nuclear power plants like this one provide France with almost 80% of its electricity. creates radioactive waste, which remains dangerous for thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. As yet, there is no long-term solution for storing this waste. The development of nuclear power plants has been on hold for three decades. Accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, Ukraine verified peoples worst fears about the dangers of harnessing nuclear power ( Figure 5.22). Recently, nuclear power appeared to be making a comeback as society looked for alternatives to fossil fuels. But the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan may have resulted in a new fear of nuclear power. The cause of the disaster was a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami, which compromised the plant. Although a total meltdown was averted, the plant experienced multiple partial meltdowns, core breaches, radiation releases, and cooling failures. The plant is scheduled for a complete cold shutdown before the end of 2011. 
D:  Nuclear  Energy  Use 	  Nuclear power is a controversial subject in California and most other places. Nuclear power has no pollutants including carbon emissions, but power plants are not always safe and the long-term disposal of wastes is a problem Uranium mine in Kakadu National Park, Australia.

Lesson  Summary 	  Fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy that produce environmental damage. Coal, oil, and natural gas are fossil fuels formed from the remains of living organisms. Coal is the largest source of energy for producing electricity. Oil and natural gas are important energy sources for vehicles and electricity generation. Nuclear energy is produced by splitting atoms. It also produces radioactive wastes that are very dangerous for many years. Perry, Mildred, Coal. Encyclopedia of Earth, 2007.

Introduction 	  Fossil fuels have the advantage of being cheap and transportable, but they cause environmental damage and will eventually run out. Renewable energy sources, by definition, will not run out, and most do not cause much pollution. But renewable energy sources do have a downside, too. Both the advantages and disadvantages of solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy will be described in this lesson. 
Solar  Power 	  The Sun is Earths main source of energy, making the development of solar power a natural choice for an alternative energy source. 
Solar  Energy 	  Energy from the Sun comes from the lightest element, hydrogen, fusing together to create the second lightest element, helium. Nuclear fusion releases tremendous amounts of solar energy. The energy travels to the Earth, mostly as visible light. The light carries the energy through the empty space between the Sun and the Earth as radiation. 
Solar  Power  Use 	  Solar energy has been used for power on a small scale for hundreds of years, and plants have used it for billions of year. Unlike energy from fossil fuels, which almost always come from a central power plant or refinery, solar power can be harnessed locally ( Figure 5.23). A set of solar panels on a homes rooftop can be used to heat water for a swimming pool or can provide electricity to the house. Solar panels supply power to the International Space Station. Societys use of solar power on a larger scale is just starting to increase. Scientists and engineers have very active, ongoing research into new ways to harness energy from the Sun more efficiently. Because of the tremendous amount of incoming sunlight, solar power is being developed in the United States in southeastern California, Nevada, and Arizona. Solar power plants turn sunlight into electricity using a large group of mirrors to focus sunlight on one place, called a receiver ( Figure 5.24). A liquid, such as oil or water, flows through this receiver and is heated to a high temperature by the focused sunlight. The heated liquid transfers its heat to a nearby object that is at a lower temperature through a process called conduction. The energy conducted by the heated liquid is used to make electricity. A video of how solar energy can be concentrated so that it can be used for power: URL imedia/video_csp.html . 
Consequences of  Solar  Power  Use 	  Solar energy has many benefits. It is extremely abundant, widespread, and will never run out. But there are problems with the widespread use of solar power. Sunlight must be present. Solar power is not useful in locations that are often cloudy or at night. However, storage technology is being developed. The technology needed for solar power is still expensive. An increase in interested customers will provide incentive for companies to research and develop new technologies and to figure out how to mass-produce existing technologies ( Figure 5.25). Solar panels require a lot of space. Fortunately, solar panels can be placed on any rooftop to supply at least some of the power required for a home or business. This experimental car is one example of the many uses that engineers have found for solar energy. 
Water  Power 	  Water covers 70% of the planets surface, and water power (hydroelectric power) is the most widely used form of renewable energy in the world. Hydroelectric power from streams provides almost one fifth of the worlds electricity. 
Hydroelectric  Power 	  Remember that potential energy is the energy of an object waiting to fall. Water held behind a dam has a lot of potential energy. In a hydroelectric plant, a dam across a riverbed holds a stream to create a reservoir. Instead of flowing down its normal channel, the water is allowed to flow into a large turbine. As the water moves, it has kinetic energy, which makes the turbine spin. The turbine is connected to a generator, which makes electricity ( Figure Most of the streams in the United States and elsewhere in the developed world that are suitable for hydroelectric power have already been dammed ( Figure 5.27). In California, about 14.5% of the total electricity comes from hydropower. The states nearly 400 hydropower plants are mostly located in the eastern mountain ranges where large streams descend down a steep grade. 
Consequences of  Water  Power  Use 	  The major benefit of hydropower is that it generates power without releasing any pollution. Hydropower is also a renewable resource since the stream will keep on flowing. However, there are a limited number of suitable dam sites. Hydropower also has environmental problems. When a large dam disrupts a rivers flow, it changes the ecosystem upstream. As the land is flooded by rising water, plants and animals are displaced or killed. Many beautiful landscapes, villages, and archeological sites have been drowned by the water in a reservoir ( Figure 5.28). The dam and turbines also change the downstream environment for fish and other living things. Dams slow the release of silt so that downstream deltas retreat and seaside cities become dangerously exposed to storms and rising Hydroelectric dams like this one use the power of moving water to create electricity. Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona created Lake Powell. The dam was controversial because it flooded Glen Canyon, a beautiful desert canyon. sea levels. 
Ocean  Water  Power 	  The energy of waves and tides can be used to produce water power. Tidal power stations may need to close off a narrow bay or estuary. Wave power applications have to be able to withstand coastal storms and the corrosion of seawater. Because of the many problems with them, tide and wave power plants are not very common. 
D:  Harnessing  Power from the  Sea 	  Although not yet widely used, many believe tidal power has more potential than wind or solar power for meeting alternative energy needs. Quest radio looks at plans for harnessing power from the sea by San Francisco and along the northern California coast. Learn more at: URL 
Wind  Power 	  Wind power is the fastest growing renewable energy source in the world. Windmills are now seen in many locations, either individually or, more commonly, in large fields. Wind Powering America follows the development of wind power in the United States over the past several years: URL . 
Wind  Energy 	  Energy from the Sun also creates wind, which can be used as wind power. The Sun heats different locations on Earth by different amounts. Air that becomes warm rises and then sucks cooler air into that spot. The movement of air from one spot to another along the ground creates wind. Since wind is moving, it has kinetic energy. 
Wind  Power  Use 	  Wind is the source of energy for wind power. Wind has been used for power for centuries. For example, windmills were used to grind grain and pump water. Sailing ships traveled by wind power long before ships were powered by fossil fuels. Wind can be used to generate electricity, as the moving air spins a turbine to create electricity ( Figure 5.29). This animation shows how wind power works: URL pic=10501 . 
Consequences of  Wind  Power 	  Wind power has many advantages. It does not burn, so it does not release pollution or carbon dioxide. Also, wind is plentiful in many places. Wind, however, does not blow all of the time, even though power is needed all of the time. Just as with solar power, engineers are working on technologies that can store wind power for later use. Windmills are expensive and wear out quickly. A lot of windmills are needed to power a region, so nearby residents may complain about the loss of a nice view if a wind farm is built. Coastlines typically receive a lot of wind, but wind farms built near beaches may cause unhappiness for local residents and tourists. The Cape Wind Project off of Cape Cod has been approved but is generating much controversy. Opponents are in favor of green power but not at that location. Proponents say that clean energy is needed and the project would supply 75% of the electricity needed for Cape Cod and nearby islands ( Figure 5.30). California was an early adopter of wind power. Windmills are found in mountain passes where the cooler Pacific Ocean air is sucked through on its way to warmer inland valleys. Large fields of windmills can be seen at Altamont Wind turbines like the ones shown here turn wind into electricity without creating pollution. pass in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area, San Gorgonio Pass east of Los Angeles, and Tehachapi Pass at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. 
Geothermal  Power 	  Geothermal energy comes from heat deep below the surface of the Earth. Nothing must be done to the geothermal energy. It is a resource that can be used without processing. 
Geothermal  Energy 	  The heat that is used for geothermal power may come to the surface naturally as hot springs or geysers, like The Geysers in northern California. Where water does not naturally come to the surface, engineers may pump cool water into the ground. The water is heated by the hot rock and then pumped back to the surface for use. The hot water or steam from a geothermal well spins a turbine to make electricity. Geothermal energy is clean and safe. The energy source is renewable since hot rock is found everywhere in the Earth, although in many parts of the world the hot rock is not close enough to the surface for building geothermal power plants. In some areas, geothermal power is common ( Figure 5.31). In the United States, California is a leader in producing geothermal energy. The largest geothermal power plant in the state is in the Geysers Geothermal Resource Area in Napa and Sonoma Counties, north of San Francisco. The source of heat is thought to be a large magma chamber lying beneath the area. 
D:  Geothermal  Heats  Up 	  Where Earths internal heat gets close to the surface, geothermal power is a clean source of energy. In California, The Geysers supplies energy for many nearby homes and businesses. Learn more at: URL t/video/geothermal-heats-up/ . A geothermal energy plant in Iceland. Iceland gets about one fourth of its electricity from geothermal sources. 
Biomass 	  Biomass is the material that comes from plants and animals that were recently living. Biomass can be burned directly, such as setting fire to wood. For as long as humans have had fire, people have used biomass for heating and cooking. People can also process biomass to make fuel, called biofuel. Biofuel can be created from crops, such as corn or algae, and processed for use in a car ( Figure 5.32). The advantage to biofuels is that they burn more cleanly than fossil fuels. As a result, they create less pollution and less carbon dioxide. Critics say, however, that the amount of energy, fertilizer, and land needed to produce the crops used make biofuels only a slightly better alternative than fossil fuels. Biofuels, such as ethanol, are added to gasoline to cut down the amount of fossil fuels that are used. KQED: How Green is Biomass Energy? Organic material, like almond shells, can be made into electricity. Biomass power is a great use of wastes and is more reliable than other renewable energy sources, but harvesting biomass energy uses energy and biomass plants produce pollutants including greenhouse gases.

Algae  Power 	  Many people think that the best source of biomass energy for the future is algae. Compared to corn, algae is not a food crop, it can grow in many places, its much easier to convert to a usable fuel and its carbon neutral. Learn more at: URL . 
Power  Up with  Leftovers 	  Food that is tossed out produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But that methane from leftovers can be harnessed and used as fuel. Sounds like a win-win situation. Learn more at:URL h-leftovers/ 
Lesson  Summary 	  Solar energy, water power, wind power, geothermal energy, and biomass energy are renewable energy sources. Solar energy can be used either by passively storing and holding the Suns heat, converting it to electricity, or concentrating it. There are many ways to use the energy of moving water, including hydroelectric dams and tidal and wave plants. Wind power uses the energy of moving air to turn turbines. Geothermal energy uses heat from deep within the earth to heat homes or produce steam that turns turbines. Biomass energy uses renewable materials such as wood or grains to produce energy.

What causes the high temperatures deep inside the Earth that make geothermal energy possible? Do you think your town or city could use wind or water power? 
S  Plate  Tectonics 	  Like just about everything in Earth Science, this strange feature is related to plate tectonics. Its really just a hot geyser like the ones found at Yellowstone National Park, except this geyser is found under 10,000 feet of seawater. These features, called hydrothermal vents, are found where lava eruptions hit seawater in regions where new ocean crust is being created. The hot water coming from the vent explodes from the release of pressure. Once in the cold seawater, sulfide minerals precipitate out, creating the smoke in the photo. As the sulfide minerals fall, they create the chimney-like structure in the photo. Many hydrothermal vents are home to unusual life forms. Courtesy of P.

S-waves 	  seismic waves 
Introduction 	  Before you can learn about plate tectonics, you need to know something about the layers that are found inside Earth. These layers are divided by composition into core, mantle, and crust or by mechanical properties into lithosphere and asthenosphere. Scientists use information from earthquakes and computer modeling to learn about Earths interior. 
Exploring  Earths  Interior 	  How do scientists know what is inside the Earth? We dont have direct evidence! Rocks yield some clues, but they only reveal information about the outer crust. In rare instances, a mineral, such as a diamond, comes to the surface from deeper down in the crust or the mantle. To learn about Earths interior, scientists use energy to see the different layers of the Earth, just like doctors can use an MRI, CT scan, or x-ray to see inside our bodies. 
Seismic  Waves 	  One ingenious way scientists learn about Earths interior is by looking at how energy travels from the point of an earthquake. These are seismic waves ( Figure 6.1). Seismic waves travel outward in all directions from where the ground breaks at an earthquake. These waves are picked up by seismographs around the world. Two types of seismic waves are most useful for learning about Earths interior. P-waves (primary waves) are fastest, traveling at about 6 to 7 kilometers (about 4 miles) per second, so they arrive first at the seismometer. P-waves move in a compression/expansion type motion, squeezing and unsqueezing earth materials as they travel. This produces a change in volume for the material. P-waves bend slightly when they travel from one layer into another. Seismic waves move faster through denser or more rigid material. As P-waves encounter the liquid outer core, which is less rigid than the mantle, they slow down. This makes the P-waves arrive later and further away than would be expected. The result is a P-wave shadow zone. No P-waves are picked up at seismographs 104 to 140 from the earthquakes focus. S-waves (secondary waves) are about half as fast as P-waves, traveling at about 3.5 km (2 miles) per second, and arrive second at seismographs. S-waves move in an up and down motion perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. This produces a change in shape for the earth materials they move through. Only solids resist a change in shape, so S-waves are only able to propagate through solids. S-waves cannot travel through liquid. By tracking seismic waves, scientists have learned what makes up the planets interior ( Figure 6.2). P-waves slow down at the mantle core boundary, so we know the outer core is less rigid than the mantle. S-waves disappear at the mantle core boundary, so the outer core is liquid. Letters describe the path of an individual P-wave or S-wave. Waves traveling through the core take on the letter K. This animation shows a seismic wave shadow zone: URL ash_title=Shadow+Zone&flash_file=shadowzone&flash_width=220&flash_height=320 . 
The  Earths  Layers 	  The layers scientists recognize are pictured in the Figure 6.4. Core, mantle, and crust are divisions based on composition: This meteorite contains silica minerals and iron-nickel. The material is like the boundary between Earths core and mantle. The meteorite is 4.2 billion years old. Lithosphere and asthenosphere are divisions based on mechanical properties: This animation shows the layers by composition and by mechanical properties: URL ers/t_tectonics/p_layers.html . 
Crust and  Lithosphere 	  Earths outer surface is its crust; a cold, thin, brittle outer shell made of rock. The crust is very thin, relative to the radius of the planet. There are two very different types of crust, each with its own distinctive physical and chemical properties, which are summarized in Table 6.1. 
Continental 	  Avg. 35 km (22 mi) 
All types 	  Oceanic crust is composed of mafic magma that erupts on the seafloor to create basalt lava flows or cools deeper down to create the intrusive igneous rock gabbro ( Figure 6.5). Sediments, primarily muds and the shells of tiny sea creatures, coat the seafloor. Sediment is thickest near the shore where it comes off the continents in rivers and on wind currents. Continental crust is made up of many different types of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. The average composition is granite, which is much less dense than the mafic rocks of the oceanic crust ( Figure 6.6). Because it is thick and has relatively low density, continental crust rises higher on the mantle than oceanic crust, which sinks into the mantle to form basins. When filled with water, these basins form the planets oceans. The lithosphere is the outermost mechanical layer, which behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. The lithosphere is about 100 kilometers thick. Look at Figure 6.4. Can you find where the crust and the lithosphere are located? How are they different from each other? The definition of the lithosphere is based on how earth materials behave, so it includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which are both brittle. Since it is rigid and brittle, when stresses act on the lithosphere, it breaks. This is what we experience as an earthquake. 
Mantle 	  The two most important things about the mantle are: (1) it is made of solid rock, and (2) it is hot. Scientists know that the mantle is made of rock based on evidence from seismic waves, heat flow, and meteorites. The properties fit the ultramafic rock peridotite, which is made of the ironand magnesium-rich silicate minerals ( Figure 6.7). Peridotite is rarely found at Earths surface. Peridotite is formed of crystals of olivine (green) and pyroxene (black). Scientists know that the mantle is extremely hot because of the heat flowing outward from it and because of its physical properties. Heat flows in two different ways within the Earth: Convection in the mantle is the same as convection in a pot of water on a stove. Convection currents within Earths mantle form as material near the core heats up. As the core heats the bottom layer of mantle material, particles move more rapidly, decreasing its density and causing it to rise. The rising material begins the convection current. When the warm material reaches the surface, it spreads horizontally. The material cools because it is no longer near the core. It eventually becomes cool and dense enough to sink back down into the mantle. At the bottom of the mantle, the material travels horizontally and is heated by the core. It reaches the location where warm mantle material rises, and the mantle convection cell is complete ( Figure 6.8). 
Core 	  At the planets center lies a dense metallic core. Scientists know that the core is metal because: If Earths core were not metal, the planet would not have a magnetic field. Metals such as iron are magnetic, but rock, which makes up the mantle and crust, is not. Scientists know that the outer core is liquid and the inner core is solid because: The heat that keeps the outer core from solidifying is produced by the breakdown of radioactive elements in the inner core. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Earth is made of three layers: the crust, mantle, and core. An iron meteorite is the closest thing to the Earths core that we can hold in our hands. The brittle crust and uppermost mantle are together called the lithosphere. Beneath the lithosphere, the mantle is solid rock that can flow, or behave plastically. The hot core warms the base of the mantle, which causes mantle convection. Oceanic crust is thinner and denser than continental crust. All crust sits atop the mantle. What might Earth be like if this were not true? If sediments fall onto the seafloor over time, what can sediment thickness tell scientists about the age of the seafloor in different regions? How might convection cells in the mantle affect the movement of solid crust on the planets surface? Explain the continental drift hypothesis. Describe the evidence Wegener used to support his continental drift idea. Describe later evidence for continental drift. apparent polar wander continental drift magnetic field magnetic polarity magnetite magnetometer 
Introduction 	  The continental drift hypothesis was developed in the early part of the 20th century, mostly by Alfred Wegener. Wegener said that continents move around on Earths surface and that they were once joined together as a single supercontinent. While Wegener was alive, scientists did not believe that the continents could move. 
The  Continental  Drift  Idea 	  Find a map of the continents and cut each one out. Better yet, use a map where the edges of the continents show the continental shelf. Thats the true size and shape of a continent. Can you fit the pieces together? The easiest link is between the eastern Americas and western Africa and Europe, but the rest can fit together too ( Figure 6.10). Alfred Wegener proposed that the continents were once united into a single supercontinent named Pangaea, meaning all earth in ancient Greek. He suggested that Pangaea broke up long ago and that the continents then moved to their current positions. He called his hypothesis continental drift. 
Evidence for  Continental  Drift 	  Besides the way the continents fit together, Wegener and his supporters collected a great deal of evidence for the continental drift hypothesis. The continents fit together like pieces of a puzzle. This is how they looked 250 million years ago. Identical rocks, of the same type and age, are found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Wegener said the rocks had formed side-by-side and that the land had since moved apart. Mountain ranges with the same rock types, structures, and ages are now on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The Appalachians of the eastern United States and Canada, for example, are just like mountain ranges in eastern Greenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway ( Figure 6.11). Wegener concluded that they formed as a single mountain range that was separated as the continents drifted. Ancient fossils of the same species of extinct plants and animals are found in rocks of the same age but are on continents that are now widely separated ( Figure 6.12). Wegener proposed that the organisms had lived side by side, but that the lands had moved apart after they were dead and fossilized. He suggested that the organisms would not have been able to travel across the oceans. Fossils of the seed fern Glossopteris were too heavy to be carried so far by wind. Mesosaurus was a swimming reptile but could only swim in fresh water. Cynognathus and Lystrosaurus were land reptiles and were unable to swim. Grooves and rock deposits left by ancient glaciers are found today on different continents very close to the equator. This would indicate that the glaciers either formed in the middle of the ocean and/or covered most of the Earth. Today glaciers only form on land and nearer the poles. Wegener thought that the glaciers were centered over the southern land mass close to the South Pole and the continents moved to their present positions later on. Coral reefs and coal-forming swamps are found in tropical and subtropical environments, but ancient coal seams and coral reefs are found in locations where it is much too cold today. Wegener suggested that these creatures were alive in warm climate zones and that the fossils and coal later had drifted to new locations on the continents. Wegener used fossil evidence to support his continental drift hypothesis. The fossils of these organisms are found on lands that are now far apart. An animation showing that Earths climate belts remain in roughly the same position while the continents move is seen here: URL . An animation showing how the continents split up can be found here: URL ica/ideas/gondwana2.html . Although Wegeners evidence was sound, most geologists at the time rejected his hypothesis of continental drift. Why do you think they did not accept continental drift? Scientists argued that there was no way to explain how solid continents could plow through solid oceanic crust. Wegeners idea was nearly forgotten until technological advances presented even more evidence that the continents moved and gave scientists the tools to develop a mechanism for Wegeners drifting continents. 
Magnetic  Polarity  Evidence 	  Puzzling new evidence came in the 1950s from studies on the Earths magnetic history ( Figure 6.13). Scientists used magnetometers, devices capable of measuring the magnetic field intensity, to look at the magnetic properties of rocks in many locations. Earths magnetic field is like a magnet with its north pole near the geographic North Pole and the south pole near the geographic South Pole. Magnetite crystals are like tiny magnets that point to the north magnetic pole as they crystallize from magma. The crystals record both the direction and strength of the magnetic field at the time. The direction is known as the fields magnetic polarity. Magnetic Polarity on the Same Continent with Rocks of Different Ages Geologists noted important things about the magnetic polarity of different aged rocks on the same continent: Magnetite crystals in fresh volcanic rocks point to the current magnetic north pole ( Figure 6.14) no matter what continent or where on the continent the rocks are located. Older rocks that are the same age and are located on the same continent point to the same location, but that location is not the current north magnetic pole. Older rock that are of different ages do not point to the same locations or to the current magnetic north pole. In other words, although the magnetite crystals were pointing to the magnetic north pole, the location of the pole seemed to wander. Scientists were amazed to find that the north magnetic pole changed location through time ( Figure 6.15). There are three possible explanations for this: Earths current north magnetic pole is in northern Canada. The location of the north magnetic north pole 80 million years before present (mybp), then 60, 40, 20, and now. Magnetic Polarity on Different Continents with Rocks of the Same Age Geologists noted that for rocks of the same age but on different continents, the little magnets pointed to different magnetic north poles. The scientists looked again at the three possible explanations. Only one can be correct. If the continents had remained fixed while the north magnetic pole moved, there must have been two separate north poles. Since there is only one north pole today, the only reasonable explanation is that the north magnetic pole has remained fixed but that the continents have moved. To test this, geologists fitted the continents together as Wegener had done. It worked! There has only been one magnetic north pole and the continents have drifted ( Figure 6.16). They named the phenomenon of the magnetic pole that seemed to move but actually did not apparent polar wander. This evidence for continental drift gave geologists renewed interest in understanding how continents could move about on the planets surface. On the left: The apparent north pole for Europe and North America if the continents were always in their current locations. The two paths merge into one if the continents are allowed to drift. 
Lesson  Summary 	  In the early part of the 20th century, scientists began to put together evidence that the continents could move around on Earths surface. The evidence for continental drift included the fit of the continents; the distribution of ancient fossils, rocks, and mountain ranges; and the locations of ancient climatic zones. Although the evidence for continental drift was extremely strong, scientists rejected the idea because no mechanism for how solid continents could move around on the solid earth was developed. The discovery of apparent polar wander renewed scientists interest in continental drift. Why is continental drift referred to as a hypothesis (or idea) and not a theory? What did Wegeners idea need for it to be accepted? What other explanations did scientists come up with to explain the evidence Wegener had for continental drift? Describe the main features of the seafloor. Explain what seafloor magnetism tells scientists about the seafloor. Describe the process of seafloor spreading. abyssal plains echo sounder seafloor spreading trench 
Introduction 	  World War II gave scientists the tools to find the mechanism for continental drift that had eluded Wegener. Maps and other data gathered during the war allowed scientists to develop the seafloor spreading hypothesis. This hypothesis traces oceanic crust from its origin at a mid-ocean ridge to its destruction at a deep sea trench and is the mechanism for continental drift. 
Seafloor  Bathymetry 	  During World War II, battleships and submarines carried echo sounders to locate enemy submarines ( Figure 6.17). Echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all directions, bounce off the nearest object, and then return to the ship. By knowing the speed of sound in seawater, scientists calculate the distance to the object based on the time it takes for the wave to make a round-trip. During the war, most of the sound waves ricocheted off the ocean bottom. This animation shows how sound waves are used to create pictures of the sea floor and ocean crust: URL e.ucsd.edu/eoc/teachers/t_tectonics/p_sonar.html . After the war, scientists pieced together the ocean depths to produce bathymetric maps, which reveal the features of the ocean floor as if the water were taken away. Even scientist were amazed that the seafloor was not completely flat ( Figure 6.18). The major features of the ocean basins and their colors on the map in Figure 6.18 include: mid-ocean ridges: rise up high above the deep seafloor as a long chain of mountains; e.g. the light blue gash in middle of Atlantic Ocean. This echo sounder has many beams and creates a three dimensional map of the seafloor. Early echo sounders had a single beam and created a line of depth measurements. deep sea trenches: found at the edges of continents or in the sea near chains of active volcanoes; e.g. the very deepest blue, off of western South America. abyssal plains: flat areas, although many are dotted with volcanic mountains; e.g. consistent blue off of southeastern South America. When they first observed these bathymetric maps, scientists wondered what had formed these features. 
Seafloor  Magnetism 	  Sometimes  no one really knows why  the magnetic poles switch positions. North becomes south and south becomes north. Normal polarity: north and south poles are aligned as they are now. Reversed polarity: north and south poles are in the opposite position. During WWII, magnetometers attached to ships to search for submarines located an astonishing feature: the normal and reversed magnetic polarity of seafloor basalts creates a pattern. Stripes of normal polarity and reversed polarity alternate across the ocean bottom. Stripes form mirror images on either side of the mid-ocean ridges ( Figure 6.19). Stripes end abruptly at the edges of continents, sometimes at a deep sea trench ( Figure 6.20). Magnetic polarity is normal at the ridge crest but reversed in symmetrical patterns away from the ridge center. This normal and reversed pattern continues across the seafloor. The characteristics of the rocks and sediments change with distance from the ridge axis as seen in the Table 6.2. TABLE 6.2: Characteristics of crustal rocks with distance from ridge axis

The oldest seafloor is near the edges of continents or deep sea trenches and is less than 180 million years old ( Figure 6.20). Since the oldest ocean crust is so much younger than the oldest continental crust, scientists realized that seafloor was being destroyed in a relatively short time. This 65 minute video explains The Role of Paleomagnetism in the Evolution of Plate Tectonic Theory: URL nline.wr.usgs.gov/calendar/2004/jul04.html . 
The  Seafloor  Spreading  Hypothesis 	  Scientists brought these observations together in the early 1960s to create the seafloor spreading hypothesis. In this hypothesis, hot buoyant mantle rises up a mid-ocean ridge, causing the ridge to rise upward ( Figure 6.21). The hot magma at the ridge erupts as lava that forms new seafloor. When the lava cools, the magnetite crystals take on the current magnetic polarity. As more lava erupts, it pushes the seafloor horizontally away from ridge axis. These animations show the creation of magnetic stripes of normal and reversed polarity at a mid-ocean ridge: URL ww.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/animate/A49.gif ; URL e/A55.gif . Magma at the mid-ocean ridge creates new seafloor. The magnetic stripes continue across the seafloor. As oceanic crust forms and spreads, moving away from the ridge crest, it pushes the continent away from the ridge axis. If the oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, it sinks into the trench and is lost into the mantle. The oldest crust is coldest and lies deepest in the ocean because it is less buoyant than the hot new crust. Seafloor spreading is the mechanism for Wegeners drifting continents. Convection currents within the mantle take the continents on a conveyor-belt ride of oceanic crust that over millions of years takes them around the planets surface. The breakup of Pangaea by seafloor spreading is seen in this animation: URL . The breakup of Pangaea with a focus on the North Atlantic: URL .

The history of the seafloor spreading hypothesis and the evidence that was collected to develop it are the subject of this video (3a): URL (8:05). 
Lesson  Summary 	  Using technologies developed to fight World War II, scientists were able to gather data that allowed them to recognize seafloor spreading as the mechanism for Wegeners drifting continents. Bathymetric maps revealed high mountain ranges and deep trenches in the seafloor. Magnetic polarity stripes give clues to seafloor ages and the importance of mid-ocean ridges in the creation of oceanic crust. Seafloor spreading processes create new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges and destroy older crust at deep sea trenches. A basic description of sea floor spreading with animations: URL ndex.html . How were the technologies that were developed to fight World War II used by scientists for the development of the seafloor spreading hypothesis? In what two ways did magnetic data lead scientists to understand more about continental drift and plate tectonics? How does seafloor spreading provide a mechanism for continental drift? Look at the features of the North Pacific Ocean basin and explain them in seafloor spreading terms. What would have to happen if oceanic crust was not destroyed at oceanic trenches, but new crust was still created at mid-ocean ridges?

Introduction 	  When the concept of seafloor spreading came along, scientists recognized that it was the mechanism to explain how continents could move around Earths surface. Like the scientists before us, we will now merge the ideas of continental drift and seafloor spreading into the theory of plate tectonics. Continental drift and the mechanism of seafloor spreading create plate tectonics: URL 5682/5390276 . 
Earths  Tectonic  Plates 	  Seafloor and continents move around on Earths surface, but what is actually moving? What portion of the Earth makes up the plates in plate tectonics? This question was also answered because of technology developed during war times in this case, the Cold War. The plates are made up of the lithosphere. During the 1950s and early 1960s, scientists set up seismograph networks to see if enemy nations were testing atomic bombs. These seismographs also recorded all of the earthquakes around the planet. The seismic records could be used to locate an earthquakes epicenter, the point on Earths surface directly above the place where the earthquake occurs. Earthquake epicenters outline the plates. Mid-ocean ridges, trenches, and large faults mark the edges of the plates, and this is where earthquakes occur ( Figure 6.22). The lithosphere is divided into a dozen major and several minor plates ( Figure 6.23). The plates edges can be drawn by connecting the dots that mark earthquakes epicenters. A single plate can be made of all oceanic lithosphere or all continental lithosphere, but nearly all plates are made of a combination of both. Movement of the plates over Earths surface is termed plate tectonics. Plates move at a rate of a few centimeters a year, about the same rate fingernails grow. 
How  Plates  Move 	  If seafloor spreading drives the plates, what drives seafloor spreading? Picture two convection cells side-by-side in the mantle, similar to the illustration in Figure 6.24. This takes place at the deep sea trenches. The lithospheric plates and their names. The arrows show whether the plates are moving apart, moving together, or sliding past each other. Mantle convection drives plate tectonics. Hot material rises at mid-ocean ridges and sinks at deep sea trenches, which keeps the plates moving along the Earths surface. Mantle convection is shown in these animations: URL URL 
Plate  Boundaries 	  Plate boundaries are the edges where two plates meet. Most geologic activities, including volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building, take place at plate boundaries. How can two plates move relative to each other? Divergent plate boundaries: the two plates move away from each other. Convergent plate boundaries: the two plates move towards each other. Transform plate boundaries: the two plates slip past each other. The type of plate boundary and the type of crust found on each side of the boundary determines what sort of geologic activity will be found there. 
Divergent  Plate  Boundaries 	  Plates move apart at mid-ocean ridges where new seafloor forms. Between the two plates is a rift valley. Lava flows at the surface cool rapidly to become basalt, but deeper in the crust, magma cools more slowly to form gabbro. So the entire ridge system is made up of igneous rock that is either extrusive or intrusive. Earthquakes are common at mid-ocean ridges since the movement of magma and oceanic crust results in crustal shaking. The vast majority of mid-ocean ridges are located deep below the sea ( Figure 6.25). USGS animation of divergent plate boundary at mid-ocean ridge: URL ation.php?flash_title=Divergent+Boundary&flash_file=divergent&flash_width=500&flash_height=200 . Divergent plate boundary animation: URL M_09_01_Divergent_480.mov . Can divergent plate boundaries occur within a continent? What is the result? In continental rifting ( Figure 6.26), magma rises beneath the continent, causing it to become thinner, break, and ultimately split apart. New ocean crust erupts in the void, creating an ocean between continents. 
Convergent  Plate  Boundaries 	  When two plates converge, the result depends on the type of lithosphere the plates are made of. No matter what, smashing two enormous slabs of lithosphere together results in magma generation and earthquakes. Ocean-continent: When oceanic crust converges with continental crust, the denser oceanic plate plunges beneath the continental plate. This process, called subduction, occurs at the oceanic trenches ( Figure 6.27). The entire The Arabian, Indian, and African plates are rifting apart, forming the Great Rift Valley in Africa. The Dead Sea fills the rift with seawater. region is known as a subduction zone. Subduction zones have a lot of intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The subducting plate causes melting in the mantle. The magma rises and erupts, creating volcanoes. These coastal volcanic mountains are found in a line above the subducting plate ( Figure 6.28). The volcanoes are known as a continental arc. Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a continental plate causes earthquakes and forms a line of volcanoes known as a continental arc. The movement of crust and magma causes earthquakes. A map of earthquake epicenters at subduction zones is found here: URL . This animation shows the relationship between subduction of the lithosphere and creation of a volcanic arc: URL arthguide.ucsd.edu/eoc/teachers/t_tectonics/p_subduction.html . The volcanoes of northeastern CaliforniaLassen Peak, Mount Shasta, and Medicine Lake volcanoalong with the rest of the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest are the result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate ( Figure 6.29). The Juan de Fuca plate is created by seafloor spreading just offshore at the Juan de Fuca ridge. If the magma at a continental arc is felsic, it may be too viscous (thick) to rise through the crust. The magma will cool slowly to form granite or granodiorite. These large bodies of intrusive igneous rocks are called batholiths, which may someday be uplifted to form a mountain range ( Figure 6.30). Ocean-ocean: When two oceanic plates converge, the older, denser plate will subduct into the mantle. An ocean trench marks the location where the plate is pushed down into the mantle. The line of volcanoes that grows on the upper oceanic plate is an island arc. Do you think earthquakes are common in these regions ( Figure 6.31)? An animation of an ocean continent plate boundary is seen here: URL (a) At the trench lining the western margin of South America, the Nazca plate is subducting beneath the South American plate, resulting in the Andes Mountains (brown and red uplands); (b) Convergence has pushed up limestone in the Andes Mountains where volcanoes are common. The Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest are a continental arc. The Sierra Nevada batholith cooled beneath a volcanic arc roughly 200 million years ago. The rock is well exposed here at Mount Whitney. Similar batholiths are likely forming beneath the Andes and Cascades today. (a) Subduction of an ocean plate beneath an ocean plate results in a volcanic island arc, an ocean trench and many earthquakes. (b) Japan is an arc-shaped island arc composed of volcanoes off the Asian mainland, as seen in this satellite image. and_outreach/aotm/11/AOTM_09_01_Convergent_480.mov . Continent-continent: Continental plates are too buoyant to subduct. What happens to continental material when it collides? Since it has nowhere to go but up, this creates some of the worlds largest mountains ranges ( Figure 6.32). Magma cannot penetrate this thick crust so there are no volcanoes, although the magma stays in the crust. Metamorphic rocks are common because of the stress the continental crust experiences. With enormous slabs of crust smashing together, continent-continent collisions bring on numerous and large earthquakes. A short animation of the Indian Plate colliding with the Eurasian Plate: URL . An animation of the Himalaya rising: URL . The Appalachian Mountains are the remnants of a large mountain range that was created when North America (a) In continent-continent convergence, the plates push upward to create a high mountain range. (b) The worlds highest mountains, the Himalayas, are the result of the collision of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian Plate, seen in this photo from the International Space Station. rammed into Eurasia about 250 million years ago. 
Transform  Plate  Boundaries 	  Transform plate boundaries are seen as transform faults, where two plates move past each other in opposite directions. Transform faults on continents bring massive earthquakes ( Figure 6.33). At the San Andreas Fault in California, the Pacific Plate is sliding northeast relative to the North American plate, which is moving southwest. At the northern end of the picture, the transform boundary turns into a subduction zone. California is very geologically active. What are the three major plate boundaries in or near California ( Figure 6.34)? This map shows the three major plate boundaries in or near California. A brief review of the three types of plate boundaries and the structures that are found there is the subject of this wordless video (3b): URL (4:50). 
Earths  Changing  Surface 	  Geologists know that Wegener was right because the movements of continents explain so much about the geology we see. Most of the geologic activity that we see on the planet today is because of the interactions of the moving plates. In the map of North America ( Figure 6.35), where are the mountain ranges located? Using what you have learned about plate tectonics, try to answer the following questions: Remember that Wegener used the similarity of the mountains on the west and east sides of the Atlantic as evidence for his continental drift hypothesis. The Appalachian mountains formed at a convergent plate boundary as Pangaea came together ( Figure 6.36). Before Pangaea came together, the continents were separated by an ocean where the Atlantic is now. The protoAtlantic ocean shrank as the Pacific ocean grew. Currently, the Pacific is shrinking as the Atlantic is growing. This About 200 million years ago, the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America were probably once as high as the Himalaya, but they have been weathered and eroded significantly since the breakup of Pangaea. supercontinent cycle is responsible for most of the geologic features that we see and many more that are long gone ( Figure 6.37). This animation shows the movement of continents over the past 600 million years beginning with the breakup of Rodinia: URL . 
Intraplate  Activity 	  A small amount of geologic activity, known as intraplate activity, does not take place at plate boundaries but within a plate instead. Mantle plumes are pipes of hot rock that rise through the mantle. The release of pressure causes melting near the surface to form a hotspot. Eruptions at the hotspot create a volcano. Hotspot volcanoes are found in a line ( Figure 6.38). Can you figure out why? Hint: The youngest volcano sits above the hotspot and volcanoes become older with distance from the hotspot. An animation of the creation of a hotspot chain is seen here: URL p_hawaii.html . Geologists use some hotspot chains to tell the direction and the speed a plate is moving ( Figure 6.39). Hotspot magmas rarely penetrate through thick continental crust. One exception is the Yellowstone hotspot ( Figure 
Plate  Tectonics  Theory 	  Plate tectonics is the unifying theory of geology. Plate tectonics theory explains why: Earths geography has changed through time and continues to change today. some places are prone to earthquakes while others are not. certain regions may have deadly, mild, or no volcanic eruptions. mountain ranges are located where they are. Plate tectonic motions affect Earths rock cycle, climate, and the evolution of life. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Plates of lithosphere move because of convection currents in the mantle. One type of motion is produced by seafloor spreading. Plate boundaries can be located by outlining earthquake epicenters. Plates interact at three types of plate boundaries: divergent, convergent and transform. Most of the Earths geologic activity takes place at plate boundaries. At a divergent boundary, volcanic activity produces a mid ocean ridge and small earthquakes. At a convergent boundary with at least one oceanic plate, an ocean trench, a chain of volcanoes develops and many earthquakes occur. At a convergent boundary where both plates are continental, mountain ranges grow and earthquakes are common. At a transform boundary, there is a transform fault and massive earthquakes occur but there are no volcanoes. Processes acting over long periods of time create Earths geographic features. Use this diagram to review this chapter ( Figure 6.41). The Hawaiian Islands are a beautiful example of a hotspot chain. Kilauea volcano lies above the Hawaiian hotspot. Mauna Loa volcano is older than Kilauea and is still erupting, but at a lower rate. The islands get progressively older to the northwest because they are further from the hotspot. Loihi, the youngest volcano, is still below the sea surface. The Hawaiian chain continues into the Emperor Seamounts. The bend in the chain was caused by a change in the direction of the Pacific plate 43 million years ago. Using the age and distance of the bend, geologists can figure out the speed of the Pacific plate over the hotspot. Volcanic activity above the Yellowstone hotspot on the North American Plate can be traced from 15 million years ago to its present location. occur and why? On the map in Figure 6.23, the arrows show the directions that the plates are going. The Atlantic has a midocean ridge, where seafloor spreading is taking place. The Pacific Ocean has many deep sea trenches, where subduction is taking place. What is the future of the Atlantic plate? What is the future of the Pacific plate? Using your hands and words, explain to someone how plate tectonics works. Be sure you describe how continents drift and how seafloor spreading provides a mechanism for continental movement. Now that you know about plate tectonics, where do you think would be a safe place to live if you wanted to avoid volcanic eruptions and earthquakes?

Introduction 	  Enormous slabs of lithosphere move unevenly over the planets spherical surface, resulting in earthquakes. This chapter deals with two types of geological activity that occur because of plate tectonics: mountain building and earthquakes. First, we will consider what can happen to rocks when they are exposed to stress. 
Causes and  Types of  Stress 	  Stress is the force applied to an object. In geology, stress is the force per unit area that is placed on a rock. Four types of stresses act on materials. A deeply buried rock is pushed down by the weight of all the material above it. Since the rock cannot move, it cannot deform. This is called confining stress. Compression squeezes rocks together, causing rocks to fold or fracture (break) ( Figure 7.1). Compression is the most common stress at convergent plate boundaries. Rocks that are pulled apart are under tension. Rocks under tension lengthen or break apart. Tension is the major type of stress at divergent plate boundaries. When forces are parallel but moving in opposite directions, the stress is called shear ( Figure 7.2). Shear stress is the most common stress at transform plate boundaries. When stress causes a material to change shape, it has undergone strain or deformation. Deformed rocks are common in geologically active areas. A rocks response to stress depends on the rock type, the surrounding temperature, and pressure conditions the rock is under, the length of time the rock is under stress, and the type of stress. Rocks have three possible responses to increasing stress (illustrated in Figure 7.3): elastic deformation: the rock returns to its original shape when the stress is removed. plastic deformation: the rock does not return to its original shape when the stress is removed. fracture: the rock breaks. With increasing stress, the rock undergoes: (1) elastic deformation, (2) plastic deformation, and (3) fracture. Under what conditions do you think a rock is more likely to fracture? Is it more likely to break deep within Earths crust or at the surface? What if the stress applied is sharp rather than gradual? At the Earths surface, rocks usually break quite quickly, but deeper in the crust, where temperatures and pressures are higher, rocks are more likely to deform plastically. Sudden stress, such as a hit with a hammer, is more likely to make a rock break. Stress applied over time often leads to plastic deformation. 
Geologic  Structures 	  Sedimentary rocks are important for deciphering the geologic history of a region because they follow certain rules. You can trace the deformation a rock has experienced by seeing how it differs from its original horizontal, oldeston-bottom position ( Figure 7.4). This deformation produces geologic structures such as folds, joints, and faults that are caused by stresses ( Figure 7.4). Using the rules listed above, try to figure out the geologic history of the geologic column below. (a) In the Grand Canyon, the rock layers are exposed like a layer cake. Each layer is made of sediments that were deposited in a particular environment perhaps a lake bed, shallow offshore region, or a sand dune. (b) In this geologic column of the Grand Canyon, the sedimentary rocks of the "Layered Paleozoic Rocks" column (layers 1 through 11) are still horizontal. 
Grand  Canyon  Supergroup rocks (layers 	  Basement Rocks are not sedimentary (rocks 16 through 18). The oldest layers are on the bottom and youngest are on the top. 
Folds 	  Rocks deforming plastically under compressive stresses crumple into folds ( Figure 7.5). They do not return to their original shape. If the rocks experience more stress, they may undergo more folding or even fracture. Snow accentuates the fold exposed in these rocks in Provo Canyon, Utah. Three types of folds are seen. Mononcline: A monocline is a simple bend in the rock layers so that they are no longer horizontal (see Figure 7.6 for an example). At Colorado National Monument, the rocks in a monocline plunge toward the ground. Anticline: An anticline is a fold that arches upward. The rocks dip away from the center of the fold ( Figure 7.7). The oldest rocks are at the center of an anticline and the youngest are draped over them. (a) Schematic of an anticline. (b) An anticline exposed in a road cut in New Jersey. When rocks arch upward to form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome. If the top of the dome is sliced off, where are the oldest rocks located? Syncline: A syncline is a fold that bends downward. The youngest rocks are at the center and the oldest are at the outside ( Figure 7.8). When rocks bend downward in a circular structure, that structure is called a basin ( Figure 7.9). If the rocks are exposed at the surface, where are the oldest rocks located? 
Faults 	  A rock under enough stress will fracture. If there is no movement on either side of a fracture, the fracture is called a joint, as shown in ( Figure 7.10). If the blocks of rock on one or both sides of a fracture move, the fracture is called a fault ( Figure 7.11). Sudden motions along faults cause rocks to break and move suddenly. The energy released is an earthquake. Basins can be enormous. This is a geologic map of the Michigan Basin, which is centered in the state of Michigan but extends into four other states and a Canadian province. Granite rocks in Joshua Tree National Park showing horizontal and vertical jointing. These joints formed when the confining stress was removed from the granite. Faults are easy to recognize as they cut across bedded rocks. Slip is the distance rocks move along a fault. Slip can be up or down the fault plane. Slip is relative, because there is usually no way to know whether both sides moved or only one. Faults lie at an angle to the horizontal surface of the Earth. That angle is called the faults dip. The dip defines which of two basic types a fault is. If the faults dip is inclined relative to the horizontal, the fault is a dip-slip fault ( Figure 7.12). There are two types of dip-slip faults. In normal faults, the hanging wall drops down relative to the footwall. In reverse faults, the footwall drops down relative to the hanging wall. This diagram illustrates the two types of dip-slip faults: normal faults and reverse faults. Imagine miners extracting a resource along a fault. The hanging wall is where miners would have hung their lanterns. The footwall is where they would have walked. An animation of a normal fault is seen here: URL e=Normal+Fault&flash_file=normalfault&flash_width=220&flash_height=320 . A thrust fault is a type of reverse fault in which the fault plane angle is nearly horizontal. Rocks can slip many miles along thrust faults ( Figure 7.13). An animation of a thrust fault is seen here: URL e=Thrust+Fault&flash_file=thrustfault&flash_width=220&flash_height=320 . Normal faults can be huge. They are responsible for uplifting mountain ranges in regions experiencing tensional stress ( Figure 7.14). At Chief Mountain in Montana, the upper rocks at the Lewis Overthrust are more than 1 billion years older than the lower rocks. How could this happen? The Teton Range in Wyoming rose up along a normal fault. A strike-slip fault is a dip-slip fault in which the dip of the fault plane is vertical. Strike-slip faults result from shear stresses. ( Figure 7.15). Imagine placing one foot on either side of a strike-slip fault. One block moves toward you. If that block moves toward your right foot, the fault is a right-lateral strike-slip fault; if that block moves toward your left foot, the fault is a left-lateral strike-slip fault. Californias San Andreas Fault is the worlds most famous strike-slip fault. It is a right-lateral strike slip fault ( Figure 7.16). A strike-slip fault animation: URL ult&flash_file=strikeslip&flash_width=240&flash_height=310 . People sometimes say that California will fall into the ocean someday, which is not true. This animation shows movement on the San Andreas into the future: URL . 
Stress and  Mountain  Building 	  Two converging continental plates smash upwards to create mountain ranges ( Figure 7.17). Stresses from this uplift cause folds, reverse faults, and thrust faults, which allow the crust to rise upwards. (a) The worlds highest mountain range, the Himalayas, is growing from the collision between the Indian and the Eurasian plates. (b) The crumpling of the Indian and Eurasian plates of continental crust creates the Himalayas. Subduction of oceanic lithosphere at convergent plate boundaries also builds mountain ranges ( Figure 7.18). The Andes Mountains are a chain of continental arc volcanoes that build up as the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. When tensional stresses pull crust apart, it breaks into blocks that slide up and drop down along normal faults. The result is alternating mountains and valleys, known as a basin-and-range ( Figure 7.19). This is a very quick animation of movement of blocks in a basin-and-range setting: URL /animations/animation.php?flash_title=Horst+%26amp%3B+Graben&flash_file=horstandgraben&flash_width=380&f lash_height=210 . 
Lesson  Summary 	  Stress is the force applied to a rock and may cause deformation. The three main types of stress are typical of the three types of plate boundaries: compression at convergent boundaries, tension at divergent boundaries, and shear at transform boundaries. Where rocks deform plastically, they tend to fold. Brittle deformation brings about fractures and faults. The two main types of faults are dip-slip (the fault plane is inclined to the horizontal) and strike-slip (the fault plane is perpendicular to the horizontal). The worlds largest mountains grow at convergent plate boundaries, primarily by thrust faulting and folding. Where in an ocean basin would you find features that indicate tensional stresses? Where would you find the features that indicate compressional stresses? Earthquakes are primarily the result of plate tectonic motions. List the three types of plate boundaries and what you think the stresses are that would cause earthquakes there. Which type of plate boundary do you think has the most dangerous earthquakes? How do earthquakes cause the greatest damage? Be able to identify an earthquake focus and its epicenter. Identify earthquake zones and what makes some regions prone to earthquakes. Compare the characteristics of the different types of seismic waves. Describe how tsunamis are caused by earthquakes, particularly using the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami as an example. amplitude body waves crest earthquake elastic rebound theory focus seismology surface waves trough tsunami wavelength 
Introduction 	  An earthquake is sudden ground movement caused by the sudden release of energy stored in rocks. Earthquakes happen when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks rupture. The energy is transmitted by seismic waves. Each year there are more than 150,000 earthquakes strong enough to be felt by people and 900,000 recorded by seismometers! 
Causes of  Earthquakes 	  The description of how earthquakes occur is called elastic rebound theory ( Figure 7.20). Elastic rebound theory in an animation: URL astic+Rebound&flash_file=elasticrebound&flash_width=300&flash_height=350 . In an earthquake, the initial point where the rocks rupture in the crust is called the focus. The epicenter is the point on the land surface that is directly above the focus. In about 75% of earthquakes, the focus is in the top 10 to 15 Elastic rebound theory. Stresses build on both sides of a fault, causing the rocks to deform plastically (Time 2). When the stresses become too great, the rocks break and end up in a different location (Time 3). This releases the built up energy and creates an earthquake. kilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage because the focus is near where people live. However, it is the epicenter of an earthquake that is reported by scientists and the media ( Figure 7.21). In the vertical cross section of crust, there are two features labeled the focus and the epicenter, which is directly above the focus. This animation shows the relationship between focus and epicenter of an earthquake: URL com/olcweb/cgi/pluginpop.cgi?it=swf::640::480::/sites/dl/free/0072402466/30425/16_04.swf::Fig.%20%2016.4%20%20Focus%20of%20an%20Earthquake . 
Earthquake  Zones 	  Nearly 95% of all earthquakes take place along one of the three types of plate boundaries, but earthquakes do occur along all three types of plate boundaries. About 80% of all earthquakes strike around the Pacific Ocean basin because it is lined with convergent and transform boundaries ( Figure 7.22). About 15% take place in the Mediterranean-Asiatic Belt, where convergence is causing the Indian Plate to run into the Eurasian Plate. The remaining 5% are scattered around other plate boundaries or are intraplate earthquakes. Earthquake epicenters for magnitude 8.0 and greater events since 1900. The earthquake depth shows that most large quakes are shallow focus, but some subducted plates cause deep focus quakes. 
Transform plate boundaries 	  Deadly earthquakes occur at transform plate boundaries. Transform faults have shallow focus earthquakes. Why do you think this is so? The faults along the San Andreas Fault zone produce around 10,000 earthquakes a year. Most are tiny, but occasionally one is massive. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the Hayward Fault was the site of a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in 1868. The 1906 quake on the San Andreas Fault had a magnitude estimated at about Recent California earthquakes: Although California is prone to many natural hazards, including volcanic eruptions at Mt. Shasta or Mt. Lassen, and landslides on coastal cliffs, the natural hazard the state is linked with is earthquakes. In this video, the boundaries between three different tectonic plates and the earthquakes that result from their interactions are explored (9b): http ://URL (1:59). (a) The San Andreas Fault zone in the San Francisco Bay Area. (b) The 1906 San Francisco earthquake is still the most costly natural disaster in California history. About 3,000 people died and 28,000 buildings were lost, mostly in the fire. New Zealand also has strike-slip earthquakes, about 20,000 a year! Only a small percentage of those are large enough to be felt. A 6.3 quake in Christchurch in February 2011 killed about 180 people. 
Convergent plate boundaries 	  Earthquakes at convergent plate boundaries mark the motions of subducting lithosphere as it plunges through the mantle ( Figure 7.24). Eventually the plate heats up enough deform plastically and earthquakes stop. This cross section of earthquake epicenters with depth outlines the subducting plate with shallow, intermediate, and deep earthquakes. Convergent plate boundaries produce earthquakes all around the Pacific Ocean basin. The Philippine Plate and the Pacific Plate subduct beneath Japan, creating a chain of volcanoes and as many as 1,500 earthquakes annually. In March 2011 an enormous 9.0 earthquake struck off of Sendai in northeastern Japan. This quake, called the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, was the most powerful ever to strike Japan and one of the top five known in the world. Damage from the earthquake was nearly overshadowed by the tsunami it generated, which wiped out coastal cities and towns ( Figure 7.25). Two months after the earthquake, about 25,000 people were dead or missing, and 125,000 buildings had been damaged or destroyed. Aftershocks, some as large as major earthquakes, have continued to rock the region. A map of aftershocks is seen here: URL . Here is an interactive feature article about the earthquake: URL asia/maps-of-earthquake-and-tsunami-damage-in-japan.html . 
Destruction in  Ofunato,  Japan, from the 	  The Pacific Northwest of the United States is at risk from a potentially massive earthquake that could strike any time. Subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath North America produces active volcanoes, but large earthquakes only hit every 300 to 600 years. The last was in 1700, with an estimated magnitude of around 9. An image of earthquakes beneath the Pacific Northwest and the depth to the epicenter is shown here: URL usgs.gov/ds/91/ . Elastic rebound at a subduction zone generates an earthquake in this animation: URL grams/education_and_outreach/aotm/5/AOTF5_Subduction_ElasticRebound480.mov . Massive earthquakes are the hallmark of the thrust faulting and folding when two continental plates converge ( Figure 7.26). The 2001 Gujarat earthquake in India was responsible for about 20,000 deaths, and many more people became injured or homeless. In Understanding Earthquakes: From Research to Resilience, scientists try to understand the mechanisms that cause earthquakes and tsunamis and the ways that society can deal with them (3d): URL 5Qz-aZ2nUM (8:06). 
Divergent  Plate  Boundaries 	  Earthquakes at mid-ocean ridges are small and shallow because the plates are young, thin, and hot. On land where continents split apart, earthquakes are larger and stronger. 
Intraplate  Earthquakes 	  Intraplate earthquakes are the result of stresses caused by plate motions acting in solid slabs of lithosphere. In 1812, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck near New Madrid, Missouri. The earthquake was strongly felt over approximately 50,000 square miles and altered the course of the Mississippi River. Because very few people lived there at the time, only 20 people died. Many more people live there today ( Figure 7.27). A similar earthquake today would undoubtedly kill many people and cause a great deal of property damage. 
Seismic  Waves 	  Energy is transmitted in waves. Every wave has a high point called a crest and a low point called a trough. The height of a wave from the center line to its crest is its amplitude. The distance between waves from crest to crest (or trough to trough) is its wavelength. The parts of a wave are illustrated in Figure 7.28. The energy from earthquakes travels in seismic waves, which were discussed in the chapter Plate Tectonics. The study of seismic waves is known as seismology. Seismologists use seismic waves to learn about earthquakes and The New Madrid Seismic Zone is within the North American plate. Around 4,000 earthquakes have occurred in the region since 1974. The crest, trough, and amplitude are illustrated in this diagram. also to learn about the Earths interior. The two types of seismic waves described in Plate Tectonics, P-waves and S-waves, are known as body waves because they move through the solid body of the Earth. P-waves travel through solids, liquids, and gases. S-waves only move through solids. Surface waves travel along the ground, outward from an earthquakes epicenter. Surface waves are the slowest of all seismic waves, traveling at 2.5 km (1.5 miles) per second. There are two types of surface waves ( Figure 7.29). In an earthquake, body waves produce sharp jolts. The rolling motions of surface waves do most of the damage in an earthquake. Interesting earthquake videos are seen at National Geographic Videos, Environment Video, Natural Disasters, Earthquakes: URL . Titles include: 
Earthquake 101 	  Inside Earthquakes looks at this sudden natural disaster. P-waves move material forward and backward in the direction they are traveling. The material returns to its original size and shape after the P-wave goes by. S-waves move up and down, perpendicular to the direction the wave is traveling. This motion produces shear stresses. 
Tsunami 	  Tsunami are deadly ocean waves from an earthquake. The sharp jolt of an undersea quake forms a set of waves that travel through the sea entirely unnoticed. When they come onto shore, they can grow to enormous heights. Fortunately, few undersea earthquakes generate tsunami. How a tsunami forms is shown in this animation: URL :640::480::/sites/dl/free/0072402466/30425/16_19.swf::Fig.%2016.19%20-%20Formation%20of%20a%20Tsunam i . The Boxing Day Tsunami of December 26, 2004 was by far the deadliest of all time ( Figure 7.30). The tsunami was caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake. With a magnitude of 9.2, it was the second largest earthquake ever recorded. The extreme movement of the crust displaced trillions of tons of water along the entire length of the rupture. Several tsunami waves were created with about 30 minutes between the peaks of each one. The waves that struck nearby Sumatra 15 minutes after the quake reached more than 10 meters (33 feet) in height. The size of the waves decreased with distance from the earthquake and were about 4 meters (13 feet) high in Somalia. About 230,000 people died in eight countries ( Figure 7.31) with fatalities even as far away as South Africa, nearly 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) from the earthquake epicenter. More than 1.2 million people lost their homes and many more lost their ways of making a living. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan created massive tsunami waves that hit the island nation. As seen in	Figure 7.32, waves in some regions topped 9 meters (27 feet). The tsunami did much more damage than the massive earthquake ( Figure 7.33). Worst was the damage done to nuclear power plants along the northeastern coast. As a result of the 2004 tsunami, an Indian Ocean warning system was put into operation in June 2006. Prior to 2004, no one had thought a large tsunami was possible in the Indian Ocean. In comparison, a warning system has been in effect around the Pacific Ocean for more than 50 years ( Figure 7.34). Why do you think a Pacific warning system has been in place for so long? The system was used to warn of possible tsunami waves after the Tohoku earthquake. The countries that were most affected by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. The Boxing Day tsunami strikes a beach in Thailand. People were evacuated along many pacific coastlines although the waves were not nearly as large as those that struck Japan shortly after the quake. 
Lesson  Summary 	  During an earthquake, the ground shakes as stored up energy is released from rocks. Elastic rebound theory states that rock will deform plastically as stresses build up until the stresses become too great and the rock breaks. Earthquakes occur at all types of plate boundaries. The Pacific Ocean basin and the Mediterranean-Asiatic Belt are the two geographic regions most likely to An aerial view shows the damage to Sendai, Japan caused by the earthquake and tsunami. The black smoke is coming from an oil refinery, which was set on fire by the earthquake. The tsunami prevented efforts to extinguish the fire until several days after the earthquake. experience quakes. Surface waves do the most damage in an earthquake.

Introduction 	  Seismograms record seismic waves. Over the past century, scientists have developed several ways of measuring earthquake intensity. The currently accepted method is the moment magnitude scale, which measures the total amount of energy released by the earthquake. At this time, seismologists have not found a reliable method for predicting earthquakes. 
Measuring  Magnitude 	  A seismograph produces a graph-like representation of the seismic waves it receives and records them onto a seismogram ( Figure 7.35). Seismograms contain information that can be used to determine how strong an earthquake was, how long it lasted, and how far away it was. Modern seismometers record ground motions using electronic motion detectors. The data are then kept digitally on a computer. If a seismogram records P-waves and surface waves but not S-waves, the seismograph was on the other side of the Earth from the earthquake. The amplitude of the waves can be used to determine the magnitude of the earthquake, which will be discussed in a later section. A seismograph records an earthquake 50 miles away: URL outreach/aotm/17/Seismogram_RegionalEarthquake.mov . This animation shows three different stations picking up seismic waves: URL s/education_and_outreach/aotm/10/4StationSeismoNetwork480.mov . 
Finding the  Epicenter 	  To locate an earthquake epicenter: Seismic stations record ten earthquakes in this animation: URL each/aotm/12/TravelTime_Sphere_10Stn_480.mov . Circles are drawn with radii representing the distance from each seismic station to the earthquakes epicenter. The intersection of these three circles is the earthquakes epicenter. 
Measuring  Earthquakes 	  People have always tried to quantify the size of and damage done by earthquakes. Since early in the 20th century, there have been three methods. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each? Mercalli Intensity Scale. Earthquakes are described in terms of what nearby residents felt and the damage that was done to nearby structures. Richter magnitude scale. Developed in 1935 by Charles Richter, this scale uses a seismometer to measure the magnitude of the largest jolt of energy released by an earthquake. Moment magnitude scale. Measures the total energy released by an earthquake. Moment magnitude is calculated from the area of the fault that is ruptured and the distance the ground moved along the fault. The Richter scale and the moment magnitude scale are logarithmic. The amplitude of the largest wave increases ten times from one integer to the next. An increase in one integer means that thirty times more energy was released. These two scales often give very similar measurements. How does the amplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 earthquake compare with the largest wave of a magnitude 4 earthquake? How does it compare with a magnitude 3 quake? The amplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4 quake and 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake. How does an increase in two integers on the moment magnitude scale compare in terms of the amount of energy released? Two integers equals a 900-fold increase in released energy. Which scale do you think is best? With the Richter scale, a single sharp jolt measures higher than a very long intense earthquake that releases more energy. The moment magnitude scale more accurately reflects the energy released and the damage caused. Most seismologists now use the moment magnitude scale. The way scientists measure earthquake intensity and the two most common scales, Richter and moment magnitude, are described along with a discussion of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake in Measuring Earthquakes video (3d): URL (2:54). 
Annual  Earthquakes 	  In a single year, on average, more than 900,000 earthquakes are recorded and 150,000 of them are strong enough to be felt. Each year about 18 earthquakes are major with a Richter magnitude of 7.0 to 7.9, and on average one earthquake has a magnitude of 8 to 8.9. Magnitude 9 earthquakes are rare. The United States Geological Survey lists five since 1900 (see Figure 7.37) and ( Table 7.1). All but the Great Indian Ocean Earthquake of 2004 occurred somewhere around the Pacific Ocean basin. The 1964 Good Friday Earthquake centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska released the second most amount of energy of any earthquake in recorded history. 
Earthquake  Prediction 	  Scientists are a long way from being able to predict earthquakes. A good prediction must be accurate as to where an earthquake will occur, when it will occur, and at what magnitude it will be so that people can evacuate. An unnecessary evacuation is expensive and causes people not to believe authorities the next time an evacuation is ordered. The probabilities of earthquakes striking along various faults in the San Francisco area between 2003 (when the work was done) and 2032. Where an earthquake will occur is the easiest feature to predict. Scientists know that earthquakes take place at plate boundaries and tend to happen where theyve occurred before ( Figure 7.38). Earthquake-prone communities should always be prepared for an earthquake. These communities can implement building codes to make structures earthquake safe. When an earthquake will occur is much more difficult to predict. Since stress on a fault builds up at the same rate over time, earthquakes should occur at regular intervals ( Figure 7.39). But so far scientists cannot predict when quakes will occur even to within a few years. Signs sometimes come before a large earthquake. Small quakes, called foreshocks, sometimes occur a few seconds to a few weeks before a major quake. However, many earthquakes do not have foreshocks and small earthquakes are not necessarily followed by a large earthquake. Often, the rocks around a fault will dilate as microfractures Around Parkfield, California, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or higher occurs about every 22 years. So seismologists predicted that one would strike in 1993, but that quake came in 2004 11 years late. form. Ground tilting, caused by the buildup of stress in the rocks, may precede a large earthquake, but not always. Water levels in wells fluctuate as water moves into or out of fractures before an earthquake. This is also an uncertain predictor of large earthquakes. The relative arrival times of P-waves and S-waves also decreases just before an earthquake occurs. Folklore tells of animals behaving erratically just before an earthquake. Mostly these anecdotes are told after the earthquake. If indeed animals sense danger from earthquakes or tsunami, scientists do not know what it is they could be sensing, but they would like to find out.

Lesson  Summary 	  Seismograms indicate an earthquakes strength, how far away it is, and how long it lasts. Epicenters can be calculated using the difference in the arrival times of Pand S-waves from three seismograms. Three different methods can be used to determine an earthquakes strength. The Mercalli Scale identifies the damage done and what people felt after an earthquake has occurred, the Richter scale measures the greatest single shock, and the moment magnitude scale measures the total energy released.

Introduction 	  Earthquakes are natural disasters that cause enormous amounts of damage, second only to hurricanes. Earthquakesafe construction techniques, securing heavy objects, and preparing an emergency kit are among the precautions people can take to minimize damage. 
Damage from  Earthquakes 	  Earthquakes kill people and cause property damage. However, the ground shaking almost never kills people, and the ground does not swallow someone up. The damage depends somewhat on the earthquake size but mostly on the quality of structures. Structures falling on people injure and kill them. More damage is done and more people are killed by the fires that follow an earthquake than the earthquake itself. What makes an earthquake deadly? Population density. The magnitude 9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake, near Anchorage, of 1964 resulted in only 131 deaths. At the time few people lived in the area ( Figure 7.40). Not size. Only about 2,000 people died in the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake, the largest earthquake ever recorded. The Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004 was one of the largest ever, but most of the 230,000 fatalities were caused by the tsunami, not the earthquake itself. Ground type. Solid bedrock vibrates less than soft sediments so there is less damage on bedrock. Sediments that are saturated with water undergo liquefaction and become like quicksand ( Figure 7.41). Soil on a hillside may become a landslide. Earthquake effects on buildings are seen in this animation: URL outreach/aotm/6/SeismicBuilding-Narrated480.mov . A landslide in a neighborhood in Anchorage, Alaska, after the 1964 Great Alaska earthquake. Liquefaction of sediments in Mexico City caused the collapse of many buildings in the 1985 earthquake. In earthquake-prone areas, city planners try to reduce hazards. For example, in the San Francisco Bay Area, maps show how much shaking is expected for different ground types ( Figure 7.42). This allows planners to locate new hospitals and schools more safely. 
Earthquake- Safe  Structures 	  Construction is a large factor in what happens during an earthquake. For example, many more people died in the 1988 Armenia earthquake where people live in mud houses than in the 1989 earthquake in Loma Prieta. Most buildings in Californias earthquake country are designed to be earthquake safe. Skyscrapers and other large structures built on soft ground must be anchored to bedrock, even if it lies hundreds of meters below the ground surface. The correct building materials must be used. Houses should bend and sway. Wood and steel are better than brick, stone, and adobe, which are brittle and will break. Larger buildings must sway, but not so much that they touch nearby buildings. Counterweights and diagonal steel beams are used to hold down sway. Large buildings can be placed on rollers so that they move with the ground. Buildings may be placed on layers of steel and rubber to absorb the shock of the waves. Connections, such as where the walls meet the foundation, must be made strong. In a multi-story building, the first story must be well supported ( Figure 7.43). To make older buildings more earthquake safe, retrofitting with steel or wood can reinforce a buildings structure and its connections ( Figure 7.44). Elevated freeways and bridges can also be retrofitted so that they do not collapse. Fires often cause more damage than the earthquake. Fires start because seismic waves rupture gas and electrical lines, and breaks in water mains make it difficult to fight the fires ( Figure 7.45). Builders zigzag pipes so that they bend and flex when the ground shakes. In San Francisco, water and gas pipelines are separated by valves so that areas can be isolated if one segment breaks. Why arent all structures in earthquakes zones constructed for maximum safety? Cost, of course. More sturdy structures are much more expensive to build. So communities must weigh how great the hazard is, what different The first floor of this San Francisco building is collapsing after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Steel trusses were built diagonally and horizontally across windows to retrofit a building at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. The San Andreas Fault passes just west of the university. In the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, fire was much more destructive than the ground shaking. building strategies cost, and make an informed decision. 
D:  The  Hayward  Fault:  Predictable  Peril 	  In 1868, the Hayward Fault erupted in what would be a disastrous earthquake today. Since the fault erupts every 140 years on average, East Bay residents and geologists are working to prepare for the inevitable event. Learn more at: URL 
Protecting  Yourself in an  Earthquake 	  There are many things you can do to protect yourself before, during, and after an earthquake. 
Before the  Earthquake 	  Have an engineer evaluate the house for structural integrity. Make sure the separate piecesfloor, walls, roof, and foundationare all well attached to each other. Bracket or brace brick chimneys to the roof. Be sure that heavy objects are not stored in high places. Secure water heaters all around and at the top and bottom. Bolt heavy furniture onto walls with bolts, screws, or strap hinges. Replace halogen and incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs to lessen fire risk. Check to see that gas lines are made of flexible material so that they do not rupture. Any equipment that uses gas should be well secured. Everyone in the household should know how to shut off the gas line. Prepare an earthquake kit with three days supply of water and food, a radio, and batteries. Place flashlights all over the house and in the glove box of your car. Keep several fire extinguishers around the house to fight small fires. Be sure to have a first aid kit. Everyone should know basic first aid and CPR. Plan in advance how you will evacuate and where you will go. Do not plan on driving as roadways will likely be damaged. 
During the  Earthquake 	  If you are in a building, get beneath a sturdy table, cover your head, and hold on. Stay away from windows, mirrors, and large furniture. If the building is structurally unsound, get outside as fast as possible. If you are outside, run to an open area away from buildings and power lines that may fall. If you are in a car, stay in the car and stay away from structures that might collapse, such as overpasses, bridges, or buildings. 
After the  Earthquake 	  Be aware that aftershocks are likely. Avoid dangerous areas like hillsides that may experience a landslide. Turn off water and power to your home. Use your phone only if there is an emergency. Many people will be trying to get through to emergency services. Be prepared to wait for help or instructions. Assist others as necessary. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A person standing in an open field in an earthquake will almost certainly be safe. Nearly all earthquake danger is from buildings falling, roadways collapsing, or from the fires and tsunami that come after the shaking stops. Communities can prepare for earthquakes by requiring that buildings be earthquake safe and by educating citizens on how to prepare. Individuals and households can prepare in two ways: by making sure that their house and its contents are not a hazard and by being ready to live independently for a few days. communities in developed versus developing nations? Many people think that in a large earthquake, California will fall into the ocean and that Arizona and Nevada will be beachfront property. Why is this not true? If you were the mayor of a small city in an earthquake-prone area, what would you like to know before choosing the building site of a new hospital? How are decisions made for determining how much money to spend preparing people and structures for earthquakes? Why do wealthy communities (such as those in California) tend to have greater earthquake protection than poorer communities (such as those in developing nations)?

Introduction 	  Volcanoes are a vibrant manifestation of plate tectonics processes. Volcanoes are common along convergent and divergent plate boundaries. Volcanoes are also found within lithospheric plates away from plate boundaries. Wherever mantle is able to melt, volcanoes may be the result. See if you can give a geological explanation for the locations of all the volcanoes in Figure 8.1. What is the Pacific Ring of Fire? Why are the Hawaiian volcanoes located away from any plate boundaries? What is the cause of the volcanoes along the mid-Atlantic ridge? Volcanoes erupt because mantle rock melts. This is the first stage in creating a volcano. Remember from the chapter Rocks that mantle may melt if temperature rises, pressure lowers, or water is added. Be sure to think about how melting occurs in each of the following volcanic settings. 
Convergent  Plate  Boundaries 	  Why does melting occur at convergent plate boundaries? The subducting plate heats up as it sinks into the mantle. Also, water is mixed in with the sediments lying on top of the subducting plate. This water lowers the melting point of the mantle material, which increases melting. Volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries are found all along the Pacific Ocean basin, primarily at the edges of the Pacific, Cocos, and Nazca plates. Trenches mark subduction zones, although only the Aleutian Trench and the Java Trench appear on the map in Figure 8.1. Remember your plate tectonics knowledge. Large earthquakes are extremely common along convergent plate boundaries. Since the Pacific Ocean is rimmed by convergent and transform boundaries, about 80% of all earthquakes strike around the Pacific Ocean basin ( Figure 8.2). Why are 75% of the worlds volcanoes found around the Pacific basin? Of course, these volcanoes are caused by the abundance of convergent plate boundaries around the Pacific. A description of the Pacific Ring of Fire along western North America is a description of the plate boundaries. The Pacific Ring of Fire is where the majority of the volcanic activity on the Earth occurs. Subduction at the Middle American Trench creates volcanoes in Central America. The San Andreas Fault is a transform boundary. Subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate creates the Cascade volcanoes. Subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North American plate in the north creates the Aleutian Islands volcanoes. The Cascades are shown on this interactive map with photos and descriptions of each of the volcanoes: URL ris.edu/hq/files/programs/education_and_outreach/aotm/interactive/6.Volcanoes4Rollover.swf . This incredible explosive eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Italy in A.D. 79 is an example of a composite volcano that forms as the result of a convergent plate boundary (3f): URL (1:53). 
Divergent plate boundaries 	  Why does melting occur at divergent plate boundaries? Hot mantle rock rises where the plates are moving apart. This releases pressure on the mantle, which lowers its melting temperature. Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, or fissures. Footage of Undersea Volcanic Eruptions is seen in National Geographic Videos, Environment Video, Habitat, Ocean section: URL . Fantastic footage of undersea volcanic eruption is in the Deepest Ocean Eruption Ever Filmed. Giant Undersea Volcano Revealed explores a volcano and its life off of Indonesia. Volcanoes erupt at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge, where seafloor spreading creates new seafloor in the rift valleys. Where a hotspot is located along the ridge, such as at Iceland, volcanoes grow high enough to create islands ( Figure 8.3). A volcanic eruption at Surtsey, a small island near Iceland. Eruptions are found at divergent plate boundaries as continents break apart. The volcanoes in Figure 8.4 are in the East African Rift between the African and Arabian plates. Mount Gahinga, a mountain in Uganda, located in the East African Rift valley. 
Volcanic  Hotspots 	  Although most volcanoes are found at convergent or divergent plate boundaries, intraplate volcanoes are found in the middle of a tectonic plate. Why is there melting at these locations? The Hawaiian Islands are the exposed peaks of a great chain of volcanoes that lie on the Pacific plate. These islands are in the middle of the Pacific plate. The youngest island sits directly above a column of hot rock called a mantle plume. As the plume rises through the mantle, pressure is released and mantle melts to create a hotspot ( Figure 8.5). (a) The Society Islands formed above a hotspot that is now beneath Mehetia and two submarine volcanoes. (b) The satellite image shows how the islands become smaller and coral reefs became more developed as the volcanoes move off the hotspot and grow older. Earth is home to about 50 known hot spots. Most of these are in the oceans because they are better able to penetrate oceanic lithosphere to create volcanoes. The hotspots that are known beneath continents are extremely large, such as Yellowstone ( Figure 8.6). A hot spot beneath Hawaii, the origin of the voluminous lava produced by the shield volcano Kilauea can be viewed here (3f): URL (2:06). How would you be able to tell hotspot volcanoes from island arc volcanoes? At island arcs, the volcanoes are all about the same age. By contrast, at hotspots the volcanoes are youngest at one end of the chain and oldest at the other. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Most volcanoes are found along convergent or divergent plate boundaries. The Pacific Ring of Fire is the most geologically active region in the world. Volcanoes such as those that form the islands of Hawaii form over hotspots, which are melting zones above mantle plumes. Some volcanoes are no longer active. What could cause a volcano to become extinct? Hot spots are still poorly understood by Earth scientists. Why do you think its hard to understand hotspots? What clues are there regarding these geological phenomena? Volcanoes have been found on Venus, Mars, and even Jupiters moon Io. What do you think this indicates to planetary geologists? Explain how magma composition affects the type of eruption. Compare the types of volcanic eruptions. Distinguish between different types of lava and the rocks they form. Describe a method for predicting volcanic eruptions. active volcano dormant volcano effusive eruption eruption explosive eruption extinct volcano lahar magma chamber pyroclastic flow tephra viscosity 
Introduction 	  In 1980, Mount St. Helens blew up in the costliest and deadliest volcanic eruption in United States history. The eruption killed 57 people, destroyed 250 homes and swept away 47 bridges ( Figure 8.7). Mt. St. Helens still has minor earthquakes and eruptions. The volcano now has a horseshoe-shaped crater with a lava dome inside. The dome is formed of viscous lava that oozes into place. 
Magma  Composition 	  Volcanoes do not always erupt in the same way. Each volcanic eruption is unique, differing in size, style, and composition of erupted material. One key to what makes the eruption unique is the chemical composition of the magma that feeds a volcano, which determines (1) the eruption style, (2) the type of volcanic cone that forms, and (3) the composition of rocks that are found at the volcano. Remember from the Rocks chapter that different minerals within a rock melt at different temperatures. The amount of partial melting and the composition of the original rock determine the composition of the magma. Magma collects in magma chambers in the crust at 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. The words that describe composition of igneous rocks also describe magma composition. Mafic magmas are low in silica and contain more dark, magnesium and iron rich mafic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene. Felsic magmas are higher in silica and contain lighter colored minerals such as quartz and orthoclase feldspar. The higher the amount of silica in the magma, the higher is its viscosity. Viscosity is a liquids resistance to flow ( Figure 8.8). Viscosity determines what the magma will do. Mafic magma is not viscous and will flow easily to the surface. Felsic magma is viscous and does not flow easily. Most felsic magma will stay deeper in the crust and will cool to form igneous intrusive rocks such as granite and granodiorite. If felsic magma rises into a magma chamber, it may be too viscous to move and so it gets stuck. Dissolved gases become trapped by thick magma. The magma churns in the chamber and the pressure builds. 
Eruptions 	  The type of magma in the chamber determines the type of volcanic eruption. Although the two major kinds of eruptions explosive and effusive are described in this section, there is an entire continuum of eruption types. Which magma composition do you think leads to each type? 
Explosive  Eruptions 	  A large explosive eruption creates even more devastation than the force of the atom bomb dropped on Nagasaki at the end of World War II in which more than 40,000 people died. A large explosive volcanic eruption is 10,000 times as powerful. Felsic magmas erupt explosively. Hot, gas-rich magma churns within the chamber. The pressure becomes so great that the magma eventually breaks the seal and explodes, just like when a cork is released from a bottle of champagne. Magma, rock, and ash burst upward in an enormous explosion. The erupted material is called tephra ( Figure 8.9). Ash and gases create a mushroom cloud above Mt. Redoubt in Alaska, 1989. The cloud reached 45,000 feet and caught a Boeing 747 in its plume. Scorching hot tephra, ash, and gas may speed down the volcanos slopes at 700 km/h (450 mph) as a pyroclastic flow. Pyroclastic flows knock down everything in their path. The temperature inside a pyroclastic flow may be as high as 1,000C (1,800F) ( Figure 8.10). A pyroclastic flow at Montserrat volcano is seen in this video: URL Movie%20files/PyroclasticFlow.MOV . Prior to the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980, the Lassen Peak eruption on May 22, 1915, was the most recent Cascades eruption. A column of ash and gas shot 30,000 feet into the air. This triggered a high-speed pyroclastic flow, which melted snow and created a volcanic mudflow known as a lahar. Lassen Peak currently has geothermal activity and could erupt explosively again. Mt. Shasta, the other active volcano in California, erupts every 600 to 800 years. An eruption would most likely create a large pyroclastic flow, and probably a lahar. Of course, Mt. Shasta could explode and collapse like Mt. Mazama in Oregon ( Figure 8.11). Volcanic gases can form poisonous and invisible clouds in the atmosphere. These gases may contribute to environmental problems such as acid rain and ozone destruction. Particles of dust and ash may stay in the atmosphere for years, disrupting weather patterns and blocking sunlight ( Figure 8.12). Crater Lake fills the caldera of the collapsed Mt. Mazama, which erupted with 42 times more power than Mount St. Helens in 1980. The bathymetry of the lake shows volcanic features such as cinder cones. The ash plume from Eyjafjallajkull volcano in Iceland disrupted air travel across Europe for six days in April 2010. 
Effusive  Eruptions 	  Mafic magma creates gentler effusive eruptions. Although the pressure builds enough for the magma to erupt, it does not erupt with the same explosive force as felsic magma. People can usually be evacuated before an effusive eruption, so they are much less deadly. Magma pushes toward the surface through fissures. Eventually, the magma reaches the surface and erupts through a vent ( Figure 8.13). In effusive eruptions, lava flows readily, producing rivers of molten rock. The Kilauea volcanic eruption in 2008 is seen in this short video: URL yxBIJI . A Quicktime movie with thermal camera of a lava stream within the vent of a Hawaiian volcano is seen here: URL . Low-viscosity lava flows down mountainsides. Differences in composition and where the lavas erupt result in three types of lava flow coming from effusive eruptions ( Figure 8.14). Undersea eruption videos are seen here URL eo.html and here URL . Although effusive eruptions rarely kill anyone, they can be destructive. Even when people know that a lava flow is approaching, there is not much anyone can do to stop it from destroying a building or road ( Figure 8.15). 
Predicting  Volcanic  Eruptions 	  Volcanologists attempt to forecast volcanic eruptions, but this has proven to be nearly as difficult as predicting an earthquake. Many pieces of evidence can mean that a volcano is about to erupt, but the time and magnitude of the eruption are difficult to pin down. This evidence includes the history of previous volcanic activity, earthquakes, slope deformation, and gas emissions. (a) Aa lava forms a thick and brittle crust that is torn into rough and jagged pieces. Aa lava can spread over large areas as the lava continues to flow underneath the crusts surface. (b) Pahoehoe lava forms lava tubes where fluid lava flows through the outer cooled rock crust, as can be seen at the Thurston Lava Tube in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. (c) Pahoehoe lava is less viscous than aa lava so its surface looks is smooth and ropy. (d) Mafic lava that erupts underwater creates pillow lava. The lava cools very quickly to roughly spherical rocks. Pillow lava is common at mid-ocean ridges. A road is overrun by an eruption at Kilauea volcano in Hawaii. 
History of  Volcanic  Activity 	  A volcanos history  how long since its last eruption and the time span between its previous eruptions  is a good first step to predicting eruptions. Which of these categories does the volcano fit into? Active: currently erupting or showing signs of erupting soon. Dormant: no current activity, but has erupted recently ( Figure 8.16). Extinct: no activity for some time; will probably not erupt again. Active and dormant volcanoes are heavily monitored, especially in populated areas. Mount Vesuvius destroyed Pompeii in 79 AD. Fortunately this volcano is dormant because the region is now much more heavily populated. 
Earthquakes 	  Moving magma shakes the ground, so the number and size of earthquakes increases before an eruption. A volcano that is about to erupt may produce a sequence of earthquakes. Scientists use seismographs that record the length and strength of each earthquake to try to determine if an eruption is imminent. 
Slope  Deformation 	  Magma and gas can push the volcanos slope upward. Most ground deformation is subtle and can only be detected by tiltmeters, which are instruments that measure the angle of the slope of a volcano. But ground swelling may sometimes create huge changes in the shape of a volcano. Mount St. Helens grew a bulge on its north side before its 1980 eruption. Ground swelling may also increase rock falls and landslides. 
Gas  Emissions 	  Gases may be able to escape a volcano before magma reaches the surface. Scientists measure gas emissions in vents on or around the volcano. Gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and even water vapor can be measured at the site ( Figure 8.17) or, in some cases, from a distance using satellites. The amounts of gases and their ratios are calculated to help predict eruptions. 
Remote  Monitoring 	  Some gases can be monitored using satellite technology ( Figure 8.18). Satellites also monitor temperature readings and deformation. As technology improves, scientists are better able to detect changes in a volcano accurately and safely. Since volcanologists are usually uncertain about an eruption, officials may not know whether to require an evacuation. If people are evacuated and the eruption doesnt happen, the people will be displeased and less likely to evacuate the next time there is a threat of an eruption. The costs of disrupting business are great. However, scientists continue to work to improve the accuracy of their predictions. Scientists monitoring gas emissions at Mount St. Helens. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The style of a volcanic eruption depends on magma viscosity. Felsic magmas produce explosive eruptions. Mafic magmas produce effusive eruptions. Explosive eruptions happen along the edges of continents and produce tremendous amounts of material ejected into the air. Non-explosive eruptions produce lavas, such as aa, pahoehoe, and pillow lavas. Volcanoes are classified as active, dormant, or extinct. Signs that a volcano may soon erupt include earthquakes, surface bulging, and gases emitted, as well as other changes that can be monitored by scientists.

Introduction 	  A volcano is a vent through which molten rock and gas escape from a magma chamber. Volcanoes differ in many features such as height, shape, and slope steepness. Some volcanoes are tall cones and others are just cracks in the ground ( Figure 8.19). As you might expect, the shape of a volcano is related to the composition of its magma. Mount St. Helens was a beautiful, classic, cone-shaped volcano. The volcanos 1980 eruption blew more than 400 meters (1,300 feet) off the top of the mountain. 
Composite  Volcanoes 	  Composite volcanoes are made of felsic to intermediate rock. The viscosity of the lava means that eruptions at these volcanoes are often explosive ( Figure 8.20). Mt. Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan, is a dormant composite volcano. The viscous lava cannot travel far down the sides of the volcano before it solidifies, which creates the steep slopes of a composite volcano. Viscosity also causes some eruptions to explode as ash and small rocks. The volcano is constructed layer by layer, as ash and lava solidify, one upon the other ( Figure 8.21). The result is the classic cone shape of composite volcanoes. A cross section of a composite volcano reveals alternating layers of rock and ash: (1) magma chamber, (2) bedrock, (3) pipe, (4) ash layers, (5) lava layers, (6) lava flow, (7) vent, (8) lava, (9) ash cloud. Frequently there is a large crater at the top from the last eruption. 
Shield  Volcanoes 	  Shield volcanoes get their name from their shape. Although shield volcanoes are not steep, they may be very large. Shield volcanoes are common at spreading centers or intraplate hot spots ( Figure 8.22). Mauna Loa Volcano in Hawaii (in the background) is the largest shield volcano on Earth with a diameter of more than 112 kilometers (70 miles). The volcano forms a significant part of the island of Hawaii. The lava that creates shield volcanoes is fluid and flows easily. The spreading lava creates the shield shape. Shield volcanoes are built by many layers over time and the layers are usually of very similar composition. The low viscosity also means that shield eruptions are non-explosive. This Volcanoes 101 video from National Geographic discusses where volcanoes are found and what their properties come from (3e): URL (3:05). 
Cinder  Cones 	  Cinder cones are the most common type of volcano. A cinder cone has a cone shape, but is much smaller than a composite volcano. Cinder cones rarely reach 300 meters in height but they have steep sides. Cinder cones grow rapidly, usually from a single eruption cycle ( Figure 8.23). Cinder cones are composed of small fragments of rock, such as pumice, piled on top of one another. The rock shoots up in the air and doesnt fall far from the vent. The exact composition of a cinder cone depends on the composition of the lava ejected from the volcano. Cinder cones usually have a crater at the summit. Cinder cones are often found near larger volcanoes ( Figure 8.24). 
Supervolcanoes 	  Supervolcano eruptions are extremely rare in Earth history. Its a good thing because they are unimaginably large. In 1943, a Mexican farmer first witnessed a cinder cone erupting in his field. In a year, Paricutn was 336 meters high. By 1952, it reached 424 meters and then stopped erupting. This Landsat image shows the topography of San Francisco Mountain, an extinct volcano, with many cinder cones near it in northern Arizona. Sunset crater is a cinder cone that erupted about 1,000 years ago. A supervolcano must erupt more than 1,000 cubic km (240 cubic miles) of material, compared with 1.2 km3 for Mount St. Helens or 25 km3 for Mount Pinatubo, a large eruption in the Philippines in 1991. Not surprisingly, supervolcanoes are the most dangerous type of volcano. Supervolcanoes are a fairly new idea in volcanology. The exact cause of supervolcano eruptions is still debated. However, scientists think that a very large magma chamber erupts entirely in one catastrophic explosion. This creates a huge hole or caldera into which the surface collapses ( Figure 8.25). The largest supervolcano in North America is beneath Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Yellowstone sits above a hotspot that has erupted catastrophically three times: 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and 640,000 years ago. Yellowstone has produced many smaller (but still enormous) eruptions more recently ( Figure 8.26). Fortunately, current activity at Yellowstone is limited to the regions famous geysers. Long Valley Caldera, south of Mono Lake in California, is the second largest supervolcano in North America ( Figure 8.27). Long Valley had an extremely hot and explosive rhyolite about 700,000 years ago. An earthquake swarm in 1980 alerted geologists to the possibility of a future eruption, but the quakes have since calmed down. The caldera at Santorini in Greece is so large that it can only be seen by satellite. The Yellowstone hotspot has produced enormous felsic eruptions. The Yellowstone caldera collapsed in the most recent super eruption. An interactive image of the geological features of Long Valley Caldera is available here: URL A supervolcano could change life on Earth as we know it. Ash could block sunlight so much that photosynthesis would be reduced and global temperatures would plummet. Volcanic eruptions could have contributed to some of the mass extinctions in our planets history. No one knows when the next super eruption will be. Interesting volcano videos are seen on National Geographic Videos, Environment Video, Natural Disasters, Earthquakes: URL . One interesting one is Mammoth Mountain, which explores Hot Creek and the volcanic area it is a part of in California. The hot water that gives Hot Creek, California, its name is heated by hot rock below Long Valley Caldera. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Composite, shield, cinder cones, and supervolcanoes are the main types of volcanoes. Composite volcanoes are tall, steep cones that produce explosive eruptions. Shield volcanoes form very large, gently sloped mounds from effusive eruptions. Cinder cones are the smallest volcanoes and result from accumulation of many small fragments of ejected material. An explosive eruption may create a caldera, a large hole into which the mountain collapses. Supervolcano eruptions are devastating but extremely rare in Earth history. Composite volcanoes and volcanic cones usually have craters on the top. Why are the craters sometimes Uor horseshoe-shaped? Think about plate boundaries again. What type of volcanoes do you think are found at convergent, divergent, and transform boundaries? How about at intraplate sites? Some people have theorized that if a huge asteroid hits the Earth, the results would be catastrophic. How might an asteroid impact and a supervolcano eruption be similar? List and describe landforms created by lava. Explain how magma creates different landforms. Describe the processes that create hot springs and geysers. geyser hot spring lava dome lava plateau 
Introduction 	  Volcanoes are associated with many types of landforms. The landforms vary with the composition of the magma that created them. Hot springs and geysers are also examples of surface features related to volcanic activity. 
Volcanoes and  Vents 	  The most obvious landforms created by lava are volcanoes, most commonly as cinder cones, composite volcanoes, and shield volcanoes. Eruptions also take place through fissures ( Figure 8.28). The eruptions that created the entire ocean floor are essentially fissure eruptions. 
Lava  Domes 	  When lava is viscous, it is flows slowly. If there is not enough magma or enough pressure to create an explosive eruption, the magma may form a lava dome. Because it is so thick, the lava does not flow far from the vent. ( Figure Lava flows often make mounds right in the middle of craters at the top of volcanoes, as seen in the Figure 8.30. A fissure eruption on Mauna Loa in Hawaii travels toward Mauna Kea on the Big Island. Lava domes are large, round landforms created by thick lava that does not travel far from the vent. Lava domes may form in the crater of composite volcanoes as at Mount St. Helens 
Lava  Plateaus 	  A lava plateau forms when large amounts of fluid lava flows over an extensive area ( Figure 8.31). When the lava solidifies, it creates a large, flat surface of igneous rock. Layer upon layer of basalt have created the Columbia Plateau, which covers more than 161,000 square kilometers (63,000 square miles) in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. 
Land 	  Lava creates new land as it solidifies on the coast or emerges from beneath the water ( Figure 8.32). Lava hitting seawater creates new land. Over time the eruptions can create whole islands. The Hawaiian Islands are formed from shield volcano eruptions that have grown over the last 5 million years ( Figure 8.33). A compilation of satellite images of the Big Island of Hawaii with its five volcanoes. 
Landforms from  Magma 	  Magma intrusions can create landforms. Shiprock in New Mexico is the neck of an old volcano that has eroded away ( Figure 8.34). 
Hot  Springs and  Geysers 	  Water sometimes comes into contact with hot rock. The water may emerge at the surface as either a hot spring or a geyser. 
Hot  Springs 	  Water heated below ground that rises through a crack to the surface creates a hot spring ( Figure 8.35). The water in hot springs may reach temperatures in the hundreds of degrees Celsius beneath the surface, although most hot springs are much cooler. Even some animals enjoy relaxing in natures hot tubs. 
Geysers 	  Geysers are also created by water that is heated beneath the Earths surface, but geysers do not bubble to the surface  they erupt. When water is both superheated by magma and flows through a narrow passageway underground, the environment is ideal for a geyser. The passageway traps the heated water underground, so that heat and pressure can build. Eventually, the pressure grows so great that the superheated water bursts out onto the surface to create a geyser ( Figure 8.36). Conditions are right for the formation of geysers in only a few places on Earth. Of the roughly 1,000 geysers worldwide and about half are found in the United States. Castle Geyser is one of the many geysers at Yellowstone National Park. Castle erupts regularly, but not as frequently or predictably as Old Faithful. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Viscous lava can produce lava domes along a fissure or within a volcano. Lava plateaus form from large lava flows that spread out over large areas. Many islands are built by or are volcanoes. Igneous intrusions associated with volcanoes may create volcanic landforms. When magma heats groundwater, it can reach the surface as hot springs or geysers. What might the Earth look like if there were no tectonic plates? Are there any planets or satellites (moons) that may not have tectonic plates? How is their surface different from that of the Earth? The largest volcano in the solar system is Olympus Mons on Mars. How could this volcano have formed? What kind of land formations are the result of volcanic activity? Are all of these created by extrusive igneous rocks? How are hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean ridges like the geysers of Yellowstone? 
S  Weathering and  Formation of  Soil 	  The solid granite rocks of Yosemite Valley appear to have been there forever and look as if they will be there forever. Yet this photo holds clues to the amazing changes that have taken place in the geologic history of Yosemite Valley and clues to what will lead to the Valleys eventual demise. The rounded domes are the way granitic rock breaks as pressure is released as it rises through the crust. Fractures seen in the granite expose weaknesses in the rock that can lead to boulders breaking off. Those boulders lie in the bottom of the valley. Bridalveil Creek flows through a notch in the granite before plunging over a cliff as Bridalveil Falls. The creek has eroded a V-shaped valley for itself within the U-shaped valley that was once filled with a glacier. The falls plunge into another larger valley, Yosemite Valley, which also has a U-shape from the glacier that once flowed through it. On the far left side of the photo is whats left of a granite dome that split in half. What will be left when the other half of Half Dome is gone? Image copyright Thomas Barrat, 2014.

Introduction 	  The footprints that astronauts left on the Moon will be there forever. Why? This is because the Moon has no atmosphere and, as a result, has no weathering. Weathering is one of the forces on Earth that destroy rocks and landforms. Without weathering, geologic features would build up but would be less likely to break down. What is Weathering? Weathering is the process that changes solid rock into sediments. Sediments were described in the Rocks chapter. With weathering, rock is disintegrated. It breaks into pieces. Once these sediments are separated from the rocks, erosion is the process that moves the sediments. Erosion is the next chapters topic. The four forces of erosion are water, wind, glaciers, and gravity. Water is responsible for most erosion. Water can move most sizes of sediments, depending on the strength of the force. Wind moves sand-sized and smaller pieces of rock through the air. Glaciers move all sizes of sediments, from extremely large boulders to the tiniest fragments. Gravity moves broken pieces of rock, large or small, downslope. While plate tectonics forces work to build huge mountains and other landscapes, the forces of weathering gradually wear those rocks and landscapes away. Together with erosion, tall mountains turn into hills and even plains. The Appalachian Mountains along the east coast of North America were once as tall as the Himalayas. No human being can watch for millions of years as mountains are built, nor can anyone watch as those same mountains gradually are worn away. But imagine a new sidewalk or road. The new road is smooth and even. Over hundreds of years, it will completely disappear, but what happens over one year? What changes would you see ( Figure 9.1)? What forces of weathering wear down that road, or rocks or mountains over time? Animations of different types of weathering processes can be found here: URL nimationsweathering.htm#. A once smooth road surface has cracks and fractures, plus a large pothole. 
Mechanical  Weathering 	  Mechanical weathering (also called physical weathering) breaks rock into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are just like the bigger rock, just smaller. That means the rock has changed physically without changing its composition. The smaller pieces have the same minerals, in just the same proportions as the original rock. There are many ways that rocks can be broken apart into smaller pieces. Ice wedging is the main form of mechanical weathering in any climate that regularly cycles above and below the freezing point ( Figure 9.2). Ice wedging works quickly, breaking apart rocks in areas with temperatures that cycle above and below freezing in the day and night, and also that cycle above and below freezing with the seasons. Ice wedging breaks apart so much rock that large piles of broken rock are seen at the base of a hillside, as rock fragments separate and tumble down. Ice wedging is common in Earths polar regions and mid latitudes, and also at higher elevations, such as in the mountains. Abrasion is another form of mechanical weathering. In abrasion, one rock bumps against another rock. Gravity causes abrasion as a rock tumbles down a mountainside or cliff. Moving water causes abrasion as particles in the water collide and bump against one another. Strong winds carrying pieces of sand can sandblast surfaces. Ice in glaciers carries many bits and pieces of rock. Rocks embedded at the bottom of the glacier scrape against the rocks below. Abrasion makes rocks with sharp or jagged edges smooth and round. If you have ever collected beach glass or cobbles from a stream, you have witnessed the work of abrasion ( Figure 9.3). Rocks on a beach are worn down by abrasion as passing waves cause them to strike each other. Now that you know what mechanical weathering is, can you think of other ways it could happen? Plants and animals can do the work of mechanical weathering ( Figure 9.4). This could happen slowly as a plants roots grow into a crack or fracture in rock and gradually grow larger, wedging open the crack. Burrowing animals can also break apart rock as they dig for food or to make living spaces for themselves. Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases Figure 9.5. With more surfaces exposed, there are more surfaces on which chemical (a) Human activities are responsible for enormous amounts of mechanical weathering, by digging or blasting into rock to build homes, roads, subways, or to quarry stone. (b) Salt weathering of building stone on the island of Gozo, Malta. weathering can occur. Mechanical weathering may increase the rate of chemical weathering. 
Chemical  Weathering 	  Chemical weathering is the other important type of weathering. Chemical weathering is different from mechanical weathering because the rock changes, not just in size of pieces, but in composition. That is, one type of mineral changes into a different mineral. Chemical weathering works through chemical reactions that cause changes in the minerals. Most minerals form at high pressure or high temperatures deep in the crust, or sometimes in the mantle. When these rocks reach the Earths surface, they are now at very low temperatures and pressures. This is a very different environment from the one in which they formed and the minerals are no longer stable. In chemical weathering, minerals that were stable inside the crust must change to minerals that are stable at Earths surface. Remember that the most common minerals in Earths crust are the silicate minerals. Many silicate minerals form in igneous or metamorphic rocks. The minerals that form at the highest temperatures and pressures are the least stable at the surface. Clay is stable at the surface and chemical weathering converts many minerals to clay ( Figure 9.6). There are many types of chemical weathering because there are many agents of chemical weathering. Water is Deforestation in Brazil reveals the underlying clay-rich soil. the most important agent of chemical weathering. Two other important agents of chemical weathering are carbon dioxide and oxygen. 
Chemical  Weathering by  Water 	  A water molecule has a very simple chemical formula, H2O, two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. But water is pretty remarkable in terms of all the things it can do. Remember from the Earths Minerals chapter that water is a polar molecule. The positive side of the molecule attracts negative ions and the negative side attracts positive ions. So water molecules separate the ions from their compounds and surround them. Water can completely dissolve some minerals, such as salt. Check out this animation of how water dissolves salt: URL imations/dissolve.html Hydrolysis is the name of the chemical reaction between a chemical compound and water. When this reaction takes place, water dissolves ions from the mineral and carries them away. These elements have undergone leaching. Through hydrolysis, a mineral such as potassium feldspar is leached of potassium and changed into a clay mineral. Clay minerals are more stable at the Earths surface. 
Chemical  Weathering by  Carbon  Dioxide 	  Carbon dioxide (CO2) combines with water as raindrops fall through the atmosphere. This makes a weak acid, called carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is a very common in nature where it works to dissolve rock. Pollutants, such as sulfur and nitrogen, from fossil fuel burning, create sulfuric and nitric acid. Sulfuric and nitric acids are the two main components of acid rain, which accelerate chemical weathering ( Figure 9.7). Acid rain is discussed in the Human Actions and the Atmosphere chapter. 
Chemical  Weathering by  Oxygen 	  Oxidation is a chemical reaction that takes place when oxygen reacts with another element. Oxygen is very strongly chemically reactive. The most familiar type of oxidation is when iron reacts with oxygen to create rust ( Figure 9.8). Minerals that are rich in iron break down as the iron oxidizes and forms new compounds. Iron oxide produces the red color in soils. When iron rich minerals oxidize, they produce the familiar red color found in rust. Now that you know what chemical weathering is, can you think of some other ways chemical weathering might occur? Chemical weathering can also be contributed to by plants and animals. As plant roots take in soluble ions as nutrients, certain elements are exchanged. Plant roots and bacterial decay use carbon dioxide in the process of respiration. 
Influences on  Weathering 	  Weathering rates depend on several factors. These include the composition of the rock and the minerals it contains as well as the climate of a region. 
Rock and  Mineral  Type 	  Different rock types weather at different rates. Certain types of rock are very resistant to weathering. Igneous rocks, especially intrusive igneous rocks such as granite, weather slowly because it is hard for water to penetrate them. Other types of rock, such as limestone, are easily weathered because they dissolve in weak acids. Rocks that resist weathering remain at the surface and form ridges or hills. Devils Tower in Wyoming is an igneous rock from beneath a volcano ( Figure 9.9). As the surrounding less resistant rocks were worn away, the resistant center of the volcano remained behind. Devils Tower is the central plug of resistant lava from which the surrounding rock weathered and eroded away. Different minerals also weather at different rates. Some minerals in a rock might completely dissolve in water but the more resistant minerals remain. In this case, the rocks surface becomes pitted and rough. When a less resistant mineral dissolves, more resistant mineral grains are released from the rock. 
Climate 	  A regions climate strongly influences weathering. Climate is determined by the temperature of a region plus the amount of precipitation it receives. Climate is weather averaged over a long period of time. Chemical weathering increases as: Temperature increases: Chemical reactions proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures. For each 10oC increase in average temperature, the rate of chemical reactions doubles. Precipitation increases: More water allows more chemical reactions. Since water participates in both mechanical and chemical weathering, more water strongly increases weathering. So how do different climates influence weathering? A cold, dry climate will produce the lowest rate of weathering. A warm, wet climate will produce the highest rate of weathering. The warmer a climate is, the more types of vegetation it will have and the greater the rate of biological weathering ( Figure 9.10). This happens because plants and bacteria grow and multiply faster in warmer temperatures. Wet, warm tropical areas have the most weathering. Some resources are concentrated by weathering processes. In tropical climates, intense chemical weathering carries away all soluble minerals, leaving behind just the least soluble components. The aluminum oxide, bauxite, forms this way and is our main source of aluminum ore. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Mechanical weathering breaks rocks into smaller pieces without changing their composition. Ice wedging and abrasion are two important processes of mechanical weathering. Chemical weathering breaks down rocks by forming new minerals that are stable at the Earths surface. Water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen are important agents of chemical weathering. Different types of rocks weather at different rates. More resistant types of rocks will remain longer. What other types of surfaces are affected by weathering other than rock? What might the surface of the Earth look like if there was no weathering? Think about the Moon or other planets. Do you think that you would be alive today if water did not dissolve elements? Would the same composition of rock weather the same way in three very different climates? Discuss why soil is an important resource. Describe how soil forms from existing rocks. Describe the different textures and components of soil. Draw and describe a soil profile. Define three climate related soils: pedalfer, pedocal and laterite.

Introduction 	  Without mechanical and chemical weathering working to break down rock, there would not be any soil on Earth. It is unlikely that humans or most other creatures would be able to live on Earth without soil. Wood, paper, cotton, medicines, and even pure water need soil. So soil is a precious resource that must be carefully managed and cared for. Although soil is a renewable resource, its renewal takes a lot of time. 
Characteristics of  Soil 	  Even though soil is only a very thin layer on Earths surface over the solid rocks below, it is the where the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere meet. Within the soil layer, important reactions between solid rock, liquid water, air, and living things take place. Soil is a complex mixture of different materials. About half of most soils are inorganic materials, such as the products of weathered rock, including pebbles, sand, silt, and clay particles. About half of all soils are organic materials, formed from the partial breakdown and decomposition of plants and animals. The organic materials are necessary for a soil to be fertile. The organic portion provides the nutrients, such as nitrogen, needed for strong plant growth. In between the solid pieces, there are tiny spaces filled with air and water. In some soils, the organic portion could be missing, as in desert sand. Or a soil could be completely organic, such as the materials that make up peat in a bog or swamp ( Figure 9.11). Peat is so rich in organic material, it can be burned for energy. Soil is an ecosystem unto itself. In the spaces of soil, there are thousands or even millions of living organisms. Those organisms could be anything from earthworms, ants, bacteria, or fungi ( Figure 9.12). 
Climate 	  Scientists know that climate is the most important factor determining soil type because given enough time, different rock types in a given climate will produce a similar soil. Even the same rock type in different climates will not produce the same type of soil. This is true because most rocks on Earth are made of the same eight elements and when the rock breaks down to become soil, those elements dominate. The same factors that lead to increased weathering also lead to greater soil formation. More rain equals more chemical reactions to weather minerals and rocks. Those reactions are most efficient in the top layers of the soil where the water is fresh and has not yet reacted with other materials. Increased rainfall increases the amount of rock that is dissolved as well as the amount of material that is carried away by moving water. As materials are carried away, new surfaces are exposed, which also increases the rate of weathering. Earthworms and insects are important residents of soils. Increased temperature increases the rate of chemical reactions, which also increases soil formation. In warmer regions, plants and bacteria grow faster, which helps to weather material and produce soils. In tropical regions, where temperature and precipitation are consistently high, thick soils form. Arid regions have thin soils. Soil type also influences the type of vegetation that can grow in the region. We can identify climate types by the types of plants that grow there. 
Rock  Type 	  The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil. The minerals that are present in the rock determine the composition of the material that is available to make soil. Soils may form in place or from material that has been moved. Residual soils form in place. The underlying rock breaks down to form the layers of soil that reside above it. Only about one-third of the soils in the United States are residual. Transported soils have been transported in from somewhere else. Sediments can be transported into an area by glaciers, wind, water, or gravity. Soils form from the loose particles that have been transported to a new location and deposited. 
Slope 	  The steeper the slope, the less likely material will be able to stay in place to form soil. Material on a steep slope is likely to go downhill. Materials will accumulate and soil will form where land areas are flat or gently undulating. 
Time 	  Soils thicken as the amount of time available for weathering increases. The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area, the greater the degree of alteration. 
Biological  Activity 	  The partial decay of plant material and animal remains produces the organic material and nutrients in soil. In soil, decomposing organisms breakdown the complex organic molecules of plant matter and animal remains to form simpler inorganic molecules that are soluble in water. Decomposing organisms also create organic acids that increase the rate of weathering and soil formation. Bacteria in the soil change atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates. The decayed remains of plant and animal life are called humus, which is an extremely important part of the soil. Humus coats the mineral grains. It binds them together into clumps that then hold the soil together, creating its structure. Humus increases the soils porosity and water holding capacity and helps to buffer rapid changes in soil acidity. Humus also helps the soil to hold its nutrients, increasing its fertility. Fertile soils are rich in nitrogen, contain a high percentage of organic materials, and are usually black or dark brown in color. Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray or yellow or even red in color. Fertile soils are more easily cultivated. 
Soil  Texture and  Composition 	  The inorganic portion of soil is made of many different size particles, and these different size particles are present in different proportions. The combination of these two factors determines some of the properties of the soil. A permeable soil allows water to flow through it easily because the spaces between the inorganic particles are large and well connected. Sandy or silty soils are considered light soils because they are permeable, water-draining types of soils. Soils that have lots of very small spaces are water-holding soils. For example, when clay is present in a soil, the soil is heavier, holds together more tightly, and holds water. When a soil contains a mixture of grain sizes, the soil is called a loam ( Figure 9.13). When soil scientists want to precisely determine soil type, they measure the percentage of sand, silt, and clay. They plot this information on a triangular diagram, with each size particle at one corner ( Figure 9.14). The soil type can then be determined from the location on the diagram. At the top, a soil would be clay; at the left corner, it would be sand, and at the right corner it would be silt. Soils in the lower middle with less than 50% clay are loams. Using the chart as a guide, what is the composition of a sandy clay loam? If you would like to determine soil type by feel, heres a chart from the USDA to help you: URL /?cid=nrcs142p2_054311 . 
Soil  Horizons and  Profiles 	  A residual soil forms over many years, as mechanical and chemical weathering slowly change solid rock into soil. The development of a residual soil may go something like this. A cut in the side of a hillside shows each of the different layers of soil. All together, these are called a soil profile ( Figure 9.15). The simplest soils have three horizons. 
Topsoil 	  Called the A horizon, the topsoil is usually the darkest layer of the soil because it has the highest proportion of organic material. The topsoil is the region of most intense biological activity: insects, worms, and other animals burrow through it and plants stretch their roots down into it. Plant roots help to hold this layer of soil in place. In the topsoil, minerals may dissolve in the fresh water that moves through it to be carried to lower layers of the soil. Very small particles, such as clay, may also get carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the ground. Soil is an important resource. Each soil horizon is distinctly visible in this photograph. 
Subsoil 	  The B horizon or subsoil is where soluble minerals and clays accumulate. This layer is lighter brown and holds more water than the topsoil because of the presence of iron and clay minerals. There is less organic material. Figure A soil profile is the complete set of soil layers. 
Each layer is called a 	  horizon. 
C horizon 	  The C horizon is a layer of partially altered bedrock. There is some evidence of weathering in this layer, but pieces of the original rock are seen and can be identified. Not all climate regions develop soils, and not all regions develop the same horizons. Some areas develop as many as five or six distinct layers, while others develop only very thin soils or perhaps no soils at all. 
Types of  Soils 	  Although soil scientists recognize thousands of types of soil each with its own specific characteristics and name lets consider just three soil types. This will help you to understand some of the basic ideas about how climate produces a certain type of soil, but there are many exceptions to what we will learn right now ( Figure 9.17). Just some of the thousands of soil types. 
Pedalfer 	  Deciduous trees, the trees that lose their leaves each winter, need at least 65 cm of rain per year. These forests produce soils called pedalfers, which are common in many areas of the temperate, eastern part of the United States ( Figure 9.18). The word pedalfer comes from some of the elements that are commonly found in the soil. The Al in ped alfer is the chemical symbol of the element aluminum, and the Fe in pedal fer is the chemical symbol for iron. Pedalfers are usually a very fertile, dark brown or black soil. Not surprising, they are rich in aluminum clays and iron oxides. Because a great deal of rainfall is common in this climate, most of the soluble minerals dissolve and are carried away, leaving the less soluble clays and iron oxides behind. 
Pedocal 	  Pedocal soils form in drier, temperate areas where grasslands and brush are the usual types of vegetation ( Figure 9.19). The climates that form pedocals have less than 65 cm rainfall per year, so compared to pedalfers, there is less chemical weathering and less water to dissolve away soluble minerals so more soluble minerals are present and fewer clay minerals are produced. It is a drier region with less vegetation, so the soils have lower amounts of organic material and are less fertile. A pedocal is named for the calcite enriched layer that forms. Water begins to move down through the soil layers, but before it gets very far, it begins to evaporate. Soluble minerals, like calcium carbonate, concentrate in a layer that marks the lowest place that water was able to reach. This layer is called caliche. A pedalfer is the dark, fertile type of soil that will form in a forested region. A pedocal is the alkaline type of soil that forms in grassland regions. 
Laterite 	  In tropical rainforests where it rains literally every day, laterite soils form ( Figure 9.20). In these hot, wet, tropical regions, intense chemical weathering strips the soils of their nutrients. There is practically no humus. All soluble minerals are removed from the soil and all plant nutrients are carried away. All that is left behind are the least soluble materials, like aluminum and iron oxides. These soils are often red in color from the iron oxides. Laterite soils bake as hard as a brick if they are exposed to the sun. Many climates types have not been mentioned here. Each produces a distinctive soil type that forms in the particular circumstances found there. Where there is less weathering, soils are thinner but soluble minerals may be present. Where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick but nutrient poor. Soil development takes a very long time, it may take hundreds or even thousands of years for a good fertile topsoil to form. Soil scientists estimate that in the very best soil-forming conditions, soil forms at a rate of about 1mm/year. In poor conditions, soil formation may take thousands of years! A laterite is the type of thick, nutrient poor soil that forms in the rainforest. 
Soil  Conservation 	  Soil is only a renewable resource if it is carefully managed. Drought, insect plagues, or outbreaks of disease are natural cycles of events that can negatively impact ecosystems and the soil, but there are also many ways in which humans neglect or abuse this important resource. One harmful practice is removing the vegetation that helps to hold soil in place. Sometimes just walking or riding your bike over the same place will kill the grass that normally grows there. Land is also deliberately cleared or deforested for wood. The loose soils then may be carried away by wind or running water. In many areas of the world, the rate of soil erosion is many times greater than the rate at which it is forming. Soils can also be contaminated if too much salt accumulates in the soil or where pollutants sink into the ground. There are many practices that can protect and preserve soil resources. Adding organic material to the soil in the form of plant or animal waste, such as compost or manure, increases the fertility of the soil and improves its ability to hold onto water and nutrients ( Figure 9.21). Inorganic fertilizer can also temporarily increase the fertility of a soil and may be less expensive or time consuming, but it does not provide the same long-term improvements as organic materials. Organic material can be added to soil to help increase its fertility. Agricultural practices such as rotating crops, alternating the types of crops planted in each row, and planting nutrient rich cover crops all help to keep soil more fertile as it is used season after season. Planting trees as windbreaks, plowing along contours of the field, or building terraces into steeper slopes will all help to hold soil in place ( Figure 9.22). No-till or low-tillage farming helps to keep soil in place by disturbing the ground as little as possible when planting. Steep slopes can be terraced to make level planting areas and decrease surface water runoff and erosion. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Soil is an important resource. Life on Earth could not exist as it does today without soil. The type of soil that forms depends mostly on climate and, to a lesser extent, on the original parent rock material and other factors. Soil texture and composition, plus the amount of organic material in a soil, determine a soils qualities and fertility. Given enough time, rock is weathered to produce a layered soil, called a soil profile. Each type of climate can ultimately produce a unique type of soil. The University of British Columbia has a collection of images that illustrate various aspects of soils: See here for more info. Why is soil such an important resource? Would soil mature faster from unaltered bedrock or from transported materials? If soil erosion is happening at a greater rate than new soil can form, what will eventually happen to the soil in that region? Do you think there are pollutants that could not easily be removed from soil?

Chapter  Outline 	  This image taken by astronauts on the International Space Station is of the mouth of the largest river in Madagascar. The Betsiboka River runs into the Betsiboka Estuary seen here. Decades of logging have cleared so much forest land in Madagascar that eroded soil clogs the river. When tropical storms strike, as in this image of when tropical Cyclone Gafilo struck the island in March 2004, the rate of erosion is even greater. Viewing this scene caused the astronauts to say that Madagascar is bleeding into the ocean. Fortunately the government of Madagascar is working to reverse the problem by reducing erosion, encouraging reforestation, and controlling land clearing.

Describe landforms that are produced as ground water flows. alluvial fan base level bed load column competence delta dissolved load floodplain gradient groundwater headwaters meander natural levee saltation sinkhole stalactite stalagmite suspended load travertine 
Introduction 	  Streams any running water from a rivulet to a raging river  complete the hydrologic cycle by returning precipitation that falls on land to the oceans ( Figure 10.1). Some of this water moves over the surface and some moves through the ground as groundwater. Flowing water does the work of both erosion and deposition. 
Erosion by  Streams 	  Flowing streams pick up and transport weathered materials by eroding sediments from their banks. Streams also carry ions and ionic compounds that dissolve easily in the water. Sediments are carried as: Dissolved load: Dissolved load is composed of ions in solution. These ions are usually carried in the water all the way to the ocean. Suspended load: Sediments carried as solids as the stream flows are suspended load. The size of particles that can be carried is determined by the streams velocity ( Figure 10.2). Faster streams can carry larger particles. Streams that carry larger particles have greater competence. Streams with a steep gradient (slope) have a faster velocity and greater competence. Rivers carry sand, silt and clay as suspended load. During flood stage, the suspended load greatly increases as stream velocity increases. Bed load: Particles that are too large to be carried as suspended load are bumped and pushed along the stream bed as bed load. Bed load sediments do not move continuously. This intermittent movement is called saltation. Streams with high velocities and steep gradients do a great deal of down cutting into the stream bed, which is primarily accomplished by movement of particles that make up the bed load. 
Stages of  Streams 	  As a stream flows from higher elevations, like in the mountains, towards lower elevations, like the ocean, the work of the stream changes. At a streams headwaters, often high in the mountains, gradients are steep ( Figure 10.3). The stream moves fast and does lots of work eroding the stream bed. This stream begins as snow melt from the mountains. As a stream moves into lower areas, the gradient is not as steep. Now the stream does more work eroding the edges of its banks. Many streams develop curves in their channels called meanders ( Figure 10.4). As the river moves onto flatter ground, the stream erodes the outer edges of its banks to carve a floodplain, which is a flat level area surrounding the stream channel ( Figure 10.5). Base level is where a stream meets a large body of standing water, usually the ocean, but sometimes a lake or pond. Streams work to down cut in their stream beds until they reach base level. The higher the elevation, the farther the stream is from where it will reach base level and the more cutting it has to do. 
Stream  Deposition 	  As a stream gets closer to base level, its gradient lowers and it deposits more material than it erodes. On flatter ground, streams deposit material on the inside of meanders. Placer mineral deposits, described in the Earths Minerals chapter, are often deposited there. A streams floodplain is much broader and shallower than the streams channel. When a stream flows onto its floodplain, its velocity slows and it deposits much of its load. These sediments are rich in nutrients and make excellent farmland ( Figure 10.6). (a) At a meander, a stream actively erodes its outer banks and deposits material along the inside curves. This causes these meanders to migrate laterally over time. (b) This stream has deposited larger materials such as gravel and pebbles along the inside curve of a meander. (c) This image is a topographic map. The San Juan River eroded the land surface as the Colorado Plateau uplifted. The rivers meanders were preserved as a feature called incised meanders. A stream at flood stage carries lots of sediments. When its gradient decreases, the stream overflows its banks and broadens its channel. The decrease in gradient causes the stream to deposit its sediments, the largest first. These large sediments build a higher area around the edges of the stream channel, creating natural levees ( Figure 10.7). When a river enters standing water, its velocity slows to a stop. The stream moves back and forth across the region and drops its sediments in a wide triangular-shaped deposit called a delta ( Figure 10.8). If a stream falls down a steep slope onto a broad flat valley, an alluvial fan develops ( Figure 10.9). Alluvial fans generally form in arid regions. After many floods, a stream builds natural levees along its banks. 
Ground  Water  Erosion and  Deposition 	  Rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) as it falls. The CO2 combines with water to form carbonic acid. The slightly acidic water sinks into the ground and moves through pore spaces in soil and cracks and fractures in rock. An alluvial fan in Iran. The mountains are in the lower right corner of the photograph. The flow of water underground is ground water. Ground water is a strong erosional force, as it works to dissolve away solid rock ( Figure 10.10). Carbonic acid is especially good at dissolving the rock limestone. When water sinks into the ground, it becomes ground water. 
Cave  Formation 	  Working slowly over many years, ground water travels along small cracks. The water dissolves and carries away the solid rock gradually enlarging the cracks. Eventually a cave may form ( Figure 10.11). Ground water carries the dissolved minerals in solution. The minerals may then be deposited, for example, as stalagmites or stalactites ( Figure 10.12). If a stalactite and stalagmite join together, they form a column. One of the wonders of visiting a cave is to witness the beauty of these amazing and strangely captivating structures. Caves also produce a beautiful rock, formed from calcium carbonate, travertine. Ground water saturated with calcium carbonate precipitates as the mineral calcite or aragonite. Mineral springs that produce travertine can be hot, warm or even cold ( Figure 10.13). You can explore a fantastic cave, Kartchner Caverns, in Arizona, by watching this video: URL graphic.com/video/player/science/earth-sci/exploring-kartchner-sci.html If the roof of a cave collapses, a sinkhole could form. Some sinkholes are large enough to swallow up a home or several homes in a neighborhood ( Figure 10.14). 
Lesson  Summary 	  Streams erode the land as they move from higher elevations to the sea. Eroded materials can be carried in a river as dissolved load, suspended load, or bed load. A river erodes deeply when it is far from its base level, the place where it enters standing water. Streams form bends, called meanders. Broad, flat areas are known as floodplains. A delta or an alluvial fan might form where the stream drops its sediment load. Caves form underground as ground water gradually dissolves away rock. Caverns many football fields long and as high as many meters tall form where ground water erodes away rock. (a) Stalactites form as calcium carbonate drips from the ceiling of a cave, forming beautiful icicle-like formations. The word stalactite has a c and it forms from the ceiling. (b) Stalagmites form as calcium carbonate drips from the ceiling to the floor of a cave and then grow upwards. The g in stalagmite means it forms on the ground. This sinkhole formed in Florida. Would a stream at high elevations erode more than a stream at lower elevations? How would Earths surface look without streams? Would a flash flood along a normally dry river valley be a dangerous event? Do you think caves could form in your neighborhood? Describe how the action of waves produces different shoreline features. Discuss how areas of quiet water produce deposits of sand and sediment. Discuss some of the structures humans build to help defend against wave erosion. arch barrier island beach breakwater groin refraction sea stack sea wall spit wave-cut cliff wave-cut platform 
Introduction 	  Waves are important for building up and breaking down shorelines. Waves transport sand onto and off of beaches. They transport sand along beaches. Waves carve structures at the shore. 
Wave  Action and  Erosion 	  All waves are energy traveling through some type of material, such as water ( Figure 10.15). Ocean waves form from wind blowing over the water. The largest waves form when the wind is very strong, blows steadily for a long time, and blows over a long distance. The wind could be strong, but if it gusts for just a short time, large waves wont form. Wave energy does the work of erosion at the shore. Waves approach the shore at some angle so the inshore part of the wave reaches shallow water sooner than the part that is further out. The shallow part of the wave feels the bottom first. This slows down the inshore part of the wave and makes the wave bend. This bending is called refraction. Wave refraction either concentrates wave energy or disperses it. In quiet water areas, such as bays, wave energy is dispersed, so sand is deposited. Areas that stick out into the water are eroded by the strong wave energy that concentrates its power on the wave-cut cliff ( Figure 10.16). The wave erodes the bottom of the cliff, eventually causing the cliff to collapse. Other features of wave erosion are pictured and named in Figure 10.17. A wave-cut platform is the level area formed by wave erosion as the waves undercut a cliff. An arch is produced when waves erode through a cliff. When a sea arch collapses, the isolated towers of rocks that remain are known as sea stacks. 
Wave  Deposition 	  Rivers carry sediments from the land to the sea. If wave action is high, a delta will not form. Waves will spread the sediments along the coastline to create a beach ( Figure 10.18). Waves also erode sediments from cliffs and shorelines and transport them onto beaches. Sand deposits in quiet areas along a shoreline to form a beach. Beaches can be made of mineral grains, like quartz, rock fragments, and also pieces of shell or coral ( Figure 10.19). Quartz, rock fragments, and shell make up the sand along a beach. Waves continually move sand along the shore. Waves also move sand from the beaches on shore to bars of sand offshore as the seasons change. In the summer, waves have lower energy so they bring sand up onto the beach. In the winter, higher energy waves bring the sand back offshore. Some of the features formed by wave-deposited sand are in Figure 10.20. These features include barrier islands and spits. A spit is sand connected to land and extending into the water. A spit may hook to form a tombolo. Examples of features formed by wavedeposited sand. Shores that are relatively flat and gently sloping may be lined with long narrow barrier islands ( Figure 10.21). Most barrier islands are a few kilometers wide and tens of kilometers long. (a) Barrier islands off of Alabama. A lagoon lies on the inland side. (b) Barrier islands, such as Padre Island off the coast of Texas, are made entirely of sand. (c) Barrier islands are some of the most urbanized areas of our coastlines, such as Miami Beach. In its natural state, a barrier island acts as the first line of defense against storms such as hurricanes. When barrier islands are urbanized ( Figure 10.21), hurricanes damage houses and businesses rather than vegetated sandy areas in which sand can move. A large hurricane brings massive problems to the urbanized area. 
Protecting  Shorelines 	  Intact shore areas protect inland areas from storms that come off the ocean ( Figure 10.22). Where the natural landscape is altered or the amount of development make damage from a storm too costly to consider, people use several types of structures to attempt to slow down wave erosion. A few are pictured in the Figure 10.23. A groin is a long narrow pile of rocks built perpendicular to the shoreline to keep sand at that beach. A breakwater is a structure built in the water parallel to the shore in order to protect the shore from strong incoming waves. A seawall is also parallel to the shore, but it is built onshore. People do not always want to choose safe building practices, and instead choose to build a beach house right on the beach. Protecting development from wave erosion is difficult and expensive. Dunes and mangroves along Baja California protect the villages that are found inland. (a) Groins trap sand on the up-current side so then people down current build groins to trap sand too. (b) Breakwaters are visible in this satellite image parallel to the shoreline. (c) Seawalls are similar to breakwaters except built onshore. Extremely large storm waves may destroy the sea wall, leaving the area unprotected. Protection does not always work. The northeastern coast of Japan was protected by anti-tsunami seawalls. Yet waves from the 2011 tsunami that resulted from the Tohoku earthquake washed over the top of some seawalls and caused others to collapse. Japan is now planning to build even higher seawalls to prepare for any future (and inevitable) tsunami. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Waves in the ocean are what we see as energy travels through the water. Wave energy produces erosional formations such as cliffs, wave cut platforms, sea arches, and sea stacks. When waves reach the shore, they can form deposits such as beaches, spits, and barrier islands. Groins, jetties, breakwaters, and seawalls are structures that protect the shore from breaking waves. What situations would increase the rate of erosion by waves? If barrier islands are natures first line of defense against ocean storms, why do people build on them? Could a seawall ever increase the amount of damage done by waves? Describe the ways particles are carried by wind. Discuss several ways that wind erosion changes land surfaces. Describe how sand dunes form. Describe the type of deposits formed by windborne silts and clays. deflation desert pavement desert varnish loess sand dune slip face ventifacts 
Introduction 	  The power of wind to erode depends on particle size, wind strength, and whether the particles are able to be picked up. Wind is a more important erosional force in arid than humid regions. 
Transport of  Particles by  Wind 	  Wind transports small particles, such as silt and clay, over great distances, even halfway across a continent or an entire ocean basin. Particles may be suspended for days. Wind more easily picks up particles on ground that has been disturbed, such as a construction site or a sand dune. Just like flowing water, wind transports particles as both bed load and suspended load. For wind, bed load is made of sand-sized particles, many of which move by saltation ( Figure 10.24). The suspended load is very small particles of silt and clay. 
Wind  Erosion 	  Wind is a stronger erosional force in arid regions than it is in humid regions because winds are stronger. In humid areas, water and vegetation bind the soil so it is harder to pick up. In arid regions, small particles are selectively (a) Wind transport is by suspension, saltation, and creep (bed load). (b) In a sandstorm, sand is usually within a meter of the ground. A dust storms smaller particles can travel higher. A dust storm as it approaches Al Asad, Iraq. picked up and transported. As they are removed, the ground surface gets lower and rockier, causing deflation. What is left is desert pavement ( Figure 10.25), a surface covered by gravel sized particles that are not easily moved by wind. This desert pavement formed in the Mojave Desert as a result of deflation. Particles moved by wind do the work of abrasion. As a grain strikes another grain or surface it erodes that surface. Abrasion by wind may polish natural or human-made surfaces, such as buildings. Stones that have become polished and faceted due to abrasion by sand particles are called ventifacts ( Figure 10.26). Exposed rocks in desert areas often develop a dark brown to black coating called desert varnish. Wind transports clay-sized particles that chemically react with other substances at high temperatures. The coating is formed of iron As wind blows from different direction, polished flat surfaces create a ventifact. and manganese oxides ( Figure 10.27). Ancient people carved these petroglyphs into desert varnish near Canyonlands National Park in Utah. 
Wind  Deposition 	  Deserts and seashores sometimes have sand dunes ( Figure 10.28). Beach dunes have different compositions depending on their location. Beach dunes are usually quartz because in humid areas other minerals weather into clays. In the tropics, sand dunes may be composed of calcium carbonate, which is common. In deserts, sand dunes may be composed of a variety of minerals. There is little weathering and so less stable minerals are left behind. Dune sands are usually very uniform in size and shape. Particles are sand-sized, because larger particles are too heavy for the wind to transport by suspension. Particles are rounded, since rounded grains roll more easily than angular grains. For sand dunes to form there must be an abundant supply of sand and steady winds. A strong wind slows down, often over some type of obstacle, such as a rock or some vegetation and drops its sand. As the wind moves up and over the obstacle, it increases in speed. It carries the sand grains up the gently sloping, upwind side of the dune by saltation. As the wind passes over the dune, its speed decreases. Sand cascades down the crest, forming the slip face of the dune. The slip face is steep because it is at the angle of repose for dry sand, about 34 ( Figure 10.29). This sand dune in the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park, Utah shows secondary sand ripples along its slip face. Sand dunes slope gently in the upwind direction. Downwind, a steeper slip face forms. Wind deposits dune sands layer by layer. If the wind changes directions, cross beds form. Cross beds are named for the way each layer is formed at an angle to the ground ( Figure 10.30). The types of sand dune that forms depends on the amount of sand available, the character and direction of the wind, and the type of ground the sand is moving over. Some dune types are shown in the Figure 10.31. An animation of the formation of the dunes at Great Sand Dunes National Park is seen on this website: http ://URL . The cross-bedded sandstones in Escalante Canyons, Utah, are ancient sand dunes. (a) Crescent shaped barchan dunes need adequate an amount of sand, winds consistent in one direction and hard ground. The crescent shape curves in the direction the wind blows. (b) Star-shaped dunes have several ridges of sand radiating from a central point. (c) Parabolic dunes form a U-shape that curves into the wind direction. Some type of vegetation at least partly covers the sand. (d) Linear dunes form long straight lines parallel to the wind direction. They form in areas with low sand and winds coming together from different directions. 
Loess 	  Windblown silt and clay deposited layer on layer over a large area are loess, which comes from the German word loose ( Figure 10.32). Loess deposits form downwind of glacial outwash or desert, where fine particles are available. Loess deposits make very fertile soils in many regions of the world. Loess deposits form nearly vertical cliffs, without grains sliding down the face. Fine-grained mud in the deep ocean is formed from silts and clays brought from the land by wind. The particles are deposited on the sea surface, then slowly settle to the deep ocean floor, forming brown, greenish, or reddish clays. Volcanic ash may also settle on the seafloor. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Wind can carry small particles such as sand, silt, and clay. Wind erosion abrades surfaces and makes desert pavement, ventifacts, and desert varnish. Sand dunes are common wind deposits that come in different shapes, depending on winds and sand availability. Loess is a very fine grained, wind-borne deposit that can be important to soil formation. Would hurricane-force winds along a coastline produce wind related erosion? What would be needed to convert a desert area back to a productive region for farming? Do you think wind could sculpt exposed rocks? Explain how this might happen. Discuss the different erosional features formed by alpine glaciers. Describe the processes by which glaciers change the underlying rocks. Discuss the particles deposited by glaciers as they advance and recede. Describe the landforms created by glacial deposits. alpine (valley) glacier continental glacier end moraine glacial erratic glacial striations glacial till glaciers ground moraine hanging valley lateral moraine moraine plucking terminal moraine varve 
Introduction 	  Glaciers cover about 10% of the land surface near Earths poles and they are also found in high mountains. During the Ice Ages, glaciers covered as much as 30% of Earth. Around 600 to 800 million years ago, geologists think that almost all of the Earth was covered in snow and ice. Scientists use the evidence of erosion and deposition left by glaciers to do a kind of detective work to figure out where the ice once was. 
Formation and  Movement of  Glaciers 	  Glaciers are solid ice that move extremely slowly along the land surface ( Figure 10.33). Glacial ice erodes and shapes the underlying rocks. Glaciers also deposit sediments in characteristic landforms. The two types of glaciers are: Continental glaciers are large ice sheets that cover relatively flat ground. These glaciers flow outward from where the greatest amount of snow and ice accumulate. Alpine or valley glaciers flow downhill through mountains along existing valleys. A satellite image of glaciers in the Himalaya with some features labeled. 
Glacial  Erosion 	  Glaciers erode the underlying rock by abrasion and plucking. Glacial meltwater seeps into cracks of the underlying rock, the water freezes and pushes pieces of rock outward. The rock is then plucked out and carried away by the flowing ice of the moving glacier ( Figure 10.34). With the weight of the ice over them, these rocks can scratch deeply into the underlying bedrock making long, parallel grooves in the bedrock, called glacial striations. Mountain glaciers leave behind unique erosional features. When a glacier cuts through a V shaped river valley, the glacier pucks rocks from the sides and bottom. This widens the valley and steepens the walls, making a U shaped valley ( Figure 10.35). Smaller tributary glaciers, like tributary streams, flow into the main glacier in their own shallower U shaped valleys. A hanging valley forms where the main glacier cuts off a tributary glacier and creates a cliff. Streams plunge over the cliff to create waterfalls ( Figure 10.36). Up high on a mountain, where a glacier originates, rocks are pulled away from valley walls. Some of the resulting erosional features are shown: Figure 10.37 and Figure 10.38. Yosemite Valley is known for waterfalls that plunge from hanging valleys. 
Depositional  Features of  Glaciers 	  As glaciers flow, mechanical weathering loosens rock on the valley walls, which falls as debris on the glacier. Glaciers can carry rock of any size, from giant boulders to silt ( Figure 10.39). These rocks can be carried for many kilometers for many years. These rocks with a different rock type or origin from the surrounding bedrock are glacial erratics. Melting glaciers deposit all the big and small bits of rocky material they are carrying in a pile. These (a) A bowl-shaped cirque in Glacier National Park was carved by glaciers. (b) A high altitude lake, called a tarn, forms from meltwater trapped in the cirque. (c) Several cirques from glaciers flowing in different directions from a mountain peak, leave behind a sharp sided horn, like the Matterhorn in Switzerland. (d) When glaciers move down opposite sides of a mountain, a sharp edged ridge, called an arte, forms between them. A roche moutone forms where a glacier smooths the uphill side of the bedrock and plucks away rock from the downslope side. unsorted deposits of rock are called glacial till. Glacial till is found in different types of deposits. Linear rock deposits are called moraines. Geologists study moraines to figure out how far glaciers extended and how long it took them to melt away. Moraines are named by their location relative to the glacier: Lateral moraines form at the edges of the glacier as material drops onto the glacier from erosion of the valley walls. Sediment from underneath the glacier becomes a ground moraine after the glacier melts. Ground moraine contributes to the fertile transported soils in many regions. Terminal moraines are long ridges of till left at the furthest point the glacier reached. End moraines are deposited where the glacier stopped for a long enough period to create a rocky ridge as it retreated. Long Island in New York is formed by two end moraines. While glaciers dump unsorted sediments, glacial meltwater can sort and re-transport the sediments ( Figure 10.41). A large boulder dropped by a glacier is a glacial erratic. The long, dark lines are medial and lateral moraines. (a) An esker is a winding ridge of sand and gravel deposited under a glacier by a stream of meltwater. (b) A drumlin is an asymmetrical hill made of sediments that points in the direction the ice moved. Usually drumlins are found in groups called drumlin fields. As water moves through unsorted glacial till, it leaves behind the larger particles and takes away the smaller bits of sand and silt ( Figure 10.42). (a) A sorted deposit of sand and smaller particles is stratified drift. A broad area of stratified drift from meltwater over broad region is an outwash plain. (b) Kettle lakes form as blocks of ice in glacial till melt. Try to pick out some of the glacial features seen in this Glacier National Park video: URL ational_parks/glacier/video_series/part_3.htm . Several types of stratified deposits form in glacial regions but are not formed directly by the ice. Varves form where lakes are covered by ice in the winter. Dark, fine-grained clays sink to the bottom in winter but melting ice in spring brings running water that deposits lighter colored sands. Each alternating dark/light layer represents one year of deposits. If during a year, a glacier accumulates more ice than melts away, the glacier advances downhill. If a glacier melts more than it accumulates over a year, it is retreating ( Figure 10.43). Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park has been retreating over the past 70 years. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The movement of ice in the form of glaciers has transformed our mountainous land surfaces with its tremendous power of erosion. U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys, cirques, horns, and aretes are features sculpted by ice. The eroded material is later deposited as large glacial erratics, in moraines, stratified drift, outwash plains, and drumlins. Varves are a very useful yearly deposit that forms in glacial lakes.

Introduction 	  Gravity shapes the Earths surface by moving weathered material from a higher place to a lower one. This occurs in a variety of ways and at a variety of rates including sudden, dramatic events as well as slow steady movements that happen over long periods of time. The force of gravity is constant and it is changing the Earths surface right now. 
Types of  Movement  Caused by  Gravity 	  Movements caused by gravity are together referred to as mass wasting or mass movement. Weathered material may fall away from a cliff because there is nothing to keep it in place. Rocks that fall to the base of a cliff make a talus slope ( Figure 10.44). Sometimes as one rock falls, it hits another rock, which hits another rock, and begins a landslide. 
Landslides and  Avalanches 	  Landslides and avalanches are the most dramatic, sudden, and dangerous examples of earth materials moved by gravity. Landslides are sudden falls of rock, whereas avalanches are sudden falls of snow. Pieces of rock regularly fall to the base of cliffs to form talus slopes. A video of a snow avalanche is seen here: URL s/2Avalanches.mov When large amounts of rock suddenly break loose from a cliff or mountainside, they move quickly and with tremendous force ( Figure 10.45). Air trapped under the falling rocks acts as a cushion that keeps the rock from slowing down. Landslides and avalanches can move as fast as 200 to 300 km/hour. (a) Landslides are called rock slides by geologists. (b) A snow avalanche moves quickly down slope, burying everything in its path. Landslides are exceptionally destructive. Homes may be destroyed as hillsides collapse. Landslides can even bury entire villages. Landslides may create lakes when the rocky material dams a stream. If a landslide flows into a lake or bay, they can trigger a tsunami ( Figure 10.46). Landslides often occur on steep slopes in dry or semi-arid climates. The California coastline, with its steep cliffs and years of drought punctuated by seasons of abundant rainfall, is prone to landslides. At-risk communities have developed landslide warning systems. Around San Francisco Bay, the National Weather Service and the U.S. The 1958 landslide into Lituya Bay, Alaska, created a 524m tsunami that knocked down trees at elevations higher than the Empire State Building (light gray). Geological Survey use rain gauges to monitor soil moisture. If soil becomes saturated, the weather service issues a warning. Earthquakes, which may occur on Californias abundant faults, can also trigger landslides. Rapid downslope movement of material is seen in this video: URL d%20Movie%20files/dflows.mov . 
D:  Landslide  Detectives 	  Hillside properties in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere may be prone to damage from landslides. Geologists are studying the warning signs and progress of local landslides to help reduce risks and give people adequate warnings of these looming threats. Learn more at: URL . 
Mudflows and  Lahars 	  Added water creates natural hazards produced by gravity ( Figure 10.47). On hillsides with soils rich in clay, little rain, and not much vegetation to hold the soil in place, a time of high precipitation will create a mudflow. Mudflows follow river channels, washing out bridges, trees, and homes that are in their path. A debris flow is seen in this video: URL scardo.mov . A lahar is mudflow that flows down a composite volcano ( Figure 10.48). Ash mixes with snow and ice melted by the eruption to produce hot, fast-moving flows. The lahar caused by the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Columbia in The white areas on green hillsides mark scars from numerous mudflows. A lahar is a mudflow that forms from volcanic ash and debris. 
Slump and  Creep 	  Less dramatic types of downslope movement move earth materials slowly down a hillside. Slump moves materials as a large block along a curved surface ( Figure 10.49). Slumps often happen when a slope is undercut, with no support for the overlying materials, or when too much weight is added to an unstable slope. Creep is the extremely gradual movement of soil downhill. Curves in tree trunks indicate creep because the base of the tree is moving downslope while the top is trying to grow straight up ( Figure 10.50). Tilted telephone or power company poles are also signs of creep. 
Contributing  Factors 	  There are several factors that increase the chance that a landslide will occur. Some of these we can prevent and some we cannot. Slump material moves as a whole unit, leaving behind a crescent shaped scar. Trees with curved trunks are often signs that the hillside is slowly creeping downhill. 
Water 	  A little bit of water helps to hold grains of sand or soil together. For example, you can build a larger sand castle with slightly wet sand than with dry sand. However too much water causes the sand to flow quickly away. Rapid snow melt or rainfall adds extra water to the soil, which increases the weight of the slope and makes sediment grains lose contact with each other, allowing flow. 
Rock  Type 	  Layers of weak rock, such as clay, also allow more landslides. Wet clay is very slippery, which provides an easy surface for materials to slide over. 
Undercutting 	  If people dig into the base of a slope to create a road or a homesite, the slope may become unstable and move downhill. This is particularly dangerous when the underlying rock layers slope towards the area ( Figure 10.51). The slope of underlying materials must be considered when making road cuts. Ocean waves undercut cliffs and cause landslides on beaches as in this video: URL r/SedMovs/Sed%20Movie%20files/Cliff_retreat.mov . When construction workers cut into slopes for homes or roads, they must stabilize the slope to help prevent a landslide ( Figure 10.52). Trees roots or even grasses can bind soil together. It is also a good idea to provide drainage so that the slope does not become saturated with water. 
Ground shaking 	  An earthquake, volcanic eruption, or even just a truck going by can shake unstable ground loose and cause a slide. Skiers and hikers may disturb the snow they travel over and set off an avalanche. A very good introduction to the topic,Landslide 101, is a video seen on National Geographic Videos, Environment Video, Natural Disasters, Landslides, and more: URL . A rock wall stabilizes a slope that has been cut away to make a road. 
Prevention and  Awareness 	  Landslides cause $1 billion to $2 billion damage in the United States each year and are responsible for traumatic and sudden loss of life and homes in many areas of the world. To be safe from landslides: Be aware of your surroundings and notice changes in the natural world. Look for cracks or bulges in hillsides, tilting of decks or patios, or leaning poles or fences when rainfall is heavy. Sticking windows and doors can indicate ground movement as soil pushes slowly against a house and knocks windows and doors out of alignment. Look for landslide scars because landslides are most likely to happen where they have occurred before. Plant vegetation and trees on the hillside around your home to help hold soil in place. Help to keep a slope stable by building retaining walls. Installing good drainage in a hillside may keep the soil from getting saturated. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Gravity moves earth materials from higher elevations to lower elevations. Landslides, avalanches, and mudflows are examples of dangerous erosion by gravity. Slump and creep move material slowly downslope. Plants, retaining walls, and good drainage are ways to help prevent landslides. Why might someone build a home on top of land where a landslide has happened before? What factors make it likely or unlikely that a landslide could happen in your area? What new technologies might help people to know when a landslide will occur? wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Offelmer.jpg; (c) URL . Public Domain 
Chapter  Outline 	  Identifying locations where abundant and interesting fossils are found is a paleontologists first step in unraveling Earth history. First, rocks of the right age need to be identified. Desert areas are better for fossil hunting because the rocks are better exposed and weathering processes have not degraded the rocks or their fossils. But there are a lot of desert areas in the world and it is not possible to search them all on foot. Paleontologists now use satellites to locate good fossil sites. This Landsat image of Mongolias Gobi Desert allowed researchers to locate exposed sedimentary rocks. While the true-color image gave a broad look at the area of interest, the false-color image shown here elucidates so much more. Different colors highlight vegetation and individual rock types. By studying the different colors scientists can single out the area they think is most likely to produce fossils. In this chapter, you will learn about some of the ways that scientists study the history of Earth and how they use clues from rocks and fossils to piece together pictures of how the Earth has changed over billions of years.

Introduction 	  Throughout human history, people have discovered fossils and wondered what they are and what they represent. In ancient times, fossils inspired legends of monsters and other strange creatures. The Chinese writer, Chang Qu, 2,000 years ago reported the discovery of dragon bones, which were probably dinosaur fossils. Look at the two photos in the Figure 11.1 and try to trace the origin of the creature on the left. The griffin, a mythical creature with a lions body and an eagles head and wings (left), was probably based on skeletons of Protoceratops (right) that were discovered by nomads in Central Asia. and elephant skull Ammonites	(left) (right). Ancient Greeks named ammonites after the ram god Ammon since they look like the coiled horns of a ram. Legends of the Cyclops may be based on fossilized elephant skulls found in Crete and other Mediterranean islands ( Figure 11.2). Can you see why? Many of the real creatures whose bones became fossilized were no less marvelous than the mythical creatures they inspired ( Figure 11.3). (a) The giant pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus had a wingspan of up to 12 meters (39 feet). (b) Argentinosaurus had an estimated weight of 80,000 kg, equal to the weight of seven elephants! Other fossils, such as the trilobite Kolihapeltis ch (c) impress us with their bizarre forms. These suture marks on an ammonite fossil (d) display a delicate beauty. 
How  Fossils  Form 	  A fossil is any remains or traces of an ancient organism. Fossils include body fossils, left behind when the soft parts have decayed away, and trace fossils, such as burrows, tracks, or fossilized coprolites (feces) ( Figure 11.4). Collections of fossils that are found together are known as fossil assemblages. The process of a once-living organism becoming a fossil is called fossilization. Fossilization is very rare: Only a tiny percentage of the organisms that have ever lived become fossils. Why do you think only a tiny percentage of living organisms become fossils after death? Think about an antelope Coprolite from a meat-eating dinosaur. that dies on the African plain ( Figure 11.5). Hyenas eating an antelope. Will the antelope in this photo become a fossil? Most of its body is eaten by hyenas and other scavengers and the remaining flesh is devoured by insects and bacteria. Only bones are left behind. As the years go by, the bones are scattered and fragmented into small pieces, eventually turning into dust. The remaining nutrients return to the soil. This antelope will not be preserved as a fossil. Is it more likely that a marine organism will become a fossil? When clams, oysters, and other shellfish die, the soft parts quickly decay, and the shells are scattered. In shallow water, wave action grinds them into sand-sized pieces. The shells are also attacked by worms, sponges, and other animals ( Figure 11.6). How about a soft bodied organism? Will a creature without hard shells or bones become a fossil? There is virtually no fossil record of soft bodied organisms such as jellyfish, worms, or slugs. Insects, which are by far the most common land animals, are only rarely found as fossils ( Figure 11.7). Despite these problems, there is a rich fossil record. How does an organism become fossilized? Usually its only the hard parts that are fossilized. The fossil record consists almost entirely of the shells, bones, or other hard parts of animals. Mammal teeth are much more resistant than other bones, so a large portion of the mammal fossil record consists of teeth. The shells of marine creatures are common also. Quick burial is essential because most decay and fragmentation occurs at the surface. Marine animals that die near a river delta may be rapidly buried by river sediments. A storm at sea may shift sediment on the ocean floor, covering a body and helping to preserve its skeletal remains ( Figure 11.8). Quick burial is rare on land, so fossils of land animals and plants are less common than marine fossils. Land organisms can be buried by mudslides, volcanic ash, or covered by sand in a sandstorm ( Figure 11.9). Skeletons can be covered by mud in lakes, swamps, or bogs. Unusual circumstances may lead to the preservation of a variety of fossils, as at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California ( Figure 11.10). In spite of the difficulties of preservation, billions of fossils have been discovered, examined, and identified by thousands of scientists. The fossil record is our best clue to the history of life on Earth, and an important indicator of past climates and geological conditions as well. 
Exceptional  Preservation 	  Some rock beds contain exceptional fossils or fossil assemblages. Two of the most famous examples of soft organism preservation are from the 505 million-year-old Burgess Shale in Canada ( Figure 11.11). The 145 million-year-old Solnhofen Limestone in Germany has fossils of soft body parts that are not normally preserved ( Figure 11.11). This fish was quickly buried in sediment to become a fossil. Although the animals trapped in the Ta Brea Tar Pits probably suffered a slow, miserable death, their bones were preserved perfectly by the sticky tar. 
Types of  Fossilization 	  Most fossils are preserved by one of five processes outlined in the Figure 11.12. (a) The Burgess shale contains softbodied fossils. (b) Anomalocaris, meaning abnormal shrimp is now extinct. The image is of a fossil. (c) The famous Archeopteryx fossil from the Solnhofen Limestone has distinct feathers and was one of the earliest birds. Five types of fossils: (a) Insect preserved in amber, (b) petrified wood (permineralization), (c) cast and mold of a clam shell, (d) pyritized ammonite, and (e) compression fossil of a fern. 
Preserved  Remains 	  Most uncommon is the preservation of soft-tissue original material. Insects have been preserved perfectly in amber, which is ancient tree sap. Mammoths and a Neanderthal hunter were frozen in glaciers, allowing scientists the rare opportunity to examine their skin, hair, and organs. Scientists collect DNA from these remains and compare the DNA sequences to those of modern counterparts. 
Permineralization 	  The most common method of fossilization is permineralization. After a bone, wood fragment, or shell is buried in sediment, mineral-rich water moves through the sediment. This water deposits minerals into empty spaces and produces a fossil. Fossil dinosaur bones, petrified wood, and many marine fossils were formed by permineralization. 
Molds and  Casts 	  When the original bone or shell dissolves and leaves behind an empty space in the shape of the material, the depression is called a mold. The space is later filled with other sediments to form a matching cast within the mold that is the shape of the original organism or part. Many mollusks (clams, snails, octopi, and squid) are found as molds and casts because their shells dissolve easily. 
Replacement 	  The original shell or bone dissolves and is replaced by a different mineral. For example, calcite shells may be replaced by dolomite, quartz, or pyrite. If a fossil that has been replace by quartz is surrounded by a calcite matrix, mildly acidic water may dissolve the calcite and leave behind an exquisitely preserved quartz fossil. 
Compression 	  Some fossils form when their remains are compressed by high pressure, leaving behind a dark imprint. Compression is most common for fossils of leaves and ferns, but can occur with other organisms. 
Clues from  Fossils 	  Fossils are our best form of evidence about Earth history, including the history of life. Along with other geological evidence from rocks and structures, fossils even give us clues about past climates, the motions of plates, and other major geological events. 
History of  Life on  Earth 	  That life on Earth has changed over time is well illustrated by the fossil record. Fossils in relatively young rocks resemble animals and plants that are living today. In general, fossils in older rocks are less similar to modern organisms. The history of life will be discussed in the "Earths History" chapter. 
Environment of  Deposition 	  By knowing something about the type of organism the fossil was, geologists can determine whether the region was terrestrial (on land) or marine (underwater) or even if the water was shallow or deep. The rock may give clues to whether the rate of sedimentation was slow or rapid. The amount of wear and fragmentation of a fossil allows scientists to learn about what happened to the region after the organism died; for example, whether it was exposed to wave action. 
Geologic  History 	  The presence of marine organisms in a rock indicates that the region where the rock was deposited was once marine. Sometimes fossils of marine organisms are found on tall mountains indicating that rocks that formed on the seabed were uplifted ( Figure 11.13). 
Climate 	  By knowing something about the climate a type of organism lives in now, geologists can use fossils to decipher the climate at the time the fossil was deposited. For example, coal beds form in tropical environments but ancient coal beds are found in Antarctica. Geologists know that at that time the climate on the Antarctic continent was much warmer. Recall from the chapter about plate tectonics that Wegener used the presence of coal beds in Antarctica as one of the lines of evidence for continental drift. The summit of Mt. Everest, the worlds tallest mountain, is limestone that formed in an ancient sea. 
Index  Fossils 	  An index fossil can be used to identify a specific period of time. Organisms that make good index fossils are distinctive, widespread, and lived briefly. Their presence in a rock layer can be used to identify that period of time over a large area. KQED: Science on the SPOT: Lupe the Mammoth Comes to Life The fossil of a juvenile mammoth found near downtown San Jose California reveals an enormous amount about these majestic creatures: what they looked like, how they lived, and what the environment of the Bay Area was like so long ago. Learn more at: URL fe/ . 
Lesson  Summary 	  Fossils are the remains of ancient life. Body fossils are the remains of the organism itself; trace fossils are burrows, tracks, feces, or other evidence of activity. Fossilization is a very rare process. The chances of becoming a fossil are enhanced by quick burial and the presence of hard parts, such as bones or shells. Fossils form in five ways: by preservation of the remains, permineralization, molds and casts, replacement, and compression. Types of organisms that make good index fossils are widespread but only existed for a short period of time. Index fossils help scientists to determine the approximate age of a rock layer and to match that layer up with other rock layers. Fossils give clues about the history of life on Earth, environments, climate, geologic history, and other events of geological importance.

Introduction 	  Something that we hope you have learned from these lessons and from your own life experience is that the laws of nature never change. They are the same today as they were billions of years ago. Water freezes at 0 C at 1 atmosphere pressure; this is always true. Knowing that natural laws never change helps scientists understand Earths past because it allows them to interpret clues about how things happened long ago. Geologists always use present-day processes to interpret the past. If you find a fossil of a fish in a dry terrestrial environment did the fish flop around on land? Did the rock form in water and then move? Since fish do not flop around on land today, the explanation that adheres to the philosophy that natural laws do not change is that the rock moved. 
Fossils were  Living  Organisms 	  In 1666, a young doctor named Nicholas Steno dissected the head of an enormous great white shark that had been caught by fisherman near Florence, Italy. Steno was struck by the resemblance of the sharks teeth to fossils found in inland mountains and hills ( Figure 11.14). 
Fossil	 Shark	 Tooth	(left)	and	 Modern 	  Shark Tooth (right). Most people at the time did not believe that fossils were once part of living creatures. Authors in that day thought that the fossils of marine animals found in tall mountains, miles from any ocean could be explained in one of two ways: The shells were washed up during the Biblical flood. (This explanation could not account for the fact that fossils were not only found on mountains, but also within mountains, in rocks that had been quarried from deep below Earths surface.) The fossils formed within the rocks as a result of mysterious forces. But for Steno, the close resemblance between fossils and modern organisms was impossible to ignore. Instead of invoking supernatural forces, Steno concluded that fossils were once parts of living creatures. He then sought to explain how fossil seashells could be found in rocks and mountains far from any ocean. This led him to the ideas that are discussed below. 
Superposition of  Rock  Layers 	  Steno proposed that if a rock contained the fossils of marine animals, the rock formed from sediments that were deposited on the seafloor. These rocks were then uplifted to become mountains. Based on these assumptions, Steno made a remarkable series of conjectures that are now known as Stenos Laws. These laws are illustrated in Figure 11.15. Other scientists observed rock layers and formulated other principles. Geologist William Smith (1769-1839) identified the principle of faunal succession, which recognizes that: Some fossil types are never found with certain other fossil types (e.g. human ancestors are never found with dinosaurs) meaning that fossils in a rock layer represent what lived during the period the rock was deposited. Older features are replaced by more modern features in fossil organisms as species change through time; e.g. feathered dinosaurs precede birds in the fossil record. Fossil species with features that change distinctly and quickly can be used to determine the age of rock layers quite precisely. Scottish geologist, James Hutton (1726-1797) recognized the principle of cross-cutting relationships. This helps geologists to determine the older and younger of two rock units ( Figure 11.16). (a) Original Horizontality: Sediments are deposited in fairly flat, horizontal layers. If a sedimentary rock is found tilted, the layer was tilted after it was formed. (b) Lateral continuity: Sediments are deposited in continuous sheets that span the body of water that they are deposited in. When a valley cuts through sedimentary layers, it is assumed that the rocks on either side of the valley were originally continuous. (c) Superposition: Sedimentary rocks are deposited one on top of another. The youngest layers are found at the top of the sequence, and the oldest layers are found at the bottom. The Grand Canyon provides an excellent illustration of the principles above. The many horizontal layers of sedimentary rock illustrate the principle of original horizontality ( Figure 11.17). The youngest rock layers are at the top and the oldest are at the bottom, which is described by the law of superposition. Distinctive rock layers, such as the Coconino Sandstone, are matched across the broad expanse of the canyon. These rock layers were once connected, as stated by the rule of lateral continuity. The Colorado River cuts through all the layers of rock to form the canyon. Based on the principle of crosscutting relationships, the river must be younger than all of the rock layers that it cuts through. 
Determining the  Relative  Ages of  Rocks 	  Stenos and Smiths principles are essential for determining the relative ages of rocks and rock layers. In the process of relative dating, scientists do not determine the exact age of a fossil or rock but look at a sequence of rocks to try to decipher the times that an event occurred relative to the other events represented in that sequence. The relative If an igneous dike (B) cuts a series of metamorphic rocks (A), which is older and which is younger? In this image, A must have existed first for B to cut across it. 
At	the	 Grand	 Canyon,	the	 Coconino 	  Sandstone appears across canyons. The Coconino is the distinctive white layer; it is a vast expanse of ancient sand dunes. age of a rock then is its age in comparison with other rocks. If you know the relative ages of two rock layers, (1) Do you know which is older and which is younger? (2) Do you know how old the layers are in years? An interactive website on relative ages and geologic time is found here: URL xplorations/tours/geotime/gtpage1.html In some cases, it is very tricky to determine the sequence of events that leads to a certain formation. Can you figure out what happened in what order in ( Figure 11.18)? Write it down and then check the following paragraphs. A geologic cross section: Sedimentary rocks (A-C), igneous intrusion (D), fault (E). The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a fault or intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts through. The fault cuts through all three sedimentary rock layers (A, B, and C) and also the intrusion (D). So the fault must be the youngest feature. The intrusion (D) cuts through the three sedimentary rock layers, so it must be younger than those layers. By the law of superposition, C is the oldest sedimentary rock, B is younger and A is still younger. The full sequence of events is: 
Earths  Age 	  During Stenos time, most Europeans believed that the Earth was around 6,000 years old, a figure that was based on the amount of time estimated for the events described in the Bible. One of the first scientists to question this assumption and to understand geologic time was James Hutton. Hutton traveled around Great Britain in the late 1700s, studying sedimentary rocks and their fossils ( Figure 11.19). Often described as the founder of modern geology, Hutton formulated uniformitarianism: The present is the key to the past. According to uniformitarianism, the same processes that operate on Earth today operated in the past as well. Why is an acceptance of this principle absolutely essential for us to be able to decipher Earth history? Hutton questioned the age of the Earth when he looked at rock sequences like the one below. On his travels, he A drawing by James Hutton. "Theory of the Earth, 1795. discovered places where sedimentary rock beds lie on an eroded surface. At this gap in rock layers, or unconformity, some rocks were eroded away. For example, consider the famous unconformity at Siccar Point, on the coast of Scotland ( Figure 11.20). Huttons Unconformity on the Coast of Scotland. Can you find the unconformity? What are the geological events that you can find in this image? (Hint: There are nine.) Since he thought that the same processes at work on Earth today worked at the same rate in the past, he had to account for all of these events and the unknown amount of missing time represented by the unconformity, Hutton realized that this rock sequence alone represented a great deal of time. He concluded that Earths age should not be measured in thousands of years, but in millions of years. 
Matching  Up  Rock  Layers 	  Superposition and cross-cutting are helpful when rocks are touching one another and lateral continuity helps match up rock layers that are nearby, but how do geologists correlate rock layers that are separated by greater distances? There are three kinds of clues: The famous White Cliffs of Dover in southwest England can be matched to similar white cliffs in Denmark and Germany. Many fossils may qualify as index fossils ( Figure 11.22). Ammonites, trilobites, and graptolites are often used as index fossils. Microfossils, which are fossils of microscopic organisms, are also useful index fossils. Fossils of animals that drifted in the upper layers of the ocean are particularly useful as index fossils, since they may be distributed over very large areas. A biostratigraphic unit, or biozone, is a geological rock layer that is defined by a single index fossil or a fossil assemblage. A biozone can also be used to identify rock layers across distances. 
The  Geologic  Time  Scale 	  To be able to discuss Earth history, scientists needed some way to refer to the time periods in which events happened and organisms lived. With the information they collected from fossil evidence and using Stenos principles, they Several examples of index fossils are shown here. Mucrospirifer mucronatus is an index fossil that indicates that a rock was laid down from 416 to 359 million years ago. The white clay is a key bed that marks the Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary. created a listing of rock layers from oldest to youngest. Then they divided Earths history into blocks of time with each block separated by important events, such as the disappearance of a species of fossil from the rock record. Since many of the scientists who first assigned names to times in Earths history were from Europe, they named the blocks of time from towns or other local places where the rock layers that represented that time were found. From these blocks of time the scientists created the geologic time scale ( Figure 11.24). In the geologic time scale the youngest ages are on the top and the oldest on the bottom. Why do you think that the more recent time periods are divided more finely? Do you think the divisions in the Figure 11.24 are proportional to the amount of time each time period represented in Earth history? In what eon, era, period and epoch do we now live? We live in the Holocene (sometimes called Recent) epoch, Quaternary period, Cenozoic era, and Phanerozoic eon. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Nicholas Steno formulated the principles in the 17th century that allow scientists to determine the relative ages of rocks. Steno stated that sedimentary rocks are formed in continuous, horizontal layers, with younger layers on top of older layers. William Smith and James Hutton later discovered the principles of cross-cutting relationships and faunal succession. Hutton also realized the vast amounts of time that would be needed to create an unconformity and concluded that Earth was much older than people at the time thought. The guiding philosophy of Hutton and geologists who came after him is: The present is the key to the past. To correlate rock layers that are separated by a large distance look for sedimentary rock formations that are extensive and recognizable, index fossils, and key beds. Changes of fossils over time led to the development of the geologic time scale, which illustrates the relative order in which events on Earth have happened. why?

Introduction 	  What was missing from the early geologic time scale? While the order of events was given, the dates at which the events happened were not. With the discovery of radioactivity in the late 1800s, scientists were able to measure the absolute age, or the exact age of some rocks in years. Absolute dating allows scientists to assign numbers to the breaks in the geologic time scale. Radiometric dating and other forms of absolute age dating allowed scientists to get an absolute age from a rock or fossil. 
Tree  Ring  Dating 	  In locations where summers are warm and winters are cool, trees have a distinctive growth pattern. Tree trunks display alternating bands of light-colored, low density summer growth and dark, high density winter growth. Each light-dark band represents one year. By counting tree rings it is possible to find the number of years the tree lived ( Figure 11.29). Cross-section showing growth rings. The width of these growth rings varies with the conditions present that year. A summer drought may make the tree grow more slowly than normal and so its light band will be relatively small. These tree-ring variations appear in all trees in a region. The same distinctive pattern can be found in all the trees in an area for the same time period. Scientists have created continuous records of tree rings going back over the past 2,000 years. Wood fragments from old buildings and ancient ruins can be age dated by matching up the pattern of tree rings in the wood fragment in question and the scale created by scientists. The outermost ring indicates when the tree stopped growing; that is, when it died. The tree-ring record is extremely useful for finding the age of ancient structures. An example of how tree-ring dating is used to date houses in the United Kingdom is found in this article: URL ww.periodproperty.co.uk/ppuk_discovering_article_013.shtml . 
Ice  Cores and  Varves 	  Other processes create distinct yearly layers that can be used for dating. On a glacier, snow falls in winter but in summer dust accumulates. This leads to a snow-dust annual pattern that goes down into the ice ( Figure 11.30). Scientists drill deep into ice sheets, producing ice cores hundreds of meters long. The information scientists gather allows them to determine how the environment has changed as the glacier has stayed in its position. Analyses of the ice tell how concentrations of atmospheric gases changed, which can yield clues about climate. The longest cores allow scientists to create a record of polar climate stretching back hundreds of thousands of years. Ice core section showing annual layers. Lake sediments, especially in lakes that are located at the end of glaciers, also have an annual pattern. In the summer, the glacier melts rapidly, producing a thick deposit of sediment. These alternate with thin, clay-rich layers deposited in the winter. The resulting layers, called varves, give scientists clues about past climate conditions ( Figure 11.31). A warm summer might result in a very thick sediment layer while a cooler summer might yield a thinner layer. 
Age of  Earth 	  During the 18th and 19th centuries, geologists tried to estimate the age of Earth with indirect techniques. What methods can you think of for doing this? One example is that by measuring how much sediment a stream deposited in a year, a geologist might try to determine how long it took for a stream to deposit an ancient sediment layer. Not surprisingly, these methods resulted in wildly different estimates. A relatively good estimate was produced by the British geologist Charles Lyell, who thought that 240 million years had passed since the appearance of the first animals with shells. Today scientists know that this event occurred about 530 million years ago. In 1892, William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) calculated that the Earth was 100 million years old ( Figure 11.32). He did this systematically assuming that the planet started off as a molten ball and calculating the time it would take for it to cool to its current temperature. This estimate was a blow to geologists and supporters of Charles Darwins theory of evolution, which required an older Earth to provide time for geological and evolutionary processes to take place. Thomsons calculations were soon shown to be flawed when radioactivity was discovered in 1896. Radioactivity is the tendency of certain atoms to decay into lighter atoms, a process that emits energy. Radioactive decay of elements inside Earths interior provides a steady source of heat, which meant that Thomson had grossly underestimated Earths age. 
Radioactive  Decay 	  Radioactivity also provides a way to find the absolute age of a rock. To begin, go back to the Earths Minerals chapter and review the material about atoms. Some isotopes are radioactive; radioactive isotopes are unstable and spontaneously change by gaining or losing particles. Two types of radioactive decay are relevant to dating Earth materials ( Table 11.1): 
Alpha 	  The nucleus contains two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons. 
Beta 	  One neutron decays to form a proton and an electron. The electron is emitted. The radioactive decay of a parent isotope (the original element) leads to the formation of stable daughter product, also known as daughter isotope. As time passes, the number of parent isotopes decreases and the number of daughter isotopes increases ( Figure 11.33). A parent emits an alpha particle to create a daughter. An animation of radioactive decay: URL . Radioactive materials decay at known rates, measured as a unit called half-life. The half-life of a radioactive substance is the amount of time it takes for half of the parent atoms to decay. This is how the material decays over time (see Table 11.2). 
Percent daughter produced 	  Pretend you find a rock with 3.125% parent atoms and 96.875% daughter atoms. How many half lives have passed? If the half-life of the parent isotope is 1 year, then how old is the rock? The decay of radioactive materials can be shown with a graph ( Figure 11.34). Decay of an imaginary radioactive substance with a half-life of one year. An animation of half-life: URL . Notice how it doesnt take too many half lives before there is very little parent remaining and most of the isotopes are daughter isotopes. This limits how many half lives can pass before a radioactive element is no longer useful for dating materials. Fortunately, different isotopes have very different half lives. Radiometric decay is exponential. Learn how exponential growth and decay can be described mathematically in this video ( IE 1e): URL (4:46). 
Radiometric  Dating of  Rocks 	  Different isotopes are used to date materials of different ages. Using more than one isotope helps scientists to check the accuracy of the ages that they calculate. 
Radiocarbon  Dating 	  Radiocarbon dating is used to find the age of once-living materials between 100 and 50,000 years old. This range is especially useful for determining ages of human fossils and habitation sites ( Figure 11.35). Carbon isotopes from the black material in these cave paintings places their creating at about 26,000 to 27,000 years BP (before present). The atmosphere contains three isotopes of carbon: carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14. Only carbon-14 is radioactive; it has a half-life of 5,730 years. The amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is tiny and has been relatively stable through time. Plants remove all three isotopes of carbon from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Animals consume this carbon when they eat plants or other animals that have eaten plants. After the organisms death, the carbon-14 decays to stable nitrogen-14 by releasing a beta particle. The nitrogen atoms are lost to the atmosphere, but the amount of carbon-14 that has decayed can be estimated by measuring the proportion of radioactive carbon-14 to stable carbon12. As time passes, the amount of carbon-14 decreases relative to the amount of carbon-12. A video of carbon-14 decay is seen here: URL ; a longer explanation is here: URL . 
Potassium- Argon  Dating 	  Potassium-40 decays to argon-40 with a half-life of 1.26 billion years. Argon is a gas so it can escape from molten magma, meaning that any argon that is found in an igneous crystal probably formed as a result of the decay of potassium-40. Measuring the ratio of potassium-40 to argon-40 yields a good estimate of the age of that crystal. Potassium is common in many minerals, such as feldspar, mica, and amphibole. With its half-life, the technique is used to date rocks from 100,000 years to over a billion years old. The technique has been useful for dating fairly young geological materials and deposits containing the bones of human ancestors. 
Uranium- Lead  Dating 	  Two uranium isotopes are used for radiometric dating. Uranium-238 decays to lead-206 with a half-life of 4.47 billion years. Uranium-235 decays to form lead-207 with a half-life of 704 million years. Uranium-lead dating is usually performed on zircon crystals ( Figure 11.36). When zircon forms in an igneous rock, the crystals readily accept atoms of uranium but reject atoms of lead. If any lead is found in a zircon crystal, it can be assumed that it was produced from the decay of uranium. Uranium-lead dating is useful for dating igneous rocks from 1 million years to around 4.6 billion years old. Zircon crystals from Australia are 4.4 billion years old, among the oldest rocks on the planet. 
Limitations of  Radiometric  Dating 	  Radiometric dating, or the process of using the concentrations of radioactive substances and daughter products to estimate the age of a material, is a very useful tool for dating geological materials but it does have limits: Using a combination of radiometric dating, index fossils, and superposition, geologists have constructed a welldefined timeline of Earth history. With information gathered from all over the world, estimates of rock and fossil ages have become increasingly accurate. All of this evidence comes together to pinpoint the age of Earth at 4.6 billion years. A video discussing the evidence for this is found here: URL . The age of Earth is also discussed in this video: URL . 
Lesson  Summary 	  Earth is very old, and the study of Earths past requires us to think about times that were millions or even billions of years ago. Techniques such as superposition and index fossils can tell you the relative age of objects, which objects are older and which are younger. Geologists use a variety of techniques to establish absolute age, including radiometric dating, tree rings, ice cores, and annual sedimentary deposits called varves. The concentrations of several radioactive isotopes (e.g. carbon-14, potassium-40, uranium-235 and -238) and their daughter products are used to accurately determine the age of rocks and organic remains.

Why are techniques for dating, such as using tree rings, ice cores, and varves only useful for events that occurred in the last few thousand years?

 	  Earth looks very different today than it did when it first formed more than 4.5 billion years ago. Rare parts of the planet may retain a bit of the feel of the ancient environment, such as the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park. Earths internal heat creates hot springs that are home to extremophiles, organisms that thrive in extreme environments. The orange, spongy materials in this photo are mats of thermophilic bacteria, organisms that thrive in extremely hot environments. Since the Earths environment was undoubtedly more extreme in the early days, it seems likely that the most ancient life forms were forms of extremophiles. Life on Earth has changed tremendously since those early days. Creatures have become multicellular; they have gained the ability to make their own food energy by photosynthesis; they have adapted to living in water, on land and in the air; and theyve even evolved intelligence. The geology of the planet has also changed. The Earths crust has hardened, mountains have risen, oceans have grown, and erosion has reduced features to flat plains. All of this has happened over an extremely long period of time, and humans have been around for only a tiny part. Miles Orchinik. CK?12 Foundation. CC BY?NC 3.0.

Introduction 	  Historical geologists study Earths past to understand what happened and when it happened. Paleontologists do the same thing, but with an emphasis on the history of life, especially as it is understood from fossils. Despite having very little material from those days, scientists have many ways of learning about the early Earth. 
Formation of  Earth 	  Earth came together (accreted) from the cloud of dust and gas known as the solar nebula nearly 4.6 billion years ago, the same time the Sun and the rest of the solar system formed. Gravity caused small bodies of rock and metal orbiting the proto-Sun to smash together to create larger bodies. Over time, the planetoids got larger and larger until they became planets. More information about planet formation is in the chapter about the solar system. There is little hard evidence for scientists to study from Earths earliest days. Much of what scientists know about the early Earth come from three sources: (1) zircon crystals, the oldest materials found on Earth, which show that the age of the earliest crust formed at least 4.4 billion years ago; (2) meteorites that date from the beginning of the solar system, to nearly 4.6 billion years ago ( Figure 12.1); and (3) lunar rocks, which represent the early days of the Earth-Moon system as far back as 4.5 billion years ago. 
Molten  Earth 	  When Earth first came together it was really hot, hot enough to melt the metal elements that it contained. Why was the early Earth so hot? The Allende Meteorite is a carbonaceous chondrite that struck Earth in 1969. The calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions are fragments of the earliest solar system. Gravitational contraction: As small bodies of rock and metal accreted, the planet grew larger and more massive. Gravity within such an enormous body squeezes the material in its interior so hard that the pressure swells. As Earths internal pressure grew, its temperature also rose. Radioactive decay: Radioactive decay releases heat, and early in the planets history there were many radioactive elements with short half lives. These elements long ago decayed into stable materials, but they were responsible for the release of enormous amounts of heat in the beginning. Bombardment: Ancient impact craters found on the Moon and inner planets indicate that asteroid impacts were common in the early solar system. Earth was struck so much in its first 500 million years that the heat was intense. Very few large objects have struck the planet in the past many hundreds of millions of year. 
Differentiation 	  When Earth was entirely molten, gravity drew denser elements to the center and lighter elements rose to the surface. The separation of Earth into layers based on density is known as differentiation. The densest material moved to the center to create the planets dense metallic core. Materials that are intermediate in density became part of the mantle ( Figure 12.2). Lighter materials accumulated at the surface of the mantle to become the earliest crust. The first crust was probably basaltic, like the oceanic crust is today. Intense heat from the early core drove rapid and vigorous mantle convection so that crust quickly recycled into the mantle. The recycling of basaltic crust was so effective that no remnants of it are found today. Earths interior: Inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. 
How the  Moon  Formed 	  One of the most unique features of planet Earth is its large Moon. Unlike the only other natural satellites orbiting an inner planet, those of Mars, the Moon is not a captured asteroid. Understanding the Moons birth and early history reveals a great deal about Earths early days. To determine how the Moon formed, scientists had to account for several lines of evidence: The Moon is large; not much smaller than the smallest planet, Mercury. Earth and Moon are very similar in composition. Moons surface is 4.5 billion years old, about the same as the age of the solar system. For a body its size and distance from the Sun, the Moon has very little core; Earth has a fairly large core. The oxygen isotope ratios of Earth and Moon indicate that they originated in the same part of the solar system. Earth has a faster spin than it should have for a planet of its size and distance from the Sun. Can you devise a birth story for the Moon that takes all of these bits of data into account? Astronomers have carried out computer simulations that are consistent with these facts and have detailed a birth story for the Moon. A little more than 4.5 billion years ago, roughly 70 million years after Earth formed, planetary bodies were being pummeled by asteroids and planetoids of all kinds. Earth was struck by a Mars-sized asteroid ( Figure 12.3). The tremendous energy from the impact melted both bodies. The molten material mixed up. The dense metals remained on Earth but some of the molten, rocky material was flung into an orbit around Earth. It eventually accreted into a single body, the Moon. Since both planetary bodies were molten, material could differentiate out of the magma ocean into core, mantle, and crust as they cooled. Earths fast spin is from energy imparted to it by the impact. Lunar rocks reveal an enormous amount about Earths early days. The Genesis Rock, with a date of 4.5 billion years, is only about 100 million years younger than the solar system ( Figure 12.4). The rock is a piece of the The Genesis Rock was brought back to Earth by the Apollo 15 astronauts. Moons anorthosite crust, which was the original crust. Why do you think Moon rocks contain information that is not available from Earths own materials? More information about the Genesis Rock from NASA is found here: URL ws/image_release042310.html . Can you find how all of the evidence presented in the bullet points above is present in the Moons birth story? 
Earths  Early  Atmosphere and  Oceans 	  At first, Earth did not have an atmosphere or free water since the planet was too hot for gases and water to collect. The atmosphere and oceans that we see today evolved over time. 
Earths  First  Atmosphere 	  Earths first atmosphere was made of hydrogen and helium, the gases that were common in this region of the solar system as it was forming. Most of these gases were drawn into the center of the solar nebula to form the Sun. When Earth was new and very small, the solar wind blew off atmospheric gases that collected. If gases did collect, they were vaporized by impacts, especially from the impact that brought about the formation of the Moon. Eventually things started to settle down and gases began to collect. High heat in Earths early days meant that there were constant volcanic eruptions, which released gases from the mantle into the atmosphere ( Figure 12.5). Just as today, volcanic outgassing was a source of water vapor, carbon dioxide, small amounts of nitrogen, and other gases. Nearly constant volcanic eruptions supplied gases for Earths early atmosphere. Scientists have calculated that the amount of gas that collected to form the early atmosphere could not have come entirely from volcanic eruptions. Frequent impacts by asteroids and comets brought in gases and ices, including water, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, nitrogen, and other volatiles from elsewhere in the solar system ( Figure 12.6). Calculations also show that asteroids and comets cannot be responsible for all of the gases of the early atmosphere, so both impacts and outgassing were needed. 
Earths  Second  Atmosphere 	  The second atmosphere, which was the first to stay with the planet, formed from volcanic outgassing and comet ices. This atmosphere had lots of water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and methane but almost no oxygen. Why was there so little oxygen? Plants produce oxygen when they photosynthesize but life had not yet begun or had not yet developed photosynthesis. In the early atmosphere, oxygen only appeared when sunlight split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen and the oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. Without oxygen, life was restricted to tiny simple organisms. Why is oxygen essential for most life on Earth? The gases that create a comets tail can become part of the atmosphere of a planet. 
Early  Oceans 	  The early atmosphere was rich in water vapor from volcanic eruptions and comets. When Earth was cool enough, water vapor condensed and rain began to fall. The water cycle began. Over millions of years enough precipitation collected that the first oceans could have formed as early as 4.2 to 4.4 billion years ago. Dissolved minerals carried by stream runoff made the early oceans salty. What geological evidence could there be for the presence of an early ocean? Marine sedimentary rocks can be dated back about 4 billion years. By the Archean, the planet was covered with oceans and the atmosphere was full of water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and smaller amounts of other gases. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Earth and the other planets in the solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago. The early Earth was frequently hit with asteroids and comets. There were also frequent volcanic eruptions. Both were sources of water and gases for the atmosphere The early Earth had no ozone layer, no free oxygen, and was very hot. The oceans originally formed as water vapor released by volcanic outgassing and comet impacts cooled and condensed. Earth was struck by a giant impactor, which flung material out into orbit around the planet. This material accreted into Earths only natural satellite, the Moon.

Introduction 	  The longest span of time is the Precambrian Era, which includes the Proterozoic, Archean, and Pre-Archean (also called the Hadean). The Precambrian began when the Earth formed and ended at the beginning of the Cambrian period, 570 million years ago. The events recounted in the previous section were all part of the earliest Earth history, the Hadean. But there was still much more to come in the Precambrian Era. The geological principles explained in the earlier chapters of this book apply to understanding the geological history of these old times ( Figure 12.7). 
Early  Continents 	  The first crust was made of basaltic rock, like the current ocean crust. Partial melting of the lower portion of the basaltic crust began more than 4 billion years ago. This created the silica-rich crust that became the felsic continents. 
Cratons and  Shields 	  The earliest felsic continental crust is now found in the ancient cores of continents, called the cratons. Rapid plate motions meant that cratons experienced many continental collisions. Little is known about the paleogeography, or the ancient geography, of the early planet, although smaller continents could have come together and broken up. Places the craton crops out at the surface is known as a shield. Cratons date from the Precambrian and are called Precambrian shields. Many Precambrian shields are about 570 million years old ( Figure 12.8). Geologists can learn many things about the Pre-Archean by studying the rocks of the cratons. Cratons also contain felsic igneous rocks, which are remnants of the first continents. Cratonic rocks contain rounded sedimentary grains. Of what importance is this fact? Rounded grains indicate that the minerals eroded from an earlier rock type and that rivers or seas also existed. One common rock type in the cratons is greenstone, a metamorphosed volcanic rock ( Figure 12.9). Since greenstones are found today in oceanic trenches, what does the presence of greenstones mean? These ancient greenstones indicate the presence of subduction zones. During the Pre-Archean and Archean, Earths interior was warmer than today. Mantle convection was faster and plate tectonics processes were more vigorous. Since subduction zones were more common, the early crustal plates The Canadian Shield is the ancient flat part of Canada that lies around Hudson Bay, the northern parts of Minnesota, 
Wisconsin and  Michigan and much of 	  Greenland. Ice age glaciers scraped the Canadian Shield down to the 4.28 billion year old greenstone in Northwestern Quebec. were relatively small. In most places the cratons were covered by younger rocks, which together are called a platform. Sometimes the younger rocks eroded away to expose the Precambrian craton ( Figure 12.10). Since the time that it was completely molten, Earth has been cooling. Still, about half the internal heat that was generated when Earth formed remains in the planet and is the source of the heat in the core and mantle today. 
Precambrian  Plate  Tectonics 	  By the end of the Archean, about 2.5 billion years ago, plate tectonics processes were completely recognizable. Small Proterozoic continents known as microcontinents collided to create supercontinents, which resulted in the uplift of massive mountain ranges. The history of the North American craton is an example of what generally happened to the cratons during the Precambrian. As the craton drifted, it collided with microcontinents and oceanic island arcs, which were added to The Precambrian craton is exposed in the Grand Canyon where the Colorado River has cut through the younger sedimentary rocks. the continents. Convergence was especially active between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago. These lands came together to create the continent of Laurentia. About 1.1 billion years ago, Laurentia became part of the supercontinent Rodinia ( Figure 12.11). Rodinia probably contained all of the landmass at the time, which was about 75% of the continental landmass present today. Rodinia as it came together about 1.1 billion years ago. Rodinia broke up about 750 million years ago. The geological evidence for this breakup includes large lava flows that are found where continental rifting took place. Seafloor spreading eventually started and created the oceans between the continents. The breakup of Rodinia may have triggered Snowball Earth around 700 million years ago. Snowball Earth is the hypothesis that much of the planet was covered by ice at the end of the Precambrian. When the ice melted and the planet became habitable, life evolved rapidly. This explains the rapid evolution of life in the Ediacaran and Cambrian periods. This video explores the origin of continents and early plate tectonics on the young Earth (1c): URL om/watch?v=QDqskltCixA (5:17). The presence of water on ancient Earth is revealed in a zircon crystal (1c): URL 21hFmZP5zM (3:13). 
The  Origin of  Life 	  No one knows how or when life first began on the turbulent early Earth. There is little hard evidence from so long ago. Scientists think that it is extremely likely that life began and was wiped out more than once; for example, by the impact that created the Moon. To look for information regarding the origin of life, scientists: perform experiments to recreate the environmental conditions found at that time. study the living creatures that make their homes in the types of extreme environments that were typical in Earths early days. seek traces of life left by ancient microorganisms, also called microbes, such as microscopic features or isotopic ratios indicative of life. Any traces of life from this time period are so ancient, it is difficult to be certain whether they originated by biological or non-biological means. What does a molecule need to be and do to be considered alive? The molecule must: be organic. The organic molecules needed are amino acids, the building blocks of life. have a metabolism. be capable of replication (be able to reproduce). 
Amino  Acids 	  Amino acids are the building blocks of life because they create proteins. To form proteins, the amino acids are linked together by covalent bonds to form polymers called polypeptide chains ( Figure 12.12). Amino acids form polypeptide chains. These chains are arranged in a specific order to form each different type of protein. Proteins are the most abundant class of biological molecules. An important question facing scientists is where the first amino acids came from: Did they originate on Earth or did they fly in from outer space? No matter where they originated, the creation of amino acids requires the right starting materials and some energy. To see if amino acids could originate in the environment thought to be present in the first years of Earths existence, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey performed a famous experiment in 1953 ( Figure 12.13). To simulate the early atmosphere they placed hydrogen, methane and ammonia in a flask of heated water that created water vapor, which they called the primordial soup. Sparks simulated lightning, which the scientists thought could have been the energy that drove the chemical reactions that created the amino acids. It worked! The gases combined to form water-soluble organic compounds including amino acids. A dramatic reenactment of this experiment is performed on this video from the 1980 TV show Cosmos: URL ww.youtube.com/watch?v=yet1xkAv_HY . At the end you can learn about the possible role of RNA. Amino acids might also have originated at hydrothermal vents or deep in the crust where Earths internal heat is the energy source. Meteorites containing amino acids currently enter the Earth system and so meteorites could have delivered amino acids to the planet from elsewhere in the solar system (where they would have formed by processes similar to those outlined here). 
Metabolism 	  Organic molecules must also carry out the chemical work of cells; that is, their metabolism. Chemical reactions in a living organism allow that organism to live in its environment, grow, and reproduce. Metabolism gets energy from other sources and creates structures needed in cells. The chemical reactions occur in a sequence of steps known as metabolic pathways. The metabolic pathways are very similar between unicellular bacteria that have been around for billions of years and the most complex life forms on Earth today. This means that they evolved very early in Earth history. The Miller-Urey experiment was simple and elegant. 
Replication 	  Living cells need organic molecules, known as nucleic acids, to store genetic information and pass it to the next generation. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the nucleic acid that carries information for nearly all living cells today and did for most of Earth history. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) delivers genetic instructions to the location in a cell where protein is synthesized. The famous double helix structure of DNA is seen in this animation: URL s/8/81/ADN_animation.gif . Many scientists think that RNA was the first replicator. Since RNA catalyzes protein synthesis, most scientists think that RNA came before proteins. RNA can also encode genetic instructions and carry it to daughter cells, such as DNA. The idea that RNA is the most primitive organic molecule is called the RNA world hypothesis, referring to the possibility that the RNA is more ancient than DNA. RNA can pass along genetic instructions as DNA can, and some RNA can carry out chemical reactions like proteins can. A video explaining the RNA world hypothesis is seen here: URL . Pieces of many scenarios can be put together to come up with a plausible suggestion for how life began. 
Simple  Cells  Evolve 	  Simple organic molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids eventually became complex organic substances. Scientists think that the organic molecules adhered to clay minerals, which provided the structure needed for these substances to organize. The clays, along with their metal cations, catalyzed the chemical reactions that caused the molecules to form polymers. The first RNA fragments could also have come together on ancient clays. For an organic molecule to become a cell, it must be able to separate itself from its environment. To enclose the molecule, a lipid membrane grew around the organic material. Eventually the molecules could synthesize their own organic material and replicate themselves. These became the first cells. The earliest cells were prokaryotes ( Figure 12.14). Although prokaryotes have a cell membrane, they lack a cell E. coli (Escherichia coli) is a primitive prokaryote that may resemble the earliest cells. nucleus and other organelles. Without a nucleus, RNA was loose within the cell. Over time the cells became more complex. Evidence for bacteria, the first single-celled life forms, goes back 3.5 billion years ( Figure 12.15). Eventually life began to diversify from these extremely simple cells. The last life form that was the ancestor to all life that came afterward is called LUCA, which stands for the Last Universal Common Ancestor. LUCA was a prokaryote but differed from the first living cells because its genetic code was based on DNA. LUCA lived 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. The oldest fossils are tiny microbe-like objects that are 3.5 billion years old. 
Photosynthesis and the  Changing  Atmosphere 	  Without photosynthesis what did the earliest cells eat? Most likely they absorbed the nutrients that floated around in the organic soup that surrounded them. After hundreds of millions of years, these nutrients would have become less abundant. Sometime around 3 billion years ago (about 1.5 billion years after Earth formed!), photosynthesis began. Photosynthesis allowed organisms to use sunlight and inorganic molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water, to create chemical energy that they could use for food. To photosynthesize, a cell needs chloroplasts ( Figure 12.16). Chloroplasts are visible in these cells found within the leaf of a water plant. In what two ways did photosynthesis make the planet much more favorable for life? 
Earths  Third  Atmosphere 	  The addition of oxygen is what created Earths third atmosphere. This event, which occurred about 2.5 billion years ago, is sometimes called the oxygen catastrophe because so many organisms died. Although many species died out and went extinct, this event is also called the Great Oxygenation Event because it was a great opportunity. The organisms that survived developed a use for oxygen through cellular respiration, the process by which cells can obtain energy from organic molecules. What evidence do scientists have that large quantities of oxygen entered the atmosphere? The iron contained in the rocks combined with the oxygen to form reddish iron oxides. By the beginning of the Proterozoic, banded-iron formations (BIFs) were forming. The oldest BIFs are 3.7 billion years old, but they are very common during the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago ( Figure 12.17). By 1.8 billion years ago, the amount of BIF declined. In recent times, the iron in these formations has been mined, and that explains the location of the auto industry in the upper Midwest. Banded-iron formations display alternating bands of iron oxide and iron-poor chert that probably represent a seasonal cycle of an aerobic and an anaerobic environment. With more oxygen in the atmosphere, ultraviolet radiation could create ozone. With the formation of an ozone layer to protect the surface of the Earth from UV radiation, more complex life forms could evolve. 
Early  Organisms 	  What were these organisms that completely changed the progression of life on Earth by changing the atmosphere from anaerobic to aerobic? The oldest known fossils that are from organisms known to photosynthesize are cyanobacteria ( Figure 12.18). Cyanobacteria were present by 2.8 billion years ago, and some may have been around as far back as 3.5 billion years. Modern cyanobacteria are also called blue-green algae. These organisms may consist of a single or many cells and they are found in many different environments ( Figure 12.19). Even now cyanobacteria account for 20% to 30% of photosynthesis on Earth. Cyanobacteria were the dominant life forms in the Archean. Why would such a primitive life-form have been dominant in the Precambrian? Many cyanobacteria lived in reef-like structures known as stromatolites ( Figure A large bloom of cyanobacteria is harmful to this lake. These rocks in Glacier National Park, Montana may contain some of the oldest fossil microbes on Earth. 
Eukaryotes 	  About 2 billion years ago, eukaryotes evolved. Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus that encloses their DNA and RNA. All complex cells and nearly all multi-celled animals are eukaryotic. The evolution of eukaryotes from prokaryotes is an interesting subject in the study of early life. Scientists think that small prokaryotic cells began to live together in a symbiotic relationship; that is, different types of small cells were beneficial to each other and none harmed the other. The small cell types each took on a specialized function and became the organelles within a larger cell. Organelles supplied energy, broke down wastes, or did other jobs that were needed for cells to become more complex. What is thought to be the oldest eukaryote fossil found so far is 2.1 billion years old. Eukaryotic cells were much better able to live and replicate themselves, so they continued to evolve and became the dominant life form over prokaryotic cells. 
Multicellular  Life 	  Prokaryotes and eukaryotes can both be multicellular. The first multi-celled organisms were probably prokaryotic cyanobacteria. Multicellularity may have evolved more than once in life history, likely at least once for plants and once for animals. Early multicellular organisms were soft bodied and did not fossilize well, so little remains of their existence. Multicellular organism will be discussed in the lesson, History of Earths Complex Life Forms. 
Lesson  Summary 	  After partial melting of the original basaltic crust began, silca-rich rock formed the early continental crust. The oldest felsic continental crust is found in cratons. A craton found at the surface is a shield; a sediment covered craton is a platform. Precambrian rocks help scientists piece together the geology of that time. The continents formed as cratons collided with microcontinents and island arcs to form large continents. Rodinia was a supercontinent composed of Laurentia and other continents. Snowball Earth may have occurred during the late Precambrian and its end may have led to the explosion of life forms that developed during the Ediacaran and Cambrian. Amino acids were essential for the origin of life. They link together to form proteins. RNA may have been the first and only nucleic acid at the beginning of life. A cell needs a way to replicate itself, a metabolism, and a way to separate itself from its environment. An atmosphere that contains oxygen is important because of the ozone layer and cellular respiration. Multicellular organisms evolved long after prokaryotes evolved and they may have evolved more than once. Read about the oldest material yet found in the Solar System: URL 100823-oldest-solar-system-two-million-years-older-science/ . What would life be like on Earth if there were no free oxygen? Why did it take so long for eukaryotes or multicellular organisms to evolve? How did the evolution of life affect the non-biological parts of the planet? The Phanerozoic is divided into the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. Marine transgressions and regressions were common during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. facies marine regression marine transgression orogeny 
Introduction 	  Compared with the long expanse of the Precambrian, the Phanerozoic is recent history. Much more geological evidence is available for scientists to study so the Phanerozoic is much better known. 
Paleozoic 	  The Paleozoic is the furthest back era of the Phanerozoic and it lasted the longest. But the Paleozoic was relatively recent, beginning only 570 million years ago. The paleogeography of the Paleozoic begins and ends with a supercontinent. 
Marine  Transgressions and  Regressions 	  Some of the most important events of the Paleozoic were the rising and falling of sea level over the continents. Sea level rises over the land during a marine transgression. During a marine regression, sea level retreats. During the Paleozoic there were four complete cycles of marine transgressions and regressions ( Figure 12.21). Geologists know about marine transgressions and regressions from the sedimentary rock record. These events leave characteristic rock layers known as sedimentary facies. On a shoreline, sand and other coarse grained rock fragments are commonly found on the beach where the wave energy is high. Away from the shore in lower energy environments, fine-grained silt that later creates shale is deposited. In deeper, low-energy waters, carbonate mud that later hardens into limestone is deposited. The Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of the Grand Canyon contain evidence of marine transgressions and regressions, but even there the rock record is not complete. Look at the sequence in the Figure 12.22 and see if you can determine Six marine transgressions and regressions have occurred during the Phanerozoic. whether the sea was transgressing or regressing. At the bottom, the Tonto Group represents a marine transgression: sandstone (11), shale (10), and limestone (9) laid down during 30 million years of the Cambrian Period. The Ordovician and Silurian are unknown because of an unconformity. Above that is freshwater limestone (8), which is overlain by limestone (7) and then shale (6), indicating that the sea was regressing. After another unconformity, the rocks of the Supai Group (5) include limestone, siltstone, and sandstone indicative of a regressing sea. Above those rocks are shale (4), sandstone (3), a limestone and sandstone mix (2) showing that the sea regressed and transgressed and finally limestone (1) indicating that the sea had come back in. One of two things must happen for sea level to change in a marine transgression: either the land must sink or the water level must rise. What could cause sea level to rise? When little or no fresh water is tied up in glaciers and ice caps, sea level is high. Sea level also appears to rise if land is down dropped. Sea level rises if an increase in seafloor spreading rate buoys up the ocean crust, causing the ocean basin to become smaller. What could cause sea level to fall in a marine regression? Geologists think that the Paleozoic marine transgressions and regressions were the result of the decrease and increase in the size of glaciers covering the lands. The Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of the Grand Canyon were deposited during marine transgressions and regressions. 
Plate  Tectonics 	  A mountain-building event is called an orogeny. Orogenies take place over tens or hundreds of millions of years. At the beginning of the Paleozoic, the supercontinent Rodinia began to split up. At the end, Pangaea came together. As continents smash into microcontinents and island arcs collided, mountains rise. Geologists find evidence for these collisions in many locations. For example, Laurentia collided with the Taconic Island Arc during the Taconic Orogeny ( Figure 12.23). The remnants of this mountain range make up the Taconic Mountains in New York. Laurentia experienced other orogenies as it merged with the northern continents. The southern continents came together to form Gondwana. When Laurentia and Gondwana collided to create Pangaea, the Appalachians rose. Geologists think they may once have been higher than the Himalayas are now. Pangaea was the last supercontinent on Earth. Evidence for the existence of Pangaea was what Alfred Wegener used to create his continental drift hypothesis, which was described in the Plate Tectonics chapter. As the continents move and the land masses change shape, the shape of the oceans changes too. During the time of Pangaea, about 250 million years ago, most of Earths water was collected in a huge ocean called Panthalassa ( Figure 12.24). The Taconic Orogeny is an example of a collision between a continent and a volcanic island arc. Pangea was the sole landform 250 million years ago, leaving a huge ocean called Panthalassa, along with a few smaller seas. 
Mesozoic 	  The Mesozoic is known as the age of the dinosaurs, but things were happening geologically as well. The Mesozoic was dominantly warm and tropical. 
The  Breakup of  Pangaea 	  At the end of the Paleozoic there was one continent and one ocean. When Pangaea began to break apart about 180 million years ago, the Panthalassa Ocean separated into the individual but interconnected oceans that we see today on Earth. Why would a supercontinent break up after being together for tens of millions of years? A continent is a giant insulating blanket that does not allow mantle heat to escape very effectively. As heat builds up beneath a supercontinent, continental rifting begins. Basaltic lavas fill in the rift and eventually lead to seafloor spreading and the formation of a new ocean basin. In the Afar Region of Ethiopia, Africa is splitting apart. Three plates are pulling away from a central point. The Atlantic Ocean basin formed as Pangaea split apart. The seafloor spreading that pushed Africa and South America apart is continuing to enlarge the Atlantic Ocean ( Figure 12.25). 
Plate  Tectonics 	  As the continents moved apart there was an intense period of plate tectonic activity. Seafloor spreading was so vigorous that the mid-ocean ridge buoyed upwards and displaced so much water that there was a marine transgression. Later in the Mesozoic those seas regressed and then transgressed again. The moving continents collided with island arcs and microcontinents so that mountain ranges accreted onto the continents edges. The subduction of the oceanic Farallon plate beneath western North America during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous produced igneous intrusions and other structures. The intrusions have since been uplifted so that they are exposed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains ( Figure 12.26). A marine transgression during the Cretaceous covered much of the North American continent with water ( Figure The snow-covered Sierra Nevada is seen striking SE to NW across the eastern third of the image. The mountain range is a line of uplifted batholiths from Mesozoic subduction. Lands that had been uplifted during tectonic activity remained above water during this marine transgression that took place during the Cretaceous. 
Cenozoic 	  The Cenozoic began around 65.5 million years ago and continues today. Although it accounts for only about 1.5% of the Earths total history, as the most recent era it is the one scientists know the most about. Much of what has been discussed in the first chapters of this book describes the geological situation of the Cenozoic. 
Plate  Tectonics 	  The paleogeography of the era was very much like it is today. Early in the Cenozoic, blocks of crust uplifted to form the Rocky Mountains, which were later eroded away and then uplifted again. Subduction off of the Pacific Northwest formed the Cascades volcanic arc. The Basin and Range province that centers on Nevada is where crust is being pulled apart. The San Andreas Fault has grown where the Pacific and North American plates meet. The plate tectonic evolution of that plate boundary is complex and interesting ( Figure 12.28). This figure shows the evolution of the San Andreas Fault zone from 30 million years ago (bottom) to present (top). The Farallon Plate was subducting beneath the North American Plate 30 Ma. By 20 Ma the Pacific Plate and East Pacific Rise spreading center had started to subduct, splitting the Farallon Plate into two smaller plates. Transform motion where the Pacific and North American plates meet formed the San Andreas Fault. The fault moved inland and at present small sea floor spreading basins along with the transform motion of the San Andreas are splitting Baja California from mainland Mexico. Although most plate tectonic activity involves continents moving apart, smaller regions are coming together. Africa collided with Eurasia to create the Alps. India crashed into Asia to form the Himalayas. 
Ice  Ages 	  As the continents moved apart, climate began to cool. When Australia and Antarctica separated, the Circumpolar Current could then move the frigid water around Antarctica and spread it more widely around the planet. Antarctica drifted over the south polar region and the continent began to grow a permanent ice cap in the Oligocene. The climate warmed in the early Miocene but then began to cool again in the late Miocene and Pliocene when glaciers began to form. During the Pleistocene ice ages, which began 2.6 million years ago, glaciers advanced and retreated four times ( Figure 17.29). During the retreats, the climate was often warmer than it is today. These continental ice sheets were extremely thick, like the Antarctic ice cap is today.

Lesson  Summary 	  The Phanerozoic began 570 million years ago and continues today. The Paleozoic was a time of four marine transgressions and regressions, which left characteristic sedimentary facies. An orogeny is a mountain building event that takes place when a continent runs into another continent, a microcontinent, or a volcanic island arc. The general climate trend in the Cenozoic was cooling, leading to the Pleistocene ice ages from 2.6 million to about 10,000 years ago. Describe the geologic history of North America. How did the paleogeography of the planet affect the evolution of life? How did climate affect the evolution of life? How was human evolution related to major climatic events? Describe how adaptations develop. Explain how the fossil record shows us that species evolve over time. Describe the general development of Earths life forms over the last 540 million years. adaptation adaptive radiation amniote egg evolution mutation natural selection paleontologist tropical variation 
Introduction 	  Organisms must adapt to their environment or they will die out. Most of the fossils are the remains of animals that are now extinct. The mechanism for change in a population of organisms is natural selection. 
Adaptation and  Evolution 	  The characteristics of an organism that help it to survive in a given environment are called adaptations. Adaptations are traits that an organism inherits from its parents. Within a population of organisms are genes coding for a certain number of traits; for example, a human population may have genes for eyes that are blue, green, hazel, or brown, but as far as we know, not purple or lime green. Adaptations develop when certain variations or differences in a population help some members survive better than others ( Figure 12.31). The variation may already exist within the population, but often the variation comes from a mutation, or a random change in an organisms genes. Some mutations are harmful and the organism dies; in that case, the variation will not remain in the population. Many mutations are neutral and remain in the population. If the environment changes, the mutation may be beneficial and it may help the organism adapt to the environment. The organisms that survive pass this favorable trait on to their offspring. Many changes in the genetic makeup of a species may accumulate over time, especially if the environment is changing. Eventually the descendants will be very different from their ancestors and may become a whole new species. Changes in the genetic makeup of a species over time are known as biological evolution. The mechanism for evolution is natural selection. Traits become more or less common in a population depending on whether they are beneficial or harmful. An example of evolution by natural selection can be found in the deer mouse, species Peromyscus maniculatus. In Nebraska this mouse is typically brown, but after glaciers carried lighter sand over the darker soil in the Sand Hills, predators could more easily spot the dark mice. Natural selection favored the light mice, and over time, the population became light colored. This story is covered in more detail here: URL . This animation begins with the Big Bang, which will be discussed in the chapter about the solar system, and goes through the history of life on Earth: URL . 
Ediacara  Fauna 	  Although the explosion in the number and type of life forms did not come until the beginning of the Cambrian, life at the end of the Precambrian became more complex. Paleontologists find worldwide evidence of a group of extremely diverse multicellular organisms toward the end of the Precambrian (580-542 Ma). The Ediacara Fauna have a variety of forms of symmetry, range from soft to rigid, and they take the form of discs, bags, or even quilted mattresses ( Figure 12.32). The organisms seem to have appeared as Earth defrosted from its worldwide glaciation. No one knows quite how to categorize these organisms. Some scientists think that they are the ancestors of organisms that came later. Others think that the Ediacara fauna died out and that the organisms that took over during the Cambrian were a different group. It may not be possible to know the solution to this problem. An example of an Ediacara organism. Why did it take 4 billion years for organisms as complex as the Ediacara biota to evolve? Scientists do not really know, although there are many possible explanations: Evolutionary processes are slow and it took a long time for complexity to evolve. There was no evolutionary advantage to being larger and more complex. Atmospheric oxygen was limited so complex organisms could not evolve. The planet was too cold for complex life. Complex life evolved but was wiped out by the massive global glaciations. Scientists also do not know why the Ediacaran biota died out. Some possibilities include: The evolution of predators with skeletons in the Cambrian. Competition from more advanced Cambrian organisms. Changes in environmental conditions caused by supercontinent breakups such as rising sea level, limited nutrients, or changing atmospheric and oceanic chemistry. The existence of the Ediacaran biota does show that a diversity of life forms existed before the Cambrian. 
Phanerozoic  Eon 	  The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three erasthe Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoicspanning from about 540 million years ago to the present ( Table 12.1). Life has undergone fantastic changes during the long span of the Phanerozoic Eon. Notice that different types of organisms developed at different times. 
First grasses; grasslands begin to dominate the 	  land 
Extinction and  Radiation 	  The eras of the Phanerozoic Eon are separated by mass extinctions. A mass extinction occurs when large numbers of species become extinct in a short amount of time. The causes of different mass extinctions are different: collisions with comets or asteroids, massive volcanic eruptions, or rapidly changing climate are all possible causes of some of these disasters ( Figure 12.33). An extinct Tyrannosaurus rex. This fossil resembling a living organism. After a mass extinction, many habitats are no longer inhabited by organisms because they have gone extinct. A change in the environment from one in which organisms live in all the available habitats to one in which many habitats are available gives an advantage to organisms that can adapt to new environments. Evolutionary processes act rapidly during these times and many new species evolve to fill those available habitats. The process in which many new species evolve in a short period of time to fill available niches is called adaptive radiation. 
Paleozoic  Life 	  The Cambrian began with a tremendous diversification of life forms. Shallow seas covered the lands so every major marine organism group evolved during this time. With the evolution of hard body parts, fossils are much more abundant and better preserved from this period than from the Precambrian. The Burgess Shale formation in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada, contains an amazing diversity of middle Cambrian life forms, from about 505 million years ago. One organism had a soft body like a worm, five eyes, and a long nose like a vacuum cleaner hose ( Figure 12.34). Paleontologists do not agree on whether the Burgess Shale fossils can all be classified into modern groups of organisms or whether many represent lines that have gone completely extinct. This bizarre animal with five eyes lived during the Cambrian, which began about 540 million years ago. Throughout the Paleozoic, seas transgressed and regressed. When continental areas were covered with shallow seas, the number and diversity of marine organisms increased. During regressions the number shrank. Large extinction events separate the periods of the Paleozoic. After extinctions, new life forms evolved ( Figure 12.35). For example, after the extinction at the end of the Ordovician, fish and the first tetrapod animals appeared. Tetrapods are four legged vertebrates, but the earliest ones did not leave shallow, brackish water. Simple plants began to colonize the land during the Ordovician, but land plants really flourished when seeds evolved during the Carboniferous ( Figure 12.36). The abundant swamps became the coal and petroleum deposits that are the source of much of our fossil fuels today. During the later part of the Paleozoic, land animals and insects greatly increased in numbers and diversity. The largest mass extinction in Earth history occurred at the end of the Permian period, about 250 million years ago. In this catastrophe, it is estimated that more than 95% of marine species on Earth went extinct. Marine species with calcium carbonate shells and skeletons suffered worst. About 70% of terrestrial vertebrates (land organisms) also went extinct. This was also the only known mass extinction of insects. Trilobites were shallow marine animals that flourished during the lower Paleozoic. A modern rainforest has many seedbearing plants that are similar to those that were common during the Carboniferous. This mass extinction appears to have taken place in three pulses, with three separate causes. Gradual environmental change, an asteroid impact, intense volcanism, or changes in the composition of the atmosphere may all have played a role. 
Mesozoic  Life 	  At the beginning of the Mesozoic, Pangaea began to break apart so more beaches and continental shelf areas were available for colonization. Climate during the entire era was warm and tropical. With many niches available after the mass extinction, a great diversity of organisms evolved. Tiny marine plants called phytoplankton arose to become the base of the marine food web. On land, seed plants and trees diversified. Ferns were common at the time of the dinosaurs ( Figure 12.37). The earliest known fossil of a flowering plant is from the Cretaceous, 125 million years old. Mammals appeared near the end of the Triassic but the Mesozoic is known as the age of the reptiles. In a great advance over amphibians, which must live near water, reptiles developed adaptations for living away from water. Their thick skin keeps them from drying out and the evolution of the amniotic egg allowed them to lay their eggs on dry land. The amniote egg has a shell and contains all the nutrients and water required for the developing embryo. Of course the most famous Mesozoic reptiles were the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs reigned for 160 million years and had tremendous numbers and diversity. Species of dinosaurs filled all the niches that are currently filled by mammals. Dinosaurs were plant eaters, meat eaters, bipedal, quadrupedal, endothermic (warm-blooded), exothermic (coldblooded), enormous, small, and some could swim or fly. Although nearly all species of dinosaurs went extinct, modern birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs ( Figure 12.38). Between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic, 65 million years ago, about 50% of all animal species, including the dinosaurs, became extinct. Although there are other hypotheses, most scientists think that this mass extinction took place when a giant meteorite struck Earth with the energy of the most powerful nuclear weapon ( Figure 12.39). The impact kicked up a massive dust cloud and when the particles rained back onto the surface they heated the atmosphere until it became as hot as a kitchen oven. Animals roasted. Dust that remained in the atmosphere blocked sunlight for a year or more, causing a deep freeze and temporarily ending photosynthesis. Sulfur from the impact An artists painting of the impact that caused the Cretaceous extinctions. mixed with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain, which dissolved the shells of the tiny marine plankton that form the base of the food chain. With little food being produced by land plants and plankton, animals starved. Carbon dioxide was also released from the impact and eventually caused global warming. Life forms could not survive the dramatic temperature swings. Asteroid impacts have profoundly affected earth history from the very beginning, by bringing in water and amino acids for the oceans, atmosphere, and life, and by forming the Moon. Mass extinctions that have occurred throughout Earth history may also have been caused by asteroid impacts. The best known is the impact that brought about the extinction of the dinosaurs (1f): URL (2:01), URL (1:23). 
Cenozoic  Life 	  The extinction of so many species again left many niches available to be filled. Although we call the Cenozoic the age of mammals, birds are more common and more diverse. The adaptations allow mammals to spread to even more environments than reptiles because mammals are endothermic and have fur, hair, or blubber for warmth. Mammals can swim, fly, and live in nearly all terrestrial environments. Mammals initially filled the forests that covered many early Cenozoic lands. Over time, the forests gave way to grasslands, which created more niches for mammals to fill. As climate cooled during the ice ages, large mammals were able to stand the cold weather and so many interesting megafauna developed ( Figure 12.40). A lecture from Yale University on the effect of life on Earth and Earth on life during 4.5 billion years. Glaciations appear at minute mark 23:30-26:20 and then the video goes into mass extinctions (6c): URL atch?v=K6Dl_Vs-ZkY (47:10). The Evolution of Life in 60 Seconds scales all 4.6 billion years of Earth history into one minute. Dont blink at the end (1i IE Stand.): URL (1:03). The saber-tooth cat lived during the Pleistocene. Humans also evolved during the later Cenozoic. Bipedal primates first appeared about 6 million years ago when grasslands were common. Standing on two feet allows an organism to see and also to use its hands and arms for hunting ( Figure 12.41). The brain size of this bipedal primate grew rapidly. The genus Homo appeared about 2 million years ago. Humans developed tools and cultures ( Figure 12.42). Homo sapiens, our species, originated about 200,000 years ago in Africa. The ice ages allowed humans to migrate. During the ice ages water was frozen in glaciers and so land bridges such as the Bering Strait allowed humans to walk from the old world to the new world. Evidence of a spiritual life appears about 32,000 years ago with stone figurines that probably have religious significance. 
Modern  Biodiversity 	  There are more than 1 million species of plants and animals known to be currently alive on Earth ( Figure 12.43) and many millions more that have not been discovered yet. The tremendous variety of creatures is due to the tremendous numbers of environments ( Figure 12.44). Many adaptations protect organisms from the external environment ( Figure 12.45). Other adaptations help an organism move or gather food. Reindeer have sponge-like hoofs that help them walk on snowy ground without slipping and falling. Hummingbirds have long thin beaks that help them drink nectar from There is an amazing diversity of organisms on Earth. How do the organisms in this picture each make their living? Polar bears have thick fur coats to stay warm as they hunt in icy waters. flowers. Organisms have special features that help them avoid being eaten. When a herd of zebras run away from lions, the zebras dark stripes confuse the predators so that they have difficulty focusing on just one zebra during the chase. Some plants have poisonous or foul-tasting substances in them that keep animals from eating them. Their brightly colored flowers serve as a warning. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Adaptations are favorable traits that organisms inherit. Adaptations develop from variations within a population and help organisms to survive in their given environment. Changes in populations accumulate over time; this is called evolution. The fossil record shows us that present day life forms evolved from earlier life forms. Beginning about 540 million years ago more complex organisms developed on Earth. During the Phanerozoic Eon all of the plant and animal types we know today evolved. Many types of organisms that once lived are now extinct. Earths overall environment, especially the climate, has changed many times, and organisms change over time, too. Cacti have thick, waterretaining bodies that help them conserve water. How did life on Earth change from one period of geologic time to the next? How did climate affect the evolution of life? Evolution is well documented in the fossil record. Why is it so controversial? For Table 12.1, from top to bottom: Mariana Ruiz Villarreal (LadyofHats). URL . Public Domain. Flickr:sonorasam. URL .

S  Earths  Fresh  Water 	  This unusual view of the world is oriented on the Arctic around summer solstice, June 2010, when the region is bathed in daylight 24 hours a day. The Arctic Circle is marked by a faint circle in the image. Water appears in several forms in this image: as solid ice, liquid water, and atmospheric gases. Greenland has the highest albedo (that is, it appears the brightest) because it is covered with an ice cap. Sea ice, found west and north of Greenland, appears as a pale gray-blue. Clouds are water vapor and appear throughout the area. Through the clouds, oceans, and possibly even lakes  liquid water  is visible.

Introduction 	  Water is simply two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen bonded together. Despite its simplicity, water has remarkable properties. Water expands when it freezes, has high surface tension (because of the polar nature of the molecules, they tend to stick together), and others. Without water, life might not be able to exist on Earth and it certainly would not have the tremendous complexity and diversity that we see. 
Distribution of  Earths  Water 	  Earths oceans contain 97% of the planets water, so just 3% is fresh water, water with low concentrations of salts ( Figure 13.1). Most fresh water is trapped as ice in the vast glaciers and ice sheets of Greenland. A storage location for water such as an ocean, glacier, pond, or even the atmosphere is known as a reservoir. A water molecule may pass through a reservoir very quickly or may remain for much longer. The amount of time a molecule stays in a reservoir is known as its residence time. How is the 3% of fresh water divided into different reservoirs? How much of that water is useful for living creatures? How much for people? The distribution of Earths water. 
The  Hydrologic  Cycle 	  Because of the unique properties of water, water molecules can cycle through almost anywhere on Earth. The water molecule found in your glass of water today could have erupted from a volcano early in Earth history. In the intervening billions of years, the molecule probably spent time in a glacier or far below the ground. The molecule surely was high up in the atmosphere and maybe deep in the belly of a dinosaur. Where will that water molecule go next? 
Three  States of  Water 	  Water is the only substance on Earth that is present in all three states of matter as a solid, liquid or gas. (And Earth is the only planet where water is present in all three states.) Because of the ranges in temperature in specific locations around the planet, all three phases may be present in a single location or in a region. The three phases are solid (ice or snow), liquid (water), and gas ( water vapor). See ice, water, and clouds ( Figure 13.2). 
The  Water  Cycle 	  Because Earths water is present in all three states, it can get into a variety of environments around the planet. The movement of water around Earths surface is the hydrologic (water) cycle ( Figure 13.3). Because it is a cycle, the water cycle has no beginning and no end. The Sun, many millions of kilometers away, provides the energy that drives the water cycle. Our nearest star directly impacts the water cycle by supplying the energy needed for evaporation. Most of Earths water is stored in the oceans where it can remain for hundreds or thousands of years. The oceans are discussed in detail in the chapter Earths Oceans. Water changes from a liquid to a gas by evaporation to become water vapor. The Suns energy can evaporate water from the ocean surface or from lakes, streams, or puddles on land. Only the water molecules evaporate; the salts remain in the ocean or a fresh water reservoir. The water vapor remains in the atmosphere until it undergoes condensation to become tiny droplets of liquid. The droplets gather in clouds, which are blown about the globe by wind. As the water droplets in the clouds collide and grow, they fall from the sky as precipitation. Precipitation can be rain, sleet, hail, or snow. Sometimes precipitation falls back into the ocean and sometimes it falls onto the land surface. For a little fun, watch this video. This water cycle song focuses on the role of the sun in moving H2O from one reservoir to another. The movement of all sorts of matter between reservoirs depends on Earths internal or external sources of energy (7c): URL (2:38). This animation shows the annual cycle of monthly mean precipitation around the world: URL wiki/File:MeanMonthlyP.gif When water falls from the sky as rain it may enter streams and rivers that flow downward to oceans and lakes. Water that falls as snow may sit on a mountain for several months. Snow may become part of the ice in a glacier, where it may remain for hundreds or thousands of years. Snow and ice may go directly back into the air by sublimation, the process in which a solid changes directly into a gas without first becoming a liquid. Although you probably have not seen water vapor sublimating from a glacier, you may have seen dry ice sublimate in air. Snow and ice slowly melt over time to become liquid water, which provides a steady flow of fresh water to streams, rivers, and lakes below. A water droplet falling as rain could also become part of a stream or a lake. At the surface, the water may eventually evaporate and reenter the atmosphere. A significant amount of water infiltrates into the ground. Soil moisture is an important reservoir for water ( Figure 13.4). Water trapped in soil is important for plants to grow. The moisture content of soil in the United States varies greatly. Water may seep through dirt and rock below the soil through pores infiltrating the ground to go into Earths groundwater system. Groundwater enters aquifers that may store fresh water for centuries. Alternatively, the water may come to the surface through springs or find its way back to the oceans. Plants and animals depend on water to live and they also play a role in the water cycle. Plants take up water from the soil and release large amounts of water vapor into the air through their leaves ( Figure 13.5), a process known as transpiration. An online guide to the hydrologic cycle from the University of Illinois is found here: URL /%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/hyd/home.rxml People also depend on water as a natural resource. Not content to get water directly from streams or ponds, humans create canals, aqueducts, dams, and wells to collect water and direct it to where they want it ( Figure 13.6).

Lesson  Summary 	  Although Earths surface is mostly water covered, only 3% is fresh water. Water on Earth is found in all three phases: solid, liquid, and gas. Water travels between phases and reservoirs as part of the hydrologic (water) cycle. The major processes of the water cycle include evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and return to the oceans via runoff and groundwater supplies.

Introduction 	  Fresh water in streams, ponds, and lakes is an extremely important part of the water cycle if only because of its importance to living creatures. Along with wetlands, these fresh water regions contain a tremendous variety of organisms. 
Streams and  Rivers 	  Streams are bodies of water that have a current; they are in constant motion. Geologists recognize many categories of streams depending on their size, depth, speed, and location. Creeks, brooks, tributaries, bayous, and rivers might all be lumped together as streams. In streams, water always flows downhill, but the form that downhill movement takes varies with rock type, topography, and many other factors. Stream erosion and deposition are extremely important creators and destroyers of landforms and were described in the Erosion and Deposition chapter. 
Parts of a  Stream 	  A stream originates at its source. A source is likely to be in the high mountains where snows collect in winter and melt in summer, or a source might be a spring. A stream may have more than one source. Two streams come together at a confluence. The smaller of the two streams is a tributary of the larger stream ( Figure 13.7). The largest band of blue, from left to right across the image, is the Rio Negro in Brazil. The other streams are tributaries of that river. Their confluence is near the bottom right. A stream may create a pool where water slows and becomes deeper ( Figure 13.8). The point at which a stream comes into a large body of water, like an ocean or a lake is called the mouth. Where the stream meets the ocean or lake is an estuary ( Figure 13.9). The Parana River drains South America and enters the Atlantic Ocean. The mix of fresh and salt water where a river runs into the ocean creates a diversity of environments where many different types of organisms create unique ecosystems ( Figure 13.10). The Klamath River enters the Pacific at Redwood National Park. 
Rivers 	  Rivers are the largest types of stream, moving large amounts of water from higher to lower elevations ( Figure 13.11). The Amazon River, the worlds river with the greatest flow, has a flow rate of nearly 220,000 cubic meters per second! People have used rivers since the beginning of civilization as a source of water, food, transportation, defense, power, recreation, and waste disposal. The famous Horseshoe Falls at Niagara Falls drops over 1,800 cubic meters of water per second, down a cliff nearly 50 meters (170 feet) in height. The falls are fed by Lake Erie and the Niagara River. 
Divides 	  A divide is a topographically high area that separates a landscape into different water basins ( Figure 13.12). Rain that falls on the north side of a ridge flows into the northern drainage basin and rain that falls on the south side flows into the southern drainage basin. On a much grander scale, entire continents have divides, known as continental divides. (a) The divides of North America. In the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, where does a raindrop falling on the western slope end up? How about on the eastern slope? (b) At Triple Divide Peak in Montana water may flow to the Pacific, the Atlantic, or Hudson Bay depending on where it falls. Can you locate where in the map of North America (above) this peak sits? 
Ponds and  Lakes 	  Ponds and lakes are bordered by hills or low rises, so that the water is blocked from flowing directly downhill. Ponds are small bodies of fresh water that usually have no outlet ( Figure 13.13); ponds are often are fed by underground springs. Lakes are larger bodies of water. Lakes are usually fresh water, although the Great Salt Lake in Utah is just one exception. Water usually drains out of a lake through a river or a stream and all lakes lose water to evaporation. Large lakes have tidal systems and currents, and can even affect weather patterns. The Great Lakes in the United States contain 22% of the worlds fresh surface water ( Figure 13.14). The largest them, Lake Superior, has a tide that rises and falls several centimeters each day. The Great Lakes are large enough to alter the weather system in Northeastern United States by the lake effect, which is an increase in snow downwind of the relatively warm lakes. The Great Lakes are home to countless species of fish and wildlife. Lakes form in a variety of different ways: in depressions carved by glaciers, in calderas ( Figure 13.14), and along tectonic faults, to name a few. Subglacial lakes are even found below a frozen ice cap. As a result of geologic history and the arrangement of land masses, most lakes are in the Northern Hemisphere. In fact, more than 60% of all the worlds lakes are in Canada most of these lakes were formed by the glaciers that covered most of Canada in the last Ice Age ( Figure 13.15). Limnology is the study of bodies of fresh water and the organisms that live there. The ecosystem of a lake is divided into three distinct sections ( Figure 13.16): In the littoral zone, sunlight promotes plant growth, which provides food and shelter to animals such as snails, insects, and fish. In the open-water zone, other plants and fish, such as bass and trout, live. The deep-water zone does not have photosynthesis since there is no sunlight. Most deep-water organisms are scavengers, such as crabs and catfish that feed on dead organisms that fall to the bottom of the lake. Fungi and bacteria aid in the decomposition in the deep zone. (a) Crater Lake in Oregon is in a volcanic caldera. Lakes can also form in volcanic craters and impact craters. (b) The Great Lakes fill depressions eroded as glaciers scraped rock out from the landscape. (c) Lake Baikail, ice coated in winter in this image, formed as water filled up a tectonic faults. Though different creatures live in the oceans, ocean waters also have these same divisions based on sunlight with similar types of creatures that live in each of the zones. Lakes are not permanent features of a landscape. Some come and go with the seasons, as water levels rise and fall. Over a longer time, lakes disappear when they fill with sediments, if the springs or streams that fill them diminish, or if their outlets grow because of erosion. When the climate of an area changes, lakes can either expand or shrink ( Figure 13.17). Lakes may disappear if precipitation significantly diminishes. 
Wetlands 	  Wetlands are lands that are wet for significant periods of time. They are common where water and land meet. Wetlands can be large flat areas or relatively small and steep areas. Wetlands are rich and unique ecosystems with many species that rely on both the land and the water for survival. Only specialized plants are able to grow in these conditions. Wetlands tend have a great deal of biological diversity. Wetland ecosystems can also be fragile systems that are sensitive to the amounts and quality of water present within them. 
Types of  Wetlands 	  Marshes are shallow wetlands around lakes, streams, or the ocean where grasses and reeds are common, but trees Lakes near Yellowknife were carved by glaciers during the last Ice Age. The three primary zones of a lake are the littoral, open-water, and deep-water zones. are not ( Figure 13.18). Frogs, turtles, muskrats, and many varieties of birds are at home in marshes. A swamp is a wetland with lush trees and vines found in a low-lying area beside slow-moving rivers ( Figure 13.19). Like marshes, they are frequently or always inundated with water. Since the water in a swamp moves slowly, oxygen in the water is often scarce. Swamp plants and animals must be adapted for these low-oxygen conditions. Like marshes, swamps can be fresh water, salt water, or a mixture of both. In an estuary, salt water from the sea mixes with fresh water from a stream or river ( Figure 13.20). These semienclosed areas are home to plants and animals that can tolerate the sharp changes in salt content that the constant motion and mixing of waters creates. Estuaries contain brackish water, water that has more salt than fresh water but less than sea water. Because of the rapid changes in salt content, estuaries have many different habitats for plants and animals and extremely high biodiversity. The Badwater Basin in Death Valley contains water in wet years. The lake basin is a remnant from when the region was much wetter just after the Ice Ages. Chesapeake Bay, surrounded by Maryland and Virginia, is the largest estuary in the United States. 
Ecological  Role of  Wetlands 	  As mentioned above, wetlands are home to many different species of organisms. Although they make up only 5% of the area of the United States, wetlands contain more than 30% of the plant types. Many endangered species live in wetlands, so wetlands are protected from human use. Wetlands also play a key biological role by removing pollutants from water. For example, they can trap and use fertilizer that has washed off a farmers field, and therefore they prevent that fertilizer from contaminating another body of water. Since wetlands naturally purify water, preserving wetlands also helps to maintain clean supplies of water. 
Floods 	  Floods are a natural part of the water cycle, but they can be terrifying forces of destruction. Put most simply, a flood is an overflow of water in one place. Floods can occur for a variety of reasons, and their effects can be minimized in several different ways. Perhaps unsurprisingly, floods tend to affect low-lying areas most severely. Floods 101 is a National Geographic video found in Environment Video, Natural Disasters, Landslides, and more: URL 
Causes of  Floods 	  Floods usually occur when precipitation falls more quickly than that water can be absorbed into the ground or carried away by rivers or streams. Waters may build up gradually over a period of weeks, when a long period of rainfall or snowmelt fills the ground with water and raises stream levels. Extremely heavy rains across the Midwestern U.S. in April 2011 led to flooding of the rivers in the Mississippi River basin in May 2011 ( Figures 13.21 and 13.22). This map shows the accumulated rainfall across the U.S. in the days from April 22 to April 29, 2011. Record flow in the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers has to go somewhere. Normal spring river levels are shown in 2010. The flooded region in the image from May 3, 2011 is the New Madrid Floodway, where overflow water is meant to go. 2011 is the first time since 1927 that this floodway was used. Flash floods are sudden and unexpected, taking place when very intense rains fall over a very brief period ( Figure 13.23). A flash flood may do its damage miles from where the rain actually falls if the water travels far down a dry streambed so that the flash flood occurs far from the location of the original storm. Heavily vegetated lands are less likely to experience flooding. Plants slow down water as it runs over the land, giving it time to enter the ground. Even if the ground is too wet to absorb more water, plants still slow the waters passage and increase the time between rainfall and the waters arrival in a stream; this could keep all the water falling over a region to hit the stream at once. Wetlands act as a buffer between land and high water levels and play a key role in minimizing the impacts of floods. Flooding is often more severe in areas that have been recently logged. When a dam breaks along a reservoir, flooding can be catastrophic. High water levels have also caused small dams to break, wreaking havoc downstream. A 2004 flash flood in England devastated two villages when 3-1/2 inches of rain fell in 60 minutes. Pictured here is some of the damage from the flash flood. People try to protect areas that might flood with dams, and dams are usually very effective. People may also line a river bank with levees, high walls that keep the stream within its banks during floods. A levee in one location may just force the high water up or downstream and cause flooding there. The New Madrid Overflow in the Figure 13.22 was created with the recognition that the Mississippi River sometimes simply cannot be contained by levees and must be allowed to flood. 
Effects of  Floods 	  Not all the consequences of flooding are negative. Rivers deposit new nutrient-rich sediments when they flood and so floodplains have traditionally been good for farming. Flooding as a source of nutrients was important to Egyptians along the Nile River until the Aswan Dam was built in the 1960s. Although the dam protects crops and settlements from the annual floods, farmers must now use fertilizers to feed their crops. Floods are also responsible for moving large amounts of sediments about within streams. These sediments provide habitats for animals, and the periodic movement of sediment is crucial to the lives of several types of organisms. Plants and fish along the Colorado River, for example, depend on seasonal flooding to rearrange sand bars. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Streams return water to the oceans. Stream headwaters are at higher elevations where snow melts or where there are springs. Tributaries join together as a river flows to its mouth at lower elevations. A river may eventually form a delta with an estuary where it meets the ocean. Water temporarily resides in ponds and lakes, which are mostly fresh water. Flooding is part of the natural cycle of rivers, enriching floodplains with nutrients, but flooding may destroy crops and settlements. What types of streams have you seen in your area? Why are bodies of water never really permanent? Is it possible that your home could be flooded? What would you do if it were flooded? Define groundwater. Explain the location, use, and importance of aquifers. Define springs.

Introduction 	  Although this may seem surprising, water beneath the ground is commonplace. Usually groundwater travels slowly and silently beneath the surface, but in some locations it bubbles to the surface at springs. The products of erosion and deposition by groundwater were described in the Erosion and Deposition chapter. 
Groundwater 	  Groundwater is the largest reservoir of liquid fresh water on Earth and is found in aquifers, porous rock and sediment with water in between. Water is attracted to the soil particles and capillary action, which describes how water moves through a porous media, moves water from wet soil to dry areas. Aquifers are found at different depths. Some are just below the surface and some are found much deeper below the land surface. A region may have more than one aquifer beneath it and even most deserts are above aquifers. The source region for an aquifer beneath a desert is likely to be far from where the aquifer is located; for example, it may be in a mountain area. The amount of water that is available to enter groundwater in a region is influenced by the local climate, the slope of the land, the type of rock found at the surface, the vegetation cover, land use in the area, and water retention, which is the amount of water that remains in the ground. More water goes into the ground where there is a lot of rain, flat land, porous rock, exposed soil, and where water is not already filling the soil and rock. The residence time of water in a groundwater aquifer can be from minutes to thousands of years. Groundwater is often called fossil water because it has remained in the ground for so long, often since the end of the ice ages. 
Features of an  Aquifer 	  To be a good aquifer, the rock in the aquifer must have good: porosity: small spaces between grains permeability: connections between pores This animation shows porosity and permeability. The water droplets are found in the pores between the sediment grains, which is porosity. When the water can travel between ores, thats permeability. URL v/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/animate/POROS_3.MPG To reach an aquifer, surface water infiltrates downward into the ground through tiny spaces or pores in the rock. The water travels down through the permeable rock until it reaches a layer that does not have pores; this rock is impermeable ( Figure 13.24). This impermeable rock layer forms the base of the aquifer. The upper surface where the groundwater reaches is the water table. Groundwater is found beneath the solid surface. Notice that the water table roughly mirrors the slope of the lands surface. A well penetrates the water table. 
The  Water  Table 	  For a groundwater aquifer to contain the same amount of water, the amount of recharge must equal the amount of discharge. What are the likely sources of recharge? What are the likely sources of discharge? In wet regions, streams are fed by groundwater; the surface of the stream is the top of the water table ( Figure 13.25). In dry regions, water seeps down from the stream into the aquifer. These streams are often dry much of the year. Water leaves a groundwater reservoir in streams or springs. People take water from aquifers, too. What happens to the water table when there is a lot of rainfall? What happens when there is a drought? Although groundwater levels do not rise and fall as rapidly as at the surface, over time the water table will rise during wet periods and fall during droughts. The top of the stream is the top of the water table. The stream feeds the aquifer. One of the most interesting, but extremely atypical types of aquifers is found in Florida. Although aquifers are very rarely underground rivers, in Florida water has dissolved the limestone so that streams travel underground and above ground ( Figure 13.26). In Florida, groundwater is sometimes not underground. 
Groundwater  Use 	  Groundwater is an extremely important water source for people. Groundwater is a renewable resource and its use is sustainable when the water pumped from the aquifer is replenished. It is important for anyone who intends to dig a well to know how deep beneath the surface the water table is. Because groundwater involves interaction between the Earth and the water, the study of groundwater is called hydrogeology. Some aquifers are overused; people pump out more water than is replaced. As the water is pumped out, the water table slowly falls, requiring wells to be dug deeper, which takes more money and energy. Wells may go completely dry if they are not deep enough to reach into the lowered water table. The Ogallala Aquifer supplies about one-third of the irrigation water in the United States ( Figure 13.27). The aquifer is found from 30 to 100 meters deep over about 440,000 square kilometers! The water in the aquifer is mostly from the last ice age. The Ogallala Aquifer is widely used by people for municipal and agricultural needs. The Ogallala Aquifer is found beneath eight states and is heavily used. About eight times more water is taken from the Ogallala Aquifer each year than is replenished. Much of the water is used for irrigation ( Figure 13.28). Lowering the water table may cause the ground surface to sink. Subsidence may occur beneath houses and other structures ( Figure 13.29). Farms in Kansas use central pivot irrigation, which is more efficient since water falls directly on the crops instead of being shot in the air. These fields are between 800 and 1600 meters (0.5 and 1 mile) in diameter. The San Joaquin Valley of California is one of the worlds major agricultural areas. So much groundwater has been pumped that the land has subsided many tens of feet. When coastal aquifers are overused, salt water from the ocean may enter the aquifer, contaminating the aquifer and making it less useful for drinking and irrigation. Salt water incursion is a problem in developed coastal regions, such as on Hawaii. 
Springs 	  Groundwater meets the surface in a stream, as shown above, or a spring ( Figure 13.30). A spring may be constant, or may only flow at certain times of year. Towns in many locations depend on water from springs. Springs can be an extremely important source of water in locations where surface water is scarce ( Figure 13.31). (a) Big Spring in Missouri lets out 12,000 liters of water per second. (b) Other springs are just tiny outlets like this one. In the dry Arizona desert, Oak Creek and many other streams are spring fed. 
Wells 	  A well is created by digging or drilling to reach groundwater. When the water table is close to the surface, wells are a convenient method for extracting water. When the water table is far below the surface, specialized equipment must be used to dig a well. Most wells use motorized pumps to bring water to the surface, but some still require people to use a bucket to draw water up ( Figure 13.32). 
Lesson  Summary 	  Groundwater is the largest reservoir of fresh water. The water table is the top of an aquifer below which is water and above is rock or soil mixed with air. Aquifers are underground areas of sediment or rock that hold groundwater. An aquifer needs good porosity and permeability. Where groundwater intersects the ground surface, a spring can form. People dig or drill wells to access groundwater. An old-fashioned well that uses a bucket drawn up by hand.

S  Earths  Oceans 	  Phytoplankton bloom in spring when sunlight hits the water. The green color is from chlorophyll, the pigment needed for photosynthesis. The blue color is from the reflective plating around coccolithophores, a type of phytoplankton. The Chatham Rise is an underwater plateau that causes deep water to rise, bringing up nutrients. The feature is located where cold Antarctic currents meet warmer, subtropical water. The mixing of water and the nutrients foster large phytoplankton blooms. Phytoplankton are the base of the marine food web and so they are food to nearly all other marine organisms. By using carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, phytoplankton help to reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Introduction 	  As terrestrial creatures, humans think of the importance of the planets land surfaces. But Earth is mostly a water planet. From space, the dominance of water is obvious ( Figure 14.1). Most of Earths water is in the oceans. Because all of Earths oceans are somehow connected, should this chapter be titled Earths Ocean or Earths Oceans? Try to decide by the end of the chapter. An animation will help you see Earths one, three, four, or five oceans: URL n_map.gif . 
Significance of the  Oceans 	  Earth would not be the same planet without its oceans. 
Moderates  Climate 	  The oceans, along with the atmosphere, keep temperatures fairly constant worldwide. While some places on Earth get as cold as -70oC and others as hot as 55oC, the range is only 125oC. On Mercury temperatures go from -180oC to 430oC, a range of 610oC. About 71% of the Earths surface is covered with water, mostly by the oceans. The oceans, along with the atmosphere, distribute heat around the planet. The oceans absorb heat near the equator and then move that solar energy to more polar regions. The oceans also moderate climate within a region. At the same latitude, the temperature range is smaller in lands nearer the oceans than away from the oceans. Summer temperatures are not as hot, and winter temperatures are not as cold, because water takes a long time to heat up or cool down. 
Water  Cycle 	  The oceans are an essential part of Earths water cycle. Since they cover so much of the planet, most evaporation comes from the ocean and most precipitation falls on the oceans. 
Biologically  Rich 	  The oceans are home to an enormous amount of life. That is, they have tremendous biodiversity ( Figure 14.2). Tiny ocean plants create the base of a food web that supports all sorts of life forms. Marine life makes up the majority of all biomass on Earth. ( Biomass is the total mass of living organisms in a given area.) These organisms supply us with food and even the oxygen created by marine plants. 
Continental  Margin 	  Recall from the Plate Tectonics chapter that the ocean floor is not flat: mid-ocean ridges, deep sea trenches, and other features all rise sharply above or plunge deeply below the abyssal plains. In fact, Earths tallest mountain is Mauna Kea volcano, which rises 10,203 m (33,476 ft.)meters) from the Pacific Ocean floor to become one of the A swimming polar bear is a tiny part of the immense biodiversity of the oceans. volcanic mountains of Hawaii. The deepest canyon is also on the ocean floor, the Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench, 10,916 m (35,814 ft). The continental margin is the transition from the land to the deep sea or, geologically speaking, from continental crust to oceanic crust. More than one-quarter of the ocean basin is continental margin. ( Figure 14.3). The continental margin is divided into the continental shelf, continental slope, and continental rise, based on the steepness of the slope. 
Composition of  Ocean  Water 	  Remember from the Minerals chapter that H2O is a polar molecule so it can dissolve many substances ( Figure 14.4). Salts, sugars, acids, bases, and organic molecules can all dissolve in water. Where does the salt in seawater come from? As water moves through rock and soil on land it picks up ions. This is the flip side of weathering. Salts comprise about 3.5% of the mass of ocean water, but the salt content or salinity is different in different locations. What would the salinity be like in an estuary? Where seawater mixes with fresh water, salinity is lower than average. What would the salinity be like where there is lots of evaporation? Where there is lots of evaporation but little circulation of water, salinity can be much higher. The Dead Sea has 30% salinitynearly nine times the average salinity of ocean water ( Figure 14.5). Why do you think this water body is called the Dead Sea? Ocean water is composed of many substances, many of them salts such as sodium, magnesium, and calcium chloride. The Dead Sea has such high salinity that people can easily float in it. Interactive ocean maps can show salinity, temperature, nutrients, and other characteristics: URL du/earthguide/diagrams/levitus/index.html . With so many dissolved substances mixed in seawater, what is the density (mass per volume) of seawater relative to fresh water? Water density increases as: salinity increases temperature decreases pressure increases Differences in water density are responsible for deep ocean currents, as will be discussed in the Ocean Movements lesson. 
The  Water  Column 	  In 1960, two men in a specially designed submarine called the Trieste descended into a submarine trench called the Challenger Deep (10,910 meters) ( Figure 14.6). The average depth of the ocean is 3,790 m, a lot more shallow than the deep trenches but still an incredible depth for sea creatures to live in. What makes it so hard to live at the bottom of the ocean? The three major factors that make the deep ocean hard to inhabit are the absence of light, low temperature, and extremely high pressure. The Trieste made a record dive to the Challenger Deep in 1960. 
Vertical  Divisions 	  To better understand regions of the ocean, scientists define the water column by depth. They divide the entire ocean into two zones vertically, based on light level. Large lakes are divided into similar regions. Sunlight only penetrates the sea surface to a depth of about 200 m, creating the photic zone (photic means light). Organisms that photosynthesize depend on sunlight for food and so are restricted to the photic zone. Since tiny photosynthetic organisms, known as phytoplankton, supply nearly all of the energy and nutrients to the rest of the marine food web, most other marine organisms live in or at least visit the photic zone. In the aphotic zone there is not enough light for photosynthesis. The aphotic zone makes up the majority of the ocean, but has a relatively small amount of its life, both in diversity of type and in numbers. The aphotic zone is subdivided based on depth ( Figure 14.7). 
Horizontal  Divisions 	  The seabed is divided into the zones described above, but ocean itself is also divided horizontally by distance from the shore. Nearest to the shore lies the intertidal (littoral) zone, the region between the high and low tidal marks. This hallmark of the intertidal is change: water is in constant motions in waves, tides, and currents. The land is sometimes under water and sometimes is exposed. The neritic zone is from low tide mark and slopes gradually downward to the edge of the seaward side of the continental shelf. Some sunlight penetrates to the seabed here. The oceanic zone is the entire rest of the ocean from the bottom edge of the neritic zone, where sunlight does not reach the bottom. The sea bed and water column are subdivided further, as seen in the 14.7). Oceanographers divide the ocean into zones both vertically and horizontally. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The oceans help to moderate Earths temperatures. The main elements in seawater are chlorine, sodium, magnesium, sulfate, and calcium. The average salinity of the oceans is about 3.5%. In seawater, if evaporation is high, salinity is high. If fresh water mixes in, salinity is low. In the photic zone there is enough available light for photosynthesis. The vast majority of the ocean lies in the aphotic zone, where there is not enough light for photosynthesis. The ocean floor averages about 3,790 m but ocean trenches are as deep as 10,910 m. The neritic zones are nearshore areas, including the intertidal zone. The oceanic zones are offshore regions of the ocean. How do water motions such as tides and waves affect living creatures in and near the sea? Is it possible to have a river in the middle of the ocean? What factors affect the movement of ocean water? How do these factors affect the worlds climate and the oceans ecosystem? Define waves and explain their formation. Describe what causes tides. Describe how surface currents form and how they affect the worlds climate. Describe the causes of deep currents. Relate upwelling areas to the food chain.

Introduction 	  Ocean water is constantly in motion: north-south, east-west, alongshore, and vertically. Seawater motions are the result of waves, tides, and currents ( Figure 14.8). Ocean movements are the consequence of many separate factors: wind, tides, Coriolis effect, water density differences, and the shape of the ocean basins. Water movements and their causes will be discussed in this lesson. Ocean waves transfer energy through the water over great distances. 
Waves 	  Waves have been discussed in previous chapters in several contexts: seismic waves traveling through the planet, sound waves traveling through seawater, and ocean waves eroding beaches. Waves transfer energy and the size of a wave and the distance it travels depends on the amount of energy that it carries. 
Wind  Waves 	  This lesson studies the most familiar waves, those on the oceans surface. Ocean waves originate from wind blowing steady winds or high storm winds over the water. Sometimes these winds are far from where the ocean waves are seen. What factors create the largest ocean waves? 
The largest wind waves form when the wind 	  is very strong blows steadily for a long time blows over a long distance The wind could be strong, but if it gusts for just a short time, large waves wont form. Wind blowing across the water transfers energy to that water. The energy first creates tiny ripples that create an uneven surface for the wind to catch so that it may create larger waves. These waves travel across the ocean out of the area where the wind is blowing. Remember that a wave is a transfer of energy. Do you think the same molecules of water that starts out in a wave in the middle of the ocean later arrive at the shore? Water molecules in waves make circles or ellipses ( Figure 14.9). Energy transfers between molecules but the molecules themselves mostly bob up and down in place. In this animation, a water bottle bobs in place like a water molecule: URL aves1.htm An animation of motion in wind waves from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography: URL arthguide/diagrams/waves/swf/wave_wind.html The circles show the motion of a water molecule in a wind wave. Wave energy is greatest at the surface and decreases with depth. A shows that a water molecule travels in a circular motion in deep water. B shows that molecules in shallow water travel in an elliptical path because of the ocean bottom. An animation of a deep water wave is seen here: URL . An animation of a shallow water wave is seen here: URL e.gif . When does a wave break? Do waves only break when they reach shore? Waves break when they become too tall to be supported by their base. This can happen at sea but happens predictably as a wave moves up a shore. The energy at the bottom of the wave is lost by friction with the ground so that the bottom of the wave slows down but the top of the wave continues at the same speed. The crest falls over and crashes down. Some of the damage done by storms is from storm surge. Water piles up at a shoreline as storm winds push waves into the coast. Storm surge may raise sea level as much as 7.5 m (25 ft), which can be devastating in a shallow land area when winds, waves, and rain are intense. A wild video of Storm Surge can be seen on National Geographic Videos, Environment Video, Natural Disasters, Landslides, and more: URL 
D:  Science of  Big  Waves 	  Maverick waves are massive. Learning how they are generated can tell scientists a great deal about how the ocean creates waves and especially large waves. Learn more at: URL s . 
Tsunami 	  Tsunami are described in the Earthquakes chapter as damaging waves that result from the sharp jolt to the water from an undersea earthquake. Landslides, meteorite impacts, or any other jolt to ocean water may form a tsunami ( Figure 14.10). Tsunami can travel at speeds of 800 kilometers per hour (500 miles per hour). Tsunami have small wave heights and long wavelengths so they are usually unnoticed at sea. As the wave rides up the continental shelf the wave height increases. 
A video explanation of tsunami is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v= Stdq Goez Nr 	  The wave speed of a tsunami is also slowed by friction with the shallower ocean floor, which causes the wavelength to decrease, creating a much taller wave. Many people caught in a tsunami have no warning of its approach. Since the wavelength is long, a long time can pass between crests or troughs onshore. In 1755 in Lisbon, an offshore earthquake caused a great deal of damage on land. People rushed to the open space of the shore and discovered that the water was flowing seaward fast. The trough of the tsunami wave reached shore first. People who went out onto the open beach were drowned when the crest of the wave reached shore.

The west coast is vulnerable to tsunami since it sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire. Scientists are trying to learn everything they can about predicting tsunamis before a massive one strikes a little closer to home. Learn more at: URL . 
Tides 	  Tides are the daily rise and fall of sea level at any given place. The pull of the Moons gravity on Earth is the primarily cause of tides and the pull of the Suns gravity on Earth is the secondary cause ( Figure 14.11). The Moon has a greater effect because, although it is much smaller than the Sun, it is much closer. The Moons pull is about twice that of the Suns. High tide (left) and low tide (right) at Bay of Fundy on the Gulf of Maine. The Bay of Fundy has the greatest tidal ranges on Earth at 38.4 feet. 
Daily  Tide  Patterns 	  To understand the tides it is easiest to start with the effect of the Moon on Earth. As the Moon revolves around our planet, its gravity pulls Earth toward it. The lithosphere is unable to move much but the water is pulled by the gravity and a bulge is created. This bulge is the high tide beneath the Moon. The Moons gravity then pulls the Earth toward it, leaving the water on the opposite side of the planet behind. This creates a second high tide bulge on the opposite side of Earth from the Moon. These two water bulges on opposite sides of the Earth aligned with the Moon are the high tides. Since so much water is pulled into the two high tides, low tides form between the two high tides ( Figure 14.12). As the Earth rotates beneath the Moon, a single spot will experience two high tides and two low tides every day. A detailed animation of lunar tides is shown here: URL . The tidal range is the difference between the ocean level at high tide and the ocean at low tide ( Figure 14.13). The tidal range in a location depends on a number of factors, including the slope of the seafloor. Water appears to move a greater distance on a gentle slope than on a steep slope. 
Monthly  Tide  Patterns 	  If you look at the diagram of high and low tides in the Figure 14.12, youll see that tides are waves. So when the Sun and Moon are aligned, what do you expect the tides to look like? The gravitational attraction of the Moon to ocean water creates the high and low tides. The tidal range is the difference between the ocean level at high tide and low tide. Waves are additive so when the gravitational pull of both bodies is in the same direction the high tides add and the low tides add ( Figure 14.14). Highs are higher and lows are lower than at other times through the month. These more extreme tides, with a greater tidal range, are called spring tides. Spring tides dont just occur in the spring; they occur whenever the Moon is in a new-moon or full-moon phase, about every 14 days. Here is a link to see these tides in motion: URL . Neap tides are tides that have the smallest tidal range, and they occur when the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun form a 90o angle ( Figure 14.15). They occur exactly halfway between the spring tides, when the Moon is at first or last quarter. How do the tides add up to create neap tides? The Moons high tide occurs in the same place as the Suns low tide and the Moons low tide in the same place as the Suns high tide. At neap tides, the tidal range relatively small. A simple animation of spring and neap tides is found here: URL supp_tide06a.html . High tides occur about twice a day, about every 12 hours and 25 minutes. The reason is that the Moon takes 24 hours and 50 minutes to rotate once around the Earth so the Moon is over the same location 24 hours and 50 minutes later. Since high tides occur twice a day, one arrives each 12 hours and 25 minutes. What is the time between a high tide and the next low tide? This animation shows the effect of the Moon and Sun on the tides: URL ides1.htm . Spring tides occur when the tidal bulges from the Moon and Sun are aligned. The Moon is full in this image; in the bottom image the Moon would appear as a new Moon. Some coastal areas do not follow this pattern at all. These coastal areas may have one high and one low tide per day or a different amount of time between two high tides. These differences are often because of local conditions, such as the shape of the coastline that the tide is entering. 
Surface  Currents 	  Ocean water moves in predictable ways along the ocean surface. Surface currents can flow for thousands of kilometers and can reach depths of hundreds of meters. These surface currents do not depend on weather; they remain unchanged even in large storms because they depend on factors that do not change. Surface currents are created by three things: global wind patterns the rotation of the Earth the shape of the ocean basins Surface currents are extremely important because they distribute heat around the planet and are a major factor influencing climate around the globe. 
Neap tides occur when the  Earth, the 	  Sun, and the Moon form a right angle; the Moon is in its first or third quarter. 
Global  Wind  Patterns 	  Winds on Earth are either global or local. Global winds blow in the same directions all the time and are related to the unequal heating of Earth by the Sun  that is, more solar radiation strikes the equator than the polar regions  and the rotation of the Earth  that is, the Coriolis effect. The causes of the global wind patterns will be described in detail in the Earths Atmosphere chapter. Water in the surface currents is pushed in the direction of the major wind belts: trade winds: east to west between the equator and 30oN and 30oS westerlies: west to east in the middle latitudes polar easterlies: east to west between 50o and 60o north and south of the equator and the north and south pole 
Earths  Rotation 	  Wind is not the only factor that affects ocean currents. The Coriolis effect describes how Earths rotation steers winds and surface ocean currents ( Figure 14.16). Coriolis causes freely moving objects to appear to move to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The objects themselves are actually moving straight, but the Earth is rotating beneath them, so they seem to bend or curve. An example might make the Coriolis effect easier to visualize. If an airplane flies 500 miles due north, it will not arrive at the city that was due north of it when it began its journey. Over the time it takes for the airplane to fly 500 miles, that city moved, along with the Earth it sits on. The airplane will therefore arrive at a city to the west of the original city (in the Northern Hemisphere), unless the pilot has compensated for the change. So to reach his intended destination, the pilot must also veer right while flying north. As wind or an ocean current moves, the Earth spins underneath it. As a result, an object moving north or south along the Earth will appear to move in a curve, instead of in a straight line. Wind or water that travels toward the poles from the equator is deflected to the east, while wind or water that travels toward the equator from the poles gets bent to the west. The Coriolis effect bends the direction of surface currents to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere. The Coriolis effect causes winds and currents to form circular patterns. The direction that they spin depends on the hemisphere that they are in. Coriolis effect is demonstrated using a metal ball and a rotating plate in this video. The ball moves in a circular path just like a freely moving particle of gas or liquid moves on the rotating Earth (5b): URL ?v=Wda7azMvabE (2:04). 
Shape of the  Ocean  Basins 	  When a surface current collides with land, the current must change direction. In the Figure 14.17, the Atlantic South Equatorial Current travels westward along the equator until it reaches South America. At Brazil, some of it goes north and some goes south. Because of Coriolis effect, the water goes right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere. The major surface ocean currents. You can see on the map of the major surface ocean currents that the surface ocean currents create loops called gyres ( Figure 14.18). The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is unique because it travels uninhibited around the globe. Why is it the only current to go all the way around? The ocean gyres. Why do the Northern Hemisphere gyres rotate clockwise and the Southern Hemisphere gyres rotate counterclockwise? This video shows the surface ocean currents set by global wind belts (5a): URL u_Ga0JYFNg (1:20). 
Local  Surface  Currents 	  The surface currents described above are all large and unchanging. Local surface currents are also found along shorelines ( Figure 14.19). Two are longshore currents and rip currents. Longshore currents move water and sediment parallel to the shore in the direction of the prevailing local winds. Rip currents are potentially dangerous currents that carry large amounts of water offshore quickly. Look at the ripcurrent animation to determine what to do if you are caught in a rip current: URL motion/currents2.htm . Each summer in the United States at least a few people die when they are caught in rip currents. This animation shows the surface currents in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean off of the southeastern United States: URL . 
Effect on  Global  Climate 	  Surface currents play an enormous role in Earths climate. Even though the equator and poles have very different climates, these regions would have more extremely different climates if ocean currents did not transfer heat from the equatorial regions to the higher latitudes. The Gulf Stream is a river of warm water in the Atlantic Ocean, about 160 kilometers wide and about a kilometer deep. Water that enters the Gulf Stream is heated as it travels along the equator. The warm water then flows up the east coast of North America and across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe ( Figure 14.20). The energy the Gulf Stream transfers is enormous: more than 100 times the worlds energy demand. The Gulf Streams warm waters raise temperatures in the North Sea, which raises the air temperatures over land between 3 to 6oC (5 to 11oF). London, U.K., for example, is at the same latitude as Quebec, Canada. However, Londons average January temperature is 3.8oC (38oF), while Quebecs is only -12oC (10oF). Because air traveling over the warm water in the Gulf Stream picks up a lot of water, London gets a lot of rain. In contrast, Quebec is much drier and receives its precipitation as snow. In a satellite image of water temperature in the western Atlantic it is easy to pick out the Gulf Stream, which brings warmer waters from the equator up eastern North America. 
Deep  Currents 	  Thermohaline circulation drives deep ocean circulation. Thermo means heat and haline refers to salinity. Differences in temperature and in salinity change the density of seawater. So thermohaline circulation is the result of density differences in water masses because of their different temperature and salinity. What is the temperature and salinity of very dense water? Lower temperature and higher salinity yield the densest water. When a volume of water is cooled, the molecules move less vigorously so same number of molecules takes up less space and the water is denser. If salt is added to a volume of water, there are more molecules in the same volume so the water is denser. Changes in temperature and salinity of seawater take place at the surface. Water becomes dense near the poles. Cold polar air cools the water and lowers its temperature, increasing its salinity. Fresh water freezes out of seawater to become sea ice, which also increases the salinity of the remaining water. This very cold, very saline water is very dense and sinks. This sinking is called downwelling. This video lecture discusses the vertical distribution of life in the oceans. Seawater density creates currents, which provide different habitats for different creatures (5d): URL (6:12). Two things then happen. The dense water pushes deeper water out of its way and that water moves along the bottom of the ocean. This deep water mixes with less dense water as it flows. Surface currents move water into the space vacated at the surface where the dense water sank ( Figure 14.21). Water also sinks into the deep ocean off of Antarctica. Cold water (blue lines) sinks in the North Atlantic, flows along the bottom of the ocean and upwells in the Pacific or Indian. The water then travels in surface currents (red lines) back to the North Atlantic. Deep water also forms off of Antarctica. Since unlimited amounts of water cannot sink to the bottom of the ocean, water must rise from the deep ocean to the surface somewhere. This process is called upwelling ( Figure 14.22). Upwelling forces denser water from below to take the place of less dense water at the surface that is pushed away by the wind. Generally, upwelling occurs along the coast when wind blows water strongly away from the shore. This leaves a void that is filled by deep water that rises to the surface. Upwelling is extremely important where it occurs. During its time on the bottom, the cold deep water has collected nutrients that have fallen down through the water column. Upwelling brings those nutrients to the surface. Those nutrient support the growth of plankton and form the base of a rich ecosystem. California, South America, South Africa, and the Arabian Sea all benefit from offshore upwelling. An animation of upwelling is seen here: URL . Upwelling also takes place along the equator between the North and South Equatorial Currents. Winds blow the surface water north and south of the equator so deep water undergoes upwelling. The nutrients rise to the surface and support a great deal of life in the equatorial oceans. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Ocean waves are energy traveling through the water. Most ocean waves are generated by wind. Tsunami are exceptionally long wavelength waves usually caused by earthquakes. Tides are produced by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun. Spring tides have large tidal ranges and occur at full and new moons, when Earth, Moon, and Sun are all aligned. Neap tides have low tidal ranges and occur at first and last quarter moons, when the Moon is at right angles to the Sun. Ocean surface currents are produced by global winds, the Coriolis effect and the shape of each ocean basin. The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have a circular pattern of surface currents called gyres that circle clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern. The Indian Ocean only has a counterclockwise gyre. Surface ocean circulation brings warm equatorial waters towards the poles and cooler polar water towards the equator. Thermohaline circulation drives deep ocean currents. Upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters creates biologically rich areas where surface waters are blown away from a shore, or where equatorial waters are blow outward.

Tide  Generating  Force 	  In this exercise you will use an equation to calculate the tide generating force. Like the force of gravity, the pull of the tide generating force is directly related to the masses of the astronomical objects involved and inversely related to the square of the distance between them. Tides are caused by both the gravitational pull of the Moon and the gravitational pull of the Sun on surface water. Unlike the gravitational force, the tide generating force varies with the distance between the Moon (or the Sun) and the Earth cubed. The equation for the tide generating force is: T = G (m1 . m2 / d3 ) where T is the tide generating force, G is the universal gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the mass of the Earth and the mass of the Moon (or the mass of the Earth and the mass of the Sun), and d is the distance between them. If we plug in values for the gravitational constant, the mass of the Earth and the mass of the Moon, we can calculate the tide generating force when the Moon is at apogee (farthest from the Earth in its orbit). Use G = 6.673 x 10 -11 m 3 / kg . s 2; m 1 = 7.35 x 10 22 kg for the mass of the Moon, m 2 = 5.974 x 10 24 kg for the mass of the Earth; and d = 405,500 km for the distance from the Earth to the Moon at apogee. You could use all the same values but substitute in d = 363,300 km for the distance from the Earth to the Moon when the Moon is at perigee (point when the Moon is closest to the Earth) and compare the tide generating force each distance. 
Tsunami  Tag 	  Could you outrun a tsunami? How fast would you have to run? You can calculate how fast a tsunami travels in the ocean using the equation for the speed of a shallow water wave, which is: V = the square root of g x d, where V = wave speed (velocity), g = the acceleration of gravity: 9.8 meters / s 2, and d = the depth of the water. If you use d = 3,940m (the average depth of the Pacific Ocean), how fast does a tsunami travel? Do you think you could outrun this wave?

Introduction 	  Oceanographers like to say that we know more about the dark side of the Moon than we do about the oceans. That statement is doubly true of the seafloor. Although modern technology has allowed us to learn more about the seafloor, vast regions remain unexplored. 
Studying the  Seafloor 	  Scuba divers can only dive to about 40 meters and they cannot stay down there for very long. Although this is good for researching the organisms and ecosystems very near a coast, most oceanic research requires accessing greater depths. 
Mapping 	  In the Plate Tectonics chapter you learned that echo sounders designed to locate enemy submarines allowed scientists to create bathymetric maps of the seafloor ( Figure 14.23). Prior to this advance, explorers mapped a small amount of the seafloor by painstakingly dropping a line over the side of a ship to measure the depth at one tiny spot at a time. 
D:  Sea 3- D:  Charting the  Ocean  Floor 	  Using sound and laser technology, researchers have begun to reveal the secrets of the ocean floor from the Sonoma Coast to Monterey Bay. By creating complex 3-D maps, theyre hoping to learn more about waves and achieve Map of San Francisco Bay, oblique view. ambitious conservation goals. Learn more at: URL . 
Sampling  Remotely 	  Samples of seawater from different depths in the water column are needed to understand ocean chemistry. To do this bottles are placed along a cable at regular depths and closed as a weight is dropped down the cable. The water trapped in the bottle can be analyzed later in a laboratory ( Figure 14.24). Scientists are also interested in collecting rock and sediment samples from the seafloor. A dredge is a giant rectangular bucket that is dragged along behind a ship to collect loose rocks. Gravity corers are metal tubes that fall to the seafloor and slice into the sediments to collect a sample. The research vessel, the Joides Resolution, drills deep into the seafloor to collect samples of the sediment and ocean crust. Scientists analyze the samples for chemistry and paleomagnetism. Videos of the drill bit and core samples taken by the Joides Resolution are seen here: URL atch?v=4c9HlHBCSCY ; URL ; URL 0VeS0TxCvU . 
Submersibles 	  Samples of seawater and rocks can be collected directly by scientists in a submersible. These subs can take scientists down to make observations and the subs have arms for collecting samples. The submersible Alvin is an HOV, a A Niskin bottle being deployed off the side of a research ship. human operated vehicle. Alvin can dive up to 4,500 m beneath the ocean surface and has made more than 4000 dives since 1964 ( Figure 14.25). Other submersibles can dive deeper. View a slide show of DSV Alvin and its history from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution: URL edu/page.do?pid=8422&tid=201&cid=14616&ct=362# . 
Remotely  Operated  Vehicles 	  To avoid the expense, dangers, and limitations of human missions under the sea, remotely operated vehicles or ROVs, allow scientists to study the oceans depths by using small vehicles carrying cameras and scientific instruments. ROVs were used to study the Titanic, which would have been far too dangerous for a manned sub to enter. Scientists control ROVs electronically with sophisticated operating systems ( Figure 14.26). Footage of the NOAA Titanic Expedition of 2004 is visible in this video: URL EnwKOQ . A video of the ROV Nereus from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is shown here: URL om/watch?v=wwdF_2wMRfU . Alvin allows two people and a pilot to make a nine hour dive. Remotely operated vehicles such as this one allow scientists to study the seafloor. 
Ocean  Resources 	  The ocean provides important living and non-living resources. To be maintained for future use, these resources must be managed sustainably. 
Living  Resources 	  Most fish are caught by lines or nets as they swim in the open waters of the ocean. Some species of fish are being overharvested, which means their rate of reproduction cannot keep up with the rate at which people consume them. Bottom trawling is a method of fishing that involves towing a weighted net across the seafloor to harvest fish. In many areas where bottom trawling is done, ecosystems are severely disturbed by the large nets. For this reason, in a few areas in the world, laws limit bottom trawling to waters not more than 1,000 m deep or waters far from protected and sensitive areas. Still these actions protect some of the seafloor. Besides food, ocean organisms have other uses. Some provide us with medications. 
Non-living  Resources 	  Oil and natural gas are the most valuable non-living resources taken from the ocean. Extracting these resources requires drilling into the seafloor. Oil platforms have dozens of oil wells that are drilled in places where the ocean is sometimes 2,000 m deep ( Figure 14.27). A description of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill affecting the Gulf of Mexico is located in the Human Actions and Earths Waters chapter. The seafloor has some valuable minerals. Manganese nodules containing manganese, iron, copper, nickel, phosphate, and cobalt ( Figure 14.28) may be as small as a pea or as large as a basketball. Estimates are that there may be as much as 500 billion tons of nodules on the seafloor. The minerals in manganese nodules have many uses in the industrial world, but currently they are not being mined. Think back to the discussion of ore deposits in the Earths Minerals chapter. Why do you think these seafloor resources are not being mined? 
Lesson  Summary 	  Scuba divers can only explore near the surface so most oceanographic research is done from satellites, ships, and submersibles. The oceans are divided into zones by water depth, distance from shore, and the slope of the seafloor. The oceans provide us with both living and non-living resources. Living oceanic resources include fish and invertebrates used for food. The most valuable non-living resources from the oceans are oil and natural gas. Manganese nodules from the seafloor are often rich in metals such as manganese, iron, nickel, copper, and cobalt.

Introduction 	  Oceans are a harsh placed to live. In the intertidal zone, conditions change rapidly as water covers and uncovers the region and waves pound on the rocks. Most of the environments at sea are cold and at just about any depth below the surface the pressure is very high. Beyond the photic zone, the ocean is entirely black. Organisms have adapted to these conditions in many interesting and effective ways. The size and variety of different habitats means that the oceans are home to a large portion of all life on Earth. 
Types of  Ocean  Organisms 	  The smallest and largest animals on Earth live in the oceans. Why do you think the oceans can support large animals? Marine animals breathe air or extract oxygen from the water. Some float on the surface and others dive into the oceans depths. There are animals that eat other animals, and plants generate food from sunlight. A few bizarre creatures break down chemicals to make food! The following section divides ocean life into seven basic groups. 
Plankton 	  Plankton are organisms that cannot swim but that float along with the current. The word "plankton" comes from the Greek for wanderer. Most plankton are microscopic, but some are visible to the naked eye ( Figure 14.29). Phytoplankton are tiny plants that make food by photosynthesis. Because they need sunlight, phytoplankton live in the photic zone. Phytoplankton are responsible for about half of the total primary productivity (food energy) on Earth. Like other plants, phytoplankton release oxygen as a waste product. A video of a research vessel sampling plankton is seen here: URL . Zooplankton, or animal plankton, eat phytoplankton as their source of food ( Figure 14.30). Some zooplankton live as plankton all their lives and others are juvenile forms of animals that will attach to the bottom as adults. Some small invertebrates live as zooplankton. Copepods are abundant and so are an important food source for larger animals. 
Plants and  Algae 	  The few true plants found in the oceans include salt marsh grasses and mangrove trees. Although they are not true plants, large algae, which are called seaweed, also use photosynthesis to make food. Plants and seaweeds are found in the neritic zone where the light they need penetrates so that they can photosynthesize ( Figure 14.31). Kelp grow in forests in the neritic zone. Otters and other organisms depend on the kelp-forest ecosystem. 
Marine  Invertebrates 	  The variety and number of invertebrates, animals without a backbone, is truly remarkable ( Figure 14.32). Marine invertebrates include sea slugs, sea anemones, starfish, octopi, clams, sponges, sea worms, crabs, and lobsters. Most of these animals are found close to the shore, but they can be found throughout the ocean. 
D:  Amazing  Jellies 	  Jellies are otherworldly creatures that glow in the dark, without brains or bones, some more than 100 feet long. Along with many other ocean areas, they live just off Californias coast. Learn more at: URL t/video/amazing-jellies/ . (a) Mussels; (b) Crown of thorns sea star; (c) Moon jelly; (d) A squid. 
Fish 	  Fish are vertebrates; they have a backbone. What are some of the features fish have that allows them to live in the oceans? All fish have most or all of these traits. Fins with which to move and steer. Scales for protection. Gills for extracting oxygen from the water. A swim bladder that lets them rise and sink to different depths. Ectothermy (cold-bloodedness) so that their bodies are the same temperature as the surrounding water. Bioluminescence: light created from a chemical reaction that can attract prey or mates in the dark ocean. Included among the fish are sardines, salmon, and eels, as well as the sharks and rays (which lack swim bladders) ( Figure 14.33). 
Reptiles 	  Only a few types of reptiles live in the oceans and they live in warm water. Why are reptiles so restricted in their ability to live in the sea? Sea turtles, sea snakes, saltwater crocodiles, and marine iguana that are found only at the Galapagos Islands sum up the marine reptile groups ( Figure 14.34). Sea snakes bear live young in the ocean, but turtles, crocodiles, and marine iguanas all lay their eggs on land. The Great White Shark is a fish that preys on other fish and marine mammals. Sea turtles are found all over the oceans, but their numbers are diminishing. 
Seabirds 	  Many types of birds are adapted to living in the sea or on the shore. A few are shown: ( Figure 14.35). 
Marine  Mammals 	  What are the common traits of mammals? Mammals are endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates that give birth to live young; feed them with milk; and have hair, ears, and a jaw bone with teeth. What traits might mammals have to be adapted to life in the ocean? For swimming: streamlined bodies, slippery skin or hair, fins. For warmth: Fur, fat, high metabolic rate, small surface area to volume, specialized blood system. (a) With their long legs for wading and long bills for digging in sand for food, shorebirds are well adapted for the intertidal. (b) Many seabirds live on land but go to sea to fish, such as gulls, pelicans, and this frigate bird. (c) Albatross spend months at sea and only come on shore to raise chicks. For salinity: kidneys that excrete salt, impervious skin. The five types of marine mammals are pictured here: ( Figure 14.36). (a) Cetaceans: whales, dolphins, and porpoises. (b) Sirenians: manatee and the dugong. (c) Mustelids: Sea otters (terrestrial members are skunks, badgers and weasels). (d) Pinnipeds: Seals, sea lions, and walruses. (e) Polar bear.

Interactions  Among  Ocean  Organisms 	  The previous section briefly discussed the adaptations different types of organisms have to live in the ocean. A look at a few of the different habitats organisms live in can focus even more on these important adaptations. 
The  Intertidal 	  A great abundance of life is found in the intertidal zone ( Figure 14.37). High energy waves pound the organisms that live in this zone and so they must be adapted to pounding waves and exposure to air during low tides. Hard shells protect from pounding waves and also protect against drying out when the animal is above water. Strong attachments keep the animals anchored to the rock. In a tide pool, as in the photo, what organisms are found where and what specific adaptations do they have to that zone? The mussels on the top left have hard shells for protection and to prevent drying because they are often not covered by water. The sea anemones in the lower right are more often submerged and have strong attachments but can close during low tides. Many young organisms get their start in estuaries and so they must be adapted to rapid shifts in salinity. 
Reefs 	  Corals and other animals deposit calcium carbonate to create rock reefs near the shore. Coral reefs are the rainforests of the oceans with a tremendous amount of species diversity ( Figure 14.38). Reefs can form interesting shapes in the oceans. Remember that hot spots create volcanoes on the seafloor. If these volcanoes rise above sea level to become islands, and if they occur in tropical waters, coral reefs will form on them. Since the volcanoes are cones, the reef forms in a circle around the volcano. As the volcano comes off the hot spot, the crust cools. The volcano subsides and then begins to erode away ( Figure 14.39). In this image of Maupiti Island in the South Pacific, the remnants of the volcano are surrounded by the circular reef. Eventually, all that is left is a reef island called an atoll. A lagoon is found inside the reef ( Figure 14.40). The Tuamotos are coral atolls that rest on volcanoes that are not beneath sea level. Coral reef are near shore and so are subject to pollution from land. The coral animals are very sensitive to temperature and reefs around the world are stressed from rising ocean temperatures. Some videos about threats to coral reefs are found at: National Geographic Videos, Environment Video, Threats to Animals, URL . 
Oceanic  Zone 	  The open ocean is a vast area. Food either washes down from the land or is created by photosynthesizing plankton. Zooplankton and larger animals feed on the phytoplankton and on each other. Larger animals such as whales and giant groupers may live their entire lives in the open water. How do fish survive in the deepest ocean? The few species that live in the greatest depths are very specialized ( Figure 14.41). Since its rare to find a meal, the fish use very little energy; they move very little, breathe slowly, have minimal bone structure and a slow metabolism. These fish are very small. To maximize the chance of getting a meal, some species may have jaws that unhinge to accept a larger fish or backward-folding teeth to keep prey from escaping.

How we can know what lives in the ocean is in Deep-Sea Robo Help Some of the results of the Census of Marine Life have been released and are discussed in Record-Breaking Sea-Creature Surveys Released Bioluminescence is common in the oceans and seen in Why Deep Sea Creatures Glow 
Hydrothermal  Vents 	  At mid-ocean ridges at hydrothermal vents, bacteria that use chemosynthesis for food energy are the base of a unique ecosystem ( Figure 14.42). This ecosystem is entirely separate from the photosynthesis at the surface. Shrimp, clams, fish, and giant tube worms have been found in these extreme places. A video explaining hydrothermal vents with good footage is seen here: URL RKoaUM . Giant tube worms found at hydrothermal vents get food from the chemosynthetic bacteria that live within them. The bacteria provide food; the worms provide shelter. 
Lesson  Summaries 	  The oceans have a tremendous diversity of life: bacteria, plankton, invertebrates, and vertebrates, which include fish, reptiles, seabirds, and mammals. Photosynthesis and chemosynthesis create food energy in two very different ways. Plankton are tiny freely floating plants (phytoplankton) or animals (zooplankton). All marine organisms must be specialized for the harsh conditions of the ocean environment in which they live. How does the ocean interact with the atmosphere? How is energy transferred around the planet and how does this affect life on Earth? What would be the effect of pollution on the oceans? -23.jpg .

Chapter  Outline 	  Astronauts took this photo of the Moon barely visible above Earths atmosphere. Earths blue halo appears because the atmosphere scatters blue light more than other wavelengths. At the top of the atmosphere, gases become so thin that they just cease to exist and then there is nothing but empty space. Since there is no easy way to define the top of the atmosphere, scientists say that it is 100 km above Earths surface. At that location, solar energy enters the Earth system mostly as visible light. Energy as reflected light and heat leave the Earth system there. If average global temperature remains the same, the incoming and outgoing energy are equal. If more energy is coming in than going out, global temperatures increase. If more energy is going out than coming in, global temperatures decrease. Increases or decreases in greenhouse gases can change this energy balance. Clouds appear in Earths atmosphere where there is water vapor. Clouds, along with snow and ice, reflect sunlight and play an important role in global climate. Where clouds reflect light back into space, they reduce the energy in the atmosphere. But water vapor is a greenhouse gas, so clouds can also trap heat. Scientists are interested in the effects of clouds on Earths heat balance.

Introduction 	  Earths atmosphere is a thin blanket of gases and tiny particles together called air. We are most aware of air when it moves and creates wind. All living things need some of the gases in air for life support. Without an atmosphere, Earth would likely be just another lifeless rock. 
Significance of the  Atmosphere 	  Earths atmosphere, along with the abundant liquid water at Earths surface, are the keys to our planets unique place in the solar system. Much of what makes Earth exceptional depends on the atmosphere. Lets consider some of the reasons we are lucky to have an atmosphere. 
Atmospheric  Gases  Are  Indispensable for  Life on  Earth 	  Without the atmosphere, Earth would look a lot more like the Moon. Atmospheric gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2), are extremely important for living organisms. How does the atmosphere make life possible? How does life alter the atmosphere? In photosynthesis plants use CO2 and create O2. Photosynthesis is responsible for nearly all of the oxygen currently found in the atmosphere. The chemical reaction for photosynthesis is: By creating oxygen and food, plants have made an environment that is favorable for animals. In respiration, animals use oxygen to convert sugar into food energy they can use. Plants also go through respiration and consume some of the sugars they produce. The chemical reaction for respiration is: 
C6 H12 O6 + 6 O2 ? 6 O2 + 6 H2 O + useable energy 	  How is respiration similar to and different from photosynthesis? They are approximately the reverse of each other. In photosynthesis, CO2 is converted to O2 and in respiration, O2 is converted to CO2 ( Figure 15.1). Chlorophyll indicates the presence of photosynthesizing plants as does the vegetation index. 
The  Atmosphere is a  Crucial  Part of the  Water  Cycle 	  As part of the hydrologic cycle, which was detailed in the Earths Fresh Water chapter, water spends a lot of time in the atmosphere, mostly as water vapor. All weather takes place in the atmosphere, virtually all of it in the lower atmosphere. Weather describes what the atmosphere is like at a specific time and place, and may include temperature, wind, and precipitation. Weather is the change we experience from day to day. Climate is the long-term average of weather in a particular spot. Although the weather for a particular winter day in Tucson, Arizona, may include snow, the climate of Tucson is generally warm and dry. 
Ozone in the  Upper  Atmosphere  Makes  Life on  Earth  Possible 	  Ozone is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms, (O3). Ozone in the upper atmosphere absorbs high-energy ultraviolet (UV) radiation coming from the Sun. This protects living things on Earths surface from the Suns most harmful rays. Without ozone for protection, only the simplest life forms would be able to live on Earth. 
The  Atmosphere  Keeps  Earths  Temperature  Moderate 	  Along with the oceans, the atmosphere keeps Earths temperatures within an acceptable range. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere so they help to moderate global temperatures ( Figure 15.2). Without an atmosphere with greenhouse gases, Earths temperatures would be frigid at night and scorching during the day. Important greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone. Fires, such as these set to burn forests across southeast Asia, contribute greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. 
Atmospheric  Gases  Provide the  Substance for  Waves to  Travel  Through 	  The atmosphere is made of gases that take up space and transmit energy. Sound waves are among the types of energy that travel though the atmosphere. Without an atmosphere, we could not hear a single sound. Earth would be as silent as outer space. Of course, no insect, bird, or airplane would be able to fly because there would be no atmosphere to hold it up. Explosions in movies about space should be silent. 
Composition of  Air 	  Nitrogen and oxygen together make up 99% of the planets atmosphere. The rest of the gases are minor components but sometimes are very important ( Figure 15.3). Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. Humidity varies from place to place and season to season. This fact is obvious if you compare a summer day in Atlanta, Georgia, where humidity is high, with a winter day in Phoenix, Arizona, where humidity is low. When the air is very humid, it feels heavy or sticky. Dry air usually feels more comfortable. Where around the globe is mean atmospheric water vapor higher and where is it lower and why ( Figure 15.4)? Higher humidity is found around the equatorial regions because air temperatures are higher and warm air can hold more moisture than cooler air. Of course, humidity is lower near the polar regions because air temperature is lower. Mean winter atmospheric water vapor in the Northern Hemisphere when temperature and humidity are lower than they would be in summer. Some of what is in the atmosphere is not gas. Particles of dust, soil, fecal matter, metals, salt, smoke, ash, and other solids make up a small percentage of the atmosphere. Particles provide starting points (or nuclei) for water vapor to condense on and form raindrops. Some particles are pollutants, which are discussed in the Human Actions and the Atmosphere chapter. 
Pressure and  Density 	  The atmosphere has different properties at different elevations above sea level, or altitudes. The air density (the number of molecules in a given volume) decreases with increasing altitude. This is why people who climb tall mountains, such as Mt. Everest, have to set up camp at different elevations to let their bodies get used to the decreased air ( Figure 15.5). Why does air density decrease with altitude? Gravity pulls the gas molecules towards Earths center. The pull of gravity is stronger closer to the center at sea level. Air is denser at sea level where the gravitational pull is greater. Gases at sea level are also compressed by the weight of the atmosphere above them. The force of the air weighing down over a unit of area is known as its atmospheric pressure, or air pressure. Why are we not crushed? The molecules inside our bodies are pushing outward to compensate. Air pressure is felt from all directions, not just from above. This bottle was closed at an altitude of 3,000 meters where air pressure is lower. When it was brought down to sea level, the higher air pressure caused the bottle to collapse. At higher altitudes the atmospheric pressure is lower and the air is less dense than at higher altitudes. If your ears have ever "popped", you have experienced a change in air pressure. Gas molecules are found inside and outside your ears. When you change altitude quickly, like when an airplane is descending, your inner ear keeps the density of molecules at the original altitude. Eventually the air molecules inside your ear suddenly move through a small tube in your ear to equalize the pressure. This sudden rush of air is felt as a popping sensation. Although the density of the atmosphere changes with altitude, the composition stays the same with altitude, with one exception. In the ozone layer, at about 20 km to 40 km above the surface, there is a greater concentration of ozone molecules than in other portions of the atmosphere 
Lesson  Summary 	  Without its atmosphere, Earth would be a very different planet. Gases in the atmosphere allow plants to photosynthesize and animals and plants to engage in respiration. Water vapor, which is an atmospheric gas, is an essential part of the water cycle. Although the amount of gases do not vary relative to each other in the atmosphere, there is one exception: the ozone layer. Ozone in the upper atmosphere protects life from the Suns high energy ultraviolet radiation. Air pressure varies with altitude and temperature. How would Earth be different if it did not have an atmosphere? What are the most important components of the atmosphere? How does the atmosphere vary with altitude?

Introduction 	  The atmosphere is layered, corresponding with how the atmospheres temperature changes with altitude. By understanding the way temperature changes with altitude, we can learn a lot about how the atmosphere works. While weather takes place in the lower atmosphere, interesting things, such as the beautiful aurora, happen higher in the atmosphere. 
Air  Temperature 	  Why does warm air rise ( Figure 15.6)? Gas molecules are able to move freely and if they are uncontained, as they are in the atmosphere, they can take up more or less space. When gas molecules are cool, they are sluggish and do not take up as much space. With the same number of molecules in less space, both air density and air pressure are higher. When gas molecules are warm, they move vigorously and take up more space. Air density and air pressure are lower. Papers held up by rising air currents above a radiator demonstrate the important principle that warm air rises. Warmer, lighter air is more buoyant than the cooler air above it, so it rises. The cooler air then sinks down, because it is denser than the air beneath it. This is convection, which was described in the Plate Tectonics chapter. The property that changes most strikingly with altitude is air temperature. Unlike the change in pressure and density, which decrease with altitude, changes in air temperature are not regular. A change in temperature with distance is called a temperature gradient. The atmosphere is divided into layers based on how the temperature in that layer changes with altitude, the layers temperature gradient ( Figure 15.7). The temperature gradient of each layer is different. In some layers, temperature increases with altitude and in others it decreases. The temperature gradient in each layer is determined by the heat source of the layer ( Figure 15.8). The four main layers of the atmosphere have different temperature gradients, creating the thermal structure of the atmosphere. Most of the important processes of the atmosphere take place in the lowest two layers: the troposphere and the stratosphere. The layers of the atmosphere appear as different colors in this image from the International Space Station. 
Troposphere 	  The temperature of the troposphere is highest near the surface of the Earth and decreases with altitude. On average, the temperature gradient of the troposphere is 6.5C per 1,000 m (3.6F per 1,000 ft.) of altitude. What is the source of heat for the troposphere? Earths surface is a major source of heat for the troposphere, although nearly all of that heat comes from the Sun. Rock, soil, and water on Earth absorb the Suns light and radiate it back into the atmosphere as heat. The temperature is also higher near the surface because of the greater density of gases. The higher gravity causes the temperature to rise. Notice that in the troposphere warmer air is beneath cooler air. What do you think the consequence of this is? This condition is unstable. The warm air near the surface rises and cool air higher in the troposphere sinks. So air in the troposphere does a lot of mixing. This mixing causes the temperature gradient to vary with time and place. The rising and sinking of air in the troposphere means that all of the planets weather takes place in the troposphere. Sometimes there is a temperature inversion, air temperature in the troposphere increases with altitude and warm air sits over cold air. Inversions are very stable and may last for several days or even weeks. Inversions form: Over land at night or in winter when the ground is cold. The cold ground cools the air that sits above it, making this low layer of air denser than the air above it. Near the coast where cold seawater cools the air above it. When that denser air moves inland, it slides beneath the warmer air over the land. Since temperature inversions are stable, they often trap pollutants and produce unhealthy air conditions in cities ( Figure 15.9). At the top of the troposphere is a thin layer in which the temperature does not change with height. This means that the cooler, denser air of the troposphere is trapped beneath the warmer, less dense air of the stratosphere. Air from the troposphere and stratosphere rarely mix. A science experiment that clearly shows how a temperature inversion traps air, along with whatever pollutants are in it, near the ground is seen in this video (5c): URL (2:50). Smoke makes a temperature inversion visible. The smoke is trapped in cold dense air that lies beneath a cap of warmer air. 
Stratosphere 	  Ash and gas from a large volcanic eruption may burst into the stratosphere, the layer above the troposphere. Once in the stratosphere, it remains suspended there for many years because there is so little mixing between the two layers. Pilots like to fly in the lower portions of the stratosphere because there is little air turbulence. In the stratosphere, temperature increases with altitude. What is the heat source for the stratosphere? The direct heat source for the stratosphere is the Sun. Air in the stratosphere is stable because warmer, less dense air sits over cooler, denser air. As a result, there is little mixing of air within the layer. The ozone layer is found within the stratosphere between 15 to 30 km (9 to 19 miles) altitude. The thickness of the ozone layer varies by the season and also by latitude. The ozone layer is extremely important because ozone gas in the stratosphere absorbs most of the Suns harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Because of this, the ozone layer protects life on Earth. High-energy UV light penetrates cells and damages DNA, leading to cell death (which we know as a bad sunburn). Organisms on Earth are not adapted to heavy UV exposure, which kills or damages them. Without the ozone layer to reflect UVC and UVB radiation, most complex life on Earth would not survive long ( Figure 15.10). 
Mesosphere 	  Temperatures in the mesosphere decrease with altitude. Because there are few gas molecules in the mesosphere to absorb the Suns radiation, the heat source is the stratosphere below. The mesosphere is extremely cold, especially Even with the ozone layer, UVB radiation still manages to reach Earths surface, especially where solar radiation is high. at its top, about -90C (-130F). The air in the mesosphere has extremely low density: 99.9% of the mass of the atmosphere is below the mesosphere. As a result, air pressure is very low ( Figure 15.11). A person traveling through the mesosphere would experience severe burns from ultraviolet light since the ozone layer which provides UV protection is in the stratosphere below. There would be almost no oxygen for breathing. Stranger yet, an unprotected travelers blood would boil at normal body temperature because the pressure is so low. 
Thermosphere and  Beyond 	  The density of molecules is so low in the thermosphere that one gas molecule can go about 1 km before it collides with another molecule. Since so little energy is transferred, the air feels very cold ( Figure 15.12). Within the thermosphere is the ionosphere. The ionosphere gets its name from the solar radiation that ionizes gas molecules to create a positively charged ion and one or more negatively charged electrons. The freed electrons travel within the ionosphere as electric currents. Because of the free ions, the ionosphere has many interesting characteristics. At night, radio waves bounce off the ionosphere and back to Earth. This is why you can often pick up an AM radio station far from its source at night. The Van Allen radiation belts are two doughnut-shaped zones of highly charged particles that are located beyond the atmosphere in the magnetosphere. The particles originate in solar flares and fly to Earth on the solar wind. Once trapped by Earths magnetic field, they follow along the fields magnetic lines of force. These lines extend from Meteors burn in the mesosphere even though the gas is very thin; these burning meteors are shooting stars. The International Space Station (ISS) orbits within the upper part of the thermosphere, at about 320 to 380 km above the Earth. above the equator to the North Pole and also to the South Pole then return to the equator. When massive solar storms cause the Van Allen belts to become overloaded with particles, the result is the most spectacular feature of the ionosphere  the nighttime aurora ( Figure 15.13). The particles spiral along magnetic field lines toward the poles. The charged particles energize oxygen and nitrogen gas molecules, causing them to light up. Each gas emits a particular color of light. There is no real outer limit to the exosphere, the outermost layer of the atmosphere; the gas molecules finally become so scarce that at some point there are no more. Beyond the atmosphere is the solar wind. The solar wind is made of high-speed particles, mostly protons and electrons, traveling rapidly outward from the Sun. This video is very thorough in its discussion of the layers of the atmosphere. Remember that the chemical composition of each layer is nearly the same except for the ozone layer that is found in the stratosphere (8a): URL outube.com/watch?v=S-YAKZoy1A0 (6:44).

Lesson  Summary 	  Features of the atmosphere change with altitude: density decreases, air pressure decreases, temperature changes vary. Different temperature gradients create different layers within the atmosphere. The lowest layer is the troposphere where most of the atmospheric gases and all of the planets weather are located. The troposphere is heated from the ground, so temperature decreases with altitude. Because warm air rises and cool air sinks, the troposphere is unstable. In the stratosphere, temperature increases with altitude. The stratosphere contains the ozone layer, which protects the planet from the Suns harmful UV radiation.

Introduction 	  Wind, precipitation, warming, and cooling depend on how much energy is in the atmosphere and where that energy is located. Much more energy from the Sun reaches low latitudes (nearer the equator) than high latitudes (nearer the poles). These differences in insolation  the amount of solar radiation that reaches a given area in a given time  cause the winds, affect climate, and drive ocean currents. Heat is held in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases. 
Energy 	  Energy travels through space or material. This is obvious when you stand near a fire and feel its warmth or when you pick up the handle of a metal pot even though the handle is not sitting directly on the hot stove. Invisible energy waves can travel through air, glass, and even the vacuum of outer space. These waves have electrical and magnetic properties, so they are called electromagnetic waves. The transfer of energy from one object to another through electromagnetic waves is known as radiation. Different wavelengths of energy create different types of electromagnetic waves ( Figure 15.14). The wavelengths humans can see are known as "visible light." These wavelengths appear to us as the colors of the rainbow. What objects can you think of that radiate visible light? Two include the Sun and a light bulb. The longest wavelengths of visible light appear red. Infrared wavelengths are longer than visible red. Snakes can see infrared energy. We feel infrared energy as heat. Wavelengths that are shorter than violet are called ultraviolet. The	electromagnetic	spectrum;	short wavelengths are the fastest with the highest energy. Can you think of some objects that appear to radiate visible light, but actually do not? The moon and the planets do not emit light of their own; they reflect the light of the Sun. Reflection is when light (or another wave) bounces back from a surface. Albedo is a measure of how well a surface reflects light. A surface with high albedo reflects a large percentage of light. A snow field has high albedo. One important fact to remember is that energy cannot be created or destroyed  it can only be changed from one form to another. This is such a fundamental fact of nature that it is a law: the law of conservation of energy. In photosynthesis, for example, plants convert solar energy into chemical energy that they can use. They do not create new energy. When energy is transformed, some nearly always becomes heat. Heat transfers between materials easily, from warmer objects to cooler ones. If no more heat is added, eventually all of a material will reach the same temperature. 
Temperature 	  Temperature is a measure of how fast the atoms in a material are vibrating. High temperature particles vibrate faster than low temperature particles. Rapidly vibrating atoms smash together, which generates heat. As a material cools down, the atoms vibrate more slowly and collide less frequently. As a result, they emit less heat. What is the difference between heat and temperature? Temperature measures how fast a materials atoms are vibrating. Heat measures the materials total energy. Which has higher heat and which has higher temperature: a candle flame or a bathtub full of hot water? The flame has higher temperature, but less heat, because the hot region is very small. The bathtub has lower temperature but contains much more heat because it has many more vibrating atoms. The bathtub has greater total energy. 
Heat 	  Heat is taken in or released when an object changes state, or changes from a gas to a liquid, or a liquid to a solid. This heat is called latent heat. When a substance changes state, latent heat is released or absorbed. A substance that is changing its state of matter does not change temperature. All of the energy that is released or absorbed goes toward changing the materials state. For example, imagine a pot of boiling water on a stove burner: that water is at 100C (212F). If you increase the temperature of the burner, more heat enters the water. The water remains at its boiling temperature, but the additional energy goes into changing the water from liquid to gas. With more heat the water evaporates more rapidly. When water changes from a liquid to a gas it takes in heat. Since evaporation takes in heat, this is called evaporative cooling. Evaporative cooling is an inexpensive way to cool homes in hot, dry areas. Substances also differ in their specific heat, the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of the material by 1.0C (1.8F). Water has a very high specific heat, which means it takes a lot of energy to change the temperature of water. Lets compare a puddle and asphalt, for example. If you are walking barefoot on a sunny day, which would you rather walk across, the shallow puddle or an asphalt parking lot? Because of its high specific heat, the water stays cooler than the asphalt, even though it receives the same amount of solar radiation. 
Energy  From the  Sun 	  Most of the energy that reaches the Earths surface comes from the Sun ( Figure 15.15). About 44% of solar radiation is in the visible light wavelengths, but the Sun also emits infrared, ultraviolet, and other wavelengths. When viewed together, all of the wavelengths of visible light appear white. But a prism or water droplets can break the white light into different wavelengths so that separate colors appear ( Figure 15.16). Of the solar energy that reaches the outer atmosphere, UV wavelengths have the greatest energy. Only about 7% of solar radiation is in the UV wavelengths. The three types are: An image of the sun taken by the SOHO spacecraft. The sensor is picking up only the 17.1 nm wavelength, in the ultraviolet wavelengths. A prism breaks apart white light. UVC: the highest energy ultraviolet, does not reach the planets surface at all. UVB: the second highest energy, is also mostly stopped in the atmosphere. UVA: the lowest energy, travels through the atmosphere to the ground. The remaining solar radiation is the longest wavelength, infrared. Most objects radiate infrared energy, which we feel as heat ( Figure 15.17). Some of the wavelengths of solar radiation traveling through the atmosphere may be lost because they are absorbed by various gases ( Figure 15.18). Ozone completely removes UVC, most UVB, and some UVA from incoming sunlight. O2, CO2 and H2O also filter out some wavelengths. An infrared sensor detects different amounts of heat radiating from a dog. Atmospheric gases filter some wavelengths of incoming solar energy. Yellow shows the energy that reaches the top of the atmosphere. Red shows the wavelengths that reach sea level. Ozone filters out the shortest wavelength UV and oxygen filters out most infrared. 
Solar  Radiation on  Earth 	  Different parts of the Earth receive different amounts of solar radiation. Which part of the planet receives the most insolation? The Suns rays strike the surface most directly at the equator. Different areas also receive different amounts of sunlight in different seasons. What causes the seasons? The seasons are caused by the direction Earths axis is pointing relative to the Sun. The Earth revolves around the Sun once each year and spins on its axis of rotation once each day. This axis of rotation is tilted 23.5 relative to its plane of orbit around the Sun. The axis of rotation is pointed toward Polaris, the North Star. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt of Earths axis stays lined up with the North Star. 
Northern  Hemisphere  Summer 	  The North Pole is tilted towards the Sun and the Suns rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly in summer ( Figure 15.19). At the summer solstice, June 21 or 22, the Suns rays hit the Earth most directly along the Tropic of Cancer (23.5N); that is, the angle of incidence of the suns rays there is zero (the angle of incidence is the deviation in the angle of an incoming ray from straight on). When it is summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. 
Northern  Hemisphere  Winter 	  Winter solstice for the Northern Hemisphere happens on December 21 or 22. The tilt of Earths axis points away from the Sun ( Figure 15.20). Light from the Sun is spread out over a larger area, so that area isnt heated as much. With fewer daylight hours in winter, there is also less time for the Sun to warm the area. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. 
In	 Southern	 Hemisphere	summer,	the 	  Suns rays directly strike the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5S). Sunlight is spread across a large area near the South Pole. No sunlight reaches the North Pole. 
Equinox 	  Halfway between the two solstices, the Suns rays shine most directly at the equator, called an "equinox" ( Figure 15.21). The daylight and nighttime hours are exactly equal on an equinox. The autumnal equinox happens on September 22 or 23 and the vernal or spring equinox happens March 21 or 22 in the Northern Hemisphere. Where	sunlight	reaches	on	spring equinox,	summer	solstice,	vernal equinox, and winter solstice. The time is 9:00 p.m. Universal Time, at Greenwich, England. 
Heat  Transfer in the  Atmosphere 	  Heat moves in the atmosphere the same way it moves through the solid Earth (Plate Tectonics chapter) or another medium. What follows is a review of the way heat flows, but applied to the atmosphere. Radiation is the transfer of energy between two objects by electromagnetic waves. Heat radiates from the ground into the lower atmosphere. In conduction, heat moves from areas of more heat to areas of less heat by direct contact. Warmer molecules vibrate rapidly and collide with other nearby molecules, transferring their energy. In the atmosphere, conduction is more effective at lower altitudes where air density is higher; transfers heat upward to where the molecules are spread further apart or transfers heat laterally from a warmer to a cooler spot, where the molecules are moving less vigorously. Heat transfer by movement of heated materials is called convection. Heat that radiates from the ground initiates convection cells in the atmosphere ( Figure 15.22). Thermal convection where the heat source is at the bottom and there is a ceiling at the top. 
Heat at  Earths  Surface 	  About half of the solar radiation that strikes the top of the atmosphere is filtered out before it reaches the ground. This energy can be absorbed by atmospheric gases, reflected by clouds, or scattered. Scattering occurs when a light wave strikes a particle and bounces off in some other direction. About 3% of the energy that strikes the ground is reflected back into the atmosphere. The rest is absorbed by rocks, soil, and water and then radiated back into the air as heat. These infrared wavelengths can only be seen by infrared sensors. The basics of Earths annual heat budget are described in this video (4b): URL 3hNQF0 (5:40). Because solar energy continually enters Earths atmosphere and ground surface, is the planet getting hotter? The answer is no (although the next section contains an exception) because energy from Earth escapes into space through the top of the atmosphere. If the amount that exits is equal to the amount that comes in, then average global temperature stays the same. This means that the planets heat budget is in balance. What happens if more energy comes in than goes out? If more energy goes out than comes in? To say that the Earths heat budget is balanced ignores an important point. The amount of incoming solar energy is different at different latitudes ( Figure 15.23). Where do you think the most solar energy ends up and why? Where does the least solar energy end up and why? See Table 15.1 
High 	  Note: Colder temperatures mean more ice and snow cover the ground, making albedo relatively high. The difference in solar energy received at different latitudes drives atmospheric circulation. The maximum land surface temperature of the Earth, showing a roughly gradual temperature gradient from the low to the high latitudes. The Earths heat budget shows the amount of energy coming into and going out of the Earths system and the importance of the greenhouse effect. The numbers are the amount of energy that is found in one square meter of that location. Greenhouse gases include CO2, H2O, methane, O3, nitrous oxides (NO and NO2), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). All are a normal part of the atmosphere except CFCs. Table 15.2 shows how each greenhouse gas naturally enters the atmosphere. 
Carbon dioxide 	  Respiration, volcanic eruptions, decomposition of plant material; burning of fossil fuels 
Methane 	  Decomposition of plant material under some conditions, biochemical reactions in stomachs 
Not naturally occurring; made by humans 	  Different greenhouse gases have different abilities to trap heat. For example, one methane molecule traps 23 times as much heat as one CO2 molecule. One CFC-12 molecule (a type of CFC) traps 10,600 times as much heat as one CO2. Still, CO2 is a very important greenhouse gas because it is much more abundant in the atmosphere. How does the difference in solar radiation that reaches the lower and upper latitudes explain the way the atmosphere circulates? How does the atmosphere protect life on Earth from harmful radiation and from extreme temperatures? What would the consequences be if the Earths overall heat budget were not balanced?

Introduction 	  A few basic principles go a long way toward explaining how and why air moves: Warm air rising creates a low pressure zone at the ground. Air from the surrounding area is sucked into the space left by the rising air. Air flows horizontally at top of the troposphere; horizontal flow is called advection. The air cools until it descends. Where it reaches the ground, it creates a high pressure zone. Air flowing from areas of high pressure to low pressure creates winds. Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air. Air moving at the bases of the three major convection cells in each hemisphere north and south of the equator creates the global wind belts. 
Air  Pressure and  Winds 	  Within the troposphere are convection cells ( Figure 15.25). Air that moves horizontally between high and low pressure zones makes wind. The greater the pressure difference between the pressure zones the faster the wind moves. Convection in the atmosphere creates the planets weather. When warm air rises and cools in a low pressure zone, it may not be able to hold all the water it contains as vapor. Some water vapor may condense to form clouds or precipitation. When cool air descends, it warms. Since it can then hold more moisture, the descending air will evaporate water on the ground. Air moving between large high and low pressure systems creates the global wind belts that profoundly affect regional climate. Smaller pressure systems create localized winds that affect the weather and climate of a local area. An online guide to air pressure and winds from the University of Illinois is found here: URL .edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/fw/home.rxml . 
Local  Winds 	  Local winds result from air moving between small low and high pressure systems. High and low pressure cells are created by a variety of conditions. Some local winds have very important effects on the weather and climate of some regions. 
Land and  Sea  Breezes 	  Since water has a very high specific heat, it maintains its temperature well. So water heats and cools more slowly than land. If there is a large temperature difference between the surface of the sea (or a large lake) and the land next to it, high and low pressure regions form. This creates local winds. Sea breezes blow from the cooler ocean over the warmer land in summer ( Figure 15.26). Where is the high pressure zone and where is the low pressure zone? Sea breezes blow at about 10 to 20 km (6 to 12 miles) per hour and lower air temperature much as 5 to 10C (9 to 18F). Land breezes blow from the land to the sea in winter. Where is the high pressure zone and where is the low pressure zone? Some warmer air from the ocean rises and then sinks on land, causing the temperature over the land to become warmer. Land and sea breezes create the pleasant climate for which Southern California is known. The effect of land and sea breezes are felt only about 50 to 100 km (30 to 60 miles) inland. This same cooling and warming effect occurs to a smaller degree during day and night, because land warms and cools faster than the ocean. 
Monsoon  Winds 	  Monsoon winds are larger scale versions of land and sea breezes; they blow from the sea onto the land in summer and from the land onto the sea in winter. Monsoon winds are occur where very hot summer lands are next to the sea. Thunderstorms are common during monsoons ( Figure 15.27). In the southwestern United States relatively cool moist air sucked in from the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of California meets air that has been heated by scorching desert temperatures. The most important monsoon in the world occurs each year over the Indian subcontinent. More than two billion residents of India and southeastern Asia depend on monsoon rains for their drinking and irrigation water. Back in the days of sailing ships, seasonal shifts in the monsoon winds carried goods back and forth between India and Africa. 
Mountain and  Valley  Breezes 	  Temperature differences between mountains and valleys create mountain and valley breezes. During the day, air on mountain slopes is heated more than air at the same elevation over an adjacent valley. As the day progresses, warm air rises and draws the cool air up from the valley, creating a valley breeze. At night the mountain slopes cool more quickly than the nearby valley, which causes a mountain breeze to flow downhill. 
Katabatic  Winds 	  Katabatic winds move up and down slopes, but they are stronger mountain and valley breezes. Katabatic winds form over a high land area, like a high plateau. The plateau is usually surrounded on almost all sides by mountains. In winter, the plateau grows cold. The air above the plateau grows cold and sinks down from the plateau through gaps in the mountains. Wind speeds depend on the difference in air pressure over the plateau and over the surroundings. Katabatic winds form over many continental areas. Extremely cold katabatic winds blow over Antarctica and Greenland. Chinook Winds (Foehn Winds) Chinook winds (or Foehn winds) develop when air is forced up over a mountain range. This takes place, for example, when the westerly winds bring air from the Pacific Ocean over the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. As the relatively warm, moist air rises over the windward side of the mountains, it cools and contracts. If the air is humid, it may form clouds and drop rain or snow. When the air sinks on the leeward side of the mountains, it forms a high pressure zone. The windward side of a mountain range is the side that receives the wind; the leeward side is the side where air sinks. The descending air warms and creates strong, dry winds. Chinook winds can raise temperatures more than 20C (36F) in an hour and they rapidly decrease humidity. Snow on the leeward side of the mountain disappears melts quickly. If precipitation falls as the air rises over the mountains, the air will be dry as it sinks on the leeward size. This dry, sinking air causes a rainshadow effect ( Figure 15.28), which creates many of the worlds deserts. As air rises over a mountain it cools and loses moisture, then warms by compression on the leeward side. The resulting warm and dry winds are Chinook winds. The leeward side of the mountain experiences rainshadow effect. 
Santa  Ana  Winds 	  Santa Ana winds are created in the late fall and winter when the Great Basin east of the Sierra Nevada cools, creating a high pressure zone. The high pressure forces winds downhill and in a clockwise direction (because of Coriolis). The air pressure rises, so temperature rises and humidity falls. The winds blow across the Southwestern deserts and then race downhill and westward toward the ocean. Air is forced through canyons cutting the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains ( Figure 15.29). The winds are especially fast through Santa Ana Canyon, for which they are named. Santa Ana winds blow dust and smoke westward over the Pacific from Southern California. The Santa Ana winds often arrive at the end of Californias long summer drought season. The hot, dry winds dry out the landscape even more. If a fire starts, it can spread quickly, causing large-scale devastation ( Figure 15.30). In October 2007, Santa Ana winds fueled many fires that together burned 426,000 acres of wild land and more than 1,500 homes in Southern California. 
Desert  Winds 	  High summer temperatures on the desert create high winds, which are often associated with monsoon storms. Desert winds pick up dust because there is not as much vegetation to hold down the dirt and sand. ( Figure 15.31). A haboob forms in the downdrafts on the front of a thunderstorm. Dust devils, also called whirlwinds, form as the ground becomes so hot that the air above it heats and rises. Air flows into the low pressure and begins to spin. Dust devils are small and short-lived but they may cause damage. A haboob in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona. 
Atmospheric  Circulation 	  Because more solar energy hits the equator, the air warms and forms a low pressure zone. At the top of the troposphere, half moves toward the North Pole and half toward the South Pole. As it moves along the top of the troposphere it cools. The cool air is dense and when it reaches a high pressure zone it sinks to the ground. The air is sucked back toward the low pressure at the equator. This describes the convection cells north and south of the equator. If the Earth did not rotate, there would be one convection cell in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern with the rising air at the equator and the sinking air at each pole. But because the planet does rotate, the situation is more complicated. The planets rotation means that the Coriolis Effect must be taken into account. Coriolis Effect was described in the Earths Oceans chapter. Lets look at atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere as a result of the Coriolis Effect ( Figure 15.32). Air rises at the equator, but as it moves toward the pole at the top of the troposphere, it deflects to the right. (Remember that it just appears to deflect to the right because the ground beneath it moves.) At about 30N latitude, the air from the equator meets air flowing toward the equator from the higher latitudes. This air is cool because it has come from higher latitudes. Both batches of air descend, creating a high pressure zone. Once on the ground, the air returns to the equator. This convection cell is called the Hadley Cell and is found between 0 and 30N. There are two more convection cells in the Northern Hemisphere. The Ferrell cell is between 30N and 50 to 60N. This cell shares its southern, descending side with the Hadley cell to its south. Its northern rising limb is shared with the Polar cell located between 50N to 60N and the North Pole, where cold air descends. There are three mirror image circulation cells in the Southern Hemisphere. In that hemisphere, the Coriolis Effect makes objects appear to deflect to the left. 
Global  Wind  Belts 	  Global winds blow in belts encircling the planet. The global wind belts are enormous and the winds are relatively steady ( Figure 15.33). These winds are the result of air movement at the bottom of the major atmospheric circulation cells, where the air moves horizontally from high to low pressure. The atmospheric circulation cells, showing direction of winds at Earths surface. The major wind belts and the directions that they blow. 
Global  Wind  Belts 	  Lets look at the global wind belts in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Hadley cell air should move north to south, but it is deflected to the right by Coriolis. So the air blows from northeast to the southwest. This belt is the trade winds, so called because at the time of sailing ships they were good for trade. In the Ferrel cell air should move south to north, but the winds actually blow from the southwest. This belt is the westerly winds or westerlies. Why do you think a flight across the United States from San Francisco to New York City takes less time than the reverse trip? In the Polar cell, the winds travel from the northeast and are called the polar easterlies The wind belts are named for the directions from which the winds come. The westerly winds, for example, blow from west to east. These names hold for the winds in the wind belts of the Southern Hemisphere as well. This video lecture discusses the 3-cell model of atmospheric circulation and the resulting global wind belts and surface wind currents (5a): URL (8:45). 
Global  Winds and  Precipitation 	  Besides their effect on the global wind belts, the high and low pressure areas created by the six atmospheric circulation cells determine in a general way the amount of precipitation a region receives. In low pressure regions, where air is rising, rain is common. In high pressure areas, the sinking air causes evaporation and the region is usually dry. More specific climate effects will be described in the chapter about climate. 
Polar  Fronts and  Jet  Streams 	  The polar front is the junction between the Ferrell and Polar cells. At this low pressure zone, relatively warm, moist air of the Ferrell Cell runs into relatively cold, dry air of the Polar cell. The weather where these two meet is extremely variable, typical of much of North America and Europe. The polar jet stream is found high up in the atmosphere where the two cells come together. A jet stream is a fastflowing river of air at the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Jet streams form where there is a large temperature difference between two air masses. This explains why the polar jet stream is the worlds most powerful ( Figure 15.34). A cross section of the atmosphere with major circulation cells and jet streams. The polar jet stream is the site of extremely turbulent weather. Jet streams move seasonally just as the angle of the Sun in the sky moves north and south. The polar jet stream, known as the jet stream, moves south in the winter and north in the summer between about 30N and 50 to 75N. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Winds blow from high pressure zones to low pressure zones. The pressure zones are created when air near the ground becomes warmer or colder than the air nearby. Local winds may be found in a mountain valley or near a coast. The global wind patterns are long-term, steady winds that prevail around a large portion of the planet. The location of the global wind belts has a great deal of influence on the weather and climate of an area.

S  Weather 	  A hurricane feeds off warm water. This NASA map of sea surface temperature shows just how warm the water was in the tropical Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico in August 2005 when Hurricane Katrina made its way towards the Gulf Coast. The storm began over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23 and moved over south Florida the next day as a Category 1 hurricane. The storm killed nine people and caused about $600 million in damage. As the storm traveled west over the Gulf of Mexico, the water was abnormally warm, as high as 89?F (32?C). On August 27, the storm was upgraded to Category 3 and the next day it received the highest designation, Category 5. Winds of 175 mph (280 kph) and gusts of 215 mph (344 kph) were reported. The residents of New Orleans were advised to evacuate the city and fortunately many did. By the time Hurricane Katrina hit land it had been downgraded to a Category 4 storm. New Orleans was not hit head-on, but by the weaker side of the storm. Initial reports were that the city had been spared. What people didnt know initially was that storm surge had collapsed several sections of the levee that protected the city. Soon 80% of the city was submerged; around 1,300 people were dead (2,500 throughout the region) and one million people were homeless. Courtesy of NASA/SVS. URL Public Domain. Discuss the difference between weather and climate. Describe the relationship between air temperature and humidity, including the concept of dew point. List the basics of the different cloud types and what they indicate about current and future weather. Explain how the different types of precipitation form. cloud dew point relative humidity 
Introduction 	  If someone across country asks you what the weather is like today, you need to consider several factors. Air temperature, humidity, wind speed, the amount and types of clouds, and precipitation are all part of a thorough weather report. In this chapter, you will learn about many of these features in more detail. What is Weather and Climate? Weather is what is going on in the atmosphere at a particular place at a particular time. Weather can change rapidly. A locations weather depends on: air temperature air pressure fog humidity cloud cover precipitation wind speed and direction All of these are directly related to the amount of energy that is in the system and where that energy is. The ultimate source of this energy is the sun. Climate is the average of a regions weather over time. The climate for a particular place is steady, and changes only very slowly. Climate is determined by many factors, including the angle of the Sun, the likelihood of cloud cover, and the air pressure. All of these factors are related to the amount of energy that is found in that location over time. 
Humidity 	  Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air in a particular spot. We usually use the term to mean relative humidity, the percentage of water vapor a certain volume of air is holding relative to the maximum amount it can contain. If the humidity today is 80%, it means that the air contains 80% of the total amount of water it can hold at that temperature. What will happen if the humidity increases to more than 100%? The excess water condenses and forms precipitation. Since warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air, raising or lowering temperature can change airs relative humidity ( Figure 16.1). The temperature at which air becomes saturated with water is called the airs dew point. This term makes sense, because water condenses from the air as dew, if the air cools down overnight and reaches 100% humidity. This diagram shows the amount of water air can hold at different temperatures. The temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. 
Clouds 	  Clouds have a big influence on weather: by preventing solar radiation from reaching the ground. by absorbing warmth that is re-emitted from the ground. as the source of precipitation. When there are no clouds, there is less insulation. As a result, cloudless days can be extremely hot, and cloudless nights can be very cold. For this reason, cloudy days tend to have a lower range of temperatures than clear days. Clouds form when air reaches its dew point. This can happen in two ways: (1) Air temperature stays the same but humidity increases. This is common in locations that are warm and humid. (2) Humidity can remain the same, but temperature decreases. When the air cools enough to reach 100% humidity, water droplets form. Air cools when it comes into contact with a cold surface or when it rises. Rising air creates clouds when it has been warmed at or near the ground level and then is pushed up over a mountain or mountain range or is thrust over a mass of cold, dense air. Water vapor is not visible unless it condenses to become a cloud. Water vapor condenses around a nucleus, such as dust, smoke, or a salt crystal. This forms a tiny liquid droplet. Billions of these water droplets together make a cloud. Clouds are classified in several ways. The most common classification used today divides clouds into four separate cloud groups, which are determined by their altitude ( Figure 16.2). The four cloud types and where they are found in the atmosphere. 
High  Clouds 	  High clouds ( Figure 16.3) form from ice crystals where the air is extremely cold and can hold little water vapor. Cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus are all names of high clouds. Cirrocumulus clouds are small, white puffs that ripple across the sky, often in rows. Cirrus clouds may indicate that a storm is coming. 
Middle  Clouds 	  Middle clouds, including altocumulus and altostratus clouds, may be made of water droplets, ice crystals or both, depending on the air temperatures ( Figure 16.4). Thick and broad altostratus clouds are gray or blue-gray. They often cover the entire sky and usually mean a large storm, bearing a lot of precipitation, is coming. 
Low  Clouds 	  Low clouds ( Figure 16.5) are nearly all water droplets. Stratus, stratocumulus and nimbostratus clouds are common low clouds. Nimbostratus clouds are thick and dark. They bring steady rain or snow. Altocumulus clouds are white to puffy stripes rolling across the sky. They may precede a thunderstorm. 
Vertical  Clouds 	  Clouds with the prefix cumulo( Figure 16.6) grow vertically instead of horizontally and have their bases at low altitude and their tops at high or middle altitude. Clouds grow vertically when strong air currents are rising upward. An online guide to cloud development and different cloud types from the University of Illinois is found here: http ://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/cld/home.rxml . 
Fog 	  Fog ( Figure 16.7) is a cloud located at or near the ground . When humid air near the ground cools below its dew point, fog is formed. The several types of fog that each form in a different way. (a) Stratus clouds are gray sheets that cover the entire sky and may produce a steady drizzle. Stratus clouds with the Alps in the distance. (b) Stratocumulus clouds are rows of large, low puffs that may be white or gray. These clouds rarely bring precipitation. (a) Cumulus clouds resemble white or light gray cotton and have towering tops and may produce light showers. (b) A cumulonimbus cloud grows when vertical air currents are strong as in a thunderstorm. This one is lit up by lightning. Radiation fog forms at night when skies are clear and the relative humidity is high. As the ground cools, the bottom layer of air cools below its dew point. Tule fog is an extreme form of radiation fog found in some regions. San Francisco, California, is famous for its summertime advection fog. Warm, moist Pacific Ocean air blows over the cold California current and cools below its dew point. Sea breezes bring the fog onshore. Steam fog appears in autumn when cool air moves over a warm lake. Water evaporates from the lake surface and condenses as it cools, appearing like steam. Warm humid air travels up a hillside and cools below its dew point to create upslope fog (a) Tule fog in the Central Valley of California. (b) Advection fog in San Francisco. (c) Steam fog over a lake. (d) Upslope fog in Terespolis city, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. 
D:  Science on the  T:  The  Science of  Fog 	  Fog levels are declining along the California coast as climate warms. The change in fog may have big ecological changes for the state. Learn more at: URL . 
Precipitation 	  Precipitation ( Figure 16.8) is an extremely important part of weather. Some precipitation forms in place . The most common precipitation comes from clouds. Rain or snow droplets grow as they ride air currents in a cloud and collect other droplets ( Figure 16.9). They fall when they become heavy enough to escape from the rising air currents that hold them up in the cloud. One million cloud droplets will combine to make only one rain drop ! If temperatures are cold, the droplet will hit the ground as a snowflake. Other less common types of precipitation are sleet ( Figure 16.10). An online guide from the University of Illinois to different types of precipitation is seen here: URL uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/cld/prcp/home.rxml . 
Lesson  Summary 	  Different air temperatures create convection cells. Air rising in a convection cell may cool enough to reach its dew point and form clouds or precipitation if the humidity is high enough. Clouds or fog may form if warmer air meets a colder ground surface. Air temperature and humidity also determine what sorts of clouds and precipitation form. (a) Sleet is rain that becomes ice as it hits a layer of freezing air near the ground. (b) If a frigid raindrop freezes on the frigid ground, it forms glaze. (c) Hail forms in cumulonimbus clouds with strong updrafts. An ice particle travels until it finally becomes too heavy and it drops. This large hail stone is about 6 cm (2.5 inches) in diameter. Different factors play a role in creating pleasant or uncomfortable weather, such as when it might be warm and dry or hot and humid. When thinking about the weather, what factors do you consider important? How do air temperature, humidity, and pressure differences create different weather? Think about the types of weather described in this lesson. Imagine types of weather that you have not experienced, look at photos, and ask friends and relatives whove lived in other places what their weather is like. Describe the characteristics of air masses and how they get those characteristics. Discuss what happens when air masses meet. List the differences between stationary, cold, warm, and occluded fronts. air mass cold front front occluded front squall line stationary front warm front 
Introduction 	  The weather in a location often depends on what type of air mass is over it. Another key factor is whether the spot is beneath a front, the meeting place of two air masses. The characteristics of the air masses and their interactions determine whether the weather over an area is constant, or whether there are rapid changes. 
Air  Masses 	  An air mass is a batch of air that has nearly the same temperature and humidity ( Figure 16.11). An air mass acquires these characteristics above an area of land or water known as its source region. When the air mass sits over a region for several days, or longer, it picks up the distinct temperature and humidity characteristics of that region. 
Air  Mass  Formation 	  Air masses form over a large area; they can be 1,600 km (1,000 miles) across and several kilometers thick. Air masses form primarily in high pressure zones, most commonly in polar and tropical regions. Temperate zones are ordinarily too unstable for air masses to form. Instead, air masses move across temperate zones so the middle latitudes are prone to having interesting weather. What does an air mass with the symbol cPk mean? The symbol cPk is an air mass with a continental polar source region that is colder than the region it is now moving over. The source regions of air masses found around the world. Symbols: (1) origin over a continent (c) or an ocean (m, for maritime); (2) arctic (A), polar (P,) tropical (T), and equatorial (E); (3) properties relative to the ground it moves over: k, for colder, w for warmer. 
Air  Mass  Movement 	  Air masses are slowly pushed along by high-level winds. When an air mass moves over a new region, it shares its temperature and humidity with that region. So the temperature and humidity of a particular location depends partly on the characteristics of the air mass that sits over it. Storms arise if the air mass and the region it moves over have different characteristics. For example, when a colder air mass moves over warmer ground, the bottom layer of air is heated. That air rises, forming clouds, rain, and sometimes thunderstorms. How would a moving air mass form an inversion? When a warmer air mass travels over colder ground, the bottom layer of air cools and, because of its high density, is trapped near the ground. In general, cold air masses tend to flow toward the equator and warm air masses tend to flow toward the poles. This brings heat to cold areas and cools down areas that are warm. It is one of the many processes that act towards balancing out the planets temperatures. An online guide from the University of Illinois about air masses and fronts is found here: URL .edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/af/home.rxml . 
Fronts 	  Two air masses meet at a front. At a front, the two air masses have different densities and do not easily mix. One air mass is lifted above the other, creating a low pressure zone. If the lifted air is moist, there will be condensation and precipitation. Winds are common at a front. The greater the temperature difference between the two air masses, the stronger the winds will be. Fronts are the main cause of stormy weather. The rest of this section will be devoted to four types of fronts. Three of these fronts move and one is stationary. With cold fronts and warm fronts, the air mass at the leading edge of the front gives the front its name. In other words, a cold front is right at the leading edge of moving cold air and a warm front marks the leading edge of moving warm air. 
Stationary  Front 	  At a stationary front the air masses do not move ( Figure 16.12). A front may become stationary if an air mass is stopped by a barrier, such as a mountain range. A stationary front may bring days of rain, drizzle, and fog. Winds usually blow parallel to the front, but in opposite directions. After several days, the front will likely break apart. The map symbol for a stationary front has red domes for the warm air mass and blue triangles for the cold air mass. 
Cold  Fronts 	  When a cold air mass takes the place of a warm air mass, there is a cold front ( Figure 16.13). The cold air mass is dense so it slides beneath the warm air mass and pushes it up. Imagine that you are standing in one spot as a cold front approaches. Along the cold front, the denser, cold air pushes up the warm air, causing the air pressure to decrease ( Figure 16.13). If the humidity is high enough, some types of cumulus clouds will grow. High in the atmosphere, winds blow ice crystals from the tops of these clouds to create cirrostratus and cirrus clouds. At the front, there will be a line of rain showers, snow showers, or thunderstorms with blustery winds ( Figure 16.14). A squall line is a line of severe thunderstorms that forms along a cold front. Behind the front is the cold air mass. This mass is drier so precipitation stops. The weather may be cold and clear or only partly cloudy. Winds may continue to blow into the low pressure zone at the front. The weather at a cold front varies with the season. spring and summer: The air is unstable so thunderstorms or tornadoes may form. spring: If the temperature gradient is high, strong winds blow. autumn: Strong rains fall over a large area. winter: The cold air mass is likely to have formed in the frigid arctic so there are frigid temperatures and heavy snows. 
Warm  Fronts 	  At a warm front, a warm air mass slides over a cold air mass ( Figure 16.15). When warm, less dense air moves over the colder, denser air, the atmosphere is relatively stable. Warm air moves forward to take over the position of colder air. Imagine that you are on the ground in the wintertime under a cold winter air mass with a warm front approaching. The transition from cold air to warm air takes place over a long distance so the first signs of changing weather appear long before the front is actually over you. Initially, the air is cold: the cold air mass is above you and the warm air mass is above it. High cirrus clouds mark the transition from one air mass to the other. Over time, cirrus clouds become thicker and cirrostratus clouds form. As the front approaches, altocumulus and altostratus clouds appear and the sky turns gray. Since it is winter, snowflakes fall. The clouds thicken and nimbostratus clouds form. Snowfall increases. Winds grow stronger as the low pressure approaches. As the front gets closer, the cold air mass is just above you but the warm air mass is not too far above that. The weather worsens. As the warm air mass approaches, temperatures rise and snow turns to sleet and freezing rain. Warm and cold air mix at the front, leading to the formation of stratus clouds and fog ( Figure 16.16). 
Occluded  Front 	  An occluded front usually forms around a low pressure system ( Figure 16.17). The occlusion starts when a cold front catches up to a warm front. The air masses, in order from front to back, are cold, warm, and then cold again. Coriolis Effect curves the boundary where the two fronts meet towards the pole. If the air mass that arrives third is colder than either of the first two air masses, that air mass slip beneath them both. This is called a cold occlusion. If Cumulus clouds build at a warm front. The map symbol for an occluded front is mixed cold front triangles and warm front domes. the air mass that arrives third is warm, that air mass rides over the other air mass. This is called a warm occlusion ( Figure 16.18). The weather at an occluded front is especially fierce right at the occlusion. Precipitation and shifting winds are typical. The Pacific Coast has frequent occluded fronts. Weather is explored in this video at National Geographic Video, Natural disaster, Landslides, and more: Weather 101 
Lesson  Summary 	  An air mass takes on the temperature and humidity characteristics of the location where it originates. Air masses meet at a front. Stationary fronts become trapped in place; the weather they bring lasts for many days. At a cold front, a cold air mass forces a warm air mass upwards. At a warm front, the warm air mass slips above the cold air mass. In an occluded front, a warm front overtakes a cold front, which creates variable weather. An occluded front with the air masses from front to rear in order as cold, warm, cold.

Introduction 	  Weather happens every day, but only some days have storms. Storms vary immensely depending on whether theyre warm or cold, coming off the ocean or off a continent, occurring in summer or winter, and many other factors. The effects of storms also vary depending on whether they strike a populated area or a natural landscape. Hurricane Katrina is a good example, since the flooding after the storm severely damaged New Orleans, while a similar storm in an unpopulated area would have done little damage. 
Thunderstorms 	  Thunderstorms are extremely common: Worldwide there are 14 million per year; thats 40,000 per day! Most drop a lot of rain on a small area quickly, but some are severe and highly damaging. Thunderstorms form when ground temperatures are high, ordinarily in the late afternoon or early evening in spring and summer. The Figure 16.19 show two stages of thunderstorm buildup. (a) As temperatures increase, warm, moist air rises. These updrafts first form cumulus and then cumulonimbus clouds. (b) Winds at the top of the stratosphere blow the cloud top sideways to make the anvil shape that characterizes a cloud as a thunderhead. As water vapor condenses to form a cloud, the latent heat makes the air in the cloud warmer than the air outside the cloud. Water droplets and ice fly up through the cloud in updrafts. When these droplets get heavy enough, they fall. This starts a downdraft, and soon there is a convection cell within the cloud. The cloud grows into a cumulonimbus giant. Eventually, the drops become large enough to fall to the ground. At this time, the thunderstorm is mature, and it produces gusty winds, lightning, heavy precipitation, and hail ( Figure 16.20). The downdrafts cool the air at the base of the cloud, so the air is no longer warm enough to rise. As a result, convection shuts down. Without convection, water vapor does not condense, no latent heat is released, and the thunderhead runs out of energy. A thunderstorm usually ends only 15 to 30 minutes after it begins, but other thunderstorms may start in the same area. With severe thunderstorms, the downdrafts are so intense that when they hit the ground it sends warm air from the ground upward into the storm. The warm air gives the convection cells more energy. Rain and hail grow huge before gravity pulls them to Earth. Severe thunderstorms can last for hours and can cause a lot of damage because of high winds, flooding, intense hail, and tornadoes. Thunderstorms can form individually or in squall lines along a cold front. In the United States, squall lines form in spring and early summer in the Midwest where the maritime tropical (mT) air mass from the Gulf of Mexico meets the continental polar (cP) air mass from Canada ( Figure 16.21). So much energy collects in cumulonimbus clouds that a huge release of electricity, called lightning, may result ( Figure 16.22). The electrical discharge may be between one part of the cloud and another, two clouds, or a cloud and the ground. A key ingredient of thunderstorms is explored in this National Geographic Video, Natural Disaster, Landslides, and Cold air from the Rockies collided with warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to form this squall line. more: Lightning 101 (2:38) at URL ers/landslides-and-more/lightning/ . Lightning heats the air so that it expands explosively. The loud clap is thunder. Light waves travel so rapidly that lightning is seen instantly. Sound waves travel much more slowly, so a thunderclap may come many seconds after the lightning is spotted. Thunderstorms kill approximately 200 people in the United States and injure about 550 Americans per year, mostly from lightning strikes. Have you heard the common misconception that lightning doesnt strike the same place twice? In fact, lightning strikes the New York Citys Empire State Building about 100 times per year ( Figure An online guide to severe storms from the University of Illinois is found here: URL Gh%29/guides/mtr/svr/home.rxml . Lightning behind the town of Diamond Head, Hawaii. 
Tornadoes 	  Tornadoes, also called twisters, are fierce products of severe thunderstorms ( Figure 16.24). As air in a thunderstorm rises, the surrounding air races in to fill the gap, forming a funnel. A tornado lasts from a few seconds to several hours. The average wind speed is about 177 kph (110 mph), but some winds are much faster. A tornado travels over the ground at about 45 km per hour (28 miles per hour) and goes about 25 km (16 miles) before losing energy and disappearing ( Figure 16.25). An individual tornado strikes a small area, but it can destroy everything in its path. Most injuries and deaths from tornadoes are caused by flying debris ( Figure 16.26). In the United States an average of 90 people are killed by tornadoes each year. The most violent two percent of tornadoes account for 70% of the deaths by tornadoes. Tornadoes form at the front of severe thunderstorms. Lines of these thunderstorms form in the spring where where maritime tropical (mT) and continental polar (cP) air masses meet. Although there is an average of 770 tornadoes annually, the number of tornadoes each year varies greatly ( Figure 16.27). In late April 2011, the situation was ripe for the deadliest set of tornadoes in 25 years. In addition to the meeting of cP and mT mentioned above, the jet stream was blowing strongly in from the west. The result was more than 150 tornadoes reported throughout the day ( Figure 16.28). The entire region was alerted to the possibility of tornadoes in those late April days. But meteorologists can only predict tornado danger over a very wide region. No one can tell exactly where and when a tornado will touch down. Once a tornado is sighted on radar, its path is predicted and a warning is issued to people in that area. The exact path is unknown because tornado movement is not very predictable. Tornado catchers capture footage inside a tornado on this National Geographic video: URL c.com/ngm/0506/feature6/multimedia.html . The intensity of tornadoes is measured on the Fujita Scale (see Table 16.1), which assigns a value based on wind speed and damage.

The red region that starts in Texas and covers Oklahoma, Nebraska, and South Dakota is called Tornado Alley because it is where most of the violent tornadoes occur. The severe thunderstorms pictured in this satellite image spawned the deadliest set of tornadoes in more than 25 years on April 27-28, 2011. The cold air mass is shown by the mostly continuous clouds. Warm moist air blowing north from the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico is indicated by small low clouds. Thunderstorms are indicated by bright white patches. 
Cyclones 	  Cyclones can be the most intense storms on Earth. A cyclone is a system of winds rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere around a low pressure center. The swirling air rises and cools, creating clouds and precipitation. There are two types of cyclones: middle latitude (mid-latitude) cyclones and tropical cyclones. Mid-latitude cyclones are the main cause of winter storms in the middle latitudes. Tropical cyclones are also known as hurricanes. An anticyclone is the opposite of a cyclone. An anticyclones winds rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere around a center of high pressure. Air comes in from above and sinks to the ground. High pressure centers generally have fair weather. 
Mid- Latitude  Cyclones 	  Mid-latitude cyclones, sometimes called extratropical cyclones, form at the polar front when the temperature difference between two air masses is large. These air masses blow past each other in opposite directions. Coriolis Effect deflects winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, causing the winds to strike the polar front at an angle. Warm and cold fronts form next to each other. Most winter storms in the middle latitudes, including most of the United States and Europe, are caused by mid-latitude cyclones ( Figure 16.29). A hypothetical mid-latitude cyclone affecting the United Kingdom. The arrows point the wind direction and its relative temperature; L is the low pressure area. Notice the warm, cold, and occluded fronts. The warm air at the cold front rises and creates a low pressure cell. Winds rush into the low pressure and create a rising column of air. The air twists, rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Since the rising air is moist, rain or snow falls. Mid-latitude cyclones form in winter in the mid-latitudes and move eastward with the westerly winds. These twoto five-day storms can reach 1,000 to 2,500 km (625 to 1,600 miles) in diameter and produce winds up to 125 km (75 miles) per hour. Like tropical cyclones, they can cause extensive beach erosion and flooding. Mid-latitude cyclones are especially fierce in the mid-Atlantic and New England states where they are called noreasters, because they come from the northeast. About 30 noreasters strike the region each year. ( Figure The 1993 Storm of the Century was a noreaster that covered the entire eastern seaboard of the United States. An online guide to mid-latitude cyclones from the University of Illinois is found here: URL .edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/cyc/home.rxml . 
Hurricanes 	  Tropical cyclones have many names. They are called hurricanes in the North Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans, typhoons in the western Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean, and willi-willis in the waters near Australia ( Figure 16.31). By any name, they are the most damaging storms on Earth. Hurricanes arise in the tropical latitudes (between 10 and 25N) in summer and autumn when sea surface temperature are 28C (82F) or higher. The warm seas create a large humid air mass. The warm air rises and forms a low pressure cell, known as a tropical depression. Thunderstorms materialize around the tropical depression. If the temperature reaches or exceeds 28C (82F) the air begins to rotate around the low pressure (counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere). As the air rises, water vapor condenses, releasing energy from latent heat. If wind shear is low, the storm builds into a hurricane within two to three days. A cross-sectional view of a hurricane. Hurricanes are huge with high winds. The exception is the relatively calm eye of the storm where air is rising upward. Rainfall can be as high as 2.5 cm (1") per hour, resulting in about 20 billion metric tons of water released daily in a hurricane. The release of latent heat generates enormous amounts of energy, nearly the total annual electrical power consumption of the United States from one storm. Hurricanes can also generate tornadoes. Hurricanes are assigned to categories based on their wind speed. The categories are listed on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale ( Table 16.2).

In the Northern Hemisphere, they originate in the trade winds and move to the west. When they reach the latitude of the westerlies, they switch direction and travel toward the north or northeast. Hurricanes may cover 800 km (500 miles) in one day. Damage from hurricanes comes from the high winds, rainfall, and storm surge. Storm surge occurs as the storms low pressure center comes onto land, causing the sea level to rise unusually high. A storm surge is often made worse by the hurricanes high winds blowing seawater across the ocean onto the shoreline. Flooding can be devastating, especially along low-lying coastlines such as the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Hurricane Camille in 1969 had a 7.3 m (24 foot) storm surge that traveled 125 miles (200 km) inland. Hurricanes typically last for 5 to 10 days. Over cooler water or land, the hurricanes latent heat source shut downs and the storm weakens. When a hurricane disintegrates, it is replaced with intense rains and tornadoes. Hurricanes are explored in a set of National Geographic videos found at National Geographic Video, Natural disaster, Hurricanes: Hurricanes 101 is an introduction to the topic. How Katrina Formed looks at the history of Hurricane Katrina as it formed and passed through the Gulf coast. Follow that up with Doomed New Orleans, which explores how the devastation to the city is a man-made disaster. The Hurricane Ike of 1900 looks at what happened in the days when there was little warning before a hurricane hit a coastal city. There are about 100 hurricanes around the world each year, plus many smaller tropical storms and tropical depressions. As people develop coastal regions, property damage from storms continues to rise. However, scientists are becoming better at predicting the paths of these storms and fatalities are decreasing. There is, however, one major exception to the previous statement: Hurricane Katrina. Lots of information about hurricanes is found in this online guide from the University of Illinois: URL mos.uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/hurr/home.rxml . The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the longest, costliest, and deadliest hurricane season so far. Total damage from all the storms together was estimated at more than $128 billion, with more than 2,280 deaths. Hurricane Katrina was both the most destructive hurricane and the most costly ( Figure 16.32 and Figure 16.33). Hurricane Katrina nears its peak strength as it travels across the Gulf of Mexico.

Blizzards and  Lake- Effect  Snow 	  A blizzard is distinguished by certain conditions ( Figure 16.34): Temperatures below 7C (20F); 12C (10F) for a severe blizzard. Winds greater than 56 kmh (35 mph); 72 kmh (45 mph) for a severe blizzard. Snow so heavy that visibility is 2/5 km (1/4 mile) or less for at least three hours; near zero visibility for a severe blizzard. Blizzards happen across the middle latitudes and toward the poles, usually as part of a mid-latitude cyclone. Blizzards are most common in winter, when the jet stream has traveled south and a cold, northern air mass comes into contact with a warmer, semitropical air mass ( Figure 16.35). The very strong winds develop because of the pressure gradient between the low pressure storm and the higher pressure west of the storm. Snow produced by the storm gets caught in the winds and blows nearly horizontally. Blizzards can also produce sleet or freezing rain. Flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina caused the levees to break and water to pour through the city. A near white out in a blizzard in Massachusetts. Blizzard snows blanket the East Coast of the United States in February 2010. In winter, a continental polar air mass travels down from Canada. As the frigid air travels across one of the Great Lakes, it warms and absorbs moisture. When the air mass reaches the leeward side of the lake, it is very unstable and it drops tremendous amounts of snow. This lake-effect snow falls on the snowiest, metropolitan areas in the United States: Buffalo and Rochester, New York ( Figure 16.36). Frigid air travels across the Great Lakes and dumps lake-effect snow on the leeward side. 
Heat  Wave 	  Even more insidious are the deadliest weather phenomena, a heat wave. A heat wave is different for different locations; it is a long period of hot weather, at least 86F (30C) for at least three days in cooler locations but much more in hotter locations. Heat waves have increased in frequency and duration in recent years. What do you think caused the heat wave in the Figure 16.37? A high pressure zone kept the jet stream further north than normal for August. A heat wave over the United States as indicated by heat radiated from the ground. The bright yellow areas are the hottest and the blue and white are coolest. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Thunderstorms arise over warm ground when updrafts form cumulonimbus clouds that rain and hail. Tornadoes form most commonly from thunderstorms. They are relatively short-lived and small, but they do an enormous amount of damage where they strike. Cyclones of all sorts are large and damaging; they include noreasters and hurricanes.

How would the damage done by Hurricane Katrina have been different if the storm had taken place 100 years ago? What knowledge do meteorologists need to better understand storms? List some of the instruments that meteorologists use to collect weather data. Describe how these instruments are used to collect weather data from many geographic locations and many altitudes. Discuss the role of satellites and computers in modern weather forecasting. Describe how meteorologists develop accurate weather forecasts. barometer isobars isotachs isotherms radar radiosonde thermometer weather map 
Introduction 	  Weather forecasts are better than they ever have been. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a 5-day weather forecast today is as reliable as a 2-day forecast was 20 years ago! This is because forecasters now use advanced technologies to gather weather data, along with the worlds most powerful computers. Together, the data and computers produce complex models that more accurately represent the conditions of the atmosphere. These models can be programmed to predict how the atmosphere and the weather will change. Despite these advances, weather forecasts are still often incorrect. Weather is extremely difficult to predict because it is a complex and chaotic system. 
Collecting  Weather  Data 	  To make a weather forecast, the conditions of the atmosphere must be known for that location and for the surrounding area. Temperature, air pressure, and other characteristics of the atmosphere must be measured and the data collected. 
Thermometer 	  Thermometers measure temperature. In an old-style mercury thermometer, mercury is placed in a long, very narrow tube with a bulb. Because mercury is temperature sensitive, it expands when temperatures are high and contracts when they are low. A scale on the outside of the thermometer matches up with the air temperature. Some modern thermometers use a coiled strip composed of two kinds of metal, each of which conducts heat differently. As the temperature rises and falls, the coil unfolds or curls up tighter. Other modern thermometers measure infrared radiation or electrical resistance. Modern thermometers usually produce digital data that can be fed directly into a computer. 
Barometer 	  Meteorologists use barometers to measure air pressure ( Figure 16.38). A barometer may contain water, air, or mercury, but like thermometers, barometers are now mostly digital. A change in barometric pressure indicates that a change in weather is coming. If air pressure rises, a high pressure cell is on the way and clear skies can be expected. If pressure falls, a low pressure cell is coming and will likely bring storm clouds. Barometric pressure data over a larger area can be used to identify pressure systems, fronts, and other weather systems. 
Weather  Stations 	  Weather stations contain some type of thermometer and barometer. Other instruments measure different characteristics of the atmosphere such as wind speed, wind direction, humidity, and amount of precipitation. These instruments are placed in various locations so that they can check the atmospheric characteristics of that location ( Figure 16.39). According to the WMO, weather information is collected from 15 satellites, 100 stationary buoys, 600 drifting buoys, 3,000 aircraft, 7,300 ships, and some 10,000 land-based stations. A land-based weather station. Weather stations are located on land, the surface of the sea, and in orbit all around the world. 
Radiosondes 	  Radiosondes measure atmospheric characteristics, such as temperature, pressure, and humidity as they move through the air ( Figure 16.40). Radiosondes in flight can be tracked to obtain wind speed and direction. Radiosondes use a radio to communicate the data they collect to a computer. A weather balloon with a radiosonde beneath it. The radiosonde is the bottom piece and the parachute that will bring it to the ground is above it. Radiosondes are launched from about 800 sites around the globe twice daily to provide a profile of the atmosphere. Radiosondes can be dropped from a balloon or airplane to make measurements as they fall. This is done to monitor storms, for example, since they are dangerous places for airplanes to fly. 
Radar 	  Radar stands for Radio Detection and Ranging ( Figure 16.41). A transmitter sends out radio waves that bounce off the nearest object and then return to a receiver. Weather radar can sense many characteristics of precipitation: its location, motion, intensity, and the likelihood of future precipitation. Doppler radar can also track how fast the precipitation falls. Radar can outline the structure of a storm and can be used to estimate its possible effects. Radar view of a line of thunderstorms. 
Satellites 	  Weather satellites have been increasingly important sources of weather data since the first one was launched in 1952. Weather satellites are the best way to monitor large scale systems, such as storms. Satellites are able to record long-term changes, such as the amount of ice cover over the Arctic Ocean in September each year. Weather satellites may observe all energy from all wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light images record storms, clouds, fires, and smog. Infrared images record clouds, water and land temperatures, and features of the ocean, such as ocean currents ( Figure 16.42). An online guide to weather forecasting from the University of Illinois is found here: URL /%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/fcst/home.rxml . 
Numerical  Weather  Prediction 	  The most accurate weather forecasts are made by advanced computers, with analysis and interpretation added by experienced meteorologists. These computers have up-to-date mathematical models that can use much more data and make many more calculations than would ever be possible by scientists working with just maps and calculators. Meteorologists can use these results to give much more accurate weather forecasts and climate predictions. In Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), atmospheric data from many sources are plugged into supercomputers running complex mathematical models ( Figure 16.43). The models then calculate what will happen over time at various altitudes for a grid of evenly spaced locations. The grid points are usually between 10 and 200 kilometers apart. Using the results calculated by the model, the program projects weather further into the future. It then uses these results to project the weather still further into the future, as far as the meteorologists want to go. Once a forecast is made, it is broadcast by satellites to more than 1,000 sites around the world. NWP produces the most accurate weather forecasts, but as anyone knows, even the best forecasts are not always right. Weather prediction is extremely valuable for reducing property damage and even fatalities. If the proposed track of a hurricane can be predicted, people can try to secure their property and then evacuate ( Figure 16.44). using numerical A weather forecast weather prediction. By predicting Hurricane Ritas path, it is likely that lives were saved. 
Weather  Maps 	  Weather maps simply and graphically depict meteorological conditions in the atmosphere. Weather maps may display only one feature of the atmosphere or multiple features. They can depict information from computer models or from human observations. On a weather map, important meteorological conditions are plotted for each weather station. Meteorologists use many different symbols as a quick and easy way to display information on the map ( Figure 16.45). Explanation of some symbols that may appear on a weather map. Once conditions have been plotted, points of equal value can be connected by isolines. Weather maps can have many types of connecting lines. For example: Lines of equal temperature are called isotherms. Isotherms show temperature gradients and can indicate the location of a front. In terms of precipitation, what does the 0C (32F) isotherm show? An animation on how to contour isotherms is seen here: Contouring isotherms URL du/public/meteo/meteo101demo/Examples/Shockwave/contouring0203.dcr . Isobars are lines of equal average air pressure at sea level ( Figure 16.46). Closed isobars represent the locations of high and low pressure cells. Isobars can be used to help visualize high pressure (H) and low pressure (L) cells. Isotachs are lines of constant wind speed. Where the minimum values occur high in the atmosphere, tropical cyclones may develop. The highest wind speeds can be used to locate the jet stream. Surface weather analysis maps are weather maps that only show conditions on the ground ( Figure 16.47). An online guide about to how to read weather maps from the University of Illinois is found here: URL mos.uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/maps/home.rxml . More about remote sensing of weather is discussed in this online guide: URL 9/guides/rs/home.rxml . 
Lesson  Summary 	  Weather forecasts are more accurate than ever before. Older instruments and data collection methods, such as radiosondes and weather balloons, are still used. Surface analysis maps may show sea level mean pressure, temperature, and amount of cloud cover. Satellites and computers create much more detailed and accurate forecasts. Forecasts are often wrong, particularly those that predict the weather for several days.

S  Climate 	  Clouds trap solar energy, which helps to warm the atmosphere. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and could build up even more clouds. These clouds would then trap more heat and...well, you get the idea. This is called a positive feedback mechanism. There are many positive feedback mechanisms in climate change. Another is albedo. As temperatures warm, snow and ice melt. This reduces albedo, which causes temperatures to warm and more snow and ice to melt. Clouds also reflect energy and shade the land. This would help to reduce global temperatures. So scientists are not sure what the net effect of clouds on global temperatures is. Clouds are the second biggest uncertainty in climate models. The biggest is in how peoples behavior will change, to change human impacts on the atmosphere. Courtesy of Rob Simmon and NASA. earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=44250. Public Domain.

Introduction 	  Although almost anything can happen with the weather, climate is more predictable. The weather on a particular winter day in San Diego may be colder than on the same day in Lake Tahoe, but, on average, Tahoes winter climate is significantly colder than San Diegos ( Figure 17.1). Climate then is the long-term average of weather. Good climate is why we choose to vacation in Hawaii in February, even though the weather is not guaranteed to be good! Lake Tahoes climate makes it easy to predict that there will be snow in the winter. What is Climate? Climate is the average of weather in that location over a long period of time, usually for at least 30 years. A locations climate can be described by its air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and the type, quantity, and frequency of precipitation. Climate can change, but only over long periods of time. The climate of a region depends on its position relative to many things. These factors are described in the next sections. 
Latitude 	  The main factor influencing the climate of a region is latitude because different latitudes receive different amounts of solar radiation. To review from the Earths Atmosphere chapter: The equator receives the most solar radiation. Days are equally long year-round and the sun is just about directly overhead at midday. The polar regions receive the least solar radiation. The night lasts six months during the winter. Even in summer, the sun never rises very high in the sky. Sunlight filters through a thick wedge of atmosphere, making the sunlight much less intense. The high albedo, because of ice and snow, reflects a good portion of the suns light. 
Atmospheric  Circulation  Cells 	  Recall from the Earths Atmosphere chapter the circulation cells and global wind belts ( Figure 17.2): The atmospheric circulation cells and their relationships to air movement on the ground. The position of a region relative to the circulation cells and wind belts has a great effect on its climate. In an area where the air is mostly rising or sinking, there is not much wind. 
The  	  The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is the low pressure area near the equator in the boundary between the two Hadley Cells. The air rises so that it cools and condenses to create clouds and rain ( Figure 17.3). Climate along the ITCZ is therefore warm and wet. Early mariners called this region the doldrums because their ships were often unable to sail because there were no steady winds. The ITCZ can easily be seen where thunderstorms are lined up north of the equator. The ITCZ migrates slightly with the season. Land areas heat more quickly than the oceans. Because there are more land areas in the Northern Hemisphere, the ITCZ is influenced by the heating effect of the land. In Northern Hemisphere summer, it is approximately 5 north of the equator while in the winter it shifts back and is approximately at the equator. As the ITCZ shifts, the major wind belts also shift slightly north in summer and south in winter, which causes the wet and dry seasons in this area ( Figure 17.4). Seasonal differences in the location of the ITCZ are shown on this map. 
Hadley  Cell and  Ferrell  Cell  Boundary 	  At about 30N and 30S, the air is fairly warm and dry because much of it came from the equator where it lost most of its moisture at the ITCZ. At this location the air is descending, and sinking air warms and causes evaporation Mariners named this region the horse latitudes. Sailing ships were sometimes delayed for so long by the lack of wind that they would run out of water and food for their livestock. Sailors tossed horses and other animals over the side after they died. Sailors sometimes didnt make it either. 
Ferrell  Cell and  Polar  Cell  Boundary 	  The polar front is around 50 to 60, where cold air from the poles meets warmer air from the tropics. The meeting of the two different air masses causes the polar jet stream, which is known for its stormy weather. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the shift in the angle of incoming sunlight causes the polar jet stream to move. Cities to the south of the polar jet stream will be under warmer, moister air than cities to its north. Directly beneath the jet stream, the weather is often stormy and there may be thunderstorms and tornadoes. 
Prevailing  Winds 	  The prevailing winds are the bases of the Hadley, Ferrell, and Polar Cells. These winds greatly influence the climate of a region because they bring the weather from the locations they come from. For example, in California, the predominant winds are the westerlies blowing in from the Pacific Ocean, which bring in relatively cool air in summer and relatively warm air in winter. Local winds also influence local climate. For example, land breezes and sea breezes moderate coastal temperatures. 
Continental  Position 	  When a particular location is near an ocean or large lake, the body of water plays an extremely important role in affecting the regions climate. A maritime climate is strongly influenced by the nearby sea. Temperatures vary a relatively small amount seasonally and daily. For a location to have a true maritime climate, the winds must most frequently come off the sea. A continental climate is more extreme, with greater temperature differences between day and night and between summer and winter. The oceans influence in moderating climate can be seen in the following temperature comparisons. Each of these cities is located at 37N latitude, within the westerly winds ( Figure 17.5). How does the ocean influence the climate of these three cities? 
Ocean  Currents 	  The temperature of the water offshore influences the temperature of a coastal location, particularly if the winds come off the sea. The cool waters of the California Current bring cooler temperatures to the California coastal region. Coastal upwelling also brings cold, deep water up to the ocean surface off of California, which contributes to the cool coastal temperatures. Further north, in southern Alaska, the upwelling actually raises the temperature of the surrounding land because the ocean water is much warmer than the land. The important effect of the Gulf Stream on the climate of northern Europe is described in the chapter, Earths Oceans. 
Altitude and  Mountain  Ranges 	  Air pressure  and air temperature  decrease with altitude. The closer molecules are packed together, the more likely they are to collide. Collisions between molecules give off heat, which warms the air. At higher altitudes, the air is less dense and air molecules are more spread out and less likely to collide. A location in the mountains has lower average temperatures than one at the base of the mountains. In Colorado, for example, Lakewood (5,640 feet) average annual temperature is 62F (17C), while Climax Lake (11,300 feet) is 42F (5.4C). Mountain ranges have two effects on the climate of the surrounding region: rainshadow effect, which brings warm dry climate to the leeward size of a mountain range, was described in the Earths Atmosphere chapter ( Figure 17.6). separation in the coastal region from the rest of the continent. Since a maritime air mass may have trouble rising over a mountain range, the coastal area will have a maritime climate but the inland area on the leeward side will have a continental climate. The Bonneville Salt Flats are part of the very dry Great Basin of the Sierra Nevada of California. The region receives little rainfall. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A regions position on the globe and on a continent determines its fundamental climate. Latitude determines a locations solar radiation and location within the wind belts. If a region is near a large water body, its climate will be influenced by that water body. Mountain ranges separate land areas from the oceans and create rainshadow effect, which influences climate. Describe how two cities at the same latitude can have very different climates. For example, Tucson, Arizona, has a hot, dry desert climate and New Orleans, Louisiana, has a warm, muggy climate even though both cities are at approximately the same latitude. How does climate influence the plants and animals that live in a particular place? Would you expect climate at similar latitudes to be the same or different on the opposite side of the equator. For example, how would the climate of a city at 45N be similar or different to one at 45S latitude? Describe the relationship between the climate zones and the factors that influence climate. Discuss the relationship between climate zones and biomes. Discuss the different biomes based on a general description. biodiversity biome chaparral desert ice cap microclimate permafrost savanna steppe taiga tropical rainforest tundra 
Introduction 	  A climate zone results from the climate conditions of an area: its temperature, humidity, amount and type of precipitation, and the season. A climate zone is reflected in a regions natural vegetation. Perceptive travelers can figure out which climate zone they are in by looking at the vegetation, even if the weather is unusual for the climate on that day. 
Climate  Zones and  Biomes 	  The major factors that influence climate determine the different climate zones. In general, the same type of climate zone will be found at similar latitudes and in similar positions on nearly all continents, both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The one exception to this pattern is the climate zones called the continental climates, which are not found at higher latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. This is because the Southern Hemisphere land masses are not wide enough to produce a continental climate. Five factors that Affect Climate takes a very thorough look at what creates the climate zones. The climate of a region allows certain plants to grow, creating an ecological biome (5f, 6a, 6b): URL xrrBV8 (5:23). Climate zones are classified by the Kppen classification system. This system is based on the temperature, the amount of precipitation, and the times of year when precipitation occurs. Since climate determines the type of vegetation that grows in an area, vegetation is used as an indicator of climate type. A climate type and its plants and animals make up a biome. The organisms of a biome share certain characteristics around the world, because their environment has similar advantages and challenges. The organisms have adapted to that environment in similar ways over time. For example, different species of cactus live on different continents, but they have adapted to the harsh desert in similar ways ( Figure 17.7). The similarities between climate zones and biome types are displayed in this video (5e): URL atch?v=Z_THTbynoRA (1:01). The Kppen classification system recognizes five major climate groups, each with a distinct capital letter A through E. Each lettered group is divided into subcategories. Some of these subcategories are forest (f), monsoon (m), and wet/dry (w) types, based on the amount of precipitation and season when that precipitation occurs ( Figure 17.8). Tropical Moist Climates (Group A) Tropical Moist (Group A) climates are found in a band about 15 to 25 N and S of the equator ( Figure 17.9). What climate characteristics is the tropical moist climate group likely to have? Temperature: Intense sunshine; each month has an average temperature of at least 18C (64F). Rainfall: Abundant, at least 150 cm (59 inches) per year. The subcategories of this zone are based on when the rain falls. Tropical Wet (Af) The wet tropics have almost no annual temperature variation and tremendous amounts of rain fall year round, between 175 and 250 cm (65 and 100 inches). These conditions support the tropical rainforest biome ( Figure 17.10). Tropical rainforests are dominated by densely packed, broadleaf evergreen trees. These rainforests have the highest number of species or biodiversity of any ecosystem. Tropical Moist Climates (Group A) are shown in red. The main vegetation for this climate is the tropical rainforest, as in the Amazon in South America, the Congo in Africa and the lands and islands of Southeast Asia. Tropical Monsoon (Am) The tropical monsoon climate has very low precipitation for one to two months each year. Rainforests grow here because the dry period is short, and the trees survive off of soil moisture. This climate is found where the monsoon winds blow, primarily in southern Asia, western Africa, and northeastern South America ( Figure 17.10). Tropical Wet and Dry (Aw) The tropical wet and dry climate lies between about 5 and 20 latitude, around the location of the ITCZ. In the summer, when the ITCZ drifts northward, the zone is wet. In the winter, when the ITCZ moves toward the equator, the region is dry. This climate exists where strong monsoon winds blow from land to sea, such as in India. Rainforests cannot survive the months of low rainfall, so the typical vegetation is savanna ( Figure 17.11). This biome consists mostly of grasses, with widely scattered deciduous trees and rare areas of denser forests. Central Africa is famous for its savanna and the unique animals that live there. A male lion stalks the African savanna. Dry Climates (Group B) The Dry Climates (Group B) have less precipitation than evaporation. Dry climate zones cover about 26% of the worlds land area ( Figure 17.12). Dry Climates (Group B) are shown in green and yellow. Low latitude deserts are found at the Ferrell cell high pressure zone. Higher latitude deserts occur within continents or in rainshadows. Vegetation is sparse but well adapted to the dry conditions. What climate characteristics is the dry climate group likely to have? Temperature: Abundant sunshine. Summer temperatures are high; winters are cooler and longer than Tropical Moist climates Rainfall: Irregular; several years of drought are often followed by a single year of abundant rainfall Arid Desert (Bw) Low-latitude, arid deserts are found between 15 to 30 N and S latitudes. This is where warm dry air sinks at high pressure zones. True deserts make up around 12% of the worlds lands ( Figure 17.13). The Sahara is the worlds largest desert, taking up much of northern Africa. The green band below the sandy Sahara is the Congo. In the Sonoran Desert of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, skies are clear. The typical weather is extremely hot summer days and cold winter nights. Although annual rainfall is less than 25 cm (10 inches), rain falls during two seasons. Pacific storms bring winter rains and monsoons bring summer rains. Since organisms do not have to go too many months without some rain, a unique group of plants and animals can survive in the Sonoran desert ( Figure 17.14). Plants in the Sonoran Desert are adapted to surviving long periods of drought. Cacti and shrubby plants have wide or deep roots to reach water after a rain. Some plants store water; others lie dormant as seeds and bloom after rain falls. Semi-arid or Steppe (Bs) Higher latitude semi-arid deserts, also called steppe, are found in continental interiors or in rainshadows. Semi-arid deserts receive between 20 and 40 cm (8 to 16 inches) of rain annually. The annual temperature range is large. In the United States, the Great Plains, portions of the southern California coast, and the Great Basin are semi-arid deserts ( Figure 17.15). The steppe biome has short bunch grass, scattered low bushes, sagebrush and few or no trees because there is not enough rain. The Great Basin in Utah illustrates the steppe biome. Moist Subtropical Mid-latitude (Group C) The Moist Subtropical Mid-latitude (Group C) climates are found along the coastal areas in the United States ( Figure 17.16). Moist Subtropical Mid-Latitude climates are shown in green. What climate characteristics is the moist subtropical group likely to have? Temperature: The coldest month ranges from just below freezing to almost balmy, between -3C and 18C (27 to 64F). Summers are mild with average temperatures above 10C (50F). Seasons are distinct. Rainfall: There is plentiful annual rainfall. This Ecosystem Ecology video lecture at U.C. Berkley outlines the factors that create climate zones and consequently the biomes (5f): URL (46:46). Dry Summer Subtropical or Mediterranean Climates (Cs) The Dry Summer Subtropical climate is found on the western sides of continents between 30 and 45 latitude. Annual rainfall is 30 to 90 cm (14 to 35 inches), most of which comes in the winter ( Figure 17.17). The Mediterranean Climate is also known as the Dry Summer Subtropical Climate. The climate is typical of coastal California, which sits beneath a summertime high pressure for about five months each year. Land and sea breezes make winters moderate and summers cool. Vegetation must survive long summer droughts ( Figure 17.18). The scrubby, woody vegetation that thrives in this climate is called chaparral. Humid Subtropical (Cfa) The Humid Subtropical climate zone is found mostly on the eastern sides of continents ( Figure 17.19). Rain falls throughout the year with annual averages between 80 and 165 cm (31 and 65 inches). Summer days are humid and hot, from the lower 30s up to 40C (mid-80s up to 104F). Afternoon and evening thunderstorms are common. These conditions are caused by warm tropical air passing over the hot continent. Winters are mild, but middle-latitude storms called cyclones may bring snow and rain. The southeastern United States, with its hot humid summers and mild, but frosty winters, is typical of this climate zone. Trees grow thickly because of the mild temperatures and high humidity. Pine forests are common in the lower latitudes, oak forests are common at higher latitudes. Marine West Coast Climate (Cfb) This climate lines western North America between 40 and 65 latitude, an area known as the Pacific Northwest ( Figure 17.20). Ocean winds bring mild winters and cool summers. The temperature range, both daily and annually, is fairly small. Rain falls year round, although summers are drier as the jet stream moves northward. Low clouds, fog, and drizzle are typical. In Western Europe the climate covers a larger region since no high mountains are near the coast to block wind blowing off the Atlantic. Continental Climates (Group D) Continental (Group D) climates are found in most of the North American interior from about 40N to 70N ( Figure 17.21). What climate characteristics is the continental group most likely to have? Temperature: The average temperature of the warmest month is higher than 10C (50F) and the coldest month is below -3C (-27F). Precipitation: Winters are cold and stormy (look at the latitude of this zone and see if you can figure out why). Snowfall is common and snow stays on the ground for long periods of time. Trees grow in continental climates, even though winters are extremely cold, because the average annual temperature is fairly mild. Continental climates are not found in the Southern Hemisphere because of the absence of a continent (a) The Pacific Northwest is marked by green forests. (b) Dense forests of Douglas fir thrive in the heavy rain and mild temperatures in the Pacific Northwest. Continental climates are shown in blue and purple. large enough to generate this effect. Humid Continental (Dfa, Dfb) The humid continental climates are found around the polar front in North America and Europe ( Figure 17.22). In the winter, middle-latitude cyclones bring chilly temperatures and snow. In the summer, westerly winds bring continental weather and warm temperatures. The average July temperature is often above 20C (70F). The region is typified by deciduous trees, which protect themselves in winter by losing their leaves. The two variations of this climate are based on summer temperatures. Dfa, long, hot summers: summer days may be over 38C (100F), nights are warm and the temperature range is large, perhaps as great as 31C (56F). The long summers and high humidity foster plant growth ( Figure The humid continental climate zone is found at about 60N latitude across much of the northeastern United States, southeastern Canada and middle Europe. Dfb, long, cool summers: summer temperatures and humidity are lower. Winter temperatures are below -18C (0F) for long periods. Parts of South Korea are in the humid continental climate zone. Subpolar (Dfc) The subpolar climate is dominated by the continental polar air that masses over the frigid continent ( Figure 17.22). Snowfall is light, but cold temperatures keep snow on the ground for months. Most of the approximately 50 cm (20 inches) of annual precipitation falls during summer cyclonic storms. The angle of the Suns rays is low but the Sun is visible in the sky for most or all of the day during the summer, so temperatures may get warm, but are rarely hot. These continental regions have extreme annual temperature ranges. The boreal, coniferous forests found in the subpolar climate are called taiga and have small, hardy, and widely spaced trees. Taiga vast forests stretch across Eurasia and North America ( Figure 17.24). The taiga of the Alaska Range in Alaska. Polar Climates (Group E) Polar climates are found across the continents that border the Arctic Ocean, Greenland, and Antarctica. What climate characteristics is the polar climate group most likely to have? Temperature: Winters are entirely dark and bitterly cold. Summer days are long, but the sun is low on the horizon so summers are cool. The average temperature of the warmest month at less than 10C (50F). The annual temperature range is large. Precipitation: The region is dry with less than 25 cm (10 inches) of precipitation annually; most precipitation occurs during the summer. Polar Tundra (ET) The polar tundra climate is continental, with severe winters ( Figure 17.25). Temperatures are so cold that a layer of permanently frozen ground, called permafrost forms below the surface. This frozen layer can extend hundreds of meters deep. The average temperature of the warmest months is above freezing, so summer temperatures defrost the uppermost portion of the permafrost. In winter, the permafrost prevents water from draining downward. In summer, the ground is swampy. Although the precipitation is low enough in many places to qualify as a desert, evaporation rates are also low, so the landscape receives more usable water than a desert. Because of the lack of ice-free land near the South Pole, there is very little tundra in the Southern Hemisphere ( Figure 17.26). The only plants that can survive the harsh winters and soggy summers are small ground-hugging plants like mosses, lichens, small shrubs, and scattered small trees that make up the tundra. 
Ice  Cap 	  Ice caps are found mostly on Greenland and Antarctica, about 9% of the Earths land area ( Figure 17.27). Ice caps may be thousands of meters thick. Ice cap areas have extremely low average annual temperatures, e.g. -29C (-20F) 
Polar tundra on the  North  Slope of  Alaska 	  (a) The area surrounding the Arctic Ocean is the only part of the globe with much tundra. (b) Roots cannot grow deep into the permafrost and conditions are harsh so plants are small. Tundra loses its green in the fall, as mosses and leaves turn brown. at Eismitte, Greenland. Precipitation is low because the air is too cold to hold much moisture. Snow occasionally falls in the summer. 
Microclimates 	  When climate conditions in a small area are different from those of the surroundings, the climate of the small area is called a microclimate. The microclimate of a valley may be cool relative to its surroundings since cold air sinks. The ground surface may be hotter or colder than the air a few feet above it, because rock and soil gain and lose heat readily. Different sides of a mountain will have different microclimates. In the Northern Hemisphere, a south-facing slope receives more solar energy than a north-facing slope, so each side supports different amounts and types of vegetation. Altitude mimics latitude in climate zones ( Figure 17.28). Climates and biomes typical of higher latitudes may be found in other areas of the world at high altitudes.

At the top of the mountain is tundra and a small glacier. At lower elevation are thick forests with savannah surrounding the base of the mountain. This is a 3-D radar image. 
Lesson  Summary 	  A climate zone depends on a regions latitude, continental position, and relationship to prevailing winds, large water bodies, and mountains, among other factors. The temperature, rainfall, length of dry season, and other features of the climate zone determine which plants can grow. When living organisms develop in similar climates, they must adapt to that same environment. Because the organisms are so similar, a climate zone and its organisms make up a biome. Why arent biomes always determined by latitude?	What geographic features or other factors affect the climate? Climate zones and biomes depend on many climate features. If climate changes, which of these features changes too? If global warming is increasing average global temperatures, how would you expect biomes to be affected? Describe some ways that climate change has been an important part of Earth history. Discuss what factors can cause climate to change and which of these can be exacerbated by human activities. Discuss the consequences of rising greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, the impacts that are already being measured, and the impacts that are likely to occur in the future.

Introduction 	  For the past two centuries, climate has been relatively stable. People placed their farms and cities in locations that were in a favorable climate without thinking that the climate could change. But climate has changed throughout Earth history, and a stable climate is not the norm. In recent years, Earths climate has begun to change again. Most of this change is warming because of human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The effects of warming are already being seen and will become more extreme as temperature rise. 
Climate  Change in  Earth  History 	  Climate has changed throughout Earth history. Much of the time Earths climate was hotter and more humid than it is today, but climate has also been colder, as when glaciers covered much more of the planet. The most recent ice ages were in the Pleistocene Epoch, between 1.8 million and 10,000 years ago ( Figure 17.29). Glaciers advanced and retreated in cycles, known as glacial and interglacial periods. With so much of the worlds water bound into the ice, sea level was about 125 meters (395 feet) lower than it is today. Many scientists think that we are now in a warm, interglacial period that has lasted about 10,000 years. For the past 1500 years, climate has been relatively mild and stable when compared with much of Earths history. Why has climate stability been beneficial for human civilization? Stability has allowed the expansion of agriculture and the development of towns and cities. Fairly small temperature changes can have major effects on global climate. The average global temperature during glacial periods was only about 5.5C (10F) less than Earths current average temperature. Temperatures during the interglacial periods were about 1.1C (2.0F) higher than today ( Figure 17.30). Since the end of the Pleistocene, the global average temperature has risen about 4C (7F). Glaciers are retreating and sea level is rising. While climate is getting steadily warmer, there have been a few more extreme warm and cool times in the last 10,000 years. Changes in climate have had effects on human civilization. The Medieval Warm Period from 900 to 1300 A.D. allowed Vikings to colonize Greenland and Great Britain to grow wine grapes. The Little Ice Age, from the 14th to 19th centuries, the Vikings were forced out of Greenland and humans had to plant crops further south. The graph is a compilation of 5 reconstructions (the green line is the mean of the five records) of mean temperature changes. This illustrates the high temperatures of the Medieval Warm Period, the lows of the Little Ice Age, and the very high (and climbing) temperature of this decade. 
Short- Term  Climate  Changes 	  Short-term changes in climate are common ( Figure 17.31). The largest and most important of these is the oscillation between El Nio and La Nia conditions. This cycle is called the ENSO (El Nio southern oscillation). The ENSO drives changes in climate that are felt around the world about every two to seven years. In a normal year, the trade winds blow across the Pacific Ocean near the equator from east to west (toward Asia). A low pressure cell rises above the western equatorial Pacific. Warm water in the western Pacific Ocean and raises sea levels by one-half meter. Along the western coast of South America, the Peru Current carries cold water northward, and then westward along the equator with the trade winds. Upwelling brings cold, nutrient-rich waters from the deep sea. Under normal conditions, low pressure and warm water (shown in red) build up in the western Pacific Ocean. Notice that continents are shown in brown in the image. North and South America are on the right in this image. In an El Nio year, when water temperature reaches around 28C (82F), the trade winds weaken or reverse direction and blow east (toward South America) ( Figure 17.32). Warm water is dragged back across the Pacific Ocean and piles up off the west coast of South America. With warm, low-density water at the surface, upwelling stops. Without upwelling, nutrients are scarce and plankton populations decline. Since plankton form the base of the food web, fish cannot find food, and fish numbers decrease as well. All the animals that eat fish, including birds and humans, are affected by the decline in fish. By altering atmospheric and oceanic circulation, El Nio events change global climate patterns. Some regions receive more than average rainfall, including the west coast of North and South America, the southern United States, and Western Europe. Drought occurs in other parts of South America, the western Pacific, southern and northern Africa, and southern Europe. An El Nio cycle lasts one to two years. Often normal circulation patterns resume. Sometimes circulation patterns bounce back quickly and extremely ( Figure 17.33). This is a La Nia. In a La Nia year, as in a normal year, trade winds moves from east to west and warm water piles up in the western Pacific Ocean. Ocean temperatures along coastal South America are colder than normal (instead of warmer, as in El Nio). Cold water reaches farther into the western Pacific than normal. In El Nio conditions, the trade winds weaken or reverse directions. Warm water moves eastward across the Pacific Ocean and piles up against South America. A La Nia year is like a normal year but the circulation patters are more extreme. An online guide to El Nio and La Nia events from the University of Illinois is found here: URL uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/eln/home.rxml . Other important oscillations are smaller and have a local, rather than global, effect. The North Atlantic Oscillation mostly alters climate in Europe. The Mediterranean also goes through cycles, varying between being dry at some times, and warm and wet at others. The ABC News video explores the relationship of El Nio to global warming. El Nio is named as the cause of strange weather across the United States in the winter of 2007 in this video (5g): URL ?v=5uk9nwtAOio (3:33). 
Causes of  Long-term  Climate  Change 	  Many processes can cause climate to change. These include changes: in the amount of energy the Sun produces over years. in the positions of the continents over millions of years. in the tilt of Earths axis and orbit over thousands of years. that are sudden and dramatic because of random catastrophic events, such as a large asteroid impact. in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused naturally or by human activities. 
Solar  Variation 	  The amount of energy the Sun radiates is variable. Sunspots are magnetic storms on the Suns surface that increase and decrease over an 11-year cycle ( Figure 17.34). When the number of sunspots is high, solar radiation is also relatively high. But the entire variation in solar radiation is tiny relative to the total amount of solar radiation that there is and there is no known 11-year cycle in climate variability. The Little Ice Age corresponded to a time when there were no sunspots on the Sun. 
Plate  Tectonics 	  Plate tectonic movements can alter climate. Over millions of years as seas open and close, ocean currents may distribute heat differently. For example, when all the continents are joined into one supercontinent (such as Pangaea), nearly all locations experience a continental climate. When the continents separate, heat is more evenly distributed. Plate tectonic movements may help start an ice age. When continents are located near the poles, ice can accumulate, which may increase albedo and lower global temperature. Low enough temperatures may start a global ice age. Plate motions trigger volcanic eruptions, which release dust and CO2 into the atmosphere. Ordinary eruptions, even large ones, have only a short-term effect on weather ( Figure 17.35). Massive eruptions of the fluid lavas that create lava plateaus release much more gas and dust, and can change climate for many years. This type of eruption is exceedingly rare; none has occurred since humans have lived on Earth. 
Milankovitch  Cycles 	  The most extreme climate of recent Earth history was the Pleistocene. Scientists attribute a series of ice ages to variation in the Earths position relative to the Sun, known as Milankovitch cycles. The Earth goes through regular variations in its position relative to the Sun: Sunspots on the face of the Sun. An eruption like Sarychev Volcano (Kuril Islands, northeast of Japan) in 2009 would have very little impact on weather. When these three variations are charted out, a climate pattern of about 100,000 years emerges. Ice ages correspond closely with Milankovitch cycles. Since glaciers can form only over land, ice ages only occur when landmasses cover the polar regions. Therefore, Milankovitch cycles are also connected to plate tectonics. 
Changes in  Atmospheric  Greenhouse  Gas  Levels 	  Since greenhouse gases trap the heat that radiates off the planets surfaces what would happen to global temperatures if atmospheric greenhouse gas levels decreased? What if greenhouse gases increased? A decrease in greenhouse gas levels decreases global temperature and an increase raises air temperature. Greenhouse gas levels have varied throughout Earth history. For example, CO2 has been present at concentrations less than 200 parts per million (ppm) and more than 5,000 ppm. But for at least 650,000 years, CO2 has never risen above 300 ppm, during either glacial or interglacial periods ( Figure 17.36). CO2 levels during glacial (blue) and interglacial (yellow) periods. Are CO2 levels relatively high or relatively low during interglacial periods? Current carbon dioxide levels are at 392 ppm, the highest level for the last 650,000 years. BP means years before present. 
Processes that add  O2 	  volcanic eruptions decay or burning of organic matter. 
Processes that remove  O2 	  absorption by plant and animal tissue. When plants are turned into fossil fuels the CO2 in their tissue is stored with them. So CO2 is removed from the atmosphere. What does this do to Earths average temperature? What happens to atmospheric CO2 when the fossil fuels are burned? What happens to global temperatures? Fossil fuel use has skyrocketed in the past few decades more people want more cars and industrial products. This has released CO2 into the atmosphere. Burning tropical rainforests, to clear land for agriculture, a practice called slash-and-burn agriculture, also increases atmospheric CO2. By cutting down trees, they can no longer remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Burning the trees releases all the CO2 stored in the trees into the atmosphere. There is now nearly 40% more CO2 in the atmosphere than there was 200 years ago, before the Industrial Revolution. About 65% of that increase has occurred since the first CO2 measurements were made on Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawaii, in 1958 ( Figure 17.37). The Keeling Curve shows the increase in atmospheric CO2 on Mauna Loa volcano since measurements began in 1958. The blue line shows yearly averaged CO2. The red line shows seasonal variations in CO2. CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas that human activities affect because it is so abundant. But other greenhouse gases are increasing as well. A few are: Methane: released from raising livestock, rice production, and the incomplete burning of rainforest plants. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs): human-made chemicals that were invented and used widely in the 20th century. Tropospheric ozone: from vehicle exhaust, it has more than doubled since 1976. 
Global  Warming 	  With more greenhouse gases trapping heat, average annual global temperatures are rising. This is known as global warming. Global warming How Humans are Affecting our Planet from NASA, discusses the basics of global warming science (4c): URL (7:58). 
Temperatures are  Increasing 	  While temperatures have risen since the end of the Pleistocene, 10,000 years ago, this rate of increase has been more rapid in the past century, and has risen even faster since 1990. The nine warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998, and the 10 of the 11 warmest years have occurred since 2001 (through 2012) ( Figure 17.38). The 2000s were the warmest decade yet. Recent temperature increases show how much temperature has risen since the Industrial Revolution began. Annual variations aside, the average global temperature increased about 0.8C (1.5F) between 1880 and 2010, according to the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NOAA. This number doesnt seem very large. Why is it important? URL The United States has long been the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with about 20% of total emissions in 2004 ( Figure 17.39). As a result of Chinas rapid economic growth, its emissions surpassed those of the United States in An animation of CO2 released by different fossil fuels is seen here: CO2 release by different fossil fuels at URL ww.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/oilgas/CO2BTU_3.MPG If nothing is done to decrease the rate of CO2 emissions, by 2030, CO2 emissions are projected to be 63% greater than they were in 2002. A number of videos on the National Geographic site deal with global warming. Go to National Geographic Videos, Environment Videos, Global Warming, URL . A no-nonsense look at global warming and what we can do about it is found in A Way Forward: Facing Climate Change. Antarctic Ice describes the changes that are already happening to Antarctica and what the consequences of future melting will be. Glacier Melt looks at melting in a large alpine glacier and the effects of glacier loss to Europe. In Greenhouse Gases researchers look at the effects of additional greenhouse gases on future forests. Researchers look for changes in the range of a mountain-top dwelling mammal, the pika. Polar bears, in their specialized habitat in the Arctic, are among the species already affected by warming temperatures. 
D:  Climate  Watch:  California at the  Tipping  Point 	  Warming temperatures are bringing changes to much of the planet, including California. Sea level is rising, snow pack is changing and the ecology of the state is responding to these changes. Learn more at: URL Global CO2 emissions are rising rapidly. The industrial revolution began about 1850 and industrialization has been accelerating. quest/video/climate-watch-california-at-the-tipping-point/ . 
Future  Warming 	  The amount CO2 levels will rise in the next decades is unknown. What will this number depend on in the developed nations? What will it depend on in the developing nations? In the developed nations it will depend on technological advances or lifestyle changes that decrease emissions. In the developing nations, it will depend on how much their lifestyles improve and how these improvements are made. Computer models are used to predict the effects of greenhouse gas increases on climate for the planet as a whole and also for specific regions. If nothing is done to control greenhouse gas emissions and they continue to increase at current rates, the surface temperature of the Earth can be expected to increase between 0.5C and 2.0C (0.9F and 3.6F) by 2050 and between 2 and 4.5C (3.5 and 8F) by 2100, with CO2 levels over 800 parts per million (ppm). On the other hand, if severe limits on CO2 emissions begin soon, temperatures could rise less than 1.1C (2F) by 2100. This video explores the tools NASA scientists use to determine how the climate is changing (6d): URL be.com/watch?v=JRayIgKublg (4:00). Whatever the temperature increase, it will not be uniform around the globe. A rise of 2.8C (5F) would result in 0.6 to 1.2C (1 to 2F) at the equator, but up to 6.7C (12F) at the poles. So far, global warming has affected the North Pole more than the South Pole, but temperatures are still increasing at Antarctica ( Figure 17.40). Temperature changes over Antarctica. The following images show changes in the earth and organisms as a result of global warming: Figure 17.41, Figure 17.42, and Figure 17.43. The timing of events for species is changing. Mating and migrations take place earlier in the spring months. Species that can are moving their ranges uphill. Some regions that were already marginal for agriculture are no longer farmable because they have become too warm or dry. Modeled Climate Induced Glacier change in Glacier National Park 1850-2100: URL ch/glacier_model.htm What are the two major effects being seen in this animation? Glaciers are melting and vegetation zones are moving uphill. If fossil fuel use exploded in the 1950s, why do these changes begin early in the animation? Does this mean that the climate change we are seeing is caused by natural processes and not by fossil fuel use? 
Animations of temperature anomalies for 5- and 10-year periods: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/animations/ 	  As greenhouse gases increase, changes will be more extreme. Oceans will become slightly more acidic, making it more difficult for creatures with carbonate shells to grow, and that includes coral reefs. A study monitoring ocean acidity in the Pacific Northwest found ocean acidity increasing ten times faster than expected and 10% to 20% of shellfish (mussels) being replaced by acid tolerant algae. (a) Breakup of the Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica in 2002 was related to climate warming in the region. (b) The Boulder Glacier has melted back tremendously since 1985. Other mountain glaciers around the world are also melting. Permafrost is melting and its extent decreasing. There are now fewer summer lakes in Siberia. Plant and animal species seeking cooler temperatures will need to move poleward 100 to 150 km (60 to 90 miles) or upward 150 m (500 feet) for each 1.0C (8F) rise in global temperature. There will be a tremendous loss of biodiversity because forest species cant migrate that rapidly. Biologists have already documented the extinction of high-altitude species that have nowhere higher to go. Decreased snowpacks, shrinking glaciers, and the earlier arrival of spring will all lessen the amount of water available in some regions of the world, including the western United States and much of Asia. Ice will continue to melt and sea level is predicted to rise 18 to 97 cm (7 to 38 inches) by 2100 ( Figure 17.44). An increase this large will gradually flood coastal regions where about one-third of the worlds population lives, forcing billions of people to move inland. Weather will become more extreme with heat waves and droughts. Some modelers predict that the Midwestern United States will become too dry to support agriculture and that Canada will become the new breadbasket. In all, about 10% to 50% of current cropland worldwide may become unusable if CO2 doubles. Although scientists do not all agree, hurricanes are likely to become more severe and possibly more frequent. Tropical and subtropical insects will expand their ranges, resulting in the spread of tropical diseases such as malaria, (a) Melting ice caps add water to the oceans, so sea level is rising. Remember that water slightly expands as it warms this expansion is also causing sea level to rise. (b) Weather is becoming more variable with more severe storms and droughts. Snow blanketed the western United States in December 2009. (c) As surface seas warm, phytoplankton productivity has decreased. (d) Coral reefs are dying worldwide; corals that are stressed by high temperatures turn white. (e) Pine beetle infestations have killed trees in western North America The insects have expanded their ranges into areas that were once too cold. Sea ice thickness around the North Pole has been decreasing in recent decades and will continue to decrease in the coming decades. encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue fever. You may notice that the numerical predictions above contain wide ranges. Sea level, for example, is expected to rise somewhere between 18 and 97 cm quite a wide range. What is the reason for this uncertainty? It is partly because scientists cannot predict exactly how the Earth will respond to increased levels of greenhouses gases. How quickly greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere depends in part on the choices we make. An important question people ask is this: Are the increases in global temperature natural? In other words, can natural variations in temperature account for the increase in temperature that we see? The answer is no. Changes in the Suns irradiance, El Nio and La Nia cycles, natural changes in greenhouse gas, and other atmospheric gases cannot account for the increase in temperature that has already happened in the past decades. This video discusses how, by using the CERES satellite, scientists monitor energy in the atmosphere, including incoming solar energy and reflected and absorbed energy. Greenhouse warming that results from atmospheric greenhouse gasses is also monitored (4c): URL (4:31).

Lesson  Summary 	  Climate has changed throughout Earth history. In general, when greenhouse gas levels are high, temperature is high. Greenhouse gases are now increasing because of human activities, especially fossil fuel use. We are already seeing the effects of these rising greenhouse gases in higher temperatures and changes to physical and biological systems. Society must choose to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or face more serious consequences. Virtually all credible scientists agree that Earth is warming and human actions are largely to blame. The evidence comes from many areas of science: atmospheric chemistry, earth history, glaciology, ecology, astronomy (stars, the Sun), energy (fossil fuels), oceanography, remote sensing, agricultural science, and others. Because the media like to present a balanced story, media outlets often present the side of climate skeptics who do not believe that global warming is happening, or that if it is happening, that human actions are largely responsible. From the following videos you can learn basic global warming science, the effects already being seen from changing climate, and learn a bit about risk assessment: Global Warming 101 touches on all aspects of the global warming story in just a few minutes (1l IE Stand.): http ://URL (1:28).

California has gone its own way by passing legislation to reduce the states greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels. A strong proponent is Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has broken with the Republican party in accepting that global warming is real and that something must be done to slow its effects.

Nearly all climate scientists agree that human activities are causing the accelerated warming of the planet that we see today. Why do you think that the media is still talking about the controversy about this idea when scientists are almost entirely in agreement? If greenhouse gas emissions must be lowered to avoid some of the more serious consequences of global warming, why have humans not done something to lower these emissions instead of letting them increase? In what ways can progress be made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions? Think about this on a variety of scales: for individuals, local communities, nations, and the global community. . CC BY 1.0

Introduction 	  An ecosystem is made up of the living creatures and the nonliving things that those creatures need within an area. Energy moves through an ecosystem in one direction. Nutrients cycle through different parts of the ecosystem and can enter or leave the ecosystem at many points. 
Biological  Communities 	  A population consists of all individuals of a single species that occur together at a given place and time. A species is a single type of organism that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. All of the populations living together in the same area make up a community. An ecosystem is all of the living things in a community and the physical and chemical factors that they interact with. 
In an  Ecosystem 	  The living organisms within an ecosystem are its biotic factors ( Figure 18.1). Living things include bacteria, algae, fungi, plants , and animals, including invertebrates, animals without backbones, and vertebrates, animals with backbones. Physical and chemical features are abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include resources living organisms need such as light, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, good soil, and nitrogen, phosphorous, and other nutrients. Abiotic factors also include environmental features that are not materials or living things, such as living space and the right temperature range. 
Niches 	  Organisms must make a living, just like a lawyer or a ballet dancer. This means that each individual organism must acquire enough food energy to live and reproduce. A species way of making a living is called its niche. An example of a niche is making a living as a top carnivore, an animal that eats other animals, but is not eaten by any other animals ( Figure 18.2). Every species fills a niche, and niches are almost always filled in an ecosystem. The top carnivore niche is filled by lions on the savanna, wolves in the tundra, and tuna in the oceans. 
Habitat 	  An organisms habitat is where it lives ( Figure 18.3). The important characteristics of a habitat include climate, the availability of food, water, and other resources, as well as other factors, such as weather. Birds living in a saguaro cactus. A habitat may be a hole in a cactus or the underside of a fern in a rainforest. It may be rocks and the nearby sea. 
Roles in  Ecosystems 	  There are many different types of ecosystems, some of which were described in the biomes discussion in the Climate chapter ( Figure 18.4). As with biomes, climate conditions determine which ecosystems are found in which location. A particular biome encompasses all of the ecosystems that have similar climate and organisms. Coral reefs are complex and beautiful ecosystems. Different organisms live in each different type of ecosystems. Lizards thrive in deserts, but no reptiles can survive at all in polar ecosystems. Large animals generally do better in cold climates than in hot climates. Despite this, every ecosystem has the same general roles that living creatures fill. Its just the organisms that fill those niches that are different. For example, every ecosystem must have some organisms that produce food in the form of chemical energy. These organisms are primarily algae in the oceans, plants on land, and bacteria at hydrothermal vents. 
Producers and  Consumers 	  The organisms that produce food are extremely important in every ecosystem. Organisms that produce their own food are called producers. There are two ways of producing food energy: Photosynthesis: plants on land, phytoplankton in the surface ocean, and some other organisms, described in the Earths Atmosphere chapter and elsewhere. Chemosynthesis: bacteria at hydrothermal vents as discussed in the Earths Oceans chapter. Organisms that use the food energy that was created by producers are named consumers. There are many types of consumers. Herbivores eat producers directly ( Figure 18.5). These animals break down the plant structures to get the materials and energy they need. Carnivores eat animals; they can eat herbivores or other carnivores. Omnivores eat plants and animals as well as fungi, bacteria, and organisms from the other kingdoms. 
Feeding  Relationships 	  There are many types of feeding relationships ( Figure 18.6) between organisms: predators that feed on prey, scavengers, and decomposers. (a) A predator is an animal that kills and eats another animal, known as its prey. (b) Scavengers are animals, such as vultures and hyenas, that eat organisms that are already dead. (c) Decomposers break apart dead organisms or the waste material of living organisms, returning the nutrients to the ecosystem. Bacteria and fungi are decomposers. 
Flow of  Energy in  Ecosystems 	  Remember from the Earths Atmosphere chapter that plants create chemical energy from abiotic factors that include solar energy. Chemosynthesizing bacteria create usable chemical energy from unusable chemical energy. The food energy created by producers is passed to consumers, scavengers, and decomposers. 
Trophic  Levels 	  Energy flows through an ecosystem in only one direction. Energy is passed from organisms at one trophic level or energy level, to organisms in the next trophic level. Which organisms do you think are at the first trophic level ( Figure 18.7)? Producers are always the first trophic level, herbivores the second, the carnivores that eat herbivores the third, and so on. Most of the energy about 90% at a trophic level is used at that trophic level. Organisms need it for locomotion, heating themselves, and reproduction. So animals at the second trophic level have only about 10% as much energy available to them as do organisms at the first trophic level. Animals at the third level have only 10% as much available to them as those at the second level. 
Food  Chains 	  The set of organisms that pass energy from one trophic level to the next is described as the food chain ( Figure 18.8). In this simple depiction, all organisms eat at only one trophic level ( Figure 18.9). What does this mean for the range of the osprey (or lion, or other top predator)? A top predator must have a very large range in which to hunt so that it can get enough energy to live. Why do most food chains have only four or five trophic levels? There is not enough energy to support organisms in a sixth trophic level. Food chains of ocean animals are longer than those of land-based animals because ocean conditions are more stable. Why do organisms at higher trophic levels tend to be larger than those at lower levels? The reason for this is simple: a large fish must be able to eat a small fish, but the small fish does not have to be able to eat the large fish ( Figure A simple food chain in a lake. The producers, algae, are not shown. For the predatory bird at the top, how much of the original energy is left? What are the consequences of the loss of energy at each trophic level? Each trophic level can support fewer organisms. How many osprey are there relative to the number of shrimp? 
Food  Webs 	  What is a more accurate way to depict the passage of energy in an ecosystem? A food web ( Figure 18.11) recognizes that many organisms eat at multiple trophic levels. Even food webs are interconnected. All organisms depend on two global food webs. The base of one is phytoplankton and the other is land plants. How are these two webs interconnected? Birds or bears that live on land may eat fish, which connects the two food webs. Where do humans fit into these food webs? Humans are an important part of both of these food webs; we are at the top of a food web since nothing eats us. That means that we are top predators. 
Flow of  Matter in  Ecosystems 	  Nutrients are ions that are crucial to the growth of living organisms. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous are important for plant cell growth. Animals use silica and calcium to build shells and skeletons. Cells need nitrates and phosphates to create proteins and other biochemicals. From nutrients, organisms make tissues and complex In this image the predators (wolves) are smaller than the prey (bison), which goes against the rule placed above. How does this relationship work? Many wolves are acting together to take down the bison. A food web includes the relationships between producers, consumers, and decomposers. molecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The flow of matter in an ecosystem is not like energy flow. Matter enters an ecosystem at any level and leaves at any level. Matter cycles freely between trophic levels and between the ecosystem and the physical environment ( Figure What are the sources of nutrients in an ecosystem? Rocks and minerals break down to release nutrients. Some enter the soil and are taken up by plants. Nutrients can be brought in from other regions, carried by wind or water. When one organism eats another organism, it receives all of its nutrients. Nutrients can also cycle out of an ecosystem. Decaying leaves may be transported out of an ecosystem by a stream. Wind or water carries nutrients out of an ecosystem. Nutrients cycle through ocean food webs. Decomposers play a key role in making nutrients available to organisms. Decomposers break down dead organisms into nutrients and carbon dioxide, which they respire into the air. If dead tissue would remain as it is, eventually nutrients would run out. Without decomposers, life on earth would have died out long ago. 
Relationships  Between  Species 	  Species have different types of relationships with each other. Competition occurs between species that try to use the same resources. When there is too much competition, one species may move or adapt so that it uses slightly different resources. It may live at the tops of trees and eat leaves that are somewhat higher on bushes, for example. If the competition does not end, one species will die out. Each niche can only be inhabited by one species. Some relationships between species are beneficial to at least one of the two interacting species. These relationships are known as symbiosis and there are three types: In mutualism, the relationship benefits both species. Most plant-pollinator relationships are mutually beneficial. What does each get from the relationship? In commensalism, one organism benefits and the other is not harmed. In parasitism, the parasite species benefits and the host is harmed. Parasites do not usually kill their hosts because a dead host is no longer useful to the parasite. Humans host parasites, such as the flatworms that cause schistosomiasis. Choose which type of relationship is described by each of the images and caption in the Figure 18.13. (a) The pollinator gets food; the plants pollen gets caught in the birds feathers so it is spread to far away flowers. (b) The barnacles receive protection and get to move to new locations; the whale is not harmed. (c) These tiny mites are parasitic and consume the insect called a harvestman. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Each species fills a niche within an ecosystem. Each ecosystem has the same niches, although the same species dont always fill them. Each ecosystem has producers, consumers, and decomposers. Decomposers break down dead tissue to make nutrients available for living organisms. Energy is lost at each trophic level, so top predators are scarce. Feeding relationships are much more complicated than a food chain, since some organisms eat from multiple trophic levels. Food webs are needed to show all the predator/prey interactions in an ecosystem. What happens if two species attempt to fill the same niche? There is at least one exception to the rule that each ecosystem has producers, consumers, and decomposers. Excluding hydrothermal vents, what does the deep sea ecosystem lack? Where do humans fit into a food web? Most humans are omnivores, but a lot of what we eat is at a high trophic level. Since ecosystems typically can support only a few top predators relative to the number of lower organisms, why are there so many people?

Introduction 	  Carbon is a very important element to living things. As the second most common element in the human body, we know that human life without carbon would not be possible. Protein, carbohydrates, and fats are all part of the body and all contain carbon. When your body breaks down food to produce energy, you break down protein, carbohydrates, and fat, and you breathe out carbon dioxide. Carbon occurs in many forms on Earth and is found throughout the environment ( Figure 18.14). The element moves through organisms and then returns to the environment. When all this happens in balance, the ecosystem remains in balance too. In this section, lets follow the path of a carbon atom over many years and see what happens. Nitrogen is also a very important element, used as a nutrient for plant and animal growth. First, the nitrogen must be converted to a useful form. Without "fixed" nitrogen, plants, and therefore animals, could not exist as we know them. 
Short  Term  Cycling of  Carbon 	  The short term cycling of carbon begins with carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Through photosynthesis, the inorganic carbon in carbon dioxide plus water and energy from sunlight is transformed into organic carbon (food) ( Figure 18.15) with oxygen given off as a waste product. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is below: These are some of the structures that carbon takes. Plants and animals engage in the reverse of photosynthesis, which is respiration. In respiration, animals use oxygen to convert the organic carbon in sugar into food energy they can use. Plants also go through respiration and consume some of the sugars they produce. The chemical reaction for respiration is: C6H12O6 + 6 O2 ? 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + useable energy Photosynthesis and respiration are a gas exchange process. In photosynthesis, CO2 is converted to O2 and in respiration, O2 is converted to CO2. Do plants create energy? It is important to remember that plants do not create energy. They change the energy from sunlight into chemical energy that plants and animals can use as food ( Figure 18.16). The carbon cycle shows where a carbon atom might be found. The black numbers indicate how much carbon is stored in various reservoirs, in billions of tons ("GtC" stands for gigatons of carbon). The purple numbers indicate how much carbon moves between reservoirs each year. The sediments, as defined in this diagram, do not include the ~70 million GtC of carbonate rock and kerogen. 
Carbon  Can  Also  Cycle in the  Long  Term 	  The carbon cycle has been discussed in other chapters. Using what you know, try to answer the following questions. How can a carbon atom cycle very quickly? One way would be if a plant takes in CO2 to make food and then is eaten by an animal, which in turn breathes out CO2. How can carbon be stored for a short period of time? Carbon that is stored as chemical energy in the cells of a plant or animal may remain until the organism dies. At that time, when the organism decomposes its carbon is released back into the environment. How can carbon be stored for a long period of time? If the organism is rapidly buried it may be transformed over millions of years into coal, oil, or natural gas. The carbon may be stored for millions of years. How can carbon be stored for long periods of time in the oceans? Many ocean creatures use calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to make their shells. When these organisms die, their organic material becomes part of the ocean sediments, which may stay at the bottom of the ocean for thousands or millions of years. Eventually, these sediments may be subducted into the mantle. The carbon could cycle back up into the atmosphere: The ocean sediments melt and form magma, and the CO2 is released when volcanoes erupt. 
Carbon  Sinks and  Carbon  Sources 	  Places in the ecosystem that store carbon are reservoirs. Places that supply and remove carbon are carbon sources and carbon sinks. If more carbon is provided than stored, the place is a carbon source. If more carbon dioxide is absorbed than is emitted, the reservoir is a carbon sink. What are some examples of carbon sources and sinks? Carbon sinks are reservoirs where carbon is stored. Healthy living forests and the oceans act as carbon sinks. Carbon sources are reservoirs from which carbon can enter the environment. The mantle is a source of carbon from volcanic gases. A reservoir can change from a sink to a source and vice-versa. A forest is a sink, but when the forest burns it becomes a source. The amount of time that carbon stays, on average, in a reservoir is the residence time of carbon in that reservoir. The concept of residence times is explored using the undergraduate population at UGA as an example. In this example the reservoir is the university (7d): URL (2:44). Remember that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is very low. This means that a small increase or decrease in the atmospheric CO2 can have a large effect. Scientists have a number of ways to see what atmospheric CO2 levels were in the past. One is to measure the composition of air bubbles trapped in glacial ice. The amount of CO2 in gas bubbles that date from before the Industrial Revolution, when society began to use fossil fuels, is thought to be the natural content of CO2 for this time period; that number was 280 parts per million (ppm). By 1958, when scientists began to directly measure CO2 content from the atmosphere at Mauna Loa volcano in the Pacific Ocean, the amount was 316 ppm ( Figure 18.17). In 2009, the atmospheric CO2 content had risen to 387 ppm. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has been measured at Mauna Loa Observatory since 1958. 
Human  Actions  Impact the  Carbon  Cycle 	  Humans have changed the natural balance of the carbon cycle because we use coal, oil, and natural gas to supply our energy demands. Fossil fuels are a sink for CO2 when they form but they are a source for CO2 when they are burned. The equation for combustion of propane, which is a simple hydrocarbon looks like this: The equation shows that when propane burns, it uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide and water. So when a car burns a tank of gas, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere increases just a little. Added over millions of tanks of gas and coal burned for electricity in power plants and all of the other sources of CO2, the result is the increase in atmospheric CO2 seen in the Figure 18.17. The second largest source of atmospheric CO2 is deforestation ( Figure 18.18). Trees naturally absorb CO2 while they are alive. Trees that are cut down lose their ability to absorb CO2. If the tree is burned or decomposes, it becomes a source of CO2. A forest can go from being a carbon sink to being a carbon source. This forest in Mexico has been cut down and burned to clear forested land for agriculture. Coal, oil, and natural gas as well as calcium carbonate rocks and ocean sediments are long term carbon sinks for the natural cycling of carbon. When humans extract and use these resources, combustion makes them into carbon sources. 
D:  Acidic  Seas 	  For years, our oceans have absorbed some of the carbon dioxide that humans create through burning fossil fuels. But all that extra CO2 is making our oceans more acidic with potentially dire consequences. Learn more at: URL cience.kqed.org/quest/video/acidic-seas/ . 
Why the  Carbon  Cycle is  Important 	  Why is such a small amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere even important? Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas ( Figure 18.19) so it absorbs infrared energy, the longer wavelengths of the Suns reflected rays. Greenhouse gases trap heat energy that would otherwise radiate out into space and warms Earth. This is like what happens in a greenhouse. The glass that makes up the greenhouse holds in heat that would otherwise radiate out. This diagram explains the role of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. When greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere increase, the atmosphere holds onto more heat than it normally would. This increase in global temperatures is called global warming. Global warming and the effects of rising temperatures were described in the Climate chapter. This video Keeping up with Carbon from NASA, focuses on the oceans. Topics include what will happen as temperature warms and the oceans can hold less carbon, and ocean acidification (7a): URL atch?v=HrIr3xDhQ0E (5:39). A very thorough but basic summary of the carbon cycle, including the effect of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is found in this video (7b): URL (4:37). 
The  Nitrogen  Cycle 	  Nitrogen (N2) is also vital for life on Earth as an essential component of organic materials, such as amino acids, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll ( Figure 18.20). Although nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, it is not in a form that plants can use. To be useful, nitrogen must be fixed, or converted into a more useful form. Although some nitrogen is fixed by lightning or blue-green algae, much is modified by bacteria in the soil. These bacteria combine the nitrogen with oxygen or hydrogen to create nitrates or ammonia ( Figure 18.21). Nitrogen fixing bacteria either live free or in a symbiotic relationship with leguminous plants (peas, beans, peanuts). The symbiotic bacteria use carbohydrates from the plant to produce ammonia that is useful to the plant. Plants use this fixed nitrogen to build amino acids, nucleic acids (DNA, RNA), and chlorophyll. When these legumes die, the fixed nitrogen they contain fertilizes the soil. Animals eat plant tissue and create animal tissue. After a plant or animal dies or an animal excretes waste, bacteria and some fungi in the soil fix the organic nitrogen and return it to the soil as ammonia. Nitrifying bacteria oxidize the ammonia to nitrites, other bacteria oxide the nitrites to nitrates, which can be used by the next generation of plants. In this way, nitrogen does not need to return to a gas. Under conditions when there is no oxygen, some bacteria can reduce nitrates to molecular nitrogen. Usable nitrogen is sometimes the factor that limits how many organisms can grow in an ecosystem. Modern agricultural practices increase plant productivity by adding nitrogen fertilizers to the soil. This can have unintended consequences: Nitrogen from fertilizers may return to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide or ammonia, both of which have deleterious effects. Nitrous oxide contributes to the breakdown of the ozone layer, and ammonia contributes to smog and acid rain. Excess fertilizers run off the land, end up in water, and then cause nitrification of ponds, lakes, and nearshore oceanic areas. The nitrogen fertilizes the pond, causing bacteria to grow. When these enormous amounts of bacteria die, their decomposition uses up all the available oxygen ( Figure 18.22). Without oxygen, fish and other larger organisms die. This is called a dead zone when it happens on a large scale. This very thorough video on the nitrogen cycle with an aquatic perspective was created by high school students (7a): URL (5:08). 
Lesson  Summary 	  Photosynthesis, which transforms inorganic carbon into organic carbon, is an extremely important part of the carbon cycle. Forests and oceans are carbon sinks. When carbon is trapped in ocean sediments or fossil fuels, it is stored for millions of years. Humans have changed the natural carbon cycle by burning fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Fossil fuels burning and deforestation are carbon sources. Global warming is a consequence of increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The nitrogen cycle begins with nitrogen gas in the atmosphere then goes through nitrogen-fixing microorganisms to plants, animals, decomposers, and into the soil.

Introduction 	  Improvements in agriculture, sanitation, and medical care have enabled the human population to grow enormously in the last few hundred years. As the population grows, consumption, waste, and the overuse of resources also grows. People are beginning to discuss and carry out sustainable development that decreases the impact humans have on the planet. 
Populations 	  Biotic and abiotic factors determine the population size of a species in an ecosystem. What are some important biotic factors? Biotic factors include the amount of food that is available to that species and the number of organisms that also use that food source. What are some important abiotic factors? Space, water, and climate all help determine a species population. When does a population grow? A population grows when the number of births is greater than the number of deaths. When does a population shrink? When deaths exceed births. What causes a population to grow? For a population to grow there must be ample resources and no major problems. What causes a population to shrink? A population can shrink either because of biotic or abiotic limits. An increase in predators, the emergence of a new disease, or the loss of habitat are just three possible problems that will decrease a population. A population may also shrink if it grows too large for the resources required to support it. 
Carrying  Capacity 	  When the number of births equals the number of deaths, the population is at its carrying capacity for that habitat. In a population at its carrying capacity, there are as many organisms of that species as the habitat can support. The carrying capacity depends on biotic and abiotic factors. If these factors improve, the carrying capacity increases. If the factors become less plentiful, the carrying capacity drops. If resources are being used faster than they are being replenished, then the species has exceeded its carrying capacity. If this occurs, the population will then decrease in size. 
Limiting  Factors 	  Every stable population has one or more factors that limit its growth. A limiting factor determines the carrying capacity for a species. A limiting factor can be any biotic or abiotic factor: nutrient, space, and water availability are examples ( Figure 18.23). The size of a population is tied to its limiting factor. In a desert such as this, what is the limiting factor on plant populations? What would make the population increase? What would make the population decrease? What happens if a limiting factor increases a lot? Is it still a limiting factor? If a limiting factor increases a lot, another factor will most likely become the new limiting factor. This may be a bit confusing so lets look at an example of limiting factors. Say you want to make as many chocolate chip cookies as you can with the ingredients you have on hand. It turns out that you have plenty of flour and other ingredients, but only two eggs. You can make only one batch of cookies, because eggs are the limiting factor. But then your neighbor comes over with a dozen eggs. Now you have enough eggs for seven batches of cookies, and enough other ingredients but only two pounds of butter. You can make four batches of cookies, with butter as the limiting factor. If you get more butter, some other ingredient will be limiting. Species ordinarily produce more offspring than their habitat can support ( Figure 18.24). If conditions improve, more young survive and the population grows. If conditions worsen, or if too many young are born, there is competition between individuals. As in any competition, there are some winners and some losers. Those individuals that survive to fill the available spots in the niche are those that are the most fit for their habitat. A frog in frog spawn. An animal produces many more offspring than will survive. 
Human  Population  Numbers 	  Human population growth over the past 10,000 years has been tremendous ( Figure 18.25). The entire human population was estimated to be As the human population continues to grow, different factors limit population in different parts of the world. What might be a limiting factor for human population in a particular location? Space, clean air, clean water, and food to feed everyone are limiting in some locations. An interactive map of where human population growth has been over time: URL lance/numbers.html . Not only has the population increased, but the rate of population growth has increased ( Figure 18.26). Estimates are that the population will reach 7 billion in 2012, 13 years after reaching 6 billion. Although population continues to grow rapidly, the rate that the growth rate is increasing has declined. Still, a recent estimate by the United Nations estimates that 10.1 billion people will be sharing this planet by the end of the century. The total added will be about 3 billion people, which is more than were even in existence as recently as 1960.

Earths  Carrying  Capacity for  Humans 	  What is Earths carrying capacity for humans? Are humans now exceeding Earths carrying capacity for our species? Many anthropologists say that the carrying capacity of humans on the planet without agriculture is about 10 million ( Figure 18.27). This population was reached about 10,000 years ago. At the time, people lived together in small bands of hunters and gatherers. Typically men hunted and fished; women gathered nuts and vegetables. Obviously, human populations have blown past this hypothetical carrying capacity. By using our brains, our erect posture, and our hands, we have been able to manipulate our environment in ways that no other species has ever done. What have been the important developments that have allowed population to grow? About 10,000 years ago, we developed the ability to grow our own food. Farming increased the yield of food plants and allowed people to have food available year round. Animals were domesticated to provide meat. With agriculture, people could settle down, so that they no longer needed to carry all their possessions ( Figure 18.28). They could develop better farming practices and store food for when it was difficult to grow. Agriculture allowed people to settle in towns and cities. When advanced farming practices allowed farmers to grow more food than they needed for their families ( Figure 18.29), some people were then able to do other types of work, such as crafts or shop keeping. The next major stage in the growth of the human population was the Industrial Revolution, which started in the late In a hunter-gatherer society, people relied on the resources they could find where they lived. More advanced farming practices allowed a single farmer to grow food for many more people. Every major advance in agriculture has allowed global population to increase. Irrigation, the ability to clear large swaths of land for farming efficiently, and the development of farm machines powered by fossil fuels allowed people to grow more food and transport it to where it was needed. The Green Revolution has allowed the addition of billions of people to the population in the past few decades. The Green Revolution has improved agricultural productivity by: Improving crops by selecting for traits that promote productivity; recently genetically engineered crops have Farming increasingly depended on machines. Rows of a single crop and heavy machinery are normal sights on modernday farms. Early in the Industrial Revolution, large numbers of people who had been freed from food production were available to work in factories. been introduced. Increasing the use of artificial fertilizers and chemical pesticides. About 23 times more fertilizer and 50 times more pesticides are used around the world than were used just 50 years ago ( Figure 18.31). Agricultural machinery: plowing, tilling, fertilizing, picking, and transporting are all done by machines. About 17% of the energy used each year in the United States is for agriculture. Increasing access to water. Many farming regions depend on groundwater, which is not a renewable resource. Some regions will eventually run out of this water source. Currently about 70% of the worlds fresh water is used for agriculture. The Green Revolution has increased the productivity of farms immensely. A century ago, a single farmer produced enough food for 2.5 people, but now a farmer can feed more than 130 people. The Green Revolution is credited for feeding 1 billion people that would not otherwise have been able to live. What is the flip side of this? The flip side is that for the population to continue to grow, more advances in agriculture and an ever increasing supply of water will be needed. Weve increased the carrying capacity for humans by our Rows of a single crop and heavy machinery are normal sights for modern day farms. genius: growing crops, trading for needed materials, and designing ways to exploit resources that are difficult to get at, such as groundwater. The question is, even though we have increased the carrying capacity of the planet, have we now exceeded it ( Figure 18.32)? Are humans on Earth experiencing overpopulation? Manhattan is one of the most heavily populated regions in the world. There is not yet an answer to that question, but there are many different opinions. In the eighteenth century, Thomas Malthus predicted that human population would continue to grow until we had exhausted our resources. At that point, humans would become victims of famine, disease, or war. This has not happened, at least not yet. Some scientists think that the carrying capacity of the planet is about 1 billion people, not the almost 7 billion people we have today. The limiting factors have changed as our intelligence has allowed us to expand our population. Can we continue to do this indefinitely into the future? 
Humans and the  Environment 	  The Green Revolution has brought enormous impacts to the planet. Natural landscapes have been altered to create farmland and cities. Already, half of the ice-free lands have been converted to human uses ( Figure 18.33). Estimates are that by 2030, that number will be more than 70%. Forests and other landscapes have been cleared for farming or urban areas. Rivers have been dammed and the water is transported by canals for irrigation and domestic uses. Ecologically sensitive areas have been altered: wetlands are now drained and coastlines are developed. Modern agricultural practices produce a lot of pollution ( Figure 18.34). Some pesticides are toxic. Dead zones grow as fertilizers drain off farmland and introduce nutrients into lakes and coastal areas. Farm machines and vehicles used to transport crops produce air pollutants. Pollutants enter the air, water, or are spilled onto the land. Moreover, many types of pollution easily move between air, water, and land. As a result, no location or organism not even polar bears in the remote Arctic is free from pollution. The increased numbers of people have other impacts on the planet. Humans do not just need food. They also need clean water, secure shelter, and a safe place for their wastes. These needs are met to different degrees in different nations and among different socioeconomic classes of people. For example, about 1.2 billion of the worlds people do not have enough clean water for drinking and washing each day ( Figure 18.35). The percentage of people in the world that live in abject poverty is decreasing somewhat globally, but increasing in some regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa. A large percentage of people expect much more than to have their basic needs met. For about one-quarter of people there is an abundance of food, plenty of water, and a secure home. Comfortable temperatures are made possible by heating and cooling systems, rapid transportation is available by motor vehicles or a well-developed public transportation system, instant communication takes place by phones and email, and many other luxuries are available that were not even dreamed of only a few decades ago. All of these need resources to produce, and fossil fuels to power ( Figure 18.36). Their production, use, and disposal all produce wastes. Many people refer to the abundance of luxury items in these peoples lives as over-consumption. People in developed nations use 32 times more resources than people in the developing countries of the world. Many problems worldwide result from overpopulation and over-consumption. One such problem is the advance of farms and cities into wild lands, which diminishes the habitat of many organisms. In addition, water also must Since CO2 is a waste product from fossil fuel burning, CO2 emissions tell which countries are using the most fossil fuels, which means that the population has a high standard of living. be transported for irrigation and domestic uses. This means building dams on rivers or drilling wells to pump groundwater. Large numbers of people living together need effective sanitation systems. Many developing countries do not have the resources to provide all of their citizens with clean water. It is not uncommon for some of these children to die of diseases related to poor sanitation. Improving sanitation in many different areas sewers, landfills, and safe food handling are important to prevent disease from spreading. Wildlife is threatened by fishing, hunting, and trading as population increases. Besides losing their habitat as land is transformed, organisms are threatened by hunting and fishing as human population grows. Hunting is highly regulated in developed nations, but many developing nations are losing many native animals because of hunting. Wild fish are being caught at too high a rate and many ocean-fish stocks are in peril. Humans also cause problems with ecosystems when they introduce species that do not belong in a habitat. Invasive species are sometimes introduced purposefully, but often they arrive by accident, like rats on a ship. Invasive species often have major impacts in their new environments. A sad example is the Australian Brown Tree Snake that has wiped out 9 of the 13 native bird species on the island of Guam ( Figure 18.37). 
An  Australian  Brown  Tree  Snake 	  A dynamic map of the spread of invasive zebra mussels is found here: URL _zm.html# . Pollution is a by-product of agriculture, urbanization, and the production and consumption of goods. Global warming is the result of fossil fuel burning. Back to the question: Have humans have exceeded Earths carrying capacity for our species? Carrying capacity is exceeded if: resources are being used faster than they are being replenished. the environment is being damaged. Seen this way: The answer appears to be yes. Many resources are being used far in excess of the rate at which they are being replaced. The best farmland is already in use and more marginal lands are being developed. Many rivers are already dammed as much as they can be. Groundwater is being used far more rapidly than it is being replaced. Fossil fuels and mineral resources are being used faster than they are being replaced. Forests are being chopped down in developed and developing nations. Wild fish are being overharvested. 
The environment is certainly being damaged 	  Pollution is discussed in the coming chapters. Temperatures are rising and the effects are being seen worldwide. Humans have caused the rate of extinction of wild species to increase to about at least 100 times the normal extinction rate. Although many more people are alive in the world than ever before, many of these people do not have secure lives. Many people in the world live in poverty, with barely enough to eat. They often do not have safe water for drinking and bathing ( Figure 18.38). Diseases kill many of the worlds children before they reach five years of age. Nearly half of the people living in Africa do not have access to clean water. What if humans suddenly disappeared? Here is a very interesting view of Earth recovering from our presence: http ://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/11/081103-ozone-video-vin.html . 
Sustainable  Development 	  A topic generating a great deal of discussion these days is sustainable development. The goals of sustainable development are to: help people out of poverty. protect the environment. use resources no faster than the rate at which they are regenerated. One of the most important steps to achieving a more sustainable future is to reduce human population growth. This has been happening in recent years. Studies have shown that the birth rate decreases as women become educated, because educated women tend to have fewer, and healthier, children. Science can be an important part of sustainable development. When scientists understand how Earths natural systems work, they can recognize how people are impacting them. Scientists can work to develop technologies that can be used to solve problems wisely. An example of a practice that can aid sustainable development is fish farming, as long as it is done in environmentally sound ways. Engineers can develop cleaner energy sources to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Citizens can change their behavior to reduce the impact they have on the planet by demanding products that are produced sustainably. When forests are logged, new trees should be planted. Mining should be done so that the landscape is not destroyed. People can consume less and think more about the impacts of what they do consume. And what of the waste products of society? Will producing all that we need to keep the population growing result in a planet so polluted that the quality of life will be greatly diminished ( Figure 18.39)? Will warming temperatures cause problems for human populations? The only answer to all of these questions is, time will tell. As China industrializes, its cities have become among the most polluted in the world. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Populations of organisms are kept to a habitats carrying capacity by factors that limit their growth. By developing agriculture and other technologies, the human population has grown well past any natural population limits. Many people on Earth live in poverty, without enough food, clean water, or shelter. Overpopulation and over-consumption are causing resources to be overused and much pollution to be generated. Society must choose development that is more sustainable to secure a long-term future for our species and the other species we share the planet with.

Because they are from so deep and need such a specialized way to get to the surface, they are very rare. In this image, vegetation is in green. Where the vegetation has been cleared at the mine, the land appears brown or pinkish because rock and soil are exposed. For every carat of diamond mined, a metric ton of rock must be removed. Considerable amounts of toxic wastes are also produced in a mine this size. The bright red spot is a fire, which is likely the result of slash-and-burn agriculture.

Introduction 	  Soil is an extremely important natural resource, one that is not always recognized or appreciated. Soil loss can lead to tragedy, as it did during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, and can degrade farmland permanently. There are many ways to prevent soil erosion and, at least in the developed nations, those practices are increasingly followed. 
The  Dust  Bowl 	  The 1930s were a terrible time in U.S. history. That was the time of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a portion of the prairie where farmers were forced from their lands as the soil was blown away in storms that came to be known as black blizzards. The Dust Bowl was caused by bad farming practices in a region that was not naturally suited for farming (see Figure 19.1). The problem began during World War I, when grain was needed to feed the troops and farmers were paid a good wage for growing it. The Great Plains is naturally grassland and soil erosion is minimal. Why do you think the soil did not erode very much while the region was grassland? Initially, rains fell and the land was productive. But in 1931, the rains stopped. Without grasses to hold the soil in place, wind picked up the dirt and blew it across the region. Muddy rain even fell out of the atmosphere as far away as the eastern United States ( Figure 19.2). Farmers that were forced off their land migrated to southern California and other places along the west coast where they met with poverty of a different sort. John Steinbecks The Grapes of Wrath deals with this difficult time in American history. We learned many lessons from the Dust Bowl storms. Modern practices encourage farmers to keep the soil covered so that it is not exposed and vulnerable to erosion. Massive irrigation projects, with water coming from groundwater sources, including the Ogallala Aquifer, keep crops healthy and soil in place. Still, some of the regions topsoil erodes away each year. The region of the Dust Bowl and the places displaced farmers migrated to after they had been forced off their land. This wind storm blew huge amounts of soil into the air in Texas on April 14, 1935. 
Causes of  Soil  Erosion 	  The agents of soil erosion are the same as the agents of all types of erosion: water, wind, ice, or gravity. Running water is the leading cause of soil erosion, because water is abundant and has a lot of power. Wind is also a leading cause of soil erosion because wind can pick up soil and blow it far away. Activities that remove vegetation, disturb the ground, or allow the ground to dry are activities that increase erosion. What are some human activities that increase the likelihood that soil will be eroded? 
Farming 	  Agriculture is probably the most significant activity that accelerates soil erosion because of the amount of land that is farmed and how much farming practices disturb the ground ( Figure 19.3). Farmers remove native vegetation and then plow the land to plant new seeds. Because most crops grow only in spring and summer, the land lies fallow during the winter. Of course, winter is also the stormy season in many locations so wind and rain are available to wash soil away. Tractor tires make deep grooves, which are natural pathways for water. Fine soil is blown away by wind. The soil that is most likely to erode is the nutrient-rich topsoil, which degrades the farmland. 
Grazing 	  Grazing animals ( Figure 19.4) wander over large areas of pasture or natural grasslands eating grasses and shrubs. Grazers expose soil by removing the plant cover for an area and they also churn up the ground with their hooves. If too many animals graze the same land area, the animals hooves pull plants out by their roots. A land is overgrazed if too many animals are living there. 
Logging and  Mining 	  Logging removes trees that protect the ground from soil erosion. The tree roots hold the soil together and the tree canopy protects the soil from hard falling rain. Logging results in the loss of leaf litter, or dead leaves, bark, and branches on the forest floor. Leaf litter plays an important role in protecting forest soils from erosion ( Figure 19.5). Grazing animals can cause erosion if they are allowed to overgraze and remove too much or all of the vegetation in a pasture. Much of the worlds original forests have been logged. Many of the tropical forests that remain are currently the site of logging because North America and Europe have already harvested many of their trees ( Figure 19.6). Soils eroded from logged forests clog rivers and lakes, fill estuaries, and bury coral reefs. Surface mining disturbs the land ( Figure 19.7) and leaves the soil vulnerable to erosion. 
Construction 	  Constructing buildings and roads churns up the ground and exposes soil to erosion. In some locations, native landscapes, such as forest and grassland, are cleared exposing the surface to erosion (in some locations the land that will be built on is farmland). Near construction sites, dirt, picked up by the wind, is often in the air. Completed construction can also contribute to erosion ( Figure 19.8). Deforested swatches in Brazil show up as gray amid the bright red tropical rainforest. 
Recreational  Activities 	  Recreational activities may accelerate soil erosion. Off-road vehicles disturb the landscape and the area eventually develops bare spots where no plants can grow. In some delicate habitats, even hikers boots can disturb the ground so its important to stay on the trail ( Figure 19.9). Urban areas and parking lots result in less water entering the ground. Water runs off the parking lot onto nearby lands and speeds up erosion in those areas. Soil erosion is as natural as any other type of erosion, but human activities have greatly accelerated soil erosion. In some locations soil erosion may occur about 10 times faster than its natural rate. Since Europeans have arrived in the United States, about one-third of the nations topsoil has eroded away. 
Preventing  Soil  Erosion 	  Soil is a natural resource that is vitally important for sustaining natural habitats and for growing food. Although soil is a renewable resource, it is renewed slowly, taking hundreds or thousands of years for a good fertile soil to develop. Most of the best land for farming is already being cultivated. With human populations continuing to grow, it is extremely important to protect our soil resources. The rate of topsoil loss in the United States and other developed countries has decreased recently as better farming practices have been adopted. Unfortunately, in developing nations, soil is often not protected. Table 19.1 shows some steps that we can take to prevent erosion. Some are things that can be done by farmers or developers. Others are things that individual homeowners or community members can implement locally. 
Agriculture 	  Leave leaf litter on the ground in the winter. Grow cover crops, special crops grown in the winter to cover the soil. Plant tall trees around fields to buffer the effects of wind. Drive tractors as little as possible. Use drip irrigation that puts small amounts of water in the ground frequently. Avoid watering crops with sprinklers that make big water drops on the ground. Keep fields as flat as possible to avoid soil eroding down hill. 
Grazing  Animals 	  Move animals throughout the year, so they dont consume all the vegetation in one spot. Keep animals away from stream banks, where hills are especially prone to erosion. 
Logging and  Mining 	  Reduce the amount of land that is logged and mined. Reduce the number of roads that are built to access logging areas. Avoid logging and mining on steep lands. Cut only small areas at one time and quickly replant logged areas with new seedlings. 
Development 	  Reduce the amount of land area that is developed into urban areas, parking lots, etc. Keep as much green space in cities as possible, such as parks or strips where plants can grow. Invest in and use new technologies for parking lots that make them permeable to water in order to reduce runoff of water. TABLE 19.1: (continued) 
Recreational  Activities 	  Avoid using off-road vehicles on hilly lands. Stay on designated trails. 
Building  Construction 	  Avoid building on steep hills. Grade surrounding land to distribute water rather than collecting it in one place. Where water collects, drain to creeks and rivers. Landscape with plants that minimize erosion. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Soil erosion is a natural process that has been greatly accelerated by human activities. Activities that accelerate erosion include agriculture, grazing, logging, mining, development, and recreation. Soil is an important natural resource and should be protected as any natural resource. Many practices can be adopted to slow down or prevent soil erosion. People who lived during the Dust Bowl talk about their experiences, the Ganzel Group URL .org/farminginthe30s/water_02.html

Describe some of the impacts of hazardous waste on human health and on the environment. Detail some ways that people can control hazardous wastes. 
Introduction 	  Sometimes human activities degrade the land with pollutants. In the United States, lands that are extremely polluted become one of the Superfund sites destined for cleanup. 
Love  Canal 	  The story of Love Canal, New York, begins in the 1950s when a local chemical company placed hazardous wastes in 55-gallon steel drums and buried them. Love Canal was an abandoned waterway near Niagara Falls and was thought to be a safe site for hazardous waste disposal because the ground was fairly impermeable ( Figure 19.10). After burial, the company covered the containers with soil and sold the land to the local school system for $1. The company warned the school district that the site had been used for toxic waste disposal. Soon a school, a playground, and 100 homes were built on the site. The impermeable ground was breached when sewer systems were dug into the rock layer. Over time, the steel drums rusted and the chemicals were released into the ground. In the 1960s people began to notice bad odors. Children developed burns after playing in the soil, and they were often sick. In 1977 a swamp created by heavy rains was found to contain 82 toxic chemicals, including 11 suspected cancer-causing chemicals. A Love Canal resident, Lois Gibbs, organized a group of citizens called the Love Canal Homeowners Association to try to find out what was causing the problems ( Figure 19.11). When they discovered that toxic chemicals were buried beneath their homes and school, they demanded that the government take action to clean up the area and remove the chemicals. A video of Lois Gibbs describing the origin of the Love Canal problem: URL Pego4A . Steel drums were used to contain 21,000 tons of hazardous chemicals at Love Canal. A resident of Love Canal protests the hazardous waste contamination in her neighborhood. In 1978, people were relocated to safe areas. The problem was instrumental in the passage of the the Superfund Act in 1980. This law requires companies to be responsible for hazardous chemicals that they put into the environment and to pay to clean up polluted sites, which can often cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Love Canal became a Superfund site in 1983 and as a result, several measures were taken to secure the toxic wastes. The land was capped so that water could not reach the waste, debris was cleaned from the nearby area, and contaminated soils were removed. What is Hazardous Waste? Hazardous waste is any waste material that is dangerous to human health or that degrades the environment. Hazardous waste includes substances that are: All sorts of materials are hazardous wastes and there are many sources. Many people have substances that could become hazardous wastes in their homes. Several cleaning and gardening chemicals are hazardous if not used properly. These include chemicals like drain cleaners and pesticides that are toxic to humans and many other creatures ( Figure 19.12). While these chemicals are fine if they are stored and used properly, if they are used or disposed of improperly, they may become hazardous wastes. Others sources of hazardous waste are shown in Table 19.2. This farm worker wears special clothes for protection from the hazardous pesticide in the container. 
Gasoline, used motor oil, battery acid, brake fluid 	  Toxic to humans and other organisms; often chemically active; often flammable. TABLE 19.2: (continued) 
Car batteries, household batteries 	  Contain toxic chemicals; are often corrosive.

Paints, paint thinners, paint strippers, wood stains 	  Toxic; flammable. 
Many various chemicals 	  Toxic; many cause cancer in humans. 
Pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers 	  Toxic to humans; can harm other organism; pollute soils and water. 
Impacts of  Hazardous  Waste 	  The pollution at Love Canal was not initially visible, but it became visible. The health effects from the waste were also not initially visible, but they became clearly visible. The effects of the contamination that were seen in human health included sickness in children and a higher than normal number of miscarriages in pregnant women. Toxic chemicals may cause cancer and birth defects. Why do you think children and fetuses are more susceptible? Because young organisms grow more rapidly, they take in more of the toxic chemicals and are more affected. Sometimes the chemicals are not so easily seen as they were at Love Canal and the impacts are seen statistically. For example, contaminated drinking water may cause an increase in some types of cancer in a community. Why is one person with cancer not enough to suspect contamination by toxic waste? One is not a statistically valid number. A certain number of people get cancer all the time. To identify contamination, a number of cancers above the normal rate, called a cancer cluster, must be discovered. A case that was made into a book and movie called A Civil Action involved the community of Woburn, Massachusetts. Groundwater contamination was initially suspected because of an increase in childhood leukemia and other illnesses. As a result of concern by parents, the well water was analyzed and shown to have high levels of TCE (trichloroethylene). Lead and mercury are two chemicals that are especially toxic to humans. Lead was once a common ingredient in gasoline and paint, but it was shown to damage human brains and nervous systems. Since young children are growing rapidly, lead is especially harmful in children under the age of six ( Figure 19.13). In the 1970s and 1980s, the United States government passed laws completely banning lead in gasoline and paint. Mercury is a pollutant that can easily spread around the world. Sources of Mercury include volcanic eruptions, coal burning, and wastes such as batteries, electronic switches, and electronic appliances such as television sets. Like lead, mercury damages the brain and impairs nervous system function. More about the hazards of mercury pollution can be found in the Human Actions and the Atmosphere chapter. 
Preventing  Hazardous  Waste  Pollution 	  Nations that have more industry produce more hazardous waste. Currently, the United States is the worlds largest producer of hazardous wastes, but China, which produces so many products for the developed world, may soon take over the number-one spot. Countries with more industry produce more hazardous waste than those with little industry. Problems with hazardous (a) Leaded gas sold in the US for decades. (b) Homes built before the 1970s may contain lead paint. Paint so old is likely to be peeling and poses a great threat to human health. About 200 children die every year from lead poisoning. wastes and their disposal became obvious sooner in the developed world than in the developing world. As a result, many developed nations, including the United States, have laws to help control hazardous waste disposal and to clean toxic sites. As mentioned above, the Superfund Act requires companies to clean up contaminated sites that are designated as Superfund sites ( Figure 19.14). If a responsible party cannot be identified, because the company has gone out of business or its culpability cannot be proven, the federal government pays for the cleanup out of a trust fund with money put aside by the petroleum and chemical industries. As a result of the Superfund Act, companies today are more careful about how they deal with hazardous substances. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 requires that companies keep track of any hazardous materials they produce. These materials must be disposed of using government guidelines and records must be kept to show the government that the wastes were disposed of safely. Workers must be protected from the hazardous materials. To some extent, individuals can control the production and disposal of hazardous wastes. We can choose to use materials that are not hazardous, such as using vinegar as a cleanser. At home, people can control the amount of pesticides that they use (or they can use organic methods of pest control). It is also necessary to dispose of hazardous materials properly by not pouring them over the land, down the drain or toilet, or into a sewer or trashcan. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Hazardous wastes are dangerous to human health and the environment. The many sources of hazardous waste include household chemicals, gasoline, paints, old batteries, discarded appliances, and industry. Once toxic chemicals are released into the environment they can cause health problems or even death, and they can degrade the environment for other organisms. Developed countries such as the United States produce most of the worlds hazardous waste but have the most Superfund sites are located all over the nation and many are waiting to be cleaned up. advanced laws to deal with them.

Chapter  Outline 	  This landscape in west Texas and southeastern New Mexico is pock-marked with oil wells and drilling structures connected by roads. The Yates Oil Field exploits petroleum from the Permian Basin, one of the highest producing oil provinces in North America. In the image its possible to see the basins folded sedimentary rocks. At the base of the basin is ancient continental crust that filled with sediments as the region was covered by shallow seas and then exposed several times during the Paleozoic Era. The thick Permian sediments were organic-rich carbonates and salts that were buried and later folded. Oil was produced and later trapped by the rock layer. Oil was first discovered on the Yates land in 1926, and by 1995 the land had produced more than 2 billion barrels of oil. The oil field is still productive, but at a diminished rate. While nearly 1 billion barrels is estimated to be still in the ground, it is more difficult to extract than the oil that was produced earlier.

Introduction 	  Natural resources may be living or non-living. Their value may be tangible, such as the price of an ounce of gold, or intangible, like the psychological value of being able to visit pristine natural areas. Some natural resources must be used and used wisely, but some must be preserved to maintain their value. 
Mystery in the  Forest 	  Like all forests, the Monongahela National Forest of West Virginia is an important natural resource. A forest is a resource in ways that are obvious and ways that are not so obvious. This forest is used for many things including: Recreation, such as hiking, camping, and picnicking. Habitat for many organisms, including nine endangered species and 50 species of rare plants. Streams [207 kilometers (129 miles)] for fishing, particularly trout fishing. Wildlife management areas for hunting deer, squirrels, turkeys, rabbits, mink, and foxes. Mineral and energy resources such as coal, gas, limestone, and gravel. Hardwood trees used for timber, which brings in over $7 million a year. But Monongahela National Forest has a problem; for several years, trees in the forest have not grown well. What are some reasons that trees might not grow well ( Figure 20.1)? Scientists have been working for several years to solve the mystery. The scientists suspected that the soil is missing nutrients that the trees and other plants need to grow. Can you design an experiment that scientists could do to test this hypothesis? (There is a clue in the caption for Figure 20.1.) The Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia contains many natural resources. Notice the air pollution that obscures the view. The scientists sampled the soil and tested it for important nutrients. They discovered that the soil has very low levels of plant nutrients, such as magnesium and calcium. Can you develop a hypothesis for why these nutrients might be missing from the soil? The scientists thought that air pollution from nearby factories had released chemicals into the environment that removed the nutrients from the soil and carried them away. How would the scientists test that hypothesis? Scientists in the Monongahela National Forest are still researching the missing plant nutrients. They are trying to learn what they can do to help keep the nutrients in the soil so the trees will grow better. Like the Monongahela National Forest, people use parts of the Earth for many reasons, such as food, water, building materials, timber, recreation, and energy ( Figure 20.2). As youve already learned, human activities can degrade natural resources, just like air pollution from factories is speeding up the loss of soil nutrients in West Virginia. We use Earths resources for many purposes, including recreation and natural beauty. For natural resources to continue to be available, they need to be protected. We also need to conserve natural resources so they will last longer. When we practice conservation, we make sure resources will be available in the future, both for ourselves and for other organisms. 
Renewable versus  Non- Renewable  Resources 	  In the Earths Energy chapter, energy resources were classified as renewable or non-renewable. How do you think other natural resources, such as minerals and forests, are classified? Like energy resources, all natural resources are divided into renewable and non-renewable. Can you define these terms? Renewable resources can be regenerated or grown so rapidly that they reappear at the same rate or even faster as they are being used ( Figure 20.3). Are forests a renewable resource? Why are they a renewable resource? Why arent they a renewable resource? Although new trees can grow to replace logged trees, their growth is often too slow for the trees to be of use for a long time. Loggers just move to a new area rather than wait for the forest to regenerate. An old growth forest, like this tropical rainforest in Malaysia, is a complex ecosystem with many types of plants and animals. When a forest is destroyed by logging, it takes hundreds or thousands of years for the forest to regenerate. Other examples of resources that are renewable but not entirely renewable include soil, wildlife, and water. How do these resources fit in both categories? Soil has a very slow renewal rate, so they are often non-renewable. Fish and other wildlife can reproduce and so are a renewable resource, yet it is possible to take so many of these creatures that the populations are not able to rebound, making them a non-renewable resource ( Figure 20.4). Organisms can be over-hunted, over-fished or have populations decline because of habitat loss so that their numbers go so low they are no longer a renewable resource. Non-renewable resources are resources that cannot be regenerated on a useful timescale. Fossil fuels and most minerals are non-renewable resources. We can (and eventually will) run out of these resources. 
Common  Materials  We  Use from the  Earth 	  People depend on natural resources for just about everything that keeps us fed and sheltered, as well as for the things that keep us entertained. Every person in the United States uses about 20,000 kilograms (40,000 pounds) of minerals every year for a wide range of products, such as cell phones, TVs, jewelry, and cars. Table 20.1 shows Chimpanzees are eaten and taken as pets so their numbers in the wild are declining. some common objects, the materials they are made from and whether they are renewable or non-renewable. 
Natural  Resources  Used 	  Are These Resources Renewable or Non-renewable? 
Jewelry 	  Precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum. Gems like diamonds, rubies, emeralds, turquoise. 
Non-renewable 	  Electronic Appliances (TVs, computers, DVD players, cell phones, etc.) Many different metals, like copper, mercury, gold. 
Clothing 	  Soil to grow fibers such as cotton. Sunlight for the plants to grow. Animals for fur and leather. 
Food 	  Soil to grow plants. Wildlife and agricultural animals. 
Bottled  Water 	  Water from streams or springs. Petroleum products to make plastic bottles. 
Gasoline 	  Petroleum drilled from wells. 
Household  Electricity 	  Coal, natural gas, solar power, wind power, hydroelectric power. 
Paper 	  Trees; Sunlight Soil. 
Houses 	  Trees for timber. Rocks and minerals for construction materials, for example, granite, gravel, sand. 
Resource  Availability 	  Tampa Bay, Florida, has one of the few desalination plants in the United States. Of course the greatest example of this is oil. Only 12 countries have approximately 80% of all of the worlds oil ( Figure 20.6). However, the biggest users of oil, the United States, China, and Japan, are all located outside this oil-rich region. This leads to a situation in which the availability and price of the oil is determined largely by one set of countries that have their own interests to look out for. The result has sometimes been war, which may have been attributed to all sorts of reasons, but at the bottom, the reason is oil. The nations in blue are the 12 biggest producers of oil; they are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. The topic of overconsumption was touched on in the Ecosystems and Human Populations chapter. Many people in developed countries, such as the United States and most of Europe, use many more natural resources than people in many other countries. We have many luxury and recreational items, and it is often cheaper for us to throw something away than to fix it or just hang on to it for a while longer. This consumerism leads to greater resource use, but it also leads to more waste. Pollution from discarded materials degrades the land, air, and water ( Figure 20.7). Natural resource use is generally lower in developing countries because people cannot afford many products. Some of these nations export natural resources to the developed world since their deposits may be richer and the cost of labor lower. Environmental regulations are often more lax, further lowering the cost of resource extraction. Besides obtaining resources, we also dump waste on these nations. Many of our electronic wastes, which we think are being recycled, end up in developing countries where they pose a problem for human health and the environment ( Figure 20.8). Pollution from discarded materials degrades the environment and reduces the availability of natural resources. Electronic wastes are sent to developing nations where people pick through them for valuable materials. These wastes contain many toxic compounds and are hazardous. 
Conserving  Natural  Resources 	  So that people in developed nations maintain a good lifestyle and people in developing nations have the ability to improve their lifestyles, natural resources must be conserved and protected ( Figure 20.9). People are researching ways to find renewable alternatives to non-renewable resources. Here is a checklist of ways to conserve resources: Buy less stuff (use items as long as you can, and ask yourself if you really need something new). Reduce excess packaging (drink tap water instead of water from plastic bottles). Recycle materials such as metal cans, old cell phones, and plastic bottles. Purchase products made from recycled materials. Reduce pollution so that resources are maintained. Prevent soil erosion. Plant new trees to replace those that are cut down. Drive cars less, take public transportation, bicycle, or walk. Recycling can help conserve natural resources. Conserve energy at home (turn out lights when they are not needed).

Lesson  Summary 	  We use natural resources for many things. Natural resources give us food, water, recreation, energy, building materials, and luxury items. Many resources vary in their availability throughout the world. Some are rare, difficult to get, or in short supply. Natural resources must be preserved and protected from pollution and overuse. Buying fewer new products and recycling will help to conserve resources.

Which is more sustainable: using renewable resources or non-renewable resources? Why? Discuss why it takes energy to get energy and why some forms of energy are more useful than others. Describe some ways to conserve energy or to use energy more efficiently. energy efficiency net energy net-energy ratio 
Introduction 	  The Earths Energy chapter deals with many aspects of energy and energy use. It would be good to review it before embarking on this lesson on energy conservation. Getting and using natural energy sources is a lot like spending money to get money. To get energy, we must use a lot of energy. Finding an energy source, extracting it, refining it, and transporting it to where it will be used all require energy. One way to keep the energy costs of energy down is to use energy more efficiently: to conserve energy. 
Obtaining  Energy 	  Net energy is the amount of useable energy available from a resource after subtracting the amount of energy needed to make the energy from that resource available. For example, every 5 barrels of oil that are made available for use require 1 barrel for extracting and refining the petroleum. What is the net energy from this process? About 4 barrels (5 barrels minus 1 barrel). What happens if the energy needed to extract and refine oil increases? Why might that happen? The energy cost of an energy resource increases when the easy deposits of that resource have already been consumed. For example, if all the nearshore petroleum in a region has been extracted, more costly drilling must take place further offshore ( Figure 20.10). If the energy cost of obtaining energy increases, the resource will be used even faster. The net-energy ratio demonstrates the difference between the amount of energy available in a resource and the amount of energy used to get it. If it takes 8 units of energy to make available 10 units of energy, then the net-energy ratio is 10/8 or 1.25. What does a net-energy ratio larger than 1 mean? What if the net-energy ratio is less than 1? A net-energy ratio larger than 1 means that there is a net gain in usable energy; a net-energy ratio smaller than one means there is an overall energy loss. Table 20.2 shows the net-energy ratios for some common energy sources. Offshore drilling is taking place in deeper water than before. It takes a lot of energy to build a deep drilling platform and to run it. 
Coal-fired  Electricity 	  Notice from the table that solar energy yields much more net energy than other sources. This is because it takes very little energy to get usable solar energy. Sunshine is abundant and does not need to be found, extracted, or transported very far. The range for coal-fired electricity is because of the differing costs of transporting the coal. What does this suggest about using coal to generate electricity? The efficiency is greater in areas where the coal is locally mined and does not have to be transported great distances ( Figure 20.11). Obtaining coal for energy takes a lot of energy. The coal must be located, extracted, refined, and transported. This is not to say that solar energy is less expensive than other types of energy. The cost of energy is dependent on lots of different factors, such as the cost of the equipment needed to harness the energy. If solar power cost less to use, it would be more widespread. 
Energy  Efficiency 	  Energy efficiency describes how much useful work is extracted from one unit of energy. Remember that although less energy-efficient than transportation by boats and trains. Compact fluorescent light bulbs are more efficient than incandescent light bulbs ( Figure 20.12). 
Energy  Conservation 	  What benefits are there from energy conservation? Conserving energy means that less energy is needed, which reduces costs, ensures that non-renewable energy sources will last longer, and reduces political and environmental impacts. What are the two ways that energy can be conserved? (1) Use less energy, and (2) use energy more efficiently. The pie chart ( Figure 20.13) shows how energy is used in the United States. Table 20.3 shows some ways that people can decrease energy use and use energy more efficiently in transportation, residences, industries, and office settings. Almost one-half of the energy used in the United States is for transportation and home use. This means individual choices can make a big impact on energy conservation. 
Transportation 	  Ride a bike or walk instead of taking a car. Reduce the number of trips you make. Use public transportation. Increase fuel efficiency in cars. Buy and drive smaller cars. Build cars from lighter and stronger materials. Drive at speeds at or below 90 kilometers per hour (55 miles per hour). 
Residential 	  Turn off lights when not in a room. Only run appliances when necessary. Unplug appliances when not in use. Wear a sweater instead of turning up heat. Use fans instead of turning down air conditioner. Engage in activities that do not involve electronics. Rely on sunlight instead of artificial light. Replace old appliances with newer more efficient models. Insulate your home. Make sure windows and doors are well sealed. Use LED bulbs if available, or compact fluorescent light bulbs (and dispose of properly!). 
Industrial 	  Recycle materials like soda cans and steel. Reduce use of plastic, paper, and metal materials. Practice conservation in factories. Reuse materials. Design equipment to be more efficient. TABLE 20.3: (continued) 
How  We  Can  Use  Energy  More  Efficiently 	  Commercial (businesses, shopping areas, etc.) Turn off appliances and equipment when not in use. Use fluorescent lighting. Set thermostats to automatically turn off heat or air conditioning when buildings are closed. Using less energy, or using energy more efficiently, will help conserve our energy resources. Since many of the energy resources we depend upon are non-renewable, we need to make sure that we waste them as little as possible. Energy saving tips from the U.S. Department of Energy: URL . The U.S. Department of Energy has a video to let you know how a home energy audit will help you to make your home more energy efficient. Be sure to follow links to the Do it yourself page. URL _home/energy_audits/index.cfm/mytopic=11160 
Lesson  Summary 	  It takes energy to get energy. Net energy refers to the amount of energy left for use after we expend energy to get, transport, and refine other forms of energy. Energy resources can be conserved by reducing energy use. Energy can be used more efficiently by getting more work out of each unit of energy. There are many ways for an individual to conserve energy. If it takes energy to get energy, then what are the best choices for types of energy? Put each of these actions in order from most important to least: choosing a sustainable form of energy, increasing energy efficiency, conserving energy use. Explain the order you chose. Could everyone in the world use as much energy as a person in the United States does each day? Why or why not? /commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_use_by_lightbulb_type.svg . Public Domain 
Chapter  Outline 	  The Colorado River originates in the mountains of northern Colorado and then travels through the desert before reaching its delta at the Gulf of California. Where the river once roared into the Gulf, there is now nothing left after five states and a bit of northern Mexico use its water for irrigation and to provide water for the overgrown desert cities of the Southwest. The river is seen in dark blue at the top left of the image. After traveling through farmlands, it fans out at the base of the mountains on the left side. The bluish purple running from left to right across the image is water from the Gulf that has traveled up the inlet since no river water fills the inlet. The rivers mouth is the bright blue horseshoe on the bottom right. The little bit of water that reaches Mexico is used by farmers near the international border. The gray mudflats were built with sediments deposited in the delta before two massive dams stopped the downstream flow of sediments. The large yellow region is the Gran Desierto, an arid, sand-covered landscape. The distribution of water resources in the Western United States will be a topic of much discussion in the coming decades.

Learning  Objectives 	  Discuss how much water is taken up by each water use. Explain the difference between consumptive and non-consumptive water uses. What is the origin of Californias fresh water supply? aquaculture consumptive water use drip irrigation non-consumptive water use 
Introduction 	  What is the most important thing for all life on Earth? Arguably, it is water (arguably, because a lot of other things are needed for life, too). From the smallest bacteria to the largest trees, all forms of life on Earth depend on water for survival. Although you could likely go a few weeks without eating, people cannot survive for more than a few days without drinking water. 
Human  Uses of  Water 	  Besides drinking and washing, people need water for agriculture, industry, household uses, and recreation ( Figure Water use can be consumptive or non-consumptive, depending on whether the water is lost to the ecosystem. Non-consumptive water use includes water that can be recycled and reused ( Figure 21.2). For example, the water that goes down the drain and enters the sewer system is purified and then redistributed for reuse. By recycling water, the overall water consumption is reduced. Consumptive water use takes the water out of the ecosystem ( Figure 21.3). Can you name some examples of consumptive water use? Water used for home, industrial, and agricultural purposes in different regions. Globally more than two-thirds of water is for agriculture. Non-consumptive water use also includes water that is used for recreation, such as whitewater rafting on these rapids. A large amount of the water that comes out of these sprinklers is consumptive because it is lost to evaporation and runoff. 
Agricultural  Water  Use 	  Some of the worlds farmers still farm without irrigation by choosing crops that match the amount of rain that falls in their area. But some years are wet and others are dry. For farmers to avoid years in which they produce little or no food, many of the worlds crops are produced using irrigation. Two popular irrigation methods are: Overhead sprinklers (pictured in the Figure 21.3). Trench irrigation: canals carry water from a water source to the fields. Both of these methods waste water. Between 15% and 36% percent of the water never reaches the crops because it evaporates or leaves the fields as runoff ( Figure 21.4). Water that runs off a field often takes valuable soil with it. So why do people use these methods? Flood irrigation is similarly wasteful of water. This farm is in the Arizona desert where evaporation greatly exceeds precipitation. A much more efficient way to water crops is drip irrigation ( Figure 21.5). With drip irrigation, pipes and tubes deliver small amounts of water directly to the soil at the roots of each plant or tree. The water is not sprayed into the air or over the ground so nearly all of it goes directly into the soil and plant roots. So back to the question, why do farmers use wasteful irrigation methods when water-efficient methods are available? Many farmers and farming corporations have not switched to more efficient irrigation methods for two reasons: What ideas can you come up with to encourage farmers to use more efficient irrigation systems? 
Aquaculture 	  Aquaculture is a different type of agriculture. Aquaculture is farming to raise fish, shellfish, algae, or aquatic plants ( Figure 21.6). As the supplies of fish from lakes, rivers, and the oceans dwindle, people are getting more fish from aquaculture. Raising fish increases our food resources and is especially valuable where protein sources are limited. Drip irrigation delivers water to the base of each plant so little is lost to evaporation and runoff. Workers at a fish farm harvest fish they will sell to stores. The next time you pass the fish display in the grocery store, look for labels for farm raised fish. Growing fish in a large scale requires that the fish stocks are healthy and protected from predators. The species raised must be hearty, inexpensive to feed, and able to reproduce in captivity ( Figure 21.7). Wastes must be flushed out to keep animals healthy. Raising shellfish at farms can also be successful. This salmon farm in British Columbia keeps young fish for up to two years. For some species, aquaculture is very successful and environmental harm is minimal. But for other species, aquaculture can cause problems. Natural landscapes, such as mangroves, which are rich ecosystems and also protect coastlines from storm damage, may be lost to fish farms ( Figure 21.8). For fish farmers, keeping costs down may be a problem since coastal land may be expensive and labor costs may be high. Large predatory fish at the 4th or 5th trophic level must eat a lot, so feeding large numbers of these fish is expensive and environmentally costly. Farmed fish are genetically different from wild stocks and if they escape into the wild they may cause problems for native fish. Because the organisms live so close together, parasites are common and may also escape into the wild. 
Industrial  Water  Use 	  Industrial water use accounts for an estimated 15% of worldwide water use with a much greater percentage in developed nations. Industrial uses of water include power plants that use water to cool their equipment, and oil refineries that use water for chemical processes. Manufacturing is also water intensive ( Figure 21.9). 
Household  Use 	  Think about all the ways you use water in a day ( Figure 21.10). You need to count the water you drink, cook with, bathe in, garden with, let run down the drain, or flush down the toilet. In developed countries, people use a lot of water while in less developed countries people use much less. Globally, household or personal water use is estimated to account for 15% of world-wide water use. Some household water uses are non-consumptive, because water is recaptured in sewer systems, treated, and returned to surface water supplies for reuse. Many things can be done to lower water consumption at home. Shrimp farms on the coast of Ecuador are shown as blue rectangles. Mangrove forests, salt flats, and salt marshes have been converted to shrimp farms. A power plant in Poland sits on the edge of a lake with easy access to water for cooling and other purposes. Convert lawns and gardens to drip-irrigation systems. Install low-flow shower heads and low-flow toilets. In what other ways can you use less water at home? 
Recreational  Use 	  People love water for swimming, fishing, boating, river rafting, and other activities ( Figure 21.11). Even activities such as golf, where there may not be any standing water, require plenty of water to make the grass on the course green. Despite its value, the amount of water that most recreational activities use is low: less than 1% of all the water we use. Many recreational water uses are non-consumptive including swimming, fishing, and boating. Golf courses are the biggest recreational water consumer since they require large amounts for irrigation, especially because many courses are located in warm, sunny, desert regions where water is scarce and evaporation is high. 
Environmental  Use 	  Environmental use of water includes creating wildlife habitat. Lakes are built to create places for fish and water birds ( Figure 21.12). Most environmental uses are non-consumptive and account for even a smaller percentage of water use than recreational uses. Environmental Water Use: Wetlands and other environments depend on clean water to survive. Water shortages are a leading cause of global biodiversity loss. 
California  Water  Resources 	  California has many sources of water ( Figure 21.13). The winter snow pack in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges feeds rivers that crisscross the state. Virtually all of these rivers are dammed, some more than once, to supply power and water to the cities and farmlands of the state. Groundwater is also an important source of water in California. In a normal year about 40% of the states water supply comes from groundwater. In a drought year, the number can rise to 60% or more. The largest groundwater reservoirs are found in the Central Valley where thousands of years of snow melt has fed the aquifers. In many locations, much more groundwater is used each year than is available to recharge the aquifer. Subsidence of the land is common in these regions. Despite these vast water sources, the states large population and enormous agricultural landscape put a strain on the water supply. Water rights in California are complex and controversial. Although about 75% of the water resources are in the northern one-third of the state, the largest usage, about 80%, is in the southern two-thirds. Besides projects that exist to distribute water within the state, a large source of water is the Colorado River. 
D:  State of  Thirst:  Californias  Water  Future 	  Californias population is growing by hundreds of thousands of people a year, but much of the state receives as much annual rainfall as Morocco. With fish populations crashing, global warming, and the demands of the countrys largest agricultural industry, the pressures on our water supply are increasing. Learn more at: URL quest/television/state-of-thirst-californias-water-future (a) Californias surface water resources include streams with headwaters in and outside the state. (b) Many of Californias rivers feed into the Sacramento River in the northern part of the Central Valley, and the San Joaquin River in the southern portion. Red is vegetation and blue-gray areas are buildings. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Human water use is dominantly in five categories: agriculture, industry, domestic, recreation, and environmental. Water use can be consumptive or non-consumptive. Despite Californias abundant water supply from surface streams and groundwater, the state has a number of water rights issues that will be important long into the future. Is fresh water ever more valuable than gold or diamonds? How can farmers and other people be encouraged to use more efficient irrigation methods? With such abundant water resources, why do Californias planners worry about the states future water resources? 
Learning  Objectives 	  Explain why water shortages are increasingly frequent throughout the world. Discuss why 1.1 billion people (one-fifth of the people on Earth) do not have access to safe drinking water. drought pathogen 
Introduction 	  Humans are facing a worldwide water crisis, according to the United Nations. Many people do not have access to clean water to drink or to wash with. Sometimes there just is not enough water and sometimes the available water is unclean and unhealthy. 
World  Water  Distribution and  Supply 	  Humans use six times as much water today as they did 100 years ago. People living in developed countries use a far greater proportion of the worlds water than people in less developed countries. Water scarcity is a problem now and will become an even larger problem in the future as water sources are reduced or polluted and population grows. 
Water  Distribution 	  Water is unevenly distributed around the world. Large portions of the world receive very little water from rainfall or rivers relative to their population. This includes much of northern Africa and central Asia. Over time, there will be less water per person within many river basins as the population grows and global temperatures increase so that some water sources are lost. Over time, many nations, even developed nations, are projected to have less water per person than now. Global warming will change patterns of rainfall and water distribution. As the Earth warms, regions that currently receive an adequate supply of rain may shift. Regions that rely on snow melt may find that there is less snow and the melt comes earlier and faster in the spring, causing the water to run off and not be available through the dry summers. A change in temperature and precipitation would completely change the types of plants and animals that can live successfully in that region. 
Water  Shortages 	  In 1995, about 40% of the worlds population faced water scarcity. Scientists estimate that by the year 2025, nearly half of the worlds people wont have enough water to meet their daily needs. Nearly one-quarter of the worlds people will have less than 500 m3 of water to use in an entire year. That amount is less water in a year than some people in the United States use in one day. As water supplies become scarce, conflicts will arise between the individuals or nations that have enough clean water and those that do not ( Figure 21.14). Just as with energy resources today, wars may erupt over water. Many regions already experience water scarcity. This map shows the number of months in which the amount of water that is used exceeds the availability of water that can be used sustainably. This is projected to get worse as demand increases. Droughts occur when a region experiences unusually low precipitation for months or years ( Figure 21.15). Periods of drought may create or worsen water shortages. Human activities can contribute to the frequency and duration of droughts. For example, deforestation keeps trees from returning water to the atmosphere by transpiration; part of the water cycle becomes broken. Because it is difficult to predict when droughts will happen, it is difficult for countries to predict how serious water shortages will be each year. 
Scarcity of  Safe  Drinking  Water 	  The water that comes out of our faucets is safe because it has gone through a series of treatment and purification processes to remove contaminants. Those of us who are fortunate enough to always be able to get clean water from a tap in our home may have trouble imagining life in a country that cannot afford the technology to treat and purify water. 
Polluted  Water 	  Many people in the world have no choice but to drink from the same polluted river where sewage is dumped. One-fifth of all people in the world, more than 1.1 billion people, do not have access to safe water for drinking, personal cleanliness, and domestic use ( Figure 21.16). Unsafe drinking water carries many pathogens, or infectious organisms, such as bacteria or fungi. Toxic chemicals, radiological hazards, and parasites are also disease-causing agents found in water. Exponential growth of bacteria is explained in this video giving the viewer a good idea of how a small number of bacteria can cause a major toxic problem. URL Exponential growth of bacteria is explained in this video giving the viewer a good idea of how a small number of bacteria can cause a major toxic problem (1e IE Stand.): URL (16:00). The Ganges River is a source of water for drinking and bathing for millions of people. Waterborne disease caused by unsafe drinking water is the leading cause of death for children under the age of five in many nations and a cause of death and illness for many adults. About 88% of all diseases are caused by drinking unsafe water ( Figure 21.17). Throughout the world, more than 14,000 people die every day from waterborne diseases, such as cholera, and many of the worlds hospital beds are occupied by patients suffering from a waterborne disease. Dracunculiasis	commonly	known	as Guinea	Worm,	is	contracted	when	a person drinks the guinea worm larvae. Guinea worm is a serious problem in parts of Africa that is being eradicated. Learn what is being done to decrease the number of people suffering from this parasite in the video below. URL 
Water  Scarcity 	  Water scarcity can have dire consequences for the people, the economy, and the environment. Without adequate water, crops and livestock dwindle and people go hungry. Industrial, construction, and economic development is halted, causing a nation to sink further into poverty. The risk of regional conflicts over scarce water resources rises. People die from diseases, thirst, or even in war over scarce resources. In many cases, water disputes add to tensions between countries where differing national interests and withdrawal rights have been in conflict. Some of todays greatest tensions are happening in places where water is scarce. Water disputes are happening along 260 different river systems that cross national boundaries. Some of these disputes are potentially very serious. International water laws, such as the Helsinki Rules, help interpret water rights among countries. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Water is a renewable resource, but it is not unlimited. Water is not evenly distributed across the globe. Water is so valuable that countries have fought each other over water rights throughout history. Many people live with water scarcity and many more will do so in the future. Underdeveloped countries are rarely able to afford water treatment and purification facilities, although international aid is sometimes available. What can we do to help the one-fifth of the people on Earth who do not have access to safe drinking water? How can we reduce water shortages because of overuse, overpopulation, and drought? Water is so valuable that wars have been fought over it throughout history. Could conserving freshwater now help avoid future wars?

Introduction 	  Freshwater and ocean pollution are serious global problems that affect the availability of safe drinking water, human health, and the environment. Waterborne diseases from water pollution kill millions of people in undeveloped countries every year. 
Sources of  Water  Pollution 	  Water pollution contributes to water shortages by making some water sources unavailable for use. In underdeveloped countries, raw sewage is dumped into the same water that people drink and bathe in. Even in developed countries, water pollution affects human and environmental health. Water pollution includes any contaminant that gets into lakes, streams, and oceans. The most widespread source of water contamination in developing countries is raw sewage. In developed countries, the three main sources of water pollution are described below. 
D:  Mercury in  San  Francisco  Bay 	  Mercury, a potent neurotoxin, has been flowing into the San Francisco Bay since the Gold Rush Era. It has settled in the bays mud and made its way up the food chain, endangering wildlife and making many fish unsafe to eat. Now a multi-billion-dollar plan aims to clean it up. Learn more at: URL rancisco-bay/ . 
Municipal  Pollution 	  Wastewater from cities and towns contains many different contaminants from many different homes, businesses, and industries ( Figure 21.18). Contaminants come from: Sewage disposal (some sewage is inadequately treated or untreated). Storm drains. Septic tanks: sewage from homes. Boats that dump sewage. Yard runoff (fertilizer and herbicide waste). Municipal and agricultural pollution. 
Industrial  Pollution 	  Factories and hospitals spew pollutants into the air and waterways ( Figure 21.19). Some of the most hazardous industrial pollutants include: Radioactive substances from nuclear power plants, medical and scientific sources. Heavy metals, organic toxins, oils, and solids in industrial waste. Chemicals, such as sulfur, from burning fossil fuels. Oil and other petroleum products from supertanker spills and offshore drilling accidents. Heated water from industrial processes, such as power stations. Industrial Waste Water: Polluted water coming from a factory in Mexico. The different colors of foam indicate various chemicals in the water and industrial pollution. 
Agricultural  Pollution 	  Runoff from crops, livestock, and poultry farming carries contaminants such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste into nearby waterways ( Figure 21.20). Soil and silt also runs off farms. Animal wastes may carry harmful diseases, particularly in the developing world. The high density of animals in a factory farm means that runoff from the area is full of pollutants. Fertilizers that run off of lawns and farm fields are extremely harmful to the environment. Nutrients, such as nitrates, in the fertilizer promote algae growth in the water they flow into. With the excess nutrients, lakes, rivers, and bays become clogged with algae and aquatic plants. Eventually these organisms die and decompose. Decomposition uses up all the dissolved oxygen in the water. Without oxygen, large numbers of plants, fish, and bottom-dwelling animals die. Every year dead zones appear in lakes and nearshore waters. A dead zone is an area of hundreds of kilometers of ocean without fish or plant life ( Figure 21.21). The Gulf of Mexico dead zone is created by the Mississippi River, which carries fertilizer from farms and yards covering an enormous land area. In 2009 the dead zone was more than 22,000 square kilometers (8,500 mi2). The Mississippi is not the only river that carries the nutrients necessary to cause a dead zone. Rivers that drain regions where human population density is high and where crops are grown create dead zones all over the world ( Figure 21.22). Dead zones off the coasts. Red dots show the location and size of the dead zone; black circles show the location but the size is unknown. Darker blue regions of the oceans indicate that organic particulates are high and may lead to a dead zone. 
Ocean  Pollution 	  Most ocean pollution comes as runoff from land and originates as agricultural, industrial, and municipal wastes ( Figure 21.23). The remaining 20% of water pollution enters the ocean directly from oil spills and people dumping wastes directly into the water. Ships at sea empty their wastes directly into the ocean, for example. Coastal pollution can make coastal water unsafe for humans and wildlife. After rainfall, there can be enough runoff pollution that beaches must be closed to prevent the spread of disease from pollutants. A surprising number of beaches are closed because of possible health hazards each year. A large proportion of the fish we rely on for food live in the coastal wetlands or lay their eggs there. Coastal runoff from farm waste often carries water-borne organisms that cause lesions that kill fish. Humans who come in contact with polluted waters and affected fish can also experience harmful symptoms. More than one-third of the shellfish-growing waters of the United States are adversely affected by coastal pollution.

The  Gulf of  Mexico  Oil  Spill 	  New drilling techniques have allowed oil companies to drill in deeper waters than ever before. This allows us to access oil deposits that were never before possible but with great technological difficulty. The risks from deepwater drilling and the consequences when something goes wrong are greater. Working on oil platforms is dangerous and workers are exposed to harsh ocean conditions and gas explosions. The danger was never more obvious than on April 20, 2010, when 11 workers were killed and 17 injured in an explosion on a deepwater oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure 21.24). The drilling rig, operated by BP, was 77 km (48 miles) offshore and the depth to the well was more than 5,000 feet. Two days after the explosion, the drill rig sank. The 5,000-foot pipe that connected the wellhead to the drilling platform bent. Oil was free to gush into the Gulf of Mexico from nearly a mile deep ( Figure 21.25). Initial efforts to cap or contain the spill at or near its source all failed to stop the vast oil spill. It was not until July 15, nearly three months after the accident, that the well was successfully capped. Estimating the flow of oil into the Gulf from the well was extremely difficult because the leak was so far below the The U.S. Coast Guard tries to put out the fire and search for missing workers after the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. Eleven workers were killed. surface. The U.S. government estimates that about 4.9 million barrels entered the Gulf at a rate of 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day. The largest previous oil spill in the United States was of 300,000 barrels by the Exxon Valdez in 1989 in Prince William Sound, Alaska. (a) On May 17, 2010, oil had been leaking into the Gulf for nearly one month. On that date government estimates put the maximum total oil leak at 1,600,000 barrels, according to the New York Times. (b) The BP oil spill on June 19, 2010. The government estimates for total oil leaked by this date was 3,200,000 barrels. Once the oil is in the water, there are three types of methods for dealing with it: Burning the oil can reduce the amount in the water. A containment boom holds back oil, but it is only effective in calm water. BP drilled two relief wells into the original well. When the relief wells entered the original borehole, specialized liquids were pumped into the original well to stop the flow. Operation of the relief wells began in August 2010. The original well was declared effectively dead on September 19, 2010. The economic and environmental impact of this spill will be felt for many years. Many people rely on the Gulf for their livelihoods or for recreation. Commercial fishing, tourism, and oil-related jobs are the economic engines of the region. Fearing contamination, NOAA imposed a fishing ban on approximately one-third of the Gulf ( Figure 21.28). Tourism is down in the region as beach goers find other ways to spend their time. Real estate prices along the Gulf have declined precipitously. This was the extent of the banned area on June 21, 2010. The toll on wildlife is felt throughout the Gulf. Plankton, which form the base of the food chain, are killed by the oil, leaving other organisms without food. Islands and marshlands around the Gulf have many species that are already at risk, including four endangered species of sea turtles ( Figure 21.29). With such low numbers, rebuilding their populations after the spill will be difficult. The Gulf of Mexico is one of only two places in the world where bluefin tuna spawn and they are also already endangered. Marine mammals in the Gulf may come up into the slick as they come to the surface to breathe ( Figure 21.30). Eight national parks and seashores are found along the Gulf shores. Other locations may be ecologically sensitive habitats such as mangroves or marshlands ( Figure 21.31). This story is a long way from being over. 
Thermal  Water  Pollution 	  Thermal pollution is any rise or fall in water temperatures that is not weather related. Power plants cool heated equipment with local streams, lakes, or ocean water and then return that heated water back into the environment. Cold water pollution is observed when very cold water is released from reservoirs. Aquatic organisms are often sensitive to even small temperature changes. The Macquarie perch is now extinct in most of its upland river habitats partially because of thermal pollution by dams. The endangered Kemps Ridley turtle breeds only around the Gulf of Mexico. Seabirds dive into a slick because the surface looks like calmer water. Oil coated birds cannot regulate their body temperatures. These pelicans are waiting for cleanup. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Industrial, agricultural, and municipal sources produce harmful water pollutants such as toxic chemicals, radiological agents, and animal wastes. Deep water oil drilling presents an enormous threat to the economic and ecological health of the oceans as seen in the Gulf Oil Spill of 2010. The Chandeleur Islands are a popular location for migrating birds to rest. Oil was already found off the islands in early May. How does water pollution reduce the amount of drinking water available for people to use? About 50% of all infectious diseases are caused by water pollution. What can be done to reduce the number of pathogens that reach our fresh water supplies? Ocean pollution harms some of the most productive sources of marine life. How can we change our behaviors to protect marine life? 
Learning  Objectives 	  Describe several ways water can be conserved. Discuss how water is treated to eliminate harmful particles. State what governments and international organizations can do to reduce water pollution. sewage treatment water purification 
Water  Treatment 	  The goal of water treatment is to make water suitable for such uses as drinking water, medicine, agriculture, and industrial processes. People living in developed countries suffer from few waterborne diseases and illness, because they have extensive water treatment systems to collect, treat, and redeliver clean water ( Figure 21.32). Many underdeveloped nations have few or no water treatment facilities. A wastewater treatment facility uses settling containers, filters, chemicals, and biological agents to remove impurities. Wastewater contains hundreds of contaminants such as suspended solids, oxygen-demanding materials, dissolved inorganic compounds, and harmful bacteria. In a wastewater treatment plant, multiple processes must be used to produce usable water: Sewage treatment removes contaminants, such as solids and particles, from sewage. Water purification produces drinking water by removing bacteria, algae, viruses, fungi, unpleasant elements such as iron and sulfur, and man-made chemical pollutants. The treatment method used depends on the kind of wastewater being treated and the desired end result. Wastewater is treated using a series of steps, each of which produces water with fewer contaminants.

QUEST investigates the causes of the spills and whats being done to prevent them. Learn more at: URL pills-in-sf-bay/ . 
Reducing  Water  Pollution 	  Water pollution can be reduced in two ways: Keep the water from becoming polluted. Clean water that is already polluted. Keeping water from becoming polluted often requires laws to be sure that people and companies behave responsibly. In the United States, the Clean Water Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to sets standards for water quality for industry, agriculture, and domestic uses. The law gives the EPA the authority to reduce the discharge of pollution into waterways, finance wastewater treatment plants, and manage runoff. Since its passage in 1972, more wastewater treatment plants have been constructed and the release of industrial waste into the water supply is better controlled. The United Nations and other international groups are working to improve global water quality standards by providing the technology for treating water. These organizations also educate people in how to protect and improve the quality of the water they use ( Figure 21.33). What can individuals do to protect water quality? Find approved recycling or disposal facilities for motor oil and household chemicals. Use lawn, garden, and farm chemicals sparingly and wisely. Repair automobile or boat engine leaks immediately. Keep litter, pet waste, leaves, and grass clippings out of street gutters and storm drains. Scientists control water pollution by sampling the water and studying the pollutants that are in the water. 
Controlling  Ocean  Pollution 	  Because so much of the pollution that ends up in the oceans starts out on land, one way to reduce ocean pollution is to reduce pollutants in rivers and other effluent that ends up in the sea. Although it is extremely difficult to do because the ocean is so vast, pollution that is put directly into the ocean can be better regulated and monitored ( Figure 21.34). Marine pollution can be controlled by regulation, such as preventing pumping of ballast water from ships. Government and international agencies can pass laws, provide funding, and enforce laws to prevent and clean up ocean pollution. Several national and international agencies monitor and control ocean pollution, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the EPA. The long-term effects of oil spills are not well understood. Although the waters contaminated by the Exxon Valdez spill have been free of contaminants for years, the rocks and sand beneath the surface on many beaches are still coated with oil. The best way to avoid these problems is to keep oil spills from happening. This requires better monitoring of the companies that are permitted to engage in drilling for oil and transporting oil. The recent spill into the Gulf of Mexico suggests that this type of monitoring is so far insufficient. 
Conserving  Water 	  reduce the Low-flow showerheads amount water used during showers. As human population growth continues, water conservation will become increasingly important globally ( Figure 21.35), especially in developed countries where people use an enormous amount of water. What are some of the ways you can conserve water in and around your home? Avoid polluting water so that less is needed. Convert to more efficient irrigation methods on farms and in gardens. Reduce household demand by installing water saving devices such as low-flow shower heads and toilets. Reduce personal demand by turning off the tap when water is not being used and taking shorter showers. Engage in water saving practices: water lawns less, sweep rather than hose down sidewalks, and others. At Earth Summit 2002 many governments approved a Plan of Action to address the scarcity of water and safe drinking water in developing countries. One goal of this plan is to cut in half the number of people without access to safe drinking water by 2015. This is a very important goal and one made more difficult as population continues to grow. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Many technologies are available to conserve water as well as to prevent and treat water pollution. Many underdeveloped countries cannot afford the technology to provide their citizens with clean water. The best way to have clean water is to keep water from being polluted. Conserving water is necessary to be sure that water will be available for as many uses as possible. The American Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS Atlas of Population and Environment.

Chapter  Outline 	  Air pollution goes hand-in-hand with industrialization as can be seen in this satellite image taken over Beijing, China. The air is a uniform brownish gray, showing that the region is thick with smog. Although legislation protects the people who live in developed nations from at least some of the problems caused by air pollution, people in many developing nations have no such protection. In China, an ongoing battle to improve the standard of living of its people has resulted in unrestrained growth and little protection from environmental damage. At least 75% of the people who live in Chinas cities live with air quality that is below the national standard. Beijing is an enormous city of more than 10 million people, where many of the bicycles that have transported people for decades are being traded in for cars. Along with the increase in electricity generation from coal, and many other factors, the result is unhealthy living conditions. There is, unfortunately, still plenty of smog in developed nations as can be seen in this chapter.

Introduction 	  Earths atmosphere provides living creatures on the planet with the gases they need for photosynthesis and respiration. In addition, the ozone layer protects organisms from the Suns ultraviolet radiation. The importance of the atmosphere for Earths life cannot be overestimated yet people also use the atmosphere as a dump for waste gases and particles. 
Air  Quality 	  Pollutants include materials that are naturally occurring but are added to the atmosphere so that they are there in larger quantities than normal. Pollutants may also be human-made compounds that have never before been found in the atmosphere. Pollutants dirty the air, change natural processes in the atmosphere, and harm living things. 
Problems with  Air  Quality 	  Air pollution started to be a problem when early people burned wood for heat and cooking fires in enclosed spaces such as caves and small tents or houses. But the problems became more widespread as fossil fuels such as coal began to be burned during the Industrial Revolution ( Figure 22.1). Air pollution became a crisis in the developed nations in the mid-20th century. Coal smoke and auto exhaust combined to create toxic smog that in some places caused lung damage and sometimes death. In Donora, Pennsylvania, in October 1948, 20 people died and 4,000 became ill when coal smoke was trapped by an inversion. In London in December 1952, the Big Smog killed 4,000 people over five days. Many thousands more likely died of health complications from the event in the next several months. The 2012 Olympic Games in London opening ceremony contained a reenactment of the Industrial Revolution complete with pollution streaming from smokestacks. Photochemical smog, a different type of air pollution, first became a problem in Southern California after World War II. The abundance of cars and sunshine provided the perfect setting for a chemical reaction between some of the molecules in auto exhaust or oil refinery emissions, and sunshine ( Figure 22.2). Photochemical smog consists of more than 100 compounds, most importantly ozone. Much of the air pollution seen over Los Angeles is photochemical smog. 
The  Clean  Air  Act 	  The terrible events in Pennsylvania and London, plus the recognition of the hazards of photochemical smog, led to the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 in the United States. The act now regulates 189 pollutants. The six most important pollutants regulated by the Act are ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and the heavy metal lead. Other important regulated pollutants include benzene, perchloroethylene, methylene chloride, dioxin, asbestos, toluene, and metals such as cadmium, mercury, chromium, and lead compounds. What is the result of the Clean Air Act? In short, the air in the United States is much cleaner. Visibility is better and people are no longer incapacitated by industrial smog. However, despite the Act, industry, power plants, and vehicles put 160 million tons of pollutants into the air each year. Some of this smog is invisible and some contributes to the orange or blue haze that affects many cities. 
Regional  Air  Quality 	  Air quality in a region is not just affected by the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere in that location but by other geographical and atmospheric factors. Winds can move pollutants into or out of a region and a mountain range can trap pollutants on its leeward side. Inversions commonly trap pollutants within a cool air mass. If the inversion lasts long enough, pollution can reach dangerous levels. Pollutants remain over a region until they are transported out of the area by wind, diluted by air blown in from another region, transformed into other compounds, or carried to the ground when mixed with rain or snow. Table 22.1 lists the smoggiest cities in 2012: nine of the 10 are in California. Why do you think California cities are among those with the worst air pollution? The state has the right conditions for collecting pollutants including mountain ranges that trap smoggy air, arid and sometimes windless conditions, agriculture, industry, and lots and lots of cars. 
Types of  Air  Pollution 	  The two types of air pollutants are primary pollutants, which enter the atmosphere directly, and secondary pollutants, which form from a chemical reaction. 
Primary  Pollutants 	  Some primary pollutants are natural, such as volcanic ash. Dust is natural but exacerbated by human activities; for example, when the ground is torn up for agriculture or development. Most primary pollutants are the result of human activities, the direct emissions from vehicles and smokestacks. Primary pollutants include: Carbon oxides include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) ( Figure 22.3). Both are colorless, odorless gases. CO is toxic to both plants and animals. CO and CO2 are both greenhouse gases. High CO2 levels are found in major metropolitan areas and along the major interstate highways. Nitrogen oxides are produced when nitrogen and oxygen from the atmosphere come together at high temperatures. This occurs in hot exhaust gas from vehicles, power plants, or factories. Nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are greenhouse gases. Nitrogen oxides contribute to acid rain. Sulfur oxides include sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfur trioxide (SO3). These form when sulfur from burning coal reaches the air. Sulfur oxides are components of acid rain. Particulates are solid particles, such as ash, dust and fecal matter ( Figure 22.4). They are commonly formed from combustion of fossil fuels, and can produce smog. Particulates can contribute to asthma, heart disease, and some types of cancers. Particulates from a brush fire give the sky a strange glow in Arizona. Lead was once widely used in automobile fuels, paint, and pipes. This heavy metal can cause brain damage or blood poisoning. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are mostly hydrocarbons. Important VOCs include methane (a naturally occurring greenhouse gas that is increasing because of human activities), chlorofluorocarbons (human-made compounds that are being phased out because of their effect on the ozone layer), and dioxin (a byproduct of chemical production that serves no useful purpose, but is harmful to humans and other organisms). 
Secondary  Pollutants 	  Any city can have photochemical smog, but it is most common in sunny, dry locations. A rise in the number of vehicles in cities worldwide has increased photochemical smog. Nitrogen oxides, ozone, and several other compounds are some of the components of this type of air pollution. Photochemical smog forms when car exhaust is exposed to sunlight. Nitrogen oxides is created by gas combustion in cars and then into the air ( Figure 22.5). In the presence of sunshine, the NO2 splits and releases an oxygen ion (O). The O then combines with an oxygen molecule (O2) to form ozone (O3). This reaction can also go in reverse: Nitric oxide (NO) removes an oxygen atom from ozone to make it O2. The direction the reaction goes depends on how much NO2 and NO there is. If NO2 is three times more abundant than NO, ozone will be produced. If nitrous oxide levels are high, ozone will not be created. The brown color of the air behind the Golden Gate Bridge is typical of California cities, because of nitrogen oxides. Ozone is one of the major secondary pollutants. It is created by a chemical reaction that takes place in exhaust and in the presence of sunlight. The gas is acrid-smelling and whitish. Warm, dry cities surrounded by mountains, such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Denver, are especially prone to photochemical smog ( Figure 22.6). Photochemical smog peaks at midday on the hottest days of summer. Ozone is also a greenhouse gas. 
Causes of  Air  Pollution 	  Most air pollutants come from burning fossil fuels or plant material. Some are the result of evaporation from humanmade materials. Nearly half (49%) of air pollution comes from transportation, 28% from factories and power plants, and the remaining pollution from a variety of other sources. Counties with such high ozone levels that they do not attain federal air quality standards. 
Fossil  Fuels 	  Fossil fuels are burned in most motor vehicles and power plants. These nonrenewable resources are the power for nearly all manufacturing and other industries. Pure coal and petroleum can burn cleanly and emit only carbon dioxide and water, but most of the time, these fossil fuels do not burn completely and the incomplete chemical reactions produce pollutants. Few sources of these fossil fuels are pure, so other pollutants are usually released. These pollutants include carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons. In large car-dependent cities such as Los Angeles and Mexico City, 80% to 85% of air pollution is from motor vehicles ( Figure 22.7). Ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxides come from vehicle exhaust. See the relative amounts of CO2 released by different fossil fuels in this animation URL OLOGY/usgsnps/oilgas/CO2BTU_3.MPG A few pollutants come primarily from power plants or industrial plants that burn coal or oil ( Figure 22.8). Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a major component of industrial air pollution that is released whenever coal and petroleum are burned. SO2 mixes with H2O in the air to produce sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Mercury is released when coal and some types of wastes are burned. Mercury is emitted as a gas, but as it cools, it becomes a droplet. Mercury droplets eventually fall to the ground. If they fall into sediments, bacteria convert them to the most dangerous form of mercury: methyl mercury. Highly toxic, methyl mercury is one of the metals organic forms. 
Biomass  Burning 	  Fossil fuels are ancient plants and animals that have been converted into usable hydrocarbons. Burning plant and animal material directly also produces pollutants. Biomass is the total amount of living material found in an environment. The biomass of a rainforest is the amount of living material found in that rainforest. The primary way biomass is burned is for slash-and-burn agriculture ( Figure 22.9). The rainforest is slashed Auto exhaust like this means that the fuels is not burning efficiently. A power plant and its emissions before emission control equipment was added. down and then the waste is burned to clear the land for farming. Biomass from other biomes, such as the savannah, is also burned to clear farmland. The pollutants are much the same as from burning fossil fuels: CO2, carbon monoxide, methane, particulates, nitrous oxide, hydrocarbons, and organic and elemental carbon. Burning forests increases greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by releasing the CO2 stored in the biomass and also by removing the forest so that it cannot store CO2 in the future. As with all forms of air pollution, the smoke from biomass burning often spreads far and pollutants can plague neighboring states or countries. Particulates result when anything is burned. About 40% of the particulates that enter the atmosphere above the United States are from industry and about 17% are from vehicles. Particulates also occur naturally from volcanic eruptions or windblown dust. Like other pollutants, they travel all around the world on atmospheric currents. A forest that has been slash-and-burned to make new farmland. 
Evaporation 	  Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) enter the atmosphere by evaporation. VOCs evaporate from human-made substances, such as paint thinners, dry cleaning solvents, petroleum, wood preservatives, and other liquids. Naturally occurring VOCs evaporate off of pine and citrus trees. The atmosphere contains tens of thousands of different VOCs, nearly 100 of which are monitored. The most common is methane, a greenhouse gas ( Figure 22.10). Methane occurs naturally, but human agriculture is increasing the amount of methane in the atmosphere. Methane forms when organic material decomposes in an oxygen-poor environment. In the top image, surface methane production is shown. Stratospheric methane concentrations in the bottom image show that methane is carried up into the stratosphere by the upward flow of air in the tropics. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Industrial pollution causes health problems, though the Clean Air Act has decreased these health problems in the United States by forcing industry to clean their emissions. The increase in motor vehicles in arid cities has increased ozone and other secondary pollutants. Burning fossil fuels is the greatest source of air pollution. Biomass burning is also a large source of air pollution, especially in places where slash-and-burn agriculture is practiced. Despite the Clean Air Act, the air over many regions in the United States is still not clean. Why? How do pollutants damage human health? In what ways does air pollution harm the environment? Describe the damage that is being done by smog. Discuss how acid rain is formed and the damage it does. Discuss how chlorofluorocarbons destroy the ozone layer. acid rain alkaline bioaccumulation ozone hole pH scale polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) 
Introduction 	  People in developing countries often do not have laws to protect the air that they breathe. The World Health Organization estimates that 22 million people die each year from complications caused by air pollution. Even in the United States, more than 120 million Americans live in areas where the air is considered unhealthy. This lesson looks at the human health and environmental problems caused by different types of air pollution. 
Smog  Effects on the  Environment 	  All air pollutants cause some damage to living creatures and the environment. Different types of pollutants cause different types of harm. 
Particulates 	  Particulates reduce visibility. In the western United States, people can now ordinarily see only about 100 to 150 kilometers (60 to 90 miles), which is one-half to two-thirds the natural (pre-pollution) range on a clear day. In the East, people can only see about 40 to 60 kilometers (25-35 miles), about one-fifth the distance they could see without any air pollution ( Figure 22.11). Particulates reduce the amount of sunshine that reaches the ground, which may reduce photosynthesis. Since particulates form the nucleus for raindrops, snowflakes, or other forms of precipitation, precipitation may increase when particulates are high. An increase in particles in the air seems to increase the number of raindrops, but often decreases their size. By reducing sunshine, particulates can also alter air temperature. In the three days after the terrorists attacks on September 11, 2001, jet airplanes did not fly over the United States. Without the gases from jet contrails blocking sunlight, air temperature increased 1C (1.8F) across the United States ( Figure 22.12) . Imagine how much all of the sources of particulates combine to reduce temperatures. What might this effect be on global warming? 
Ozone 	  Ozone damages some plants. Since ozone effects accumulate, plants that live a long time show the most damage. Some species of trees appear to be the most susceptible. If a forest contains ozone-sensitive trees, they may die out and be replaced by species that are not as easily harmed. This can change an entire ecosystem, because animals and plants may not be able to survive without the habitats created by the native trees. Some crop plants show ozone damage ( Figure 22.13). When exposed to ozone, spinach leaves become spotted. Soybeans and other crops have reduced productivity. In developing nations, where getting every last bit of food energy out of the agricultural system is critical, any loss is keenly felt. The spots on this leaf are caused by ozone damage. 
Oxides 	  Oxide air pollutants also damage the environment. NO2 is a toxic, orange-brown colored gas that gives air a distinctive orange color and an unpleasant odor. Nitrogen and sulfur-oxides in the atmosphere create acids that fall as acid rain. 
D:  Lichen  Point to  Pollution 	  Lichen get a lot of their nutrients from the air so they may be good indicators of changes in the atmosphere such as increased nitrogen. In Yosemite National Park, this could change the ecosystem of the region and lead to fires and other problems. Learn more at: URL . 
Smog  Effects on  Human  Health 	  Human health suffers in locations with high levels of air pollution. 
Pollutants and their  Effects 	  Different pollutants have different health effects: Lead is the most common toxic material and is responsible for lead poisoning. Carbon monoxide can kill people in poorly ventilated spaces, such as tunnels. Nitrogen and sulfur-oxides cause lung disease and increased rates of asthma, emphysema, and viral infections such as the flu. Ozone damages the human respiratory system, causing lung disease. High ozone levels are also associated with increased heart disease and cancer. Particulates enter the lungs and cause heart or lung disease. When particulate levels are high, asthma attacks are more common. By some estimates, 30,000 deaths a year in the United States are caused by fine particle pollution. 
Human  Illnesses from  Air  Pollution 	  Many but not all cases of asthma can be linked to air pollution. During the 1996 Olympic Games, Atlanta, Georgia, closed off their downtown to private vehicles. This action decreased ozone levels by 28%. At the same time, there were 40% fewer hospital visits for asthma. Can scientists conclude without a shadow of a doubt that the reduction in ozone caused the reduction in hospital visits? What could they do to make that determination? Lung cancer among people who have never smoked is around 15% and is increasing. One study showed that the risk of being afflicted with lung cancer increases directly with a persons exposure to air pollution ( Figure 22.14). The study concluded that no level of air pollution should be considered safe. Exposure to smog also increased the risk of dying from any cause, including heart disease. One study found that in the United States, children develop asthma at more than twice the rate of two decades ago and at four times the rate in Canada. Adults also suffer from air pollution-related illnesses that include lung disease, heart disease, lung cancer, and weakened immune systems. The asthma rate worldwide is rising 20% to 50% every decade. Do you know why you are only supposed to eat large predatory fish like tuna infrequently? It is because of the bioaccumulation of mercury in those species. Some pollutants remain in an organism throughout its life, a phenomenon called bioaccumulation. In this process, an organism accumulates the entire amount of a toxic compound that it consumes over its lifetime. Not all substances bioaccumulate. Can you name one that does not? Aspirin does not bioaccumulate; if it did, a person would quickly accumulate a toxic amount in her body. Compounds that bioaccumulate are usually stored in the organisms fat. Mercury is released into the atmosphere when coal is burned ( Figure 22.15). But breathing the mercury is not harmful. In the atmosphere, the mercury forms small droplets that are deposited in water or sediments. Historic increases of mercury in the atmosphere: blue is volcanic eruptions; brown, purple, and pink are human-caused. The red region shows the effect of industrialization on atmospheric mercury. In the sediments, bacteria convert the droplets to the hazardous compound methyl mercury. Bacteria and plankton store all of the mercury from all of the seawater they ingest ( Figure 22.16). A small fish that eats bacteria and plankton accumulates all of the mercury from all of the tiny creatures it eats over its lifetime. A big fish accumulates all of the mercury from all of the small fish it eats over its lifetime. For a tuna at the top of the food chain, thats a lot of mercury. So tuna pose a health hazard to anything that eats them because their bodies are so high in mercury. This is why the government recommends limits on the amount of tuna that people eat. Limiting intake of large predatory fish is especially important for children and pregnant women. If the mercury just stayed in a persons fat, it would not be harmful, but that fat is used when a woman is pregnant or nursing a baby. A person will also get the mercury into her system when she (or he) burns the fat while losing weight. Methyl mercury bioaccumulates up the food chain. Methyl mercury poisoning can cause nervous system or brain damage, especially in infants and children. Children may experience brain damage or developmental delays ( Figure 22.17). Like mercury, other metals and VOCS can bioaccumulate, causing harm to animals and people high on the food chain. The phrase mad as a hatter was common when Lewis Carroll wrote his Alice in Wonderland stories. It was based on symptoms suffered by hatters who were exposed to mercury and experienced mercury poisoning while using the metal to make hats. 
Acid  Rain 	  Acid rain is caused by sulfur and nitrogen oxides emanating from power plants or metal refineries. The smokestacks have been built tall so that pollutants dont sit over cities ( Figure 22.18). Tall smokestacks allow the emissions to rise high into the atmosphere and travel up to 1,000 km (600 miles) downwind. As they move, these pollutants combine with water vapor to form sulfuric and nitric acids. The acid droplets form acid fog, rain, snow, or they may be deposited dry. Most typical is acid rain ( Figure 22.19). pH and Acid Rain Acid rain water is more acidic than normal rain water. Acidity is measured on the pH scale. Lower numbers are more acidic and higher numbers are less acidic (also called more alkaline) ( Figure 22.20). Natural rain is somewhat acidic with a pH of 5.6; acid rain must have a pH of less than 5.0. A small change in pH represents a large change in acidity: rain with a pH of 4.6 is 10 times more acidic than normal rain (with a pH of 5.6). Rain with a pH of 3.6 is 100 times more acidic. A pH scale goes from 1 to 14; numbers are shown with the pH of some common substances. A value of 7 is neutral. The strongest acids are at the low end of the scale and the strongest bases are at the high end. Regions with a lot of coal-burning power plants have the most acidic rain. The acidity of average rainwater in the northeastern United States has fallen to between 4.0 and 4.6. Acid fog has even lower pH with an average of around In arid climates, such as in Southern California, acids deposit on the ground dry. Acid precipitation ends up on the land surface and in water bodies. Some forest soils in the northeast are five to ten times more acidic than they were two or three decades ago. Acid droplets move down through acidic soils to lower the pH of streams and lakes even more. Acids strip soil of metals and nutrients, which collect in streams and lakes. As a result, stripped soils may no longer provide the nutrients that native plants need. 
Effects of  Acid  Rain 	  Acid rain takes a toll on ecosystems ( Figure 22.21). Plants that are exposed to acids become weak and are more likely to be damaged by bad weather, insect pests, or disease. Snails die in acid soils, so songbirds do not have as much food to eat. Young birds and mammals do not build bones as well and may not be as strong. Eggshells may also be weak and break more easily. Acid rain has killed trees in this forest in the Czech Republic. As lakes become acidic, organisms die off. No fish can live if the pH drops below 4.5. Organic material cannot decay, and mosses take over the lake. Wildlife that depend on the lake for drinking water suffer population declines. Crops are damaged by acid rain. This is most noticeable in poor nations where people cant afford to fix the problems with fertilizers or other technology. Acid rain damages cultural monuments like buildings and statues. These include the U.S. Capital and many buildings in Europe, such as Westminster Abbey ( Figure 22.22). Carbonate rocks neutralize acids and so some regions do not suffer the effects of acid rain nearly as much. Limestone in the midwestern United States protects the area. One reason that the northeastern United States is so vulnerable to acid rain damage is that the rocks are not carbonates. Because pollutants can travel so far, much of the acid rain that falls hurts states or nations other than ones where the pollutants were released. All the rain that falls in Sweden is acidic and fish in lakes all over the country are dying. The pollutants come from the United Kingdom and Western Europe, which are now working to decrease their emissions. Canada also suffers from acid rain that originates in the United States, a problem that is also improving. Southeast Asia is experiencing more acid rain between nations as the region industrializes. A statue damaged by acid rain. 
Ozone  Depletion 	  At this point you might be asking yourself, Is ozone bad or is ozone good? There is no simple answer to that question: It depends on where the ozone is located ( Figure 22.23). In the troposphere, ozone is a pollutant. In the ozone layer in the stratosphere, ozone screens out high energy ultraviolet radiation and makes Earth habitable. (1) Solar energy breaks apart oxygen molecules into two oxygen atoms. (2) Ozone forms when oxygen atoms bond together as O3. UV rays break apart the ozone molecules into one oxygen molecule (O2) and one oxygen atom (O). These processes convert UV radiation into heat, which is how the Sun heats the stratosphere. (3) Under natural circumstances, the amount of ozone created equals the amount destroyed. When O3 interacts with chlorine or some other gases the O3 breaks down into O2 and O and so the ozone layer loses its ability to filter out UV. 
The  Ozone  Hole 	  Human-made chemicals are breaking ozone molecules in the ozone layer. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are the most common but there are others including halons, methyl bromide, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform. CFCs were once widely used because they are cheap, nontoxic, nonflammable, and non-reactive. They were used as spray-can propellants, refrigerants, and in many other products. Once they are released into the air, CFCs float up to the stratosphere. Air currents move them toward the poles. In the winter, they freeze onto nitric acid molecules in polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) ( Figure 22.24). In the spring, the suns warmth starts the air moving, and ultraviolet light breaks the CFCs apart. The chlorine atom floats away and attaches to one of the oxygen atoms on an ozone molecule. The chlorine pulls the oxygen atom away, leaving behind an O2 molecule, which provides no UV protection. The chlorine then releases the oxygen atom and moves on to destroy another ozone molecule. One CFC molecule can destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules. PSCs form only where the stratosphere is coldest, and are most common above Antarctica in the wintertime. PSCs are needed for stratospheric ozone to be destroyed. Ozone destruction creates the ozone hole where the layer is dangerously thin ( Figure 22.25). As air circulates over Antarctica in the spring, the ozone hole expands northward over the southern continents, including Australia, New Zealand, southern South America, and southern Africa. UV levels may rise as much as 20% beneath the ozone hole. The hole was first measured in 1981 when it was 2 million square km (900,000 square miles). The 2006 hole was the largest ever observed at 28 million square km (11.4 million square miles). The size of the ozone hole each year depends on many factors, including whether conditions are right for the formation of PSCs. Find out how the ozone hole forms and view the hole over time on this National Geographic video: URL onalgeographic.com/news/2008/11/081103-ozone-video-vin.html . Ozone loss also occurs over the North Polar Region, but it is not enough for scientists to call it a hole. Why do you think there is less ozone loss over the North Pole area? The region of low ozone levels is small because the atmosphere is not as cold and PSCs do not form as readily. Still, springtime ozone levels are relatively low. This low moves south over some of the worlds most populated areas in Europe, North America, and Asia. At 40N, the latitude of New York City, UV-B has increased about 4% per decade since 1978. At 55N, the approximate latitude of Moscow and Copenhagen, the increase has been 6.8% per decade since 1978.

Blue and purple colors show particularly low levels of ozone. atch?v=I1wrEvc2URE (1:52). This NASA video discusses the ingredients of ozone depletion of Antarctica and the future of the ozone hole, including the effect of climate change (8c): URL (2:20). 
Effects of  Ozone  Loss 	  Ozone losses on human health and environment include: Increases in sunburns, cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), and skin cancers. A loss of ozone of only 1% is estimated to increase skin cancer cases by 5% to 6%. Decreases in the human immune systems ability to fight off infectious diseases. Reduction in crop yields because many plants are sensitive to ultraviolet light. Decreases in phytoplankton productivity. A decrease of 6% to 12% has been measured around Antarctica, which may be at least partly related to the ozone hole. The effects of excess UV on other organisms is not known. Whales in the Gulf of California have been found to have sunburn cells in their lowest skin layers, indicating very severe sunburns. The problem is greatest with light colored species or species that spend more time near the sea surface. When the problem with ozone depletion was recognized, world leaders took action. CFCs were banned in spray cans in some nations in 1978. The greatest production of CFCs was in 1986, but it has declined since then. This will be discussed more in the next lesson. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Air pollutants damage human health and the environment. Particulates reduce visibility, alter the weather, and cause lung problems such as asthma attacks. Ozone damages plants and can also cause lung disease. Acid rain damages forests, crops, buildings, and statues. The ozone hole, caused by ozone-destroying chemicals, allows more UV radiation to strike the Earth. UV radiation can cause plankton populations to decline and skin cancers in humans to increase, along with other effects. Since mercury bioaccumulates and coal-fired power plants continue to emit mercury into the atmosphere, what will be the consequence for people who like to eat tuna and other large predatory fish? What are the possible causes of rising asthma rates in children? A ban has been imposed on CFCs and some other ozone-depleting substances. How will the ozone hole change in response to this ban?

Introduction 	  The Clean Air Act of 1970 and the amendments since then have done a great job in requiring people to clean up the air over the United States. Emissions of the six major pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act, carbon monoxide, lead, nitrous oxides, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulates, have decreased by more than 50%. Cars, power plants, and factories individually release less pollution than they did in the mid-20th century. But there are many more cars, power plants, and factories. Many pollutants are still being released and some substances have been found to be pollutants that were not known to be pollutants in the past. There is still much work to be done to continue to clean up the air. 
Ways to  Reduce  Air  Pollution 	  How can air pollution be reduced? Using less fossil fuel is one way to lessen pollution. Some examples of ways to conserve fossil fuels are: Riding a bike or walking instead of driving. Taking a bus or carpooling. Buying a car that has greater fuel efficiency. Turning off lights and appliances when they are not in use. Using energy efficient light bulbs and appliances. Buying fewer things that are manufactured using fossil fuels. All these actions reduce the amount of energy that power plants need to produce. Developing alternative energy sources is important. Think back to the chapter, Earths Energy. What are some of the problems facing wider adoption of alternative energy sources? The technologies for several sources of alternative energy, including solar and wind, are still being developed. Solar and wind are still expensive relative to using fossil fuels. The technology needs to advance so that the price falls. Some areas get low amounts of sunlight and are not suited for solar. Others do not have much wind. It is important that regions develop what best suits them. While the desert Southwest will need to develop solar, the Great Plains can use wind energy as its energy source. Perhaps some locations will rely on nuclear power plants, although current nuclear power plants have major problems with safety and waste disposal. Sometimes technological approaches are what is needed.

Reducing  Air  Pollution from  Vehicles 	  Reducing air pollution from vehicles can be done in a number of ways. Breaking down pollutants before they are released into the atmosphere. Motor vehicles emit less pollution than they once did because of catalytic converters ( Figure 22.26). Catalytic converters contain a catalyst that speeds up chemical reactions and breaks down nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, and VOCs. Catalytic converters only work when they are hot, so a lot of exhaust escapes as the car is warming up. Making a vehicle more fuel efficient. Lighter more streamlined vehicles need less energy. Hybrid vehicles have an electric motor and a rechargeable battery. The energy that would be lost during braking is funneled into charging the battery, which then can power the car. The internal combustion engine only takes over when power in the battery has run out. Hybrids can reduce auto emissions by 90% or more, but many models do not maximize the possible fuel efficiency of the vehicle. A plug-in hybrid is plugged into an electricity source when it is not in use, perhaps in a garage, to make sure that the battery is charged. Plug-in hybrids run for a longer time on electricity and so are less polluting than regular hybrids. Plug-in hybrids are beginning to become available in 2010. Catalytic converters are placed on modern cars in the United States. Developing new technologies that do not use fossil fuels. Fueling a car with something other than a liquid organic-based fuel is difficult. A fuel cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy. Hydrogen fuel cells harness the energy released when hydrogen and oxygen come together to create water ( Figure 22.27). Fuel cells are extremely efficient and they produce no pollutants. But developing fuel-cell technology has had many problems and no one knows when or if they will become practical. A hydrogen fuel-cell car looks like a gasoline-powered car. 
Reducing  Industrial  Air  Pollution 	  Pollutants are removed from the exhaust streams of power plants and industrial plants before they enter the atmosphere. Particulates can be filtered out, and sulfur and nitric oxides can be broken down by catalysts. Removing these oxides reduces the pollutants that cause acid rain. Particles are relatively easy to remove from emissions by using motion or electricity to separate particles from the gases. Scrubbers remove particles and waste gases from exhaust using liquids or neutralizing materials ( Figure 22.28). Gases, such as nitrogen oxides, can be broken down at very high temperatures. Scrubbers remove particles and waste gases from exhaust. Gasification is a developing technology. In gasification, coal (rarely is another organic material used) is heated to extremely high temperatures to create syngas, which is then filtered and the energy goes on to drive a generator. Syngas releases about 80% less pollution than regular coal plants, and greenhouse gases are also lower. Clean coal plants do not need scrubbers or other pollution control devices. Although the technology is ready, clean coal plants are more expensive to construct and operate. Also, heating the coal to high enough temperatures uses a great deal of energy, so the technology is not energy efficient. In addition, large amounts of the greenhouse gas CO2 are still released with clean coal technology. Nonetheless, a few of these plants are operating in the United States and around the world. 
Reducing  Ozone  Destruction 	  One success story in reducing pollutants that harm the atmosphere concerns ozone-destroying chemicals. In 1973, scientists calculated that CFCs could reach the stratosphere and break apart. This would release chlorine atoms, which would then destroy ozone. Based only on their calculations, the United States and most Scandinavian countries banned CFCs in spray cans in 1978. More confirmation that CFCs break down ozone was needed before more was done to reduce production of ozonedestroying chemicals. In 1985, members of the British Antarctic Survey reported that a 50% reduction in the ozone layer had been found over Antarctica in the previous three springs. Two years later, the "Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer" was ratified by nations all over the world. The Montreal Protocol controls the production and consumption of 96 chemicals that damage the ozone layer ( Figure 22.29). Hazardous substances are phased out first by developed nations and one decade later by developing nations. More hazardous substances are phased out more quickly. CFCs have been mostly phased out since 1995, although were used in developing nations until 2010. Some of the less hazardous substances will not be phased out until 2030. The Protocol also requires that wealthier nations donate money to develop technologies that will replace these chemicals. Ozone levels over North America decreased between 1974 and 2009. Models of the future predict what ozone levels would have been if CFCs were not being phased out. Warmer colors indicate more ozone. Had CFCs not been phased out, by 2050 there would have been 10 times more skin cancer cases than in 1980. The result would have been about 20 million more cases of skin cancer in the United States and 130 million cases globally. Since CFCs take many years to reach the stratosphere and they can survive there a long time before they break down, the ozone hole will probably continue to grow for some time before it begins to shrink. The ozone layer will reach the same levels it had before 1980 around 2068 and 1950 levels in one or two centuries. 
Reducing  Greenhouse  Gases 	  Climate scientists agree that climate change is a global problem that must be attacked by a unified world with a single goal. All nations must come together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, getting nations to agree on anything has proven to be difficult. A few ideas have been proposed and in some nations are being enacted. 
International  Agreements 	  The first attempt to cap greenhouse gas emissions was the Kyoto Protocol, which climate scientists agree did not do enough in terms of cutting emissions or in getting nations to participate. The Kyoto Protocol set up a cap-and-trade system. Cap-and-trade provides a monetary incentive for nations to develop technologies that will reduce emissions and to conserve energy. Some states and cities within the United States have begun their own cap-and-trade systems. The United Nations Climate Change Conference meets in a different location annually. Although recommendations are made each year, the group has not gotten the nations to sign on to a binding agreement. By doing nothing we are doing something continuing to raise greenhouse gas levels and failing to prepare for the coming environmental changes. How bad could a few degrees be? National Geographic has a set of videos about what to expect if temperature rises by each of these amounts by degree Celsius. 
Carbon  Tax 	  The easiest and quickest way is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to increase energy efficiency. One effective way to encourage efficiency is financial. A carbon tax can be placed on CO2 emissions to encourage conservation. The tax would be placed on gasoline, carbon dioxide emitted by factories, and home energy bills so people or businesses that emit more carbon would pay more money. This would encourage conservation since when people purchase a new car, for example, they would be more likely to purchase an energy efficient model. The money from the carbon tax would be used for research into alternative energy sources. All plans for a carbon tax allow a tax credit for people who cannot afford to pay more for energy so that they do not suffer unfairly. New technologies can be developed, such as renewable sources that were discussed in the chapter,Earths Energy. Biofuels can replace gasoline in vehicles, but they must be developed sensibly ( Figure 22.30). So far much of the biofuel is produced from crops such as corn. But when food crops are used for fuel, the price of food goes up. Modern agriculture is also extremely reliant on fossil fuels for pesticides, fertilizers, and the work of farming. This means that not much energy is gained from using a biofuel over using the fossil fuels directly. More promising crops for biofuels are now being researched. Surprisingly, algae is being investigated as a source of fuel! The algae can be grown in areas that are not useful for agriculture, and it also contains much more usable oil than crops such as corn. 
Carbon  Capture and  Sequestration 	  If climate change becomes bad enough, people can attempt to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere after they are emitted. Carbon sequestration occurs naturally when carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by trees in a forest. One way to remove carbon would be to plant more trees, but unfortunately, more forest land is currently being lost than gained. Carbon can also be artificially sequestered. For example, carbon can be captured from the emissions from gasification plants and then stored underground in salt layers or coal seams. While some small sequestration projects are in development, large-scale sequestration has not yet been attempted. This type of carbon capture and sequestration comes under the heading of geoengineering. There are many other fascinating ideas in geoengineering that people have proposed that are worth looking at. One wild example is to A bus that runs on soybean oil shows the potential of biofuels. shadow the planet with large orbiting objects. A large mirror in orbit could reflect about 2% of incoming solar radiation back into space. These sorts of solutions would be expensive in cost and energy. Just as individuals can diminish other types of air pollution, people can fight global warming by conserving energy. Also, people can become involved in local, regional, and national efforts to make sound choices on energy policy. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Air pollutants can be reduced in many ways. The best method is to not use energy that produces the pollutants through conservation or increasing energy efficiency. Alternative energy sources are another good way to reduce pollution. Most of these alternate energy technologies are still being refined (solar, wind) and some have other problems associated with them (nuclear, biofuels). Pollutants can be removed from an exhaust stream by being filtered out or broken down. Some pollutants, such as CFCs, are best not released at all. Why is it important to reduce air pollution?

Introduction 	  Many scientists interact directly with what they are studying. Biologists can collect cells, seeds, or sea urchins and put them in a controlled laboratory environment. Physicists can subject metals to stress or smash atoms into each other. Geologists can chip away at rocks to see what is inside. But astronomers, scientists who study the universe beyond Earth, rarely have a chance for direct contact with their subject. Astronomers observe their subjects at a distance, usually a very large distance! 
Electromagnetic  Radiation 	  Earth is separated from the rest of the universe by very large expanses of space. Very rarely matter from outside Earths environment reaches us, such as when a meteorite makes it through the atmosphere from elsewhere in the solar system. But for the most part, astronomers have one main source for their data light. Light can travel across empty space, and as it does, so it carries both energy and information. Light is one type of electromagnetic (EM) radiation, energy that is transmitted through space as a wave. These videos discuss infrared, ultraviolet, and radio telescopes, as well as telescopes that detect visible light, and reveal tremendous features of the stars and galaxies around the Universe (2d): URL K-gtuAJ-B4 (2:19), URL (5:30). 
The  Speed of  Light 	  Light travels faster than anything else in the universe. In the almost completely empty vacuum of space, light travels at a speed of approximately 300,000,000 meters per second (670,000,000 miles per hour). To give you an idea of how fast that is, a beam of light could travel from New York to Los Angeles and back again nearly 40 times in just one second. Even though light travels extremely fast, objects in space are so far away that it takes a significant amount of time for light from those objects to reach us. For example, light from the Sun takes about 8 minutes to reach Earth. 
Light- Years 	  Since astronomical distances are so large, it helps to have a unit of measurement that is good for expressing those large distances. A light-year is a unit of distance that is defined as the distance that light travels in one year. One light-year is approximately equal to 9,500,000,000,000 (9.5 trillion) kilometers, or 5,900,000,000,000 (5.9 trillion) miles ( Figure 23.1). Thats a long way! But by astronomical standards, its actually a pretty short distance. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to us after the Sun, is 4.22 light-years away. That means the light from Proxima Centauri takes 4.22 years to reach us. The galaxy we live in, the Milky Way Galaxy, is about 100,000 light-years across. How long does it take light to travel from one side of the galaxy to the other? 100,000 years! If an astronomer looks through a telescope at a star that is 1,000 light years away, is she seeing the star as it is now? The smallest red-shifted galaxies are among the most distant galaxies we have detected so far at 13 billion light-years away. Thats over a hundred-billion-trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) kilometers! 
Looking  Back in  Time 	  When we look at astronomical objects such as stars and galaxies, we are not just seeing over great distanceswe are also seeing back in time. Because light takes time to travel, the image we see of a distant galaxy is an image of how the galaxy used to look. For example, the Andromeda Galaxy, shown in ( Figure 23.2), is about 2.5 million light years from Earth. If you look at the Andromeda Galaxy through a telescope, what are you seeing? You are seeing the galaxy as it was 2.5 million years ago. If the galaxy ceased to exist 1 million years ago, when would you know that? If you want to see the galaxy as it is now, you will have to wait and look again 2.5 million years into the future. 
Electromagnetic  Waves 	  Light is one type of EM radiation; light is energy that travels in the form of an electromagnetic wave. ( Figure 23.3) shows a diagram of an electromagnetic wave. An EM wave has two components: an electric field and a magnetic field. Each of these components oscillates between positive and negative values, which is what makes the wavy shape in the diagram. The distance between two adjacent oscillations is called wavelength. A related value is frequency, which measures the number of wavelengths that pass a given point every second. Wavelength and frequency are reciprocal, which means that as one increases, the other decreases. 
The  Electromagnetic  Spectrum 	  Visible light the light that human eyes can see comes in a variety of colors. The color of visible light is determined by its wavelength. Visible light ranges from wavelengths of 400 nm to 700 nm, corresponding to the This recent picture of the Andromeda Galaxy actually shows the galaxy as it was about 2.5 million years ago. An electromagnetic wave consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. colors violet through red. EM radiation with wavelengths shorter than 400 nm or longer than 700 nm exists all around you you just cant see it. The full range of electromagnetic radiation, or the electromagnetic spectrum, is shown in Figure 23.4. Like our Sun, every star emits light at a wide range of wavelengths, all across the visible spectrum and even outside the visible spectrum. Astronomers can learn a lot from studying the details of the spectrum of light from a star. Some very hot stars emit light primarily at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, while some very cool stars emit mostly in the infrared. There are extremely hot objects that emit X-rays and even gamma rays. Light from some of the faintest, most distant objects is in the form of radio waves. In fact, a lot of the objects most interesting to astronomers today cant even be seen with the naked eye. Astronomers use telescopes to detect the faint light from distant objects and to see objects at wavelengths all across the electromagnetic spectrum.

In the top, only the wavelengths of visible light show. In the bottom, a layer of thick clouds appears in the infrared wavelengths. 
Optical  Telescopes 	  People have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands of years. However, the first true telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century. These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both nearer and larger. The term telescope was coined by the Italian scientist and mathematician Galileo Galilei (15641642). Galileo built his first telescope in 1608 and subsequently made many improvements to telescope design. Telescopes that rely on the refraction, or bending, of light by lenses are called refracting telescopes, or simply refractors. The earliest telescopes, including Galileos, were all refractors. Many of the small telescopes used by amateur astronomers today are refractors. Refractors are particularly good for viewing details within our solar system, such as the surface of Earths moon or the rings around Saturn ( Figure 23.5). Around 1670, another famous scientist and mathematician Sir Isaac Newton (16431727) built a different kind The largest refracting telescope in the world is at the University of Chicagos Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin and was built in 1897. Its largest lens has a diameter of 102 cm. of telescope. Newton used curved mirrors to focus light and so created the first reflecting telescopes, or reflectors ( Figure 23.6). The mirrors in a reflecting telescope are much lighter than the heavy glass lenses in a refractor. This is significant, because: To support the thick glass lenses a refractor must be strong and heavy. Mirrors are easier to make precisely than it is to make glass lenses. Because they do not need to be as heavy to support the same size lens, reflectors can be made larger than refractors. Larger telescopes can collect more light and so they can study dimmer or more distant objects. The largest optical telescopes in the world today are reflectors. Catadioptric telescopes have a combination of mirrors and lenses to focus light. Catadioptric telescopes have large mirrors to collect a lot of light, but short tubes for portability. 
D:  Amateur  Astronomers 	  Amateur astronomers enjoy observing and studying stars and other celestial objects. Both professional and amateur astronomers use telescopes. A telescope is an instrument that makes faraway objects look closer. Learn more at: URL . (a) Reflecting telescopes used by amateur astronomers today are similar to the one designed by Isaac Newton in the 17th century. (b) The South African Large Telescope (SALT) is one of the largest reflecting telescopes on Earth. SALTs primary mirror consists of 91 smaller hexagonal mirrors, each with sides 1 m long. (c) Many amateur astronomers today use catadioptric telescopes. 
Radio  Telescopes 	  Notice it says above that the largest optical telescopes in the world are reflectors. Optical telescopes collect visible light. Even larger telescopes are built to collect light at longer wavelengths radio waves. What do you think these telescopes are called? Radio telescopes look a lot like satellite dishes because both are designed to do the same thing to collect and focus radio waves or microwaves (the shortest wavelength waves) from space. The largest single telescope in the world is at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico ( Figure 23.7). This telescope is located in a naturally occurring sinkhole that formed when water flowing underground dissolved the limestone rock. If this telescope were not supported by the ground, it would collapse under its own weight. Since the telescope is set into the ground it cannot be aimed to different parts of the sky and so can only observe the part of the sky that happens to be overhead at a given time. A group of radio telescopes can be linked together with a computer so that they are all observing the same object ( Figure 23.8). The computer combines the data, making the group function like one single telescope. For more on radio telescopes and radio astronomy in general, go to URL . The radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory has a diameter of 305 m. The Very Large Array in New Mexico has 27 radio dishes, each 25 m in diameter. When all the dishes are pointed at the same object, they are like a single telescope with a diameter of 22.3 mi.

Space  Telescopes 	  Telescopes on Earth all have one significant limitation: the electromagnetic radiation they gather must pass through Earths atmosphere. The atmosphere blocks some radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum and almost all radiation in the ultraviolet and higher frequency ranges. Furthermore, motion in the atmosphere distorts light. That distortion is why stars twinkle in the night sky. To minimize these problems, many observatories are built on high mountains, where there is less atmosphere above the telescope. Even better, space telescopes avoid such problems completely because they orbit outside Earths atmosphere in space. Space telescopes can carry instruments to observe objects emitting various types of electromagnetic radiation such as visible, infrared or ultraviolet light; gamma rays; or x-rays. X-ray telescopes, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, use X-ray optics to observe remote objects in the X-ray spectrum. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST), shown in ( Figure 23.9), is perhaps the best known space telescope. The Hubble was put into orbit by the Space Shuttle Atlantis in 1990. Once it was in orbit, scientists discovered that there was a flaw in the shape of the mirror. A servicing mission to the Hubble by the Space Shuttle Endeavor in 1994 corrected the problem. Since that time, the Hubble has provided huge amounts of data that have helped to answer many of the biggest questions in astronomy. Find out more by visiting the Hubble Space Telescope website at URL . (a) The Hubble Space Telescope orbits Earth at an altitude of 589 km (366 mi). It collects data in visible, infrared, and ultraviolet wavelengths. (b) This starburst cluster is one of the many fantastic images taken by the HST over the past two decades. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has placed three other major space telescopes in orbit, comprising what NASA calls the Great Observatories. Each of these telescopes specializes in a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum ( Figure 23.10). NASA is planning for another telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, to serve as a replacement for the aging Hubble. The James Webb is scheduled to launch in 2018. To learn more about NASAs great observatories, check out URL ry/features/F_NASA_Great_Observatories_PS.html .

Ancient  Astronomers 	  Humans have been studying the night sky for thousands of years. Observing the patterns and motions in the sky helped ancient peoples keep track of time ( Figure 23.11). By understanding annual rhythms, people could know when to plant crops. They also timed many of their religious ceremonies to coincide with events in the heavens. The ancient Greeks made careful observations of the locations of stars in the sky. They noticed that some of the stars moved against the background of other stars. They called these bright and odd bodies in the sky planets, which in Greek means wanderers. Today we know that the planets are not stars, but members of our solar system that orbit the Sun. Greeks also identified constellations, patterns of stars in the sky ( Figure 23.12). They associated the constellations with stories and myths from their culture. 
Galileos  Observations 	  Ancient astronomers knew a lot about the patterns of stars and the movement of objects in the sky, but they did not know what these objects actually were. That understanding began in the year 1610, when Galileo turned a telescope toward the heavens. With his telescope, Galileo made the following discoveries (among others): Many archaeologists think that Stonehenge was used to observe the movement of the moon and the sun. Stars in the constellation Orion. Constellations help astronomers today identify different regions of the night sky. There are more stars in the night sky than the naked eye can see. The band of stars called the Milky Way consists of many stars. The Moon has craters ( Figure 23.13). Venus has phases like the Moon. Jupiter has orbiting moons. There are dark spots that move across the surface of the Sun. Galileos observations challenged people to think in new ways about the universe and Earths place in it. About 100 years before Galileo, Nicolaus Copernicus had proposed a controversial new model of the universe in which Earth and the other planets revolve around the Sun. In Galileos time, most people still believed that the Sun and planets revolved around Earth. Galileos observations provided direct evidence to support Copernicus model. Galileo was the first person known to look at the Moon through a telescope. Galileo made the drawing on the left in 1610; on the right is a modern photograph of the Moon. 
Observations with  Modern  Telescopes 	  Equipped with no more than a good pair of binoculars, you can see all of the things Galileo saw, and more. You can even see sunspots, but be sure to use special filters on the lenses to protect your eyes. With a basic telescope like those used by many amateur astronomers, you can see more than Galileo saw, such as polar caps on Mars, the rings of Saturn, and bands in the atmosphere of Jupiter. All of the objects mentioned above are within our solar system. With a telescope you can also see many times more stars than without a telescope. However, because they are so far away, the stars will appear as points of light. This is true even of the most powerful professional telescopes, with one rare exception ( Figure 23.14). This ultraviolet image of the red supergiant star Betelgeuse taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1996 was the first direct image taken of the disk of a star other than the Sun. Very few professional astronomers today look directly through the eyepiece of a telescope. Instead, they attach to the telescopes sophisticated instruments that capture and process the light. The astronomers then look at the images or data shown on these instruments. Most often the instruments then pass the data on to a computer where the data can be stored for later use. An astronomer may take weeks or months to analyze all the data collected from just a single night. Astronomers use spectrometers to study the light from a telescope. A spectrometer uses a prism or other device to break light down into its component colors. The spectrum produced can be observed directly, captured on film, or stored digitally on a computer ( Figure 23.15). A simplified example of starlight after it passes through a spectrometer. The dark lines in a stars spectrum are caused by gases absorbing light in the stars outer atmosphere. From a single spectrum of a star, an astronomer can tell: How hot the star is (by the relative brightness of different colors). What elements the star contains (by the pattern of dark lines). Whether and how fast the star is moving toward or away from Earth (by how far the dark lines are shifted from their normal positions). Using telescopes, astronomers can also learn how stars evolve, what kind of matter is found throughout the universe, how that matter is distributed, and even how the universe might have formed. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Astronomers study light from distant objects. Light travels at 300,000,000 meters per second faster than anything else in the universe. A light-year is equal to the distance light travels in one year, 9.5 trillion kilometers. When we see distant objects, we see them as they were in the past, because their light has been traveling to us for many years. Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Telescopes make distant objects appear both nearer and larger. Optical telescopes collect visible light. The three main types are reflecting telescopes, refracting telescopes, and catadioptric telescopes. Radio telescopes collect and focus radio waves from distant objects. Space telescopes orbit Earth, collecting wavelengths of light that are normally blocked by the atmosphere. Galileo was the first person known to use a telescope to study the sky. His discoveries helped change the way humans think about the universe. Modern telescopes collect data that can be stored on a computer. Astronomers can learn a lot about a star by studying its spectrum.

Introduction 	  Humans have long dreamed of traveling into space. Greek mythology tells of Daedelus and Icarus, a father and son who took flight using wings made of feathers and wax ( Figure 23.16). Icarus, thrilled with the feel of flying, got too close to the Sun, the wax melted, and he fell into the sea. In a time before airplanes and hot air balloons, we can relate to the excitement Icarus would have felt. Much later, science fiction writers, such as Jules Verne (18281905) and H.G. Wells (18661946), wrote about technologies that explore the dream of traveling beyond Earth into space. 
Rockets 	  Humans did not reach space until the second half of the 20th century. However, the main technology that makes space exploration possible, the rocket, has been around for a long time. A rocket is propelled by particles flying out of one end at high speed. We do not know who built the first rocket, or when, but there are records of the Chinese using rockets in war against the Mongols as early as the 13th century. The Mongols then spread rocket technology in their attacks on Eastern Europe. Early rockets were also used to launch fireworks and for other ceremonial purposes. 
How  Rockets  Work 	  Rockets were used for centuries before anyone could explain exactly how they worked. The theory to explain rockets did not arrive until 1687, when Isaac Newton (16431727) described the three basic laws of motion, now referred to as Newtons Laws of Motion: Newtons third law of motion is particularly useful in explaining how a rocket works. To better understand this law, consider the skate boarder in ( Figure 23.17). When the skate boarder pushes the wall, his force the action is matched by an equal force by the wall on the skate boarder in the opposite direction the reaction. Once the skate boarder is moving, however, he has nothing to push against and he will soon stop because of friction. Imagine now that he is is holding a fire extinguisher. When he pulls the trigger on the extinguisher, a fluid or powder flies out of the extinguisher, and he moves backward. In this case, the action force is the pressure pushing the material out of the extinguisher. The reaction force of the material against the extinguisher pushes the skate boarder backward. Since space is a vacuum, how does a rocket work if there is nothing for the rocket to push against? A rocket in space moves like the skater holding the fire extinguisher. Fuel is ignited in a chamber, which causes an explosion of gases. The explosion creates pressure that forces the gases out of the rocket. As these gases rush out the end, the rocket moves in the opposite direction, as predicted by Newtons Third Law of Motion ( Figure 23.18). The reaction force of the gases on the rocket pushes the rocket forward. The force pushing the rocket is called thrust. Explosions in a chamber create pressure that pushes gases out of a rocket. This in turn produces thrust that pushes the rocket forward. The rocket shown here is a Saturn V rocket, used for the Apollo 11 mission the first to carry humans to the Moon. 
A  Rocket  Revolution 	  For centuries, rockets were powered by gunpowder or other solid fuels and could travel only fairly short distances. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, several breakthroughs in rocketry led to rockets that were powerful enough to carry the rocketsand humansbeyond Earth. During this period, three people independently came up with similar ideas for improving rocket design. The first person to establish many of the main ideas of modern rocketry was a Russian schoolteacher, named Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (18571935). Most of his work was done before the first airplane flight, which took place in 1903. Tsiolkovsky realized that in order for rockets to have enough power to escape Earths gravity, they would need liquid fuel instead of solid fuel. He also realized that it was important to find the right balance between the amount of fuel a rocket uses and how heavy the rocket is. He came up with the idea of using multiple stages when launching rockets, so that empty fuel containers would drop away to reduce mass. Tsiolkovsky had many great ideas and designed many rockets, but he never built one. The second great rocket pioneer was an American, Robert Goddard (18821945). Goddard independently came up with using liquid fuel and using multiple stages for rockets. He also designed a system for cooling the gases escaping from a rocket, which made the rocket much more efficient. Goddard built rockets to test his ideas, such as the first rocket to use liquid fuel ( Figure 23.19). Over a lifetime of research, Goddard came up with many innovations that are still used in rockets today. The third great pioneer of rocket science was a Romanian-born German, named Hermann Oberth (18941989). In the early 1920s, Oberth came up with many of the same ideas as Tsiolkovsky and Goddard. Oberth built a liquidfueled rocket, which he launched in 1929. Later, he joined a team of scientists that designed the rocket shown in ( Figure 23.20) for the German military. This rocket played a major role in World War II. The Germans used the V-2 as a missile to bomb numerous targets in Belgium, England, and France. In 1942, the V-2 was launched to an altitude of 176 km (109 miles), making it the first human-made object to travel into space (an altitude of 100 km (62 miles). The leader of the V-2 team was a German scientist named Wernher von Braun. von Braun later fled Germany and came to the United States, where he helped the United States develop missile weapons. He then joined NASA to design rockets for space travel including the Saturn V rocket ( Figure 23.21), which was eventually used to send the first men to the Moon. Left: Robert Goddard launched the first liquid-fueled rocket on March 16, 1926, in Massachusetts; Right: This schematic shows details of Goddards rocket. Explosions in a chamber create pressure that pushes gases out of the rocket. This in turn produces thrust that pushes the rocket forward. 
Satellites 	  One of the first uses of rockets in space was to launch satellites. A satellite is an object that orbits a larger object. An orbit is a circular or elliptical path around an object. The Moon was Earths first satellite, but now many human-made artificial satellites orbit the planet. 
Newtons  Law of  Universal  Gravitation 	  Isaac Newton also developed the theory that explains why satellites stay in orbit. Newtons law of universal gravitation describes how every object in the universe is attracted to every other object. The same gravity that makes an apple fall to the ground and keeps a person from floating away into the sky, also holds the Moon in orbit around Earth, and Earth in orbit around the Sun. Newton used the following example to explain how gravity makes orbits possible. Consider a cannonball launched from a high mountain ( Figure 23.22). If a cannonball is launched off a high mountain at a slow speed, it will fall back to Earth (A, B) If the cannonball is launched at a fast enough speed, the Earth below curves away at the same rate that the cannonball falls, and the cannonball goes into a circular orbit (C). If the cannonball is launched even faster, it goes into an elliptical orbit (D) or leaves Earths gravity entirely (E). Not that Newtons idea would actually work in real life: A cannonball launched from Mt. Everest would burn up in the atmosphere if launched at the speed required to put it into orbit. However, a rocket can launch straight up, then steer into an orbit. A rocket can also carry a satellite above the atmosphere and then release the satellite into orbit.

Types of  Satellites 	  Since the first satellite was launched more than 50 years ago, thousands of artificial satellites have been put into orbit around Earth. We have even put satellites into orbit around the Moon, the Sun, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. There are four main types of satellites. Imaging satellites take pictures of Earths surface to be used by the military, when taken by spy satellites; or for scientific purposes, such as meteorology, if taken by weather satellites. Astronomers use imaging satellites to study the Moon and other planets. Communications satellites, such as the one in ( Figure 23.23), are designed to receive and send signals for telephone, television, or other types of communications. Navigational satellites are used for navigation systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). The International Space Station, the largest artificial satellite is designed for humans to live in space while conducting scientific research. This is a Milstar communications satellite used by the U.S. military. The long, flat solar panels provide power for the satellite. The antennas are for sending or receiving signals. 
Types of  Orbits 	  The speed of a satellite depends on how high it is above the object it is orbiting ( Figure 23.24). Satellites that are relatively close to Earth are said to be in low Earth orbit (LEO). Satellites in LEO are often in polar orbit; they orbit over the North and South Poles, perpendicular to Earths spin. Because Earth rotates underneath the orbiting satellite, a satellite in polar orbit is over a different part of Earths surface each time it circles. Imaging satellites and weather satellites are often put in low-Earth, polar orbits. An animation of GPS satellites orbiting Earth is seen here: URL An animation of roughly half the orbit of the ISS from sunrise to sunset: URL e_To_Sunset_Aboard_The_ISS.OGG A satellite placed at just the right distance above Earth  35,786 km (22,240 miles)  orbits at the same rate that Earth spins. The satellite is always in the same position over Earths surface, called a geostationary orbit (GEO). Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbits. 
The  Space  Race 	  From the end of World War II in 1945 to the breakup of the Soviet Union (USSR) in 1991, the Soviet Union and the United States were in a military, social, and political conflict, known as the Cold War. Although there were very few actual military confrontations, each of the two countries was in an arms race  continually developing new and more powerful weapons to try to best the other. While the arms race had many social and political consequences, it helped to drive technology. For example, the development of missiles during the Cold War significantly sped up the development of rocket technologies. More information about the Space Race can be found at URL . Different orbits of Earth: ISS orbit = red dotted line; LEO = filled blue; Medium Earth Orbit = filled yellow; GPS = green dash-dot; geostationary = black dash. 
Sputnik 	  On October 4, 1957, the USSR launched the first artificial satellite ever put into orbit. Sputnik 1 ( Figure 23.25) was 58 cm in diameter and weighed 84 kg (184 lb). Antennas trailing behind the satellite sent out radio signals, which were detected by scientists and amateur radio operators around the world. Sputnik 1 orbited in an LEO on an elliptical path every 96 minutes. After about 3 months, the satellite slowed down enough to descend into Earths atmosphere where it burned up as a result of friction. The launch of Sputnik 1 triggered the Space Race between the USSR and the United States. Many Americans were shocked that the Soviets had the technology to put a satellite in orbit, and they worried that the Soviets might also be winning the arms race. On November 3, 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik 2, which carried the first animal to go into orbita dog named Laika ( Figure 23.26). 
The  Race  Is  On 	  In response to the Sputnik program, the United States launched its first satellite, Explorer I, on January 31, 1958, and its second, Vanguard 1, on March 17, 1958. Later that year, the U.S. Congress and President Eisenhower established NASA. The Soviets stayed ahead of the United States for many notable firsts, but the United States soon followed with some firsts of its own. The timeline in Table 23.1 shows many Space Race firsts.

Apollo 11 	  The Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, on October 4, 1957. Laika was a stray trained for space flight. No one yet knew how to bring a satellite out of orbit and Laika was not expected to survive the flight. The Space Race reached a peak in 1969 when the United States put the first human on the Moon. However, the competition between the two countries space programs continued for many more years. 
Reaching the  Moon 	  On May 25, 1961, shortly after the first American went into space, President John F. Kennedy presented the following challenge to the U.S. Congress ( Figure 23.27): "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him back safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish." Eight years later, NASAs Apollo 11 mission achieved Kennedys ambitious goal. On July 20, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first humans to set foot on the moon ( Figure 23.28). Following the Apollo 11 mission, four other American missions successfully put astronauts on the Moon. The last manned mission to the moon was Apollo 17, which landed on December 11, 1972. To date, no other country has put a person on the Moon. In July 1975, the USSR and the United States carried out a joint mission called the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. During the mission, an American Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft ( Figure 23.29). 
Exploring  Other  Planets 	  Both the United States and the USSR sent probes to other planets during the Space Race. A space probe is a an unmanned spacecraft that is sent to collect data by flying near or landing on an object in space, such as a planet, moon, asteroid, or comet. During the Venera missions, the USSR sent several probes to Venus, including some that landed on the surface. The United States sent probes to Mercury, Venus, and Mars in the Mariner missions ( Figure 23.30), and landed two probes on Mars in the Viking missions. In the Pioneer and Voyager missions, the United States also sent probes to the outer solar system, including flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The Pioneer and Voyager probes are still traveling, and are now beyond the edges of our solar system. We have lost contact with the two Pioneer probes, but expect to have contact with the two Voyager probes until at least 2020 ( Figure 23.31). As of late 2012, Voyager 1 was about 11 billion miles from Earth. The spacecraft was about to leave the Suns influence and enter interstellar space. Neil Armstrong took this photo of Buzz Aldrin on the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission. Armstrong and the Lunar Module can be seen in the reflection in Aldrins helmet. The docking of an Apollo spacecraft with a Soyuz spacecraft in 1975. Many considered this to be the symbolic end of the Space Race. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Rockets have been used for warfare and ceremonies for many centuries. Newtons third law explains how a rocket works. The action force of the engine on the gases is accompanied by a reaction force of the gases on the rocket. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard, and Hermann Oberthall came up with similar ideas for improving rocket design, such as using liquid fuel and multiple stages. A satellite orbits a larger object. Moons are natural satellites; humans make artificial satellites. Newtons law of universal gravitation explains how satellites enter an orbit. Artificial satellites are used for imaging planets, for navigation, and for communication. The launch of Sputnik 1 started a Space Race between the United States and the USSR. Data from Mariner 10 was used to create this image of Mercury. A portrait of the solar system more than 4 billion miles from Earth was taken by Voyager I. The pale blue dot halfway down the brown band on the right side is Earth. The United States Apollo 11 mission put the first humans on the Moon. The United States and USSR sent several probes to other planets during the Space Race.

A history of lunar exploration: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_25th.html 	  The Space Race and the United States desire to get to the Moon brought about many advances in science and technology. Can you think of any challenges we face today that are, could be, or should be a focus of science and technology? If you were in charge of NASA, what new goals would you set for space exploration? Do you think that a space program is a good use of government funding? Outline the history of space stations and space shuttles. Describe recent developments in space exploration. orbiter space shuttle space station 
Introduction 	  Even since the end of the Space Race, space exploration has continued. Humans have a presence in space at the International Space Station, and the Russian space station, Mir. 
Space  Shuttles and  Space  Stations 	  While the United States continued missions to the Moon in the early 1970s, the Soviets had another goal: to build a space station. A space station is a large spacecraft on which humans can live for extended periods. 
Early  Space  Stations 	  The Soviet Union put the first space station, Salyut 1, into orbit on April 19, 1971, with no crew. On June 7, 1971, three cosmonauts boarded the station and stayed for 22 days. Unfortunately, the cosmonauts died during their return to Earth and Salyut 1 left orbit and burned up in the Earths atmosphere later that year. Between 1971 and 1982, the Soviets put a total of seven Salyut space stations into orbit ( Figure 23.32). Several of the stations were used to study the problems of living in space and for a variety of experiments in astronomy, biology, and Earth science. The United States only launched one space station during this time. In May 1973, Skylab was launched ( Figure 23.33). Three crews visited Skylab, all within its first year in orbit. Skylab was used to study the effects on humans of staying in space for long periods, and was used for studying the Sun. More about Skylab can be found at URL . Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 each had two docking ports, so a crew could dock a spacecraft to one end, and a replacement crew could dock to the other end. This Soviet Salyut 7 space station was in orbit from 1982 to 1991. This image of Skylab was taken as the last crew left the station in January of 1974. 
Modular  Space  Stations 	  The first space station designed for long-term use was the Mir space station ( Figure 23.34). Mir was a modular space station. The USSR launched Mirs core in 1986 and the station was put together in several phases over the next decade. Mir holds the current record for the longest continuous occupation (although not by the same astronauts), nearly 10 years. Mir was taken out of orbit in 2001 and fell into the Pacific Ocean, as planned. Early space exploration was driven by competition between the United States and the USSR. However, since the end of the Cold War, space technology and space exploration have benefited from a spirit of cooperation. In 1993, the United States and Russia announced American involvement in Mir and plans for what became the International Space Station (ISS). Space shuttles would transport supplies and people to and from Mir, and American astronauts The Soviet/Russian space station Mir was designed to have several different parts attached to a core. would live on Mir for many months. This cooperation allowed the United States to learn from Russias experience with long-duration space flights. ( Figure 23.35) shows Mir with an American space shuttle attached. 
The  International  Space  Station 	  The International Space Station, shown in ( Figure 23.36), is a joint project between the space agencies of the United States (NASA), Russia (RKA), Japan (JAXA), Canada (CSA) and several European countries (ESA). The Brazilian Space Agency also contributes. The first piece of the ISS was launched in 1997 and it has been constructed piece by piece over time since then. It is a large station with many different sections. The station has had people on board since the first crew arrived in 2000. American space shuttles transport most of the supplies and equipment to the station, while Russian Soyuz spacecraft carry people. The primary purpose of the station is scientific research, especially in biology, medicine, and physics. 
Space  Shuttles 	  Although the spacecraft used for the Apollo missions were very successful, they were also very expensive, could not carry much cargo, and could be used only once. NASA wanted a new kind of space vehicle, one that was reusable and able to carry large pieces of equipment, such as satellites, space telescopes, or sections of a space station. The resulting spacecraft was a space shuttle, shown in ( Figure 23.37), and there have been five Columbia, Challenger, Russian cosmonauts took this photograph from their Soyuz spacecraft as they flew around Mir and the ISS. 
A photograph of the  International  Space 	  Station was taken from the space shuttle Atlantis in June 2007. Construction of the station was completed in 2011. Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavor. The Soviet Union built a similar shuttle called Buran, but it never flew a mission with humans aboard. A space shuttle has three main parts. The part you are probably most familiar with is the orbiter, with wings like an airplane. When a space shuttle launches, the orbiter is attached to a huge fuel tank that contains liquid fuel. On the sides of the fuel tank are two large booster rockets. ( Figure 23.38) shows the stages of a normal space shuttle mission. The launch takes place at Cape Canaveral in Florida. The booster rockets provide extra power to get the orbiter out of Earths atmosphere. When they are done, they parachute down into the ocean so they can be recovered and used again. When the fuel tank is empty, it also falls away, but it burns up in the atmosphere. Once in space, the orbiter can be used to release equipment, such as a satellite, or supplies to the International Space Station, or to repair existing equipment such as the Hubble Space Telescope, or to do experiments directly on board the orbiter. When the mission is complete, the orbiter re-enters Earths atmosphere. As it passes through the atmosphere, the Atlantis on the launch pad in 2006. Since 1981, the space shuttle has been the United States primary vehicle for carrying people and large equipment into space. In a typical space shuttle mission, the orbiter takes off like a rocket and lands like an airplane. outside of the orbiter heats up to over 1,500oC. The rockets do not fire during re-entry, so the shuttle is more like a glider than an airplane. Pilots have to steer the shuttle to the runway very precisely. Space shuttles usually land at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, or at Edwards Air Force Base in California. However, if weather is bad at both these landing sites, a shuttle can land at one of many backup sites around the world and then hauled back to Florida on the back of a jet airplane.

Space  Shuttle  Disasters 	  The space shuttle program has been very successful. Space shuttles have made possible many scientific discoveries and other great achievements in space. However, the program has also had some tragic disasters. After more than 20 successful missions from 1981 to the end of 1985, disaster struck on January 28, 1986. Just 73 seconds after launch, the space shuttle Challenger started to break apart, and most of it disintegrated in mid-air, as shown in ( Figure 23.39). All seven crew members on board, including the first teacher in space, Christa McAuliffe, died. The problem was found to be an O-ring, a small part in one of the rocket boosters. Safety was reviewed and improved. Shuttle missions started again in 1988, and more than 87 missions were completed without a major accident. Then during takeoff of the space shuttle Columbia on January 16, 2003, a small piece of insulating foam broke off the fuel tank, smashed into the front edge of one wing of the orbiter and damaged a tile. These tiles are heat-shield tiles that protect the shuttle from extremely high temperatures. When Columbia returned to Earth on February 3, 2003, it could not withstand the high temperature, and broke apart. Pieces of the shuttle were found throughout the southern United States. As in the Challenger disaster, all seven crew members died. Again, shuttle missions were stopped for two years while NASA worked on safety. The Space Shuttle program was terminated in 2011 and the shuttles have all been retired. You can see them in various locations around the country: 
Enterprise (test orbiter):  Intrepid  Sea- Air  Space  Museum;  New  York  City 	  Explorer (orbiter mockup): Johnson Space Center; Houston, Texas. Future missions to the ISS will be aboard the Russian Soyuz and eventually from a new American craft. 
Recent  Space  Missions 	  Many missions since the Challenger disaster have been designed without a crew. These missions are less expensive, less dangerous, and more flexible than manned mission and they provide a great deal of valuable information. 
Earth  Science  Satellites 	  NASA and space agencies from other countries have launched dozens of satellites that collect data on the current state of Earths systems. NASAs Landsat satellites take detailed images of Earths continents and coastal areas, such as those in ( Figure 23.40). Other satellites study the oceans, the atmosphere, the polar ice sheets, and other Earth systems. This data helps us to monitor climate change and understand how Earths systems affect one another. Many of the images used in this text are from satellites. The two images here are from NASAs Landsat 7 satellite and show New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain on April 26, 2000, (left) and on August 30, 2005, (right), shortly after Hurricane Katrina. Dark blue areas in the city are underwater. More about the Landsat program can be found at URL . 
Space  Telescopes 	  Some of the greatest astronomical discoveries and greatest pictures, such as the one in ( Figure 23.41), have come from the Hubble Space Telescope. The Hubble was put into orbit by the space shuttle Discovery in 1990. Several shuttle missions returned to the Hubble to make repairs. This image, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, shows the Cats Eye Nebula. Hubble has produced thousands of beautiful pictures that are also very valuable for scientific research. NASA has also put several other telescopes in space as described in the "Telescopes" lesson. The James Webb Telescope, scheduled to be launched into orbit in 2018, will replace the Hubble and have an even greater ability to view distant objects. Other countries, including Russia, Japan, and several European countries, have also put space telescopes in orbit. 
Solar  System  Exploration 	  The United States and other nations have had many missions around the solar system in recent years ( Figure (a) The Mars Pathfinder carried a rover, the Sojourner, to the surface. Here Sojourner takes a measurement of a rock scientists named Yogi. (b) Sunset on Mars, taken by Spirit in May 2005. (c) This artists painting of Opportunity shows the six wheels, as well as a set of instruments being extended forward by a robotic arm. The Cassini mission has been studying Saturn, including its rings and moons, since 2004 and will be directed to crash into Saturn in 2017 ( Figure 23.43). The Huygens probe, built by the European Space Agency, is studying Saturns moon Titan. Titan has some of the conditions that are needed to support life. An eclipse of Saturn taken by Cassini. Some missions are studying the smaller objects in our solar system. The Deep Impact probe was sent to collide with a comet. The probe and telescopes on Earth and in space all collected data The impact was recorded by Deep Impacts flyby spacecraft: URL . The Stardust mission collected tiny dust particles from another comet. Missions are currently underway to study some of the larger asteroids and Pluto. Studies of smaller objects in the solar system may help us to understand how the solar system formed. A manned trip to Mars to take place in the 2030s is being discussed, as are other possible missions. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The Space Race propelled space exploration for several decades. The United States first space station was Skylab. Skylab was in orbit from 1973 to 1979. The Soviet (later Russian) space station Mir was the first modular space station. Both Russian and American crews lived on Mir. The ISS is a huge project that involves many countries. It was assembled over several years. Space shuttles are reusable vehicles for American astronauts to get into space. A space shuttle takes off like a rocket and lands like a glider plane. The space shuttle program has had two major disastersthe Challenger disaster in 1986 and the Columbia disaster in 2003. In each case, the spacecraft was destroyed and a crew of 7 people died. Recent space missions have mostly used small spacecraft, such as satellites and space probes, without crews.

Introduction 	  This book so far has been almost entirely about Earth. This chapter is concerned with Earth as a planetary body, a member of the Earth-Moon pair that orbit each other and the Sun. 
Earth as a  Planetary  Body 	  Earth is an inner planet in the solar system and it is very much like the other inner planets, at least in its size, shape, and composition. But many features make Earth very different from the planets and any other planet that we know of so far. 
Earths  Shape 	  Earth is a sphere or, more correctly, an oblate spheroid, which is a sphere that is a bit squished down at the poles and bulges a bit at the equator. Or to be more technical, the minor axis (the diameter through the poles) is smaller than the major axis (the diameter through the equator). Half of the sphere is a hemisphere. North of the equator is the northern hemisphere and south of the equator is the southern hemisphere. Eastern and western hemispheres are also designated. What evidence is there that Earth is spherical? What evidence was there before spaceships and satellites? Try to design an experiment involving a ship and the ocean to show Earth is round. If you are standing on the shore and a ship is going out to sea, the ship gets smaller as it moves further away from you but the ships bottom also starts to disappear as the vessel goes around the arc of the planet ( Figure 24.1). There are many other ways that early scientists and mariners knew that Earth was not flat. Earths curvature is noticeable when objects at a distance are below the arc. Even the ancient Greeks knew that Earth was round by observing the arc shape of the shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse. NASA has an animation of a lunar eclipse here: URL 10/29/04nov_lunareclipse2_resources/reddy1_big.gif . The Sun and the other planets of the solar system are also spherical. Larger satellites, those that have enough mass for their gravitational attraction to have made them round, are as well. 
Earths  Magnetism 	  Earth has a magnetic field ( Figure 24.2) that behaves as if the planet had a gigantic bar magnet inside of it. Earths magnetic field also has a north and south pole and a magnetic field that surrounds it. The magnetic field arises from the convection of molten iron and nickel metal in Earths outer liquid iron core. Earths magnetic field extends several thousand kilometers into space. The magnetic field shields the planet from harmful radiation from the Sun ( Figure 24.3). 
Earths  Motions 	  Imagine a line passing through the center of Earth that goes through both the North Pole and the South Pole. This imaginary line is called an axis. Earth spins around its axis, just as a top spins around its spindle. This spinning movement is called Earths rotation. At the same time that the Earth spins on its axis, it also orbits, or revolves around the Sun. This movement is called revolution. Earth, on the right, is tiny in comparison to the Sun, but its magnetic field extends far outward. 
Earths  Rotation 	  In 1851, a French scientist named Lon Foucault took an iron sphere and swung it from a wire. He pulled the sphere to one side and then released it, letting it swing back and forth in a straight line ( Figure 24.4). A ball swinging back and forth on a string is called a pendulum. A pendulum set in motion will not change its motion, and so the direction of its swinging should not change. However, Foucault observed that his pendulum did seem to change direction. Since he knew that the pendulum could not change its motion, he concluded that the Earth, underneath the pendulum was moving. Figure 24.5 shows how this might look. An observer in space will see that Earth requires 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds to make one complete rotation on its axis. But because Earth moves around the Sun at the same time that it is rotating, the planet must turn just a little bit more to reach the same place relative to the Sun. Hence the length of a day on Earth is actually 24 hours. At the equator, the Earth rotates at a speed of about 1,700 km per hour, but at the poles the movement speed is nearly Foucaults pendulum is now on display in the Pantheon in Paris. Imagine a pendulum at the North Pole. The pendulum always swings in the same direction, but because of Earths rotation, its direction appears to change to observers on Earth. nothing. 
A  Turn of the  Earth 	  In this video, MIT students demonstrate how a Foucault Pendulum is used to prove that the Earth is rotating. See the video at URL . 
Earths  Revolution 	  For Earth to make one complete revolution around the Sun takes 365.24 days. This amount of time is the definition of one year. The gravitational pull of the Sun keeps Earth and the other planets in orbit around the star. Like the other planets, Earths orbital path is an ellipse ( Figure 24.6) so the planet is sometimes farther away from the Sun than at other times. The closest Earth gets to the Sun each year is at perihelion (147 million km) on about January 3rd and the furthest is at aphelion (152 million km) on July 4th. Earths elliptical orbit has nothing to do with Earths seasons. Earth and the other planets in the solar system orbit around the Sun. Although the orbits are slightly elliptical, in this image the ellipses are exaggerated. During one revolution around the Sun, Earth travels at an average distance of about 150 million km. Earth revolves around the Sun at an average speed of about 27 km (17 mi) per second, but the speed is not constant. The planet moves slower when it is at aphelion and faster when it is at perihelion. The reason the Earth (or any planet) has seasons is that Earth is tilted 23 1/2o on its axis. During the Northern Hemisphere summer the North Pole points toward the Sun, and in the Northern Hemisphere winter the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun ( Figure 24.7). 
Lesson  Summary 	  Earth rotates or spins on its axis approximately once each day and revolves around the Sun approximately once a year. Earths orbit around the Sun is elliptical; the planet is closer at perihelion and farther at aphelion. The tilt of Earths axis produces seasons. The Earth and other planets in our solar system are rotating spheres. Earth has a magnetic field created by the convection of molten liquid in the outer core. The magnetic field shields Earth from harmful solar radiation. What type of experiment could you create to prove that the Earth is rotating on its axis? If you lived at the equator, would you experience any effects because of Earths tilted axis? If Earth suddenly increased in mass, what might happen to its orbit around the Sun? Would life on Earth be impacted if Earth lost its magnetic field? Why are the inner planets spherical? Explain how scientists think the Moon formed. Describe the features of the Moon. crater lunar maria terrae 
Introduction 	  On July 20, 1969, hundreds of millions of people all over the world witnessed something incredible. Never before had a human being walked on a planetary body other than Earth. But on that day, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the Moon ( Figure 24.8). More than 30 years later, the Moon remains the only place that humans have visited outside of our home planet. Human explorations of the Moon, along with visits by rovers and satellites, have helped scientists learn a great deal about the geology of Earths only natural satellite. Much of what we know about the Moon was learned by astronauts visiting the Moon and from data collected by the Apollo missions. 
Lunar  Characteristics 	  The Moon is Earths only natural satellite, a body that moves around a larger body in space. The Moon orbits Earth for the same reason Earth orbits the Sun  gravity. The Moon is 3,476 km in diameter, about one-fourth the size of Earth. The satellite is also not as dense as the Earth; gravity on the Moon is only one-sixth as strong as it is on Earth. An astronaut can jump six times as high on the Moon as on Earth! (By the way, lunar means having to do with the Moon.) The Moon makes one complete orbit around the Earth every 27.3 days, relative to the fixed stars. This is the Moons orbital period. The Moon also rotates on its axis once every 27.3 days. Do you know what this means? The same side of the Moon always faces Earth and so that side of the Moon is what we always see in the night sky ( Figure Astronaut Buzz Aldrin walks on the Moon on July 20, 1969. The footprints are the first signs of life ever on the Moon. (a) The near side of the Moon faces Earth continually. It has a thinner crust with many more maria (flat areas of basaltic rock). (b) The far side of the Moon has only been seen by spacecraft. It has a thicker crust and far fewer maria (flat areas of basaltic rock). 
The  Lunar  Surface 	  The Moon has no atmosphere. Since an atmosphere moderates temperature, the Moons average surface temperature during the day is approximately 225F but drops to minus 243F at night. The coldest temperatures, around minus 397F, occur in craters in the permanently shaded south polar basin. These are among the coldest temperatures recorded in the entire solar system. Earths landscape is extremely varied with mountains, valleys, plains and hills. This landscape is always changing as plate tectonics builds new features and weathering and erosion destroys them. The landscape of the Moon is very different. With no plate tectonics, features are not built. With no atmosphere, features are not destroyed. Still, the Moon has a unique surface. One major lunar surface feature is the bowl-shaped craters that are caused by meteorite impacts ( Figure 24.10). If Earth did not have plate tectonics or erosion, its surface would also be covered with meteorite craters. Even from Earth, the Moon has visible dark areas and light areas. The dark areas are called maria, which means seas since thats what the ancients thought they were. But the maria are not water but solid, flat areas of basaltic lava. From about 3.0 to 3.5 billion years ago the Moon was continually bombarded by meteorites. Some of these meteorites were so large that they broke through the Moons newly formed surface, then magma flowed out and filling the craters. Scientists estimate volcanic activity on the Moon ceased about 1.2 billion years ago, but most occurred long before that. The lighter parts of the Moon are called terrae or highlands ( Figure 24.11). The terrae are higher than the maria and include several high mountain ranges. The terrae are the light silicate minerals that precipitated out of the ancient magma ocean and formed the early lunar crust. A close-up of the Moon, showing maria (the dark areas) and terrae (the light areas); maria covers around 16% of the Moons surface, mostly on the side of the Moon we see. There are no lakes, rivers, or even small puddles anywhere to be found on the Moons surface, but water ice has been found in the extremely cold craters and bound up in the lunar soil. Despite the possible presence of water, the lack of an atmosphere and the extreme temperatures make it no surprise to scientists that the Moon has absolutely no evidence of life. Life from Earth has visited the Moon and there are footprints of astronauts on the lunar surface. With no wind, rain, or living thing to disturb them, these footprints will remain as long as the Moon exists. Only an impact with a meteorite could destroy them.

Interior of the  Moon 	  Like Earth, the Moon has a distinct crust, mantle, and core. What is known about the Moons interior was determined from the analysis of rock samples gathered by astronauts and from unpiloted spacecraft sent to the Moon ( Figure The Moons small core, 600 to 800 kilometers in diameter is mostly iron with some sulfur and nickel. The Moons internal structure shows a small metallic core (yellow), a primitive mantle (orange), a depleted mantle (blue), and a crust (gray). The mantle is composed of the minerals olivine and orthopyroxene. Analysis of Moon rocks indicates that there may also be high levels of iron and titanium in the lunar mantle. The crust is composed of igneous rock rich in the elements oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and aluminum. The crust is about 60 km thick on the near side of the Moon and about 100 km thick on the far side. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The Moon makes one rotation on its axis in the time it takes for it to orbit the Earth. The Moon has dark areas, called maria, surrounded by lighter colored highland areas, called terrae. Because the Moon is geologically inactive and doesnt have an atmosphere, it has many thousands of craters on its surface. The Moon is made of many materials similar to Earth and has a crust, mantle, and core, just like the Earth. What things would be different on Earth if Earth did not have a moon? If the Moon rotated on its axis once every 14 days, would we see anything different than we do now? How do we know that the Moon has been geologically inactive for billions of years? Describe the layers of the Sun. Describe the surface features of the Sun. chromosphere convection zone corona nuclear fusion photon photosphere plasma radiative zone solar flare solar prominence 
Introduction 	  Consider Earth, the Moon, and all the other planets and satellites in the solar system. The mass of all of those objects together accounts for only 0.2% of the total mass of the solar system. The rest, 99.8% of all the mass in the solar system, is the Sun! The Sun ( Figure 24.13) is the center of the solar system and the largest object in the solar system. This nearby star provides light and heat and supports almost all life on Earth. 
Layers of the  Sun 	  The Sun is a sphere, composed almost entirely of the elements hydrogen and helium. The Sun is not solid or a typical gas. Most atoms in the Sun exist as plasma, a fourth state of matter made up of superheated gas with a positive electrical charge. 
Internal  Structure 	  Because the Sun is not solid, it does not have a defined outer boundary. It does, however, have a definite internal structure with identifiable layers ( Figure 24.14). From inward to outward they are: The Suns central core is plasma with a temperature of around 27 millionoC. At such high temperatures hydrogen combines to form helium by nuclear fusion, a process that releases vast amounts of energy. This energy moves outward, towards the outer layers of the Sun. Nuclear fusion in stars is discussed more in the Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe chapter. The radiative zone, just outside the core, has a temperature of about 7 millionoC. The energy released in the core travels extremely slowly through the radiative zone. A particle of light, called a photon, travels only a few millimeters before it hits another particle. The photon is absorbed and then released again. A photon may take as long as 50 million years to travel all the way through the radiative zone. In the convection zone, hot material from near the radiative zone rises, cools at the Suns surface, and then plunges back downward to the radiative zone. Convective movement helps to create solar flares and sunspots. The first video describes the basics of our Sun, including how it is powered by nuclear reactions (1e): URL outube.com/watch?v=JHf3dG0Bx7I (8:34). The second video discusses what powers the sun and what is its influence on Earth and the rest of the solar system (1e): URL (8:25). 
The  Outer  Layers 	  The next three layers make up the Suns atmosphere. Since there are no solid layers to any part of the Sun, these boundaries are fuzzy and indistinct. The photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun, the region that emits sunlight. The photosphere is relatively cool  only about 6,700C. The photosphere has several different colors; oranges, yellow and reds, giving it a grainy appearance. The chromosphere is a thin zone, about 2,000 km thick, that glows red as it is heated by energy from the photosphere ( Figure 24.15). Temperatures in the chromosphere range from about 4,000C to about 10,000C. Jets of gas fire up through the chromosphere at speeds up to 72,000 km per hour, reaching heights as high as 10,000 km. The corona is the outermost plasma layer  It is the Suns halo or crown. The coronas temperature of 2 to 5 millionC is much hotter than the photosphere ( Figure 24.16). The movie Seeing a Star in a New Light can be seen here: URL . 
Surface  Features 	  The Suns surface features are quite visible, but only with special equipment. For example, sunspots are only visible with special light-filtering lenses. (a) During a solar eclipse, the Suns corona is visible extending millions of kilometers into space. (b) The corona and coronal loops in the lower solar atmosphere taken by the TRACE space telescope. 
Sunspots 	  The most noticeable surface feature of the Sun are cooler, darker areas known as sunspots ( Figure 24.17). Sunspots are located where loops of the Suns magnetic field break through the surface and disrupt the smooth transfer of heat from lower layers of the Sun, making them cooler and darker and marked by intense magnetic activity. Sunspots usually occur in pairs. When a loop of the Suns magnetic field breaks through the surface, a sunspot is created where the loop comes out and where it goes back in again. 
Solar  Flares 	  There are other types of interruptions of the Suns magnetic energy. If a loop of the suns magnetic field snaps and breaks, it creates solar flares, which are violent explosions that release huge amounts of energy ( Figure 24.18). A movie of the flare is seen here: URL . A strong solar flare can turn into a coronal mass ejection ( Figure 24.19). A solar flare or coronal mass ejection releases streams of highly energetic particles that make up the solar wind. The solar wind can be dangerous to spacecraft and astronauts because it sends out large amounts of radiation that can (a) Sunspots usually occur in 11-year cycles, increasing from a minimum number to a maximum number and then gradually decreasing to a minimum number again. (b) A close-up of a sunspot taken in ultraviolet light. A coronal mass ejection is a large ejection of plasma from the star seen in this image. harm the human body. Solar flares have knocked out entire power grids and disturbed radio, satellite, and cell phone communications. 
D:  Journey  Into the  Sun 	  The Solar Dynamics Observatory is a NASA spacecraft launched in early 2010 is obtaining IMAX-like images of the sun every second of the day, generating more data than any NASA mission in history. The data will allow researchers to learn about solar storms and other phenomena that can cause blackouts and harm astronauts. Learn more at: URL . 
Solar  Prominences 	  Another highly visible feature on the Sun is solar prominences. If plasma flows along a loop of the Suns magnetic field from sunspot to sunspot, it forms a glowing arch that reaches thousands of kilometers into the Suns atmosphere. Prominences can last for a day to several months. Prominences are also visible during a total solar eclipse. Solar prominences are displayed in this video from NASAs Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO): URL be.com/watch?v=QrmUUcr4HXg . Most of the imagery comes from SDOs AIA instrument; different colors represent different temperatures, a common technique for observing solar features. SDO sees the entire disk of the Sun in extremely high spatial and temporal resolution, allowing scientists to zoom in on notable events such as flares, waves, and sunspots. 
Solar  Dynamics  Observatory 	  The video above was taken from the SDO, the most advanced spacecraft ever designed to study the Sun. During its five-year mission, SDO will examine the Suns magnetic field and also provide a better understanding of the role the Sun plays in Earths atmospheric chemistry and climate. Since just after its launch on February 11, 2010, SDO is providing images with clarity 10 times better than high-definition television and will return more comprehensive science data faster than any other solar observing spacecraft. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The mass of the Sun is 99.8% of the mass of our solar system. The Sun is mostly made of hydrogen with smaller amounts of helium in the form of plasma. The main part of the Sun has three layers: the core, radiative zone, and convection zone. The Suns atmosphere also has three layers: the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the corona. Nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the core of the Sun produces tremendous amounts of energy that radiate out from the Sun. Some features of the Suns surface include sunspots, solar flares, and prominences. To find these videos for download, check out: URL s-20100421.html and URL .

If something were to suddenly cause nuclear fusion to stop in the Sun, how would we know? When would we know? Are there any types of dangerous energy from the Sun? What might be affected by them? If the Sun is made of gases such as hydrogen and helium, how can it have layers? 
Going  Further -  Applying  Math 	  Have would you measure something that you cannot reach? The answer is that you can use simple geometry. We can measure the diameter of the Sun, even though we cannot go to the Sun and even though the Sun is far too large for a human being to measure. To measure the Sun we use the rules of similar triangles. The sides of similar triangles are proportional to each other. By setting up one very small triangle that is proportional to another very large triangle, we can find an unknown distance or measurement as long as we know three out of four of the parts of the equation. If you make a pinhole in an index card and project an image of the Sun onto a clipboard held 1 meter from the index card, the diameter of our projected image of the Sun will be proportional to the true diameter of the Sun. Heres the equation: s / d = S / D, where s = diameter of the projected image of the Sun, S = true diameter of the Sun. The calculation also requires you to know the true distance between the Earth and the Sun, D = 1.496 x 108 km and the distance (d = 1 meter) between the clipboard and the index card. Before you can correctly solve this equation, you will need to be sure all of your measurements are in the same units in this case, change all your measurements to km. Try this out and see how accurately you can measure the true diameter of the Sun. Describe how Earths movements affect seasons and cause day and night. Explain solar and lunar eclipses.

Introduction 	  The motions of bodies in the solar system are, for the most part, regular and understandable. From Earth, the Sun rises in the eastern sky in the morning and sets in the western sky in the evening. If the Moon is full on Day 1, it will be full again on Day 28, and new on Day 14. The motions of Earth relative to the Sun, and the motions of the Moon and Sun relative to Earth affect different phenomena on Earth, including day and night, the seasons, tides, and phases of the Moon. 
Day- Night  Cycle 	  Earth rotates once on its axis about every 24 hours. To an observer cooling down on the North Pole, the rotation appears counterclockwise. From nearly all points on Earth, the Sun appears to move across the sky from east to west each day. Of course, the Sun is not moving from east to west at all; Earth is rotating. The Moon and stars also seem to rise in the east and set in the west. Earths rotation means that there is a cycle of daylight and darkness approximately every 24 hours, the length of a day. Different places experience sunset and sunrise at different times and the amount of time a location is in daylight and darkness also differs by location. Shadows are areas where an object obstructs a light source so that darkness takes on the form of the object. On Earth, a shadow can be cast by the Sun, Moon or, rarely, Mercury or Venus. 
Earths  Seasons 	  A common misconception is that the Sun is closer to Earth in the summer and farther away from it during the winter. Instead, the seasons are caused by the 23.5 tilt of Earths axis of rotation relative to its plane of orbit around the Sun ( Figure 24.20). At summer solstice, June 21 or 22, Earths axis points toward the Sun and so the Sun is directly overhead at its furthest north point of the year, the Tropic of Cancer (23.5 N). The Earths tilt on its axis leads to one hemisphere facing the Sun more than the other hemisphere and gives rise to seasons. During the summer, areas north of the equator experience longer days and shorter nights. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Sun is as far away as it will be and so it is their winter. Locations will have longer nights and shorter days. The opposite occurs on winter solstice, which begins on December 21. More about seasons can be found in the Earths Atmosphere chapter. Check out this video on why earth has seasons to learn more: URL . 
Solar  Eclipses 	  A solar eclipse occurs when the new moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun ( Figure 24.21). This casts a shadow on the Earth and blocks Earths view of the Sun. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moons shadow completely blocks the Sun ( Figure 24.22). When only a portion of the Sun is out of view, it is called a partial solar eclipse. Solar eclipses are rare and usually only last a few minutes because the Moon casts only a small shadow ( Figure A BBC video of a solar eclipse is seen here: URL . The Moons shadow in a solar eclipse covers a very small area. As the Sun is covered by the moons shadow, it will actually get cooler outside. Birds may begin to sing, and stars will become visible in the sky. During a solar eclipse, the corona and solar prominences can be seen. 
D:  Eclipse  Chasers 	  A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun in such a way that the Sun is either partially or totally hidden from view. Some people, including some scientists, chase eclipses all over the world to learn or just observe this amazing phenomenon. Learn more at: URL . 
A  Lunar  Eclipse 	  A lunar eclipse occurs when the full moon moves through Earths shadow, which only happens when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun and all three are lined up in the same plane, called the ecliptic ( Figure 24.24). In an eclipse, Earths shadow has two distinct parts: the umbra and the penumbra. The umbra is the inner, cone-shaped part of the shadow, in which all of the light has been blocked. The penumbra is the outer part of Earths shadow where only part of the light is blocked. In the penumbra, the light is dimmed but not totally absent. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon travels completely in Earths umbra. During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon enters Earths umbra. Earths shadow is large enough that a lunar eclipse lasts for hours and can be seen by any part of Earth with a view of the Moon at the time of the eclipse ( Figure 24.25). The moon glows with a dull red coloring during a total lunar eclipse, which you can see in this video of a lunar eclipse over Hawaii: URL . Partial lunar eclipses occur at least twice a year, but total lunar eclipses are less common. 
The  Phases of the  Moon 	  Like everything in the solar system except the Sun, the Moon does not produce any light of its own it only reflects sunlight. As the Moon moves around Earth, different portions of the satellite are illuminated. This causes the phases of the Moon, so that our view of the Moon goes from fully lit to completely dark and back again. The Moon is full when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun and the Moons nearside is entirely lit. The Moon is at first quarter phase about one week later, when the Moon appears as a half-circle. Only half of the Moons lit surface is visible from Earth. The Moon is in a new moon phase when the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun and the side of the Moon facing Earth is completely dark. Earth observers may be able to just barely see the outline of the new moon because some sunlight reflects off the Earth and hits the moon. Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases. During the gibbous moon phase, the moon is more than half lit but not full. During the crescent moon phase, the moon is less than half lit and is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape. It takes about 29.5 days for the Moon to make one cycle relative to the Sun and go through all the phases ( Figure 24.26). The time between two new Moon phases or two full Moon phases is 29.5 days. Remember that the Moons orbital period is 27.3 days. The difference of 29.5 and 27.3 is that while the Moon is orbiting the Earth, the Earth is moving along in its orbit so it takes longer for the Moon to reach the same position relative to the Sun. An animation of lunar phases from the University of Illinois: URL ndex.html . The phases of the moon as if the Sun is above the top of this picture with its rays directed downward. 
The  Tides 	  Tides are the regular rising and falling of Earths surface water in response to the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun. The Moons gravity pulls upwards on Earths water, causing it to bulge out in the direction of the Moon. On the other side of the Earth, a high tide is produced where the Moons pull is weakest. As the Earth rotates on its axis, the areas directly in line with the Moon experience high tides. The places directly in between the high tides are low tides. There are two high tides and two low tides each tidal day. Since the Earth is rotating on its axis, the highlow-tide cycle moves around the globe in a 24-hour period. The gravity of the Sun also pulls Earths water towards it and causes its own tides. Because the sun is so far away, its pull is smaller than the Moons. When the Sun and Moon are in line, during the new moon and the full moon, their high tides add up and create a spring tide. During a spring tide, high tides are really high, which means that low tides are really low ( Figure 24.27). A spring tide is the added highs produced by the Moon and Sun and the added lows, creating a large tidal range. When the Earth and Sun are in line but the Moon is perpendicular to the Earth a neap tide occurs. This happens when the moon is at first or last quarter-moon phase. In a neap tide the difference between high and low tides is not very large since the pull of gravity from the Sun partially cancels out the pull of gravity from the Moon. Neap tides produce less extreme tides than the normal tides ( Figure 24.28). A neap tide occurs when the high tide of the Sun adds to the low tide of the Moon and vice versa so the tidal range is relatively small. More about tides is found in the chapter Earths Ocean. 
Lesson  Summary 	  As the Earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun, day and night and seasons result. When the new moon comes between the Earth and the Sun along the ecliptic, a solar eclipse is produced. When the Earth comes between the full moon and the Sun along the ecliptic, a lunar eclipse occurs. Observing the Moon from Earth, there is a sequence of phases as the side facing us goes from completely darkened to completely illuminated and back again every 29.5 days. As the Moon orbits Earth, tides align with its gravitational pull. The Sun produces a smaller tide. When the solar and lunar tides align, at new and full moons, higher than normal tidal ranges called spring tides occur. At first and last quarter moons, the solar tide and lunar tide interfere with each other, producing lower than normal tidal ranges called neap tides.

Chapter  Outline 	  How do planetary geologists learn about the geology of other planets? Since much of the available information is from spacecraft flying high above the planet, these scientists compare images taken of the planet with images taken on Earth. Look at the images above and see if you can find the similarities and differences. Which is from Earth and which from another planet? Its easy to figure out that the top image is Earth since there are plants. It is Devils Tower in Wyoming and the bottom image is Marte Vallis on Mars. The features that are common to the images are columnar basalts showing columnar jointing and talus slopes. Columnar basalts form from basalt lavas that flow in a thick layer along a cool surface. The vertical joints speed cooling. Weathering causes the columns to break and form talus slopes. On Mars the columnar basalts are exposed on the rim of a 160 km diameter crater. Evidence of the lava flows covers more than 200 square km (77 square miles), similar to terrestrial flood basalts. A meteorite impact appears to have created a crater to expose the columnar basalts. Devils Tower is a magma that cooled below the surface in sedimentary rock layers and formed columnar joints. The sedimentary rocks have since been eroded, exposing the tower. At the base are slopes of broken columns creating talus slopes. Mars image courtesy High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, Arizona State University.

Changing  Views of the  Solar  System 	  Humans view of the solar system has evolved as technology and scientific knowledge have increased. The ancient Greeks identified five of the planets and for many centuries they were the only planets known. Since then, scientists have discovered two more planets, many other solar-system objects and even planets found outside our solar system. 
The  Geocentric  Universe 	  The ancient Greeks believed that Earth was at the center of the universe, as shown in Figure 25.1. This view is called the geocentric model of the universe. Geocentric means "Earth-centered." In the geocentric model, the sky, or heavens, are a set of spheres layered on top of one another. Each object in the sky is attached to a sphere and moves around Earth as that sphere rotates. From Earth outward, these spheres contain the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. An outer sphere holds all the stars. Since the planets appear to move much faster than the stars, the Greeks placed them closer to Earth. The geocentric model worked well, by explaining why all the stars appear to rotate around Earth once per day. The model also explained why the planets move differently from the stars and from each other. One problem with the geocentric model is that some planets seem to move backwards (in retrograde) instead of in their usual forward motion around Earth. A demonstration animation of retrograde motion of Mars as it appears to Earth can be found here: URL Model of a geocentric universe. This diagram of the universe from the Middle Ages shows Earth at the center, with the Moon, the Sun, and the planets orbiting Earth. Around 150 A.D. the astronomer Ptolemy resolved this problem by using a system of circles to describe the motion of planets ( Figure 25.2). In Ptolemys system, a planet moves in a small circle, called an epicycle. This circle moves around Earth in a larger circle, called a deferent. Ptolemys version of the geocentric model worked so well that it remained the accepted model of the universe for more than a thousand years. According to Ptolemy, a planet moves on a small circle (epicycle) that in turn moves on a larger circle (deferent) around Earth. 
The  Heliocentric  Universe 	  Ptolemys geocentric model worked but it was not only complicated, it occasionally made errors in predicting the movement of planets. At the beginning of the 16th century A.D., Nicolaus Copernicus proposed that Earth and all the other planets orbit the Sun. With the Sun at the center, this model is called the heliocentric model or "sun-centered" model of the universe ( Figure 25.3). Copernicus model explained the motion of the planets as well as Ptolemys model did, but it did not require complicated additions like epicycles and deferents. Unlike the geocentric model, the heliocentric model had the Sun at the center and did not require epicycles. Although Copernicus model worked more simply than Ptolemys, it still did not perfectly describe the motion of the planets because, like Ptolemy, Copernicus thought planets moved in perfect circles. Not long after Copernicus, Johannes Kepler refined the heliocentric model so that the planets moved around the Sun in ellipses (ovals), not circles ( Figure 25.4). Keplers model matched observations perfectly. 
Animation of  Keplers  Laws of  Planetary  Motion: http://projects.astro.illinois.edu/data/ Keplers Laws/index.html 	  Keplers model showed the planets moving around the sun in ellipses. The elliptical orbits are exaggerated in this image. Because people were so used to thinking of Earth at the center of the universe, the heliocentric model was not widely accepted at first. However, when Galileo Galilei first turned a telescope to the heavens in 1610, he made several striking discoveries. Galileo discovered that the planet Jupiter has moons orbiting around it. This provided the first evidence that objects could orbit something besides Earth. An animation of three of Jupiters moons orbiting the planet is seen here: URL mmons/e/e7/Galilean_moon_Laplace_resonance_animation_de.gif . Galileo also discovered that Venus has phases like the Moon ( Figure 25.5), which provides direct evidence that Venus orbits the Sun. Galileos discoveries caused many more people to accept the heliocentric model of the universe, although Galileo himself was found guilty of heresy for his ideas. The shift from an Earth-centered view to a Sun-centered view of the universe is referred to as the Copernican Revolution. Watch this animation of the Ptolemaic and Copernican models of the solar system. Ptolemy made the best model he could with the assumption that Earth was the center of the universe, but by letting that assumption go, Copernicus came up with a much simpler model. Before people would accept that Copernicus was right, they needed to accept that the Sun was the center of the solar system (1n IE Stand.): URL (0:47). 
The  Modern  Solar  System 	  Today, we know that our solar system is just one tiny part of the universe as a whole. Neither Earth nor the Sun are at the center of the universe. However, the heliocentric model accurately describes the solar system. In our modern view of the solar system, the Sun is at the center, with the planets moving in elliptical orbits around the Sun. The planets do not emit their own light, but instead reflect light from the Sun. 
Extrasolar  Planets or  Exoplanets 	  Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered other solar systems, with planets orbiting stars other than our own Sun (called "extrasolar planets" or simply "exoplanets") ( Figure 25.6). The extrasolar planet Fomalhaut is surrounded by a large disk of gas. The disk is not centered on the planet, suggesting that another planet may be pulling on the gas as well. Some extrasolar planets have been directly imaged, but most have been discovered by indirect methods. One technique involves detecting the very slight motion of a star periodically moving toward and away from us along our line-of-sight (also known as a stars "radial velocity"). This periodic motion can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a planet or, sometimes, another star orbiting the star. This is in line with the plane of the system: URL . A planet may also be identified by measuring a stars brightness over time. A temporary, periodic decrease in light emitted from a star can occur when a planet crosses in front of (or "transits") the star it is orbiting, momentarily blocking out some of the starlight. More than 3,600 extrasolar planets have been identified and the rate of discovery is increasing rapidly. Extrasolar Planet from the ESA discusses extrasolar planets and particularly a planetary system very similar to our solar system (1g): URL (3:29). An introduction to extrasolar planets from NASA is available at (1g): URL HDNTvQ (3:14). 
D:  The  Planet  Hunters 	  Hundreds of exoplanets have now been discovered. To learn something about how planet hunters find these balls of rock they usually cant even see, watch this QUEST video. Learn more at: URL and URL . 
Planets and  Their  Motions 	  Since the time of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo, we have learned a lot more about our solar system. Astronomers have discovered two more planets (Uranus and Neptune), four dwarf planets (Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris), more than 150 moons, and many, many asteroids and other small objects. ( Figure 25.7) shows the Sun and the major objects that orbit the Sun. There are eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and the five known dwarf planets and the five known dwarf planets (Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris). Although the Sun is just an average star compared to other stars, it is by far the largest object in the solar system. The Sun is more than 500 times the mass of everything else in the solar system combined! Table 25.1 gives data on the sizes of the Sun and planets relative to Earth. Relative sizes of the Sun, planets and dwarf planets. The relative sizes are correct and their position relative to each other is correct, but the relative distances are not correct.

The  Role of  Gravity 	  Isaac Newton was one of the first scientists to explore gravity. He understood that the Moon circles the Earth because a force is pulling the Moon toward Earths center. Without that force, the Moon would continue moving in a straight The force of gravity exists between all objects in the universe; the strength of the force depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them. 
Formation of the  Solar  System 	  There are two additional key features of the solar system: These two features are clues to how the solar system formed. 
A  Giant  Nebula 	  The most widely accepted explanation of how the solar system formed is called the nebular hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the Sun and the planets of our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust, called a nebula. The nebula was drawn together by gravity, which released gravitational potential energy. As small particles of dust and gas smashed together to create larger ones, they released kinetic energy. As the nebula collapsed, the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin because of its angular momentum. As it collapsed further, the spinning got faster, much as an ice skater spins faster when he pulls his arms to his sides during a spin. Much of the clouds mass migrated to its center but the rest of the material flattened out in an enormous disk, as shown in Figure 25.11. The disk contained hydrogen and helium, along with heavier elements and even simple organic molecules. 
Formation of the  Sun and  Planets 	  As gravity pulled matter into the center of the disk, the density and pressure at the center became intense. When the pressure in the center of the disk was high enough, nuclear fusion began. A star was bornthe Sun. The burning star stopped the disk from collapsing further. Meanwhile, the outer parts of the disk were cooling off. Matter condensed from the cloud and small pieces of dust started clumping together. These clumps collided and combined with other clumps. Larger clumps, called planetesimals, attracted smaller clumps with their gravity. Gravity at the center of the disk attracted heavier particles, such as rock and metal and lighter particles remained further out in the disk. Eventually, the planetesimals formed protoplanets, which grew to become the planets and moons that we find in our solar system today. Because of the gravitational sorting of material, the inner planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars formed from dense rock and metal. The outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune condensed farther from the Sun from lighter materials such as hydrogen, helium, water, ammonia, and methane. Out by Jupiter and beyond, where its very cold, these materials form solid particles. The nebular hypothesis was designed to explain some of the basic features of the solar system: The orbits of the planets lie in nearly the same plane with the Sun at the center 
The planets mostly rotate in the same direction 	  The axes of rotation of the planets are mostly nearly perpendicular to the orbital plane 
The oldest moon rocks are 4.5 billion years 	  This video, from the ESA, discusses the Sun, planets, and other bodies in the Solar System and how they formed (1a, 1d). The first part of the video explores the evolution of our view of the solar system starting with the early Greeks who reasoned that since some points of light which they called planets moved faster than the stars, they must be closer: URL (8:34). 
Lesson  Summary 	  The solar system is the Sun and all the objects that are bound to the Sun by gravity. The solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Ceres, Makemake, Pluto and Eris are dwarf planets. The ancient Greeks and people for centuries afterwards believed in a geocentric model of the universe, with Earth at the center and everything else orbiting our planet. Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo promoted a heliocentric model of the universe, with the Sun at the center and Earth and the other planets orbiting the Sun. Gravity holds planets in elliptical orbits around the Sun. The nebular hypothesis describes how the solar system formed from a giant cloud of gas and dust about 4.6 billion years ago.

Why or why not? The planets are often divided into two groups: the inner planets and the outer planets. Which planets do you think are in each of these two groups? What do members of each group have in common? Describe key features of each of the inner planets. Compare each of the inner planets to Earth and to one another. day inner planets terrestrial planets year 
Introduction 	  What evidence do planetary geologists have to go on to determine the geology of the inner planets? On Earth, scientists can collect and analyze the chemistry of samples, do radiometric dating to determine their ages, and look at satellite images to see large-scale features. Rovers have landed on Mars and sent back enormous amounts of information but much of the rest of what is known about the inner planets is from satellite images. 
The  Inner  Planets 	  The inner planets, or terrestrial planets, are the four planets closest to the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Figure 25.12 shows the relative sizes of these four inner planets. This composite shows the relative sizes of the four inner planets. From left to right, they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Unlike the outer planets, which have many of satellites, Mercury and Venus do not have moons, Earth has one, and Mars has two. Of course, the inner planets have shorter orbits around the Sun, and they all spin more slowly. Geologically, the inner planets are all made of cooled igneous rock with iron cores, and all have been geologically active, at least early in their history. None of the inner planets has rings. 
Earth 	  Although Earth is the third planet out from the Sun this lesson will start here. We know a lot more about Earth, so what we know can be used for comparison with the other planets. What are Earths most distinctive features? This famous image of Earth was taken during the Apollo 17 mission to the moon. Can you find a hurricane? A storm spinning in the opposite direction from the hurricane? 
Earths  Surface and  Life 	  As you can see in ( Figure 25.13), Earth has vast oceans of liquid water, large masses of exposed land, and a dynamic atmosphere with clouds of water vapor. Earth also has ice covering its polar regions. Earths average surface temperature is 14C (57F). Water is a liquid at this temperature, but the planet also has water in its other two states, solid and gas. The oceans and the atmosphere help keep Earths surface temperatures fairly steady. As yet Earth is the only planet known to have life. The presence of liquid water, the ability of the atmosphere to filter out harmful radiation, and many other features make the planet uniquely suited to harbor life. Life and Earth now affect each other; for example, the evolution of plants allowed oxygen to enter the atmosphere in large enough quantities for animals to evolve. Although life has not been found elsewhere in the solar system, other planets or satellites may harbor primitive life forms. Life may also be found elsewhere in the universe. 
Structure and  Plate  Tectonics 	  The heat that remained from the planets accretion, gravitational compression, and radioactive decay allowed the Earth to melt, probably more than once. As it subsequently cooled, gravity pulled metal into the center to create the core. Heavier rocks formed the mantle and lighter rocks formed the crust. Earths crust is divided into tectonic plates, which move around on the surface because of the convecting mantle below. Movement of the plates causes other geological activity, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and the formation of mountains. The locations of these features are mostly related to current or former plate boundaries. Earth is the only planet known to have plate tectonics. 
Earths  Motions and  Satellites 	  Earth rotates on its axis once per day, by definition. Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.24 days, which is defined as a year. Earth has one large moon, which orbits Earth once every 29.5 days, a period known as a month. Earths moon is the only large moon orbiting a terrestrial planet in the solar system. The Moon is covered with craters; it also has large plains of lava. The huge number of craters suggests that Moons surface is ancient. There is evidence that the Moon formed when a large object perhaps as large as the planet Mars struck Earth in the distant past ( Figure 25.14). Besides its Moon, Earth is orbited by a great deal of space debris, the remains of satellites, and rocket stages. 
Mercury 	  The smallest planet, Mercury, is the planet closest to the Sun. Because Mercury is so close to the Sun, it is difficult to observe from Earth, even with a telescope. However, the Mariner 10 spacecraft, shown in Figure 25.15, visited Mercury from 1974 to 1975. The MESSENGER spacecraft has been studying Mercury in detail since 2005. The craft is currently in orbit around the planet, where it is creating detailed maps. MESSENGER stands for Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging. As Figure 25.16 shows, the surface of Mercury is covered with craters, like Earths moon. Ancient impact craters means that for billions of years Mercury hasnt changed much geologically. Also, with very little atmosphere, the processes of weathering and erosion do not wear down structures on the planet. There are many images, movies and activities on the MESSENGER site: URL . 
Short  Year,  Long  Days 	  Mercury is named for the Roman messenger god, who could run extremely quickly, just as the planet moves very quickly in its orbit around the Sun. A year on Mercury the length of time it takes to orbit the Sun is just 88 Earth days. Despite its very short years, Mercury has very long days. A day is defined as the time it takes a planet to turn on its axis. Mercury rotates slowly on its axis, turning exactly three times for every two times it orbits the Sun. Therefore, each day on Mercury is 57 Earth days long. In other words, on Mercury, a year is only a Mercury day and a half long! 
Extreme  Temperatures 	  Mercury is close to the Sun, so it can get very hot. However, Mercury has virtually no atmosphere, no water to insulate the surface, and it rotates very slowly. For these reasons, temperatures on the surface of Mercury vary Mercury is covered with craters, like Earths moon. MESSENGER has taken extremely detailed pictures of the planets surface. widely. In direct sunlight, the surface can be as hot as 427C (801F). On the dark side, or in the shadows inside craters, the surface can be as cold as -183C (-297F)! Although most of Mercury is extremely dry, scientists think there may be a small amount of water in the form of ice at the poles of Mercury, in areas that never receive direct sunlight. 
A  Liquid  Metal  Core 	  Mercury contains a thin crust, a mantle, and a large, liquid core that is rich in iron. 
Venus 	  Named after the Roman goddess of love, Venus is the only planet named after a female. Venus thick clouds reflect sunlight well so Venus is very bright. When it is visible, Venus is the brightest object in the sky besides the Sun and the Moon. Because the orbit of Venus is inside Earths orbit, Venus always appears close to the Sun. When Venus rises just before the Sun rises, the bright object is called the morning star. When it sets just after the Sun sets, it is the evening star. Of the planets, Venus is most similar to Earth in size and density. Venus is also our nearest neighbor. The planets interior structure is similar to Earths with a large iron core and a silicate mantle ( Figure 25.18). But the resemblance between the two inner planets ends there. Find out more about Venus at the following link: URL . Venuss interior is similar to Earths. 
Motion 	  Venus rotates in a direction opposite the other planets and opposite to the direction it orbits the Sun. This rotation is extremely slow, only one turn every 243 days. This is longer than a year on Venusit takes Venus only 224 days to orbit the Sun. 
Extreme  Atmosphere 	  Venus is covered by a thick layer of clouds, as shown in pictures of Venus taken at ultraviolet wavelengths ( Figure 25.19). This ultraviolet image from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter shows thick layers of clouds in the atmosphere of Venus. Venus clouds are not made of water vapor like Earths clouds. Clouds on Venus are made mostly of carbon dioxide with a bit of sulfur dioxide and they also contain corrosive sulfuric acid. Because carbon dioxide is greenhouse gas, the atmosphere traps heat from the Sun and creates a powerful greenhouse effect. Even though Venus is further from the Sun than Mercury, the greenhouse effect makes Venus the hottest planet. Temperatures at the surface reach 465C (860F). Thats hot enough to melt lead. The atmosphere of Venus is full of acid, its pressure is crushing, and the enormous amount of carbon dioxide causes runaway greenhouse effect (4d): URL (2:05). The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the atmospheric pressure on the planets surface is 90 times greater than the atmospheric pressure on Earths surface. The dense atmosphere totally obscures the surface of Venus, even from spacecraft orbiting the planet. 
Venuss  Surface 	  Since spacecraft cannot see through the thick atmosphere, radar is used to map Venus surface. Many features found on the surface are similar to Earth and yet are very different. Figure 25.20 shows a topographical map of Venus produced by the Magellan probe using radar. This false color image of Venus was made from radar data collected by the Magellan probe between 1990 and 1994. What features can you identify? Orbiting spacecraft have used radar to reveal mountains, valleys, and canyons. Most of the surface has large areas of volcanoes surrounded by plains of lava. In fact, Venus has many more volcanoes than any other planet in the solar system and some of those volcanoes are very large. Most of the volcanoes are no longer active, but scientists have found evidence that there is some active volcanism ( Figure 25.21). Think about what you know about the geology of Earth and what produces volcanoes. What does the presence of volcanoes suggest about the geology of Venus? What evidence would you look for to find the causes of volcanism on Venus? This image of the Maat Mons volcano with lava beds in the foreground was generated by a computer from radar data. The reddish-orange color is close to what scientists think the color of sunlight would look like on the surface of Venus. Venus also has very few impact craters compared with Mercury and the Moon. What is the significance of this? Earth has fewer impact craters than Mercury and the Moon too. Is this for the same reason that Venus has fewer impact craters? Its difficult for scientists to figure out the geological history of Venus. The environment is too harsh for a rover to go there. It is even more difficult for students to figure out the geological history of a distant planet based on the information given here. Still we can piece together a few things. On Earth, volcanism is generated because the planets interior is hot. Much of the volcanic activity is caused by plate tectonic activity. But on Venus, there is no evidence of plate boundaries and volcanic features do not line up the way they do at plate boundaries. Because the density of impact craters can be used to determine how old a planets surface is, the small number of impact craters means that Venus surface is young. Scientists think that there is frequent, planet-wide resurfacing of Venus with volcanism taking place in many locations. The cause is heat that builds up below the surface that has no escape until finally it destroys the crust and results in volcanoes. 
Mars 	  Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, and the first planet beyond Earths orbit ( Figure 25.22). Mars is a quite different from Earth and yet more similar than any other planet. Mars is smaller, colder, drier, and appears to have no life, but volcanoes are common to both planets and Mars has many. Mars is easy to observe so Mars has been studied more thoroughly than any other extraterrestrial planet. Space probes, rovers, and orbiting satellites have all yielded information to planetary geologists. Although no humans have ever set foot on Mars, both NASA and the European Space Agency have set goals of sending people to Mars sometime between 2030 and 2040. Find out all you want to know about Mars at URL . This image of Mars, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in October, 2005, shows the planets red color, a small ice cap on the south pole, and a dust storm. 
A  Red  Planet 	  Viewed from Earth, Mars is reddish in color. The ancient Greeks and Romans named the planet after the god of war. But the surface is not red from blood but from large amounts of iron oxide in the soil. The Martian atmosphere is very thin relative to Earths and has much lower atmospheric pressure. Although the atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide, the planet has only a weak greenhouse effect so temperatures are only slightly higher than if the planet had no atmosphere. 
Surface  Features 	  Mars has mountains, canyons, and other features similar to Earth. Some of these surface features are amazing for their size! Olympus Mons is a shield volcano, similar to the volcanoes that make up the Hawaiian Islands. But Olympus Mons is also the largest mountain in the solar system ( Figure 25.23). Mars also has the largest canyon in the solar system, Valles Marineris ( Figure 25.24). Mars has more impact craters than Earth, though fewer than the Moon. A video comparing geologic features on Mars and Earth is seen here: Mars tectonics video URL onics.html Is There Water on Mars? Water cannot stay in liquid form on Mars because the atmospheric pressure is too low. However, there is a lot of water in the form of ice and even prominent ice caps ( Figure 25.25). Scientists also think that there is a lot of water Olympus Mons is about 27 km (16.7 miles/88,580 ft) above the Martian surface, more than three times taller than Mount Everest. The volcanos base is about the size of the state of Arizona. Valles Marineris is 4,000 km (2,500 mi) long, as long as Europe is wide, and one-fifth the circumference of Mars. The canyon is 7 km (4.3 mi) deep. By comparison, the Grand Canyon on Earth is only 446 km (277 mi) long and about 2 km (1.2 mi) deep. ice present just under the Martian surface. This ice can melt when volcanoes erupt, and water can flow across the surface temporarily. Scientists think that water once flowed over the Martian surface because there are surface features that look like water-eroded canyons ( Figure 25.26). The presence of water on Mars, even though it is now frozen as ice, suggests that it might have been possible for life to exist on Mars in the past. The Mars rover collected rounded clumps of crystals that, on Earth, are known to form in water. A video of the top five Phoenix Lander sites on Mars is seen here: URL -mars-phoenix-lander-images.html . 
Two  Martian  Moons 	  Mars has two very small moons that are irregular rocky bodies ( Figure 25.27). Phobos and Deimos are named after characters in Greek mythology the two sons of Ares, who followed their father into war. Ares is equivalent to the Roman god Mars. An animation of the moons orbiting Mars is seen here: URL and_Deimos.gif . 
D:  Searching for  Life on  Mars 	  The Mars Science Laboratory was launched on November 26, 2011 and will search for any evidence that the Red Planet was once capable of supporting life. Curiosity is a car-sized rover that is scouring the red planet for clues; it landed in August 2012. Learn more at: URL . Mars has two small moons, Phobos (left) and Deimos (right). Both were discovered in 1877 and are thought to be captured asteroids. 
Lesson  Summary 	  The four inner planets, or terrestrial planets, have solid, rocky surfaces. Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only planet with large amounts of liquid water, and the only planet known to support life. Earth has a large round moon. Mercury is the smallest planet and is the closest to the Sun. With its extremely thin atmosphere, Mercury has a large temperature range. Like the Moon, it is covered with craters. Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the closest planet to Earth, in distance and in size. With its thick, corrosive atmosphere, the surface temperature is extremely high. Venus has mountainous areas, as well as volcanoes surrounded by plains of lava. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is reddish in color and has the largest mountain and the largest canyon in the solar system. It has two small moons. Water ice is found in the polar ice caps and under the surface of Mars. The Jet Propulsion Lab home page has all the current and past missions with media and activities and great images: URL . 
A short video about  Mars: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v= M- Kf Ug2s 	  The first humans may reach Mars sometime in the next few decades. What conditions will they face? Why do you think we are going to Mars instead of Mercury or Venus? Why are the four inner planets called terrestrial planets? What might a planet be like if it werent a terrestrial planet? Describe key features of the outer planets and their moons. Compare the outer planets to each other and to Earth. 
Galilean moons 	  gas giants 
Great  Red  Spot 	  outer planets planetary rings 
Introduction 	  The four outer planets are farther from the Sun as well as farther from Earth. They are much more difficult to learn about since they are very different from our home planet. 
The  Outer  Planets 	  The four planets farthest from the Sun are the outer planets. Figure 25.28 shows the relative sizes of the outer planets and the Sun. These planets are much larger than the inner planets and are made primarily of gases and liquids, so they are also called gas giants. The gas giants are made up primarily of hydrogen and helium, the same elements that make up most of the Sun. Astronomers think that hydrogen and helium gases comprised much of the solar system when it first formed. Since the inner planets didnt have enough mass to hold on to these light gases, their hydrogen and helium floated away into space. The Sun and the massive outer planets had enough gravity to keep hydrogen and helium from drifting away. All of the outer planets have numerous moons. They all also have planetary rings, composed of dust and other small particles that encircle the planet in a thin plane. This image shows the four outer planets and the Sun, with sizes to scale. From left to right, the outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
Jupiter 	  Because Jupiter is so large, it reflects a lot of sunlight. Jupiter is extremely bright in the night sky; only the Moon and Venus are brighter ( Figure 25.29). This brightness is all the more impressive because Jupiter is quite far from the Earth 5.20 AUs away. It takes Jupiter about 12 Earth years to orbit once around the Sun. This image of Jupiter was taken by Voyager 2 in 1979. The colors were later enhanced to bring out more details. Jupiter is named for the king of the gods in Roman mythology. The planet is enormous, the largest object in the solar system besides the Sun. Although Jupiter is over 1,300 times Earths volume, it has only 318 times the mass of Earth. Like the other gas giants, it is much less dense than Earth. Check out NASAs world book to learn more about Jupiter: URL . 
A  Ball of  Gas and  Liquid 	  Astronauts trying to land a spaceship on the surface of Jupiter would find that there is no solid surface at all! Jupiter is made mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of other elements ( Figure 25.30). Jupiters atmosphere is composed of hydrogen and helium. Deeper within the planet, pressure compresses the gases into a liquid. Some evidence suggests that Jupiter may have a small rocky core of heavier elements at its center. 
A  Stormy  Atmosphere 	  The upper layer of Jupiters atmosphere contains clouds of ammonia (NH3) in bands of different colors. These bands rotate around the planet, but also swirl around in turbulent storms. The Great Red Spot ( Figure 25.31) is an enormous, oval-shaped storm found south of Jupiters equator. This storm is more than three times as wide as the entire Earth. Clouds in the storm rotate in a counterclockwise direction, making one complete turn every six days or so. The Great Red Spot has been on Jupiter for at least 300 years, since astronomers could first see the storm through telescopes. Do you think the Great Red Spot is a permanent feature on Jupiter? How could you know? 
This image of  Jupiters  Great  Red  Spot 	  (upper right of image) was taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft. The white storm just below the Great Red Spot is about the same diameter as Earth. 
Jupiters  Moons and  Rings 	  Jupiter has a very large number of moons  63 have been discovered so far. Four are big enough and bright enough to be seen from Earth, using no more than a pair of binoculars. These moons Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto were first discovered by Galileo in 1610, so they are sometimes referred to as the Galilean moons ( Figure 25.32). The Galilean moons are larger than the dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, and Eris. Ganymede is not only the biggest moon in the solar system it is even larger than the planet Mercury! This composite image shows the four Galilean moons and their sizes relative to the Great Red Spot. From top to bottom, the moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Jupiters Great Red Spot is in the background. Sizes are to scale. Scientists are particularly interested in Europa because it may be a place to find extraterrestrial life. What features might make a satellite so far from the Sun a candidate for life? Although the surface of Europa is a smooth layer of ice, there is evidence that there is an ocean of liquid water underneath ( Figure 25.33). Europa also has a continual source of energy it is heated as it is stretched and squashed by tidal forces from Jupiter. Numerous missions have been planned to explore Europa, including plans to drill through the ice and send a probe into the ocean. However, no such mission has yet been attempted. An enhanced color image of a portion of Europas icy surface. The surface ice may have motions similar to plate tectonics on Earth. In 1979, two spacecrafts Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 visited Jupiter and its moons. Photos from the Voyager missions showed that Jupiter has a ring system. This ring system is very faint, so it is difficult to observe from Earth. 
Saturn 	  Saturn, shown in Figure 25.34, is famous for its beautiful rings. Although all the gas giants have rings, only Saturns can be easily seen from Earth. In Roman mythology, Saturn was the father of Jupiter. Saturns mass is about 95 times the mass of Earth, and its volume is 755 times Earths volume, making it the second largest planet in the solar system. Saturn is also the least dense planet in the solar system. It is less dense than water. What would happen if you had a large enough bathtub to put Saturn in? Saturn would float! Saturn orbits the Sun once about every 30 Earth years. This image of Saturn and its rings is a composite of pictures taken by the Cassini orbiter in 2008 Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium gases in the outer layers and liquids at greater depths. The upper atmosphere has clouds in bands of different colors. These rotate rapidly around the planet, but there seems to be less turbulence and fewer storms on Saturn than on Jupiter. One interesting phenomena that has been observed in the storms on Saturn is the presence of thunder and lightning (see video, below). The planet likely has a small rocky and metallic core. Cassini scientists waited years for the right conditions to produce the first movie that shows lightning on another planet  Saturn. URL Lots more videos from the Cassini mission are indexed here: URL 
Saturns  Rings 	  In 1610 Galileo first observed Saturns rings with his telescope, but he thought they might be two large moons, one on either side of the planet. In 1659, the Dutch astronomer Christian Huygens realized that the features were rings ( Figure 25.35). Saturns rings circle the planets equator and appear tilted because Saturn itself is tilted about 27 degrees. The rings do not touch the planet. A color-exaggerated mosaic of Saturn and its rings taken by Cassini as Saturn eclipses the Sun. The Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft in 1980 and 1981 sent back detailed pictures of Saturn, its rings, and some of its moons. Saturns rings are made of particles of water and ice, with some dust and rocks ( Figure 25.36). There are several gaps in the rings that scientists think have originated because (1) the material was cleared out by the gravitational pull within the rings or (2) by the gravitational forces of Saturn and of moons outside the rings. The rings were likely formed by the breakup of one of Saturns moons or from material that never accreted into the planet when Saturn originally formed. An animation of dark spokes in Saturns rings is seen here: URL _PIA11144_300px_secs15.5to23_20080926.ogv . The spokes appear seasonally and their origin is as yet unknown. 
Saturns  Moons 	  Most of Saturns moons are very small and only seven are large enough for gravity to have made them spherical. Only Titan is larger than Earths Moon at about 1.5 times its size. Titan is even larger than the planet Mercury. Scientists are interested in Titan because its atmosphere is similar to what Earths was like before life developed. Nitrogen is dominant and methane is the second most abundant gas. Titan may have a layer of liquid water and ammonia under a layer of surface ice. Lakes of liquid methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) are found on Titans surface. Although conditions are similar enough to those of early Earth for scientists to speculate that extremely primitive life may exist on Titan, the extreme cold and lack of carbon dioxide make it unlikely ( Figure 25.37). This composite image compares Saturns largest moon, Titan (right) to Earth (left). 
Uranus 	  Uranus (YOOR-uh-nuhs) is named for the Greek god of the sky ( Figure 25.38). From Earth, Uranus is so faint that it was unnoticed by ancient observers. William Herschel first discovered the planet in 1781. Although Uranus is very large, it is extremely far away, about 2.8 billion km (1.8 billion mi) from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach Uranus. Uranus orbits the Sun once about every 84 Earth years. Uranus has a mass about 14 times the mass of Earth, but it is much less dense than Earth. Gravity at the surface of Uranus is weaker than on Earths surface so if you were at the top of the clouds on Uranus, you would weigh about 10% less than what you weigh on Earth. 
An  Icy  Blue- Green  Ball 	  Like Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with an outer gas layer that gives way to liquid on the inside. Uranus has a higher percentage of icy materials, such as water, ammonia (NH3), and methane (CH4), than Jupiter and Saturn. When sunlight reflects off Uranus, clouds of methane filter out red light, giving the planet a blue-green color. There are bands of clouds in the atmosphere of Uranus, but they are hard to see in normal light, so the planet looks like a plain blue ball. 
The  Sideways  Planet 	  Most of the planets in the solar system rotate on their axes in the same direction that they move around the Sun. Uranus, though, is tilted on its side so its axis is almost parallel to its orbit. In other words, it rotates like a top that was turned so that it was spinning parallel to the floor. Scientists think that Uranus was probably knocked over by a collision with another planet-sized object billions of years ago. 
Rings and  Moons of  Uranus 	  Uranus has a faint system of rings ( Figure 25.39). The rings circle the planets equator, but because Uranus is tilted on its side, the rings are almost perpendicular to the planets orbit. Uranus has 27 known moons and all but a few of them are named for characters from the plays of William Shakespeare. The five biggest moons of Uranus Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon are shown in Figure 25.40. This image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows the faint rings of Uranus. The planet is tilted on its side, so the rings are nearly vertical. These Voyager 2 photos have been resized to show the relative sizes of the five main moons of Uranus. 
Neptune 	  Neptune, shown in Figure 25.41, is the only major planet that cant be seen from Earth without a telescope. Scientists predicted the existence of Neptune before it was discovered because Uranus did not always appear exactly where it should appear. They knew that the gravitational pull of another planet beyond Uranus must be affecting Uranus orbit. Neptune was discovered in 1846, in the position that had been predicted, and it was named Neptune for the Roman god of the sea because of its bluish color. This image of Neptune was taken by Voyager 2 in 1989. The Great Dark Spot seen on the left center in the picture has since disappeared, but a similar dark spot has appeared on another part of the planet. In many respects, Neptune is similar to Uranus ( Figure 25.42). Neptune has slightly more mass than Uranus, but it is slightly smaller in size. Neptune is much farther from the Sun at nearly 4.5 billion km (2.8 billion mi). The planets slow orbit means that it takes 165 Earth years to go once around the Sun. Neptunes composition is that of a gas giant: (1) upper atmosphere, (2) atmosphere composed of hydrogen, helium and methane gas, (3) mantle of water, ammonia and methane ice, (4) core of rock and ice. 
Extremes of  Cold and  Wind 	  Neptunes blue color is mostly because of frozen methane (CH4). When Voyager 2 visited Neptune in 1986, there was a large dark-blue spot that scientists named the Great Dark Spot, south of the equator. When the Hubble Space Telescope took pictures of Neptune in 1994, the Great Dark Spot had disappeared but another dark spot had appeared north of the equator. Astronomers think that both of these spots represent gaps in the methane clouds on Neptune. The changing appearance of Neptune is caused by its turbulent atmosphere. The winds on Neptune are stronger than on any other planet in the solar system, reaching speeds of 1,100 km/h (700 mi/h), close to the speed of sound. This extreme weather surprised astronomers, since the planet receives little energy from the Sun to power weather systems. Neptune is also one of the coldest places in the solar system. Temperatures at the top of the clouds are about -218oC (-360oF). 
Neptunes  Rings and  Moons 	  Neptune has faint rings of ice and dust that may change or disappear in fairly short time frames. Neptune has 13 known moons. Triton, shown in Figure 25.43, is the only one of them that has enough mass to be spherical in shape. Triton orbits in the direction opposite to the orbit of Neptune. Scientists think Triton did not form around Neptune, but instead was captured by Neptunes gravity as it passed by.

Lesson  Summary 	  The four outer planets are all gas giants made primarily of hydrogen and helium. They have thick gaseous outer layers and liquid interiors. The outer planets have numerous moons, as well as planetary rings. Jupiter, by far the largest planet in the solar system, has bands of different colored clouds, and a long-lasting storm called the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has more than 60 moons including the four largest, the Galilean moons. Europa has an ocean of liquid water under a layer of ice where life may have formed. Saturn is smaller than Jupiter but has a large system of beautiful rings. Titans atmosphere is similar to early Earths and the moon could harbor primitive life. Uranus and Neptune were discovered relatively recently since they are so far away. Uranus is tilted on its side, probably because of a past collision with a large object. Neptune is very cold and has strong winds. Its dark spots are storms in Neptunes atmosphere.

From the  C  Documentary,  The  Planets,  Neptune: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29wfzota Ig 	  The inner planets are small and rocky, while the outer planets are large and gaseous. Why might the planets have formed into these two groups? We have discussed the Sun, the planets, and the moons of the planets. What other objects can you think of that can be found in our solar system? Locate and describe the asteroid belt. Explain where comets come from and what causes their tails. Differentiate between meteors, meteoroids, and meteorites. asteroid asteroid belt comet dwarf planet 
Kuiper belt 	  meteor meteor shower meteoroid 
Introduction 	  When the solar system formed, most of the matter ended up in the Sun. Material spinning in a disk around the Sun clumped together into larger and larger pieces to form the eight planets. But some of the smaller pieces of matter never joined one of these larger bodies and are still out there in space. 
Asteroids 	  Asteroids are very small, rocky bodies that orbit the Sun. "Asteroid" means "star-like," and in a telescope, asteroids look like points of light, just like stars. Asteroids are irregularly shaped because they do not have enough gravity to become round. They are also too small to maintain an atmosphere and without internal heat they are not geologically active ( Figure 25.44). Collisions with other bodies may break up the asteroid or create craters on its surface. Asteroid impacts have had dramatic impacts on the shaping of the planets, including Earth. Early impacts caused the planets to grow as they cleared their portions of space. An impact with an asteroid about the size of Mars caused fragments of Earth to fly into space and ultimately create the Moon. Asteroid impacts are linked to mass extinctions throughout Earth history. In 1991, Asteroid 951 Gaspra was the first asteroid photographed at close range. Gaspra is a medium-sized asteroid, measuring about 19 by 12 by 11 km (12 by 7.5 by 7 mi). 
The  Asteroid  Belt 	  Hundreds of thousands of asteroids have been discovered in our solar system. They are still being discovered at a rate of about 5,000 new asteroids per month. The majority of the asteroids are found in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, in a region called the asteroid belt, as shown in Figure 25.45. Although there are many thousands of asteroids in the asteroid belt, their total mass adds up to only about 4% of Earths moon. Scientists think that the bodies in the asteroid belt formed during the formation of the solar system. The asteroids might have come together to make a single planet, but they were pulled apart by the intense gravity of Jupiter. 
Near- Earth  Asteroids 	  More than 4,500 asteroids cross Earths orbit; they are near-Earth asteroids. Between 500 and 1,000 of these are over 1 km in diameter. Any object whose orbit crosses Earths can collide with Earth and many asteroids do. On average, each year a rock about 510 m in diameter hits Earth ( Figure 25.46). Since past asteroid impacts have been implicated in mass extinctions, astronomers are always on the lookout for new asteroids, and follow the known near-Earth asteroids closely, so they can predict a possible collision as early as possible. 
Asteroid  Missions 	  Scientists are interested in asteroids because they are representatives of the earliest solar system ( Figure 25.47). Eventually asteroids could be mined for rare minerals or for construction projects in space. A few missions have studied asteroids directly. NASAs DAWN mission orbited asteroid Vesta from July 2011 to September 2012 and is on its way to meet dwarf planet Ceres in 2015. The white dots in the figure are asteroids in the main asteroid belt. Other groups of asteroids closer to Jupiter are called the Hildas (orange), the Trojans (green), and the Greeks (also green). A painting of what an asteroid a few kilometers across might look like as it strikes Earth. 
D:  Asteroid  Hunters 	  Thousands of objects, including comets and asteroids, are zooming around our solar system; some could be on a collision course with Earth. QUEST explores how these Near Earth Objects are being tracked and what scientists are saying should be done to prevent a deadly impact. Learn more at: URL -hunters/ . The NEAR Shoemaker probe took this photo as it was about to land on 433 Eros in 2001. 
Meteors 	  A meteor, such as in Figure 25.48, is a streak of light across the sky. People call them shooting stars but they are actually small pieces of matter burning up as they enter Earths atmosphere from space. Meteors are called meteoroids before they reach Earths atmosphere. Meteoroids are smaller than asteroids and range from the size of boulders down to the size of tiny sand grains. Still smaller objects are called interplanetary dust. When Earth passes through a cluster of meteoroids, there is a meteor shower. These clusters are often remnants left behind by comet tails. 
Meteorites 	  Although most meteors burn up in the atmosphere, larger meteoroids may strike the Earths surface to create a meteorite. Meteorites are valuable to scientists because they provide clues about our solar system. Many meteorites are from asteroids that formed when the solar system formed ( Figure 25.49). A few meteorites are made of rocky material that is thought to have come from Mars when an asteroid impact shot material off the Martian surface and into space. A meteor streaks across the sky. 
Comets 	  Comets are small, icy objects that have very elliptical orbits around the Sun. Their orbits carry them from the outer solar system to the inner solar system, close to the Sun ( Figure 25.50). Early in Earths history, comets may have brought water and other substances to Earth during collisions. Comet tails form the outer layers of ice melt and evaporate as the comet flies close to the Sun. The ice from the comet vaporizes and forms a glowing coma, which reflects light from the Sun. Radiation and particles streaming from the Sun push this gas and dust into a long tail that always points away from the Sun ( Figure 25.51). Comets 
The	highly	elliptical	orbit	of	 Kohoutek 	  (red) relative to Earths more circular orbit (blue) and the position of the Sun. appear for only a short time when they are near the Sun, then seem to disappear again as they move back to the outer solar system. Comet Hale-Bopp, also called the Great Comet of 1997, shone brightly for several months in 1997. The comet has two visible tails: a bright, curved dust tail and a fainter, straight tail of ions (charged atoms) pointing directly away from the Sun. The time between one appearance of a comet and the next is called the comets period. Halleys comet, with a period of 75 years, will next be seen in 2061. The first mention of the comet in historical records may go back as much as two millennia. 
Where  Comets  Come  From 	  Short-period comets, with periods of about 200 years or less, come from a region beyond the orbit of Neptune. The Kuiper belt (pronounced KI-per) contains not only comets, but asteroids, and at least two dwarf planets. Comets with periods as long as thousands or even millions of years come from a very distant region of the solar system called the Oort cloud, about 50,000100,000 AU from the Sun (50,000100,000 times the distance from the Sun to Earth). 
Dwarf  Planets 	  The dwarf planets of our solar system are exciting proof of how much we are learning about our solar system. With the discovery of many new objects in our solar system, in 2006, astronomers refined the definition of a planet. Their subsequent reclassification of Pluto to the new category dwarf planet stirred up a great deal of controversy. How the classification of Pluto has evolved is an interesting story in science. The question is: What is and is not a planet? 
Pluto 	  From the time it was discovered in 1930 until the early 2000s Pluto was considered the ninth planet. When astronomers first located Pluto, the telescopes were not as good so Pluto and its moon, Charon, were seen as one much larger object ( Figure 25.52). With better telescopes, astronomers realized that Pluto was much smaller than they had thought. Pluto and its moon Charon are actually two objects. Better technology also allowed astronomers to discover many smaller objects like Pluto that orbit the Sun. One of them, Eris, discovered in 2005, is even larger than Pluto ( Figure 25.53). Even when it was considered a planet, Pluto was an oddball. Unlike the other outer planets in the solar system, which are all gas giants, it is small, icy, and rocky. With a diameter of about 2,400 km, it is only about one-fifth the mass of Earths Moon. Plutos orbit is tilted relative to the other planets and is shaped like a long, narrow ellipse. Plutos orbit sometimes even passes inside Neptunes orbit. In 1992 Plutos orbit was recognized to be part of the Kuiper belt. With more than 200 million Kuiper belt objects, Pluto has failed the test of clearing other bodies out its orbit. From what youve read above, do you think Pluto should be called a planet? Why are people hesitant to take away Plutos planetary status? In 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided that there were too many questions surrounding what could be called a planet and so refined the definition of a planet. According to the new definition, a planet must: Orbit a star. Be big enough that its own gravity causes it to be shaped as a sphere. Be small enough that it isnt a star itself. Have cleared the area of its orbit of smaller objects. A dwarf planet is an object that meets items the first three items in the list above, but not but not the fourth. Pluto is now called a dwarf planet, along with the objects Ceres, Makemake, and Eris. According to the IAU, a dwarf planet must: Orbit a star. Have enough mass to be nearly spherical. Not have cleared the area around its orbit of smaller objects. Not be a moon. A video showing why Pluto isnt a planet any more: URL . Pluto has three moons of its own. The largest, Charon, is big enough that the Pluto-Charon system is sometimes considered to be a double dwarf planet ( Figure 25.55). Two smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, were discovered in 2005. But having moons is not enough to make an object a planet. 
Ceres 	  Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt ( Figure 25.54). Before 2006, Ceres was considered the largest of the asteroids, with only about 1.3% of the mass of the Earths Moon. But unlike the asteroids, Ceres has enough mass that its gravity causes it to be shaped like a sphere. Like Pluto, Ceres is rocky. Is Ceres a planet? How does it match the criteria above? Ceres orbits the Sun, is round, and is not a moon. As part of the asteroid belt, its orbit is full of other smaller bodies, so Ceres fails the fourth criterion for being a planet. This composite image compares the size of the dwarf planet Ceres to Earth and the Moon. 
Makemake 	  Makemake is the third largest and second brightest dwarf planet we have discovered so far ( Figure 25.55). With a diameter estimated to be between 1,300 and 1,900 km, it is about three-quarters the size of Pluto. Makemake orbits the Sun in 310 years at a distance between 38.5 to 53 AU. It is thought to be made of methane, ethane, and nitrogen ices. 
Eris 	  Eris is the largest known dwarf planet in the solar system about 27% more massive than Pluto. The object was not discovered until 2003 because it is about three times farther from the Sun than Pluto, and almost 100 times farther from the Sun than Earth is. For a short time Eris was considered the tenth planet in the solar system, but its discovery helped to prompt astronomers to better define planets and dwarf planets in 2006. Eris also has a small moon, Dysnomia that orbits it once about every 16 days. Astronomers know there may be other dwarf planets in the outer reaches of the solar system. Haumea was made a dwarf planet in 2008 and so now the total is five. Quaoar, Varuna and Orcus may be added to the list of dwarf planets in the future. We still have a lot to discover and explore. Largest Known Trans-Neptunian Objects. Makemake is named after the deity that created humanity in the mythology of the people of Easter Island. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Asteroids are irregularly shaped, rocky bodies that orbit the Sun. Most are found in the asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Meteoroids are smaller than asteroids, ranging from the size of boulders to the size of sand grains. When meteoroids enter Earths atmosphere, they vaporize, creating a trail of glowing gas called a meteor. If any of the meteoroid reaches Earth, it is a meteorite. Comets are small, icy objects that have very elliptical orbits. When they are close to the Sun, they form comas and tails, which glow and make the comet more visible. Short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, beyond Neptune. Long-period comets come from the very distant Oort cloud. Dwarf planets are spherical bodies that orbit the Sun, but that have not cleared their orbit of smaller bodies. Ceres is a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt. Pluto, Makemake and Eris are dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt. 
A worldbook on asteroids: http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/asteroid_worldbook.html 	  In 2006, astronomers changed the definition of a planet and created a new category of dwarf planets. Do you think planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and meteoroids are clearly separate groups? What defines each of these groups, and what do objects in these different groups have in common? Could an object change from being in one group to another? How? We have learned about many different kinds of objects that are found within our solar system. What objects or systems of objects can you think of that are found outside our solar system?

Chapter  Outline 	  The Whirlpool Galaxy, also known as M51, is a spiral galaxy about 23 million light-years from Earth. Its interactions with the yellowish dwarf galaxy NGC 5195 are of interest to astronomers because the galaxies are near enough to Earth to be well-studied. Decades ago astronomers could not tell if these two galaxies were just passing each other but radio astronomy has supplied astronomers with important data outlining their interactions. Using this data, astronomers have simulated the interaction. NGC 5195 came from behind and then passed through the main disk of M51 about 500 to 600 million years ago. The dwarf galaxy crossed the disk again between 50 and 100 million years ago and is now slightly behind M51. These interactions appear to have intensified the spiral arms that are the dominant characteristic of the Whirlpool Galaxy. Astronomers are able to learn about objects unimaginably far away from Earth using telescopes that sense all wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum. Imagine what Galileo would do if he could see the images and data astronomers have available to them now.

Introduction 	  When you look at the sky on a clear night, you can see dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of tiny points of light. Almost every one of these points of light is a star, a giant ball of glowing gas at a very, very high temperature. Stars differ in size, temperature, and age, but they all appear to be made up of the same elements and to behave according to the same principles 
Constellations 	  People of many different cultures, including the Greeks, identified patterns of stars in the sky. We call these patterns constellations. Figure 26.1 shows one of the most easily recognized constellations. Why do the patterns in constellations and in groups or clusters of stars, called asterisms, stay the same night after night? Although the stars move across the sky, they stay in the same patterns. This is because the apparent nightly motion of the stars is actually caused by the rotation of Earth on its axis. The patterns also shift in the sky with the seasons as Earth revolves around the Sun. As a result, people in a particular location can see different constellations The ancient Greeks thought this group of stars looked like a hunter, so they named it Orion after their mythical hunter. The line of three stars at the center is "Orions Belt". in the winter than in the summer. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere Orion is a prominent constellation in the winter sky, but not in the summer sky. This is the annual traverse of the constellations. 
Apparent  Versus  Real  Distances 	  Although the stars in a constellation appear close together as we see them in our night sky, they are not at all close together out in space. In the constellation Orion, the stars visible to the naked eye are at distances ranging from just 26 light-years (which is relatively close to Earth) to several thousand light-years away. 
Star  Power 	  The Sun is Earths major source of energy, yet the planet only receives a small portion of its energy and the Sun is just an ordinary star. Many stars produce much more energy than the Sun. The energy source for all stars is nuclear fusion. 
Nuclear  Fusion 	  Stars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, which are packed so densely in a star that in the stars center the pressure is great enough to initiate nuclear fusion reactions. In a nuclear fusion reaction, the nuclei of two atoms combine to create a new atom. Most commonly, in the core of a star, two hydrogen atoms fuse to become a helium atom. Although nuclear fusion reactions require a lot of energy to get started, once they are going they produce enormous amounts of energy ( Figure 26.2). In a star, the energy from fusion reactions in the core pushes outward to balance the inward pull of gravity. This energy moves outward through the layers of the star until it finally reaches the stars outer surface. The outer layer of the star glows brightly, sending the energy out into space as electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, heat, ultraviolet light, and radio waves ( Figure 26.3). In particle accelerators, subatomic particles are propelled until they have attained almost the same amount of energy as found in the core of a star ( Figure 26.4). When these particles collide head-on, new particles are created. This process simulates the nuclear fusion that takes place in the cores of stars. The process also simulates the conditions A thermonuclear bomb is an uncontrolled fusion reaction in which enormous amounts of energy are released. A diagram of a star like the Sun. that allowed for the first helium atom to be produced from the collision of two hydrogen atoms in the first few minutes of the universe.

How  Stars  Are  Classified 	  The many different colors of stars reflect the stars temperature. In Orion (as shown in the Figure 26.1) the bright, red star in the upper left named Betelgeuse (pronounced BET-ul-juice) is not as hot than the blue star in the lower right named Rigel. 
Color and  Temperature 	  Think about how the color of a piece of metal changes with temperature. A coil of an electric stove will start out black but with added heat will start to glow a dull red. With more heat the coil turns a brighter red, then orange. At extremely high temperatures the coil will turn yellow-white, or even blue-white (its hard to imagine a stove coil getting that hot). A stars color is also determined by the temperature of the stars surface. Relatively cool stars are red, warmer stars are orange or yellow, and extremely hot stars are blue or blue-white ( Figure 26.5). 
Classifying  Stars by  Color 	  Color is the most common way to classify stars. Table 26.1 shows the classification system. The class of a star is given by a letter. Each letter corresponds to a color, and also to a range of temperatures. Note that these letters dont match the color names; they are left over from an older system that is no longer used. 
Epsilon  Indi 	  TABLE 26.1: (continued) 
Red 	  Betelgeuse, Proxima Centauri A Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows the brightness and color of main sequence stars. The brightness is indicated by luminosity and is higher up the yaxis. The temperature is given in degrees Kelvin and is higher on the left side of the x-axis. How does our Sun fare in terms of brightness and color compared with other stars? For most stars, surface temperature is also related to size. Bigger stars produce more energy, so their surfaces are hotter. These stars tend toward bluish white. Smaller stars produce less energy. Their surfaces are less hot and so they tend to be yellowish. 
Lifetime of  Stars 	  Stars have a life cycle that is expressed similarly to the life cycle of a living creature: they are born, grow, change over time, and eventually die. Most stars change in size, color, and class at least once in their lifetime. What astronomers know about the life cycles of stars is because of data gathered from visual, radio, and X-ray telescopes. 
Star  Formation 	  As discussed in the Solar System chapter, stars are born in clouds of gas and dust called nebulas, like the one shown in Figure 26.6. For more on star formation, check out URL and URL urricanes.nasa.gov/universe/science/stars.html . 
The  Main  Sequence 	  For most of a stars life, nuclear fusion in the core produces helium from hydrogen. A star in this stage is a main sequence star. This term comes from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shown in the Figure 26.5. For stars on the main sequence, temperature is directly related to brightness. A star is on the main sequence as long as it is able to balance the inward force of gravity with the outward force of nuclear fusion in its core. The more massive a star, the more it must burn hydrogen fuel to prevent gravitational collapse. Because they burn more fuel, more massive stars have higher temperatures. Massive stars also run out of hydrogen sooner than smaller stars do. Our Sun has been a main sequence star for about 5 billion years and will continue on the main sequence for about 5 billion more years ( Figure 26.7). Very large stars may be on the main sequence for only 10 million years. Very small stars may last tens to hundreds of billions of years. The Pillars of Creation within the Eagle Nebula are where gas and dust come together as a stellar nursery. Our Sun is a medium-sized star in about the middle of its main sequence life. The fate of the Sun and inner planets is explored in this video: URL hp?videoRef=mm32_SunDeath . 
Red  Giants and  White  Dwarfs 	  As a star begins to use up its hydrogen, it fuses helium atoms together into heavier atoms such as carbon. A blue giant star has exhausted its hydrogen fuel and is a transitional phase. When the light elements are mostly used up the star can no longer resist gravity and it starts to collapse inward. The outer layers of the star grow outward and cool. The larger, cooler star turns red in color and so is called a red giant. Eventually, a red giant burns up all of the helium in its core. What happens next depends on how massive the star is. A typical star, such as the Sun, stops fusion completely. Gravitational collapse shrinks the stars core to a white, glowing object about the size of Earth, called a white dwarf ( Figure 26.8). A white dwarf will ultimately fade out. Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is actually a binary star system. Sirius A is on the main sequence. Sirius B, the tiny dot on the lower left, is a white dwarf. 
Supergiants and  Supernovas 	  A star that runs out of helium will end its life much more dramatically. When very massive stars leave the main sequence, they become red supergiants ( Figure 26.9). Unlike a red giant, when all the helium in a red supergiant is gone, fusion continues. Lighter atoms fuse into heavier atoms up to iron atoms. Creating elements heavier than iron through fusion uses more energy than it produces so stars do not ordinarily form any heavier elements. When there are no more elements for the star to fuse, the core succumbs to gravity and collapses, creating a violent explosion called a supernova ( Figure 26.10). A supernova explosion contains so much energy that atoms can fuse together to produce heavier elements such as gold, silver, and uranium. A supernova can shine as brightly as an entire galaxy for a short time. All elements with an atomic number greater than that of lithium were formed by nuclear fusion in stars. An animation of the Crab Supernova is seen here: URL . This video looks at the origin of the universe, star formation, and the formation of the chemical elements in supernovas (2c): URL (8:30). (a) NASAs Chandra X-ray observatory captured the brightest stellar explosion so far, 100 times more energetic than a typical supernova. (b) This false-color image of the supernova remnant SN 1604 was observed as a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy. At its peak it was brighter than all other stars and planets, except Venus, in the night sky. 
Neutron  Stars and  Black  Holes 	  After a supernova explosion, the leftover material in the core is extremely dense. If the core is less than about four times the mass of the Sun, the star becomes a neutron star ( Figure 26.11). A neutron star is made almost entirely of neutrons, relatively large particles that have no electrical charge. If the core remaining after a supernova is more than about five times the mass of the Sun, the core collapses into a black hole. Black holes are so dense that not even light can escape their gravity. With no light, a black hole cannot be observed directly. But a black hole can be identified by the effect that it has on objects around it, and by radiation that leaks out around its edges. How to make a black hole: URL erTop . A video about black holes is seen on Space.com: URL Ref=black_holes . A Stars Life Cycle video from Discovery Channel describes how stars are born, age and die (2f): URL be.com/watch?v=H8Jz6FU5D1A (3:11). After a supernova, the remaining core may end up as a neutron star. A neutron star is more massive than the Sun, but only a few kilometers in diameter. A video of neutron stars is available at: URL (4:24). 
Measuring  Star  Distances 	  How can you measure the distance of an object that is too far away to measure? Now what if you dont know the size of the object or the size or distance of any other objects like it? That would be very difficult, but that is the problem facing astronomers when they try to measure the distances to stars. 
Parallax 	  Distances to stars that are relatively close to us can be measured using parallax. Parallax is an apparent shift in position that takes place when the position of the observer changes. To see an example of parallax, try holding your finger about 1 foot (30 cm) in front of your eyes. Now, while focusing on your finger, close one eye and then the other. Alternate back and forth between eyes, and pay attention to how your finger appears to move. The shift in position of your finger is an example of parallax. Now try moving your finger closer to your eyes, and repeat the experiment. Do you notice any difference? The closer your finger is to your eyes, the greater the position changes because of parallax. As Figure 26.12 shows, astronomers use this same principle to measure the distance to stars. Instead of a finger, they focus on a star, and instead of switching back and forth between eyes, they switch between the biggest possible differences in observing position. To do this, an astronomer first looks at the star from one position and notes where the star is relative to more distant stars. Now where will the astronomer go to make an observation the greatest possible distance from the first observation? In six months, after Earth moves from one side of its orbit around the Sun to the other side, the astronomer looks at the star again. This time parallax causes the star to appear in a different position relative to more distant stars. From the size of this shift, astronomers can calculate the distance to the star. For more about parallax, visit URL . A parallax exercise is seen here: URL . 
Other  Methods 	  Even with the most precise instruments available, parallax is too small to measure the distance to stars that are more than a few hundred light years away. For these more distant stars, astronomers must use more indirect methods of determining distance. Most of these methods involve determining how bright the star they are looking at really is. For example, if the star has properties similar to the Sun, then it should be about as bright as the Sun. The astronomer compares the observed brightness to the expected brightness. 
Lesson  Summary 	  Constellations and asterisms are apparent patterns of stars in the sky. Stars in the same constellation are often not close to each other in space. A star generates energy by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The color of a star is determined by its surface temperature. Stars are classified by color and temperature: O (blue), B (bluish white), A (white), F (yellowish white), G (yellow), K (orange), and M (red), from hottest to coolest. Stars form from nebulas. Gravity causes stars to collapse until nuclear fusion begins. Stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence, fusing hydrogen into helium. Typical, Sun-like stars expand into red giants, then fade out as white dwarfs. Very large stars expand into red supergiants, explode in supernovas, and end up as neutron stars or black holes. Parallax is an apparent shift in an objects position when the position of the observer changes. Astronomers use parallax to measure the distance to relatively nearby stars. 
A, parts of a star: http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/stars.html 	  Although stars may appear to be close together in constellations, they are usually not close together out in space. Can you think of any groups of astronomical objects that are relatively close together in space? Most nebulas contain more mass than a single star. If a large nebula collapsed into several different stars, what would the result be like? Distinguish between star systems and star clusters. Identify different types of galaxies. Describe our own galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy. binary star dwarf galaxy elliptical galaxy galaxy globular cluster irregular galaxy

Introduction 	  Where do you live? Sure you live in a house or apartment, on a street, in a town or city, in a state or province, and in a country. You may not think to mention that you live on planet Earth in the solar system (as if there is no other), which is in the Milky Way Galaxy. Our galaxy is just one of many billions of galaxies in the universe. These galaxies are incomprehensible distances from each other and from Earth. 
Star  Systems and  Star  Clusters 	  Although constellations have stars that usually only appear to be close together, stars may be found in the same portion of space. Stars that are grouped closely together are called star systems. Larger groups of hundreds or thousands of stars are called star clusters. 
Star  Systems 	  Although the star humans know best is a single star, many starsin fact, more than half of the bright stars in our galaxyare star systems. A system of two stars orbiting each other is a binary star. A system with more than two stars orbiting each other is a multiple star system. The stars in a binary or multiple star system are often so close together that they appear as one and only through a telescope can the pair be distinguished. An animation of a solar system like ours but with two suns was created by NASA: URL ideo-audio/852-ssc2007-05v1-Two-Suns-Raise-Family-of-Planetary-Bodies- 
Star  Clusters 	  Star clusters are divided into two main types, open clusters and globular clusters. Open clusters are groups of up to a few thousand stars that are loosely held together by gravity. The Pleiades, shown in Figure 26.13, is an open cluster that is also called the Seven Sisters. In the Pleiades, seven stars can be seen without a telescope, but the cluster has close to a thousand stars. Open clusters tend to be blue in color and often contain glowing gas and dust. Why do you think that open clusters have these features? Open clusters are made of young stars that formed from the same nebula. The stars may eventually be pulled apart by gravitational attraction to other objects. Globular clusters are groups of tens to hundreds of thousands of stars held tightly together by gravity. Figure 26.14 shows an example of a globular cluster. Globular clusters have a definite, spherical shape and contain mostly reddish stars. The stars are closer together, closer to the center of the cluster. Globular clusters dont have much dust in them the dust has already formed into stars. Check out URL and URL for more information about star clusters. 
Types of  Galaxies 	  Galaxies are the biggest groups of stars and can contain anywhere from a few million stars to many billions of stars. Every star that is visible in the night sky is part of the Milky Way Galaxy. To the naked eye the closest major galaxy M80 is a large globular cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars. Note that the cluster is spherical and contains mostly red stars. the Andromeda Galaxy, shown in Figure 26.15 looks like only a dim, fuzzy spot. But that fuzzy spot contains one trillion stars  1,000,000,000,000 stars! The Andromeda Galaxy is a large spiral galaxy similar to the Milky Way. Galaxies are divided into three types according to shape: spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies. 
Spiral  Galaxies 	  Spiral galaxies spin, so they appear as a rotating disk of stars and dust, with a bulge in the middle, like the Sombrero Galaxy shown in Figure 26.16. Several arms spiral outward in the Pinwheel Galaxy (seen in Figure 26.16) and are appropriately called spiral arms. Spiral galaxies have lots of gas and dust and lots of young stars. (a) The Sombrero Galaxy is a spiral galaxy that we see from the side so the disk and central bulge are visible. (b) The Pinwheel Galaxy is a spiral galaxy that we see face-on so we can see the spiral arms. Because they contain lots of young stars, spiral arms tend to be blue. 
Elliptical  Galaxies 	  Most elliptical galaxies contain very little gas and dust because the gas and dust has already formed into stars. However, some elliptical galaxies, such as the one shown in Figure 26.18, contain lots of dust. Why might some elliptical galaxies contain dust? 
Irregular  Galaxies and  Dwarf  Galaxies 	  Is the galaxy in Figure 26.19 a spiral galaxy or an elliptical galaxy? It is neither one! Galaxies that are not clearly elliptical galaxies or spiral galaxies are irregular galaxies. How might an irregular galaxy form? Most irregular galaxies were once spiral or elliptical galaxies that were then deformed either by gravitational attraction to a larger galaxy or by a collision with another galaxy. Dwarf galaxies are small galaxies containing only a few million to a few billion stars. Dwarf galaxies are the most common type in the universe. However, because they are relatively small and dim, we dont see as many dwarf galaxies from Earth. Most dwarf galaxies are irregular in shape. However, there are also dwarf elliptical galaxies and dwarf spiral galaxies. The large, reddish-yellow object in the middle of this figure is a typical elliptical galaxy. What other types of galaxies can you find in the figure? Astronomers believe that these dusty elliptical galaxies form when two galaxies of similar size collide. This galaxy, called NGC 1427A, has neither a spiral nor an elliptical shape. Look back at the picture of the elliptical galaxy. In the figure, you can see two dwarf elliptical galaxies that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy. One is a bright sphere to the left of center, and the other is a long ellipse below and to the right of center. Dwarf galaxies are often found near larger galaxies. They sometimes collide with and merge into their larger neighbors. Images from the Hubble Space Telescope are seen in this video: URL er.php?videoRef=black_holes#playerTop . 
The  Milky  Way  Galaxy 	  On a dark, clear night, you will see a milky band of light stretching across the sky, as in Figure 26.20 . This band is the disk of a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy, which is our galaxy. The Milky Way is made of millions of stars along with a lot of gas and dust. 
Shape and  Size 	  Although it is difficult to know what the shape of the Milky Way Galaxy is because we are inside of it, astronomers have identified it as a typical spiral galaxy containing about 100 billion to 400 billion stars ( Figure 26.21). Like other spiral galaxies, our galaxy has a disk, a central bulge, and spiral arms. The disk is about 100,000 lightyears across and 3,000 light-years thick. Most of the Galaxys gas, dust, young stars, and open clusters are in the disk. What evidence do astronomers find that lets them know that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy? The Milky Way Galaxy looks different than other galaxies because we are looking along the main disk from within the galaxy. An artists rendition of what astronomers think the Milky Way Galaxy would look like seen from above. The Sun is located approximately where the arrow points. An infrared image of the Milky Way shows the long thin line of stars and the central bulge typical of spiral galaxies. The central bulge is about 12,000 to 16,000 light-years wide and 6,000 to 10,000 light-years thick. The central bulge contains mostly older stars and globular clusters. Some recent evidence suggests the bulge might not be spherical, but is instead shaped like a bar. The bar might be as long as 27,000 light-years long. The disk and bulge are surrounded by a faint, spherical halo, which also contains old stars and globular clusters. Astronomers have discovered that there is a gigantic black hole at the center of the galaxy. The Milky Way Galaxy is a big place. If our solar system were the size of your fist, the Galaxys disk would still be wider than the entire United States! A video closeup of the Milky Way Galaxy is seen here: URL ideoRef=black_holes#playerTopjjj . 
Where  We  Are 	  Our solar system, including the Sun, Earth, and all the other planets, is within one of the spiral arms in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy. Most of the stars we see in the sky are relatively nearby stars that are also in this spiral arm. We are about 26,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy, a little more than halfway out from the center of the galaxy to the edge. Just as Earth orbits the Sun, the Sun and solar system orbit the center of the Galaxy. One orbit of the solar system takes about 225 to 250 million years. The solar system has orbited 20 to 25 times since it formed 4.6 billion years ago. Astronomers have recently discovered that at the center of the Milky Way, and most other galaxies, is a supermassive black hole, although a black hole cannot be seen. This video describes the solar system in which we live. It is located in an outer edge of the Milky Way galaxy, which spans 100,000 light years (2a): URL (5:10). The Universe contains many billions of stars and there are many billions of galaxies. Our home, the Milky Way galaxy, is only one (2a, 2b): URL (5:59). 
Lesson  Summary 	  Many stars are in systems of two or more stars. Open clusters are groups of young stars loosely held together by gravity. Globular clusters are spherical groups of old stars held tightly together by gravity. Galaxies are collections of millions to many billions of stars. Spiral galaxies have a rotating disk of stars and dust, a bulge in the middle, and several arms spiraling out from the center. The disk and arms contain many young, blue stars. Typical elliptical galaxies are egg-shaped, reddish, and contain mostly old stars. Galaxies that are not elliptical or spiral galaxies are called irregular galaxies. These galaxies were probably deformed by other galaxies. The Milky Way Galaxy is a typical spiral galaxy. Our solar system is in a spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, a little more than halfway from the center to the edge of the disk. 
More about galaxies: http://stardate.org/resources/btss/galaxies/ 	  Objects in the universe tend to be grouped together. What forces or factors do you think cause objects to form and stay in groups? Some people used to call galaxies island universes. Are they really universes? Can you think of anything, either an object or a group of objects, that is bigger than a galaxy? Explain the evidence for an expanding universe. Describe the formation of the universe according to the Big Bang Theory. Define dark matter and dark energy.

Introduction 	  The study of the universe is called cosmology. Cosmologists study the structure and changes in the present universe. The universe contains all of the star systems, galaxies, gas and dust, plus all the matter and energy that exists now, that existed in the past, and that will exist in the future. The universe includes all of space and time. 
Evolution of  Human  Understanding of the  Universe 	  What did the ancient Greeks recognize as the universe? In their model, the universe contained Earth at the center, the Sun, the Moon, five planets, and a sphere to which all the stars were attached. This idea held for many centuries until Galileos telescope helped allow people to recognize that Earth is not the center of the universe. They also found out that there are many more stars than were visible to the naked eye. All of those stars were in the Milky Way Galaxy. In the early 20th century, an astronomer named Edwin Hubble Figure 26.23 discovered that what scientists called the Andromeda Nebula was actually over 2 million light years away many times farther than the farthest distances that had ever been measured. Hubble realized that many of the objects that astronomers called nebulas were not actually clouds of gas, but were collections of millions or billions of stars what we now call galaxies. Hubble showed that the universe was much larger than our own galaxy. Today, we know that the universe contains about a hundred billion galaxiesabout the same number of galaxies as there are stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. (a) Edwin Hubble used the 100-inch reflecting telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California to show that some distant specks of light were galaxies. (b) Hubbles namesake space telescope spotted this six galaxy group. Edwin Hubble demonstrated the existence of galaxies. 
Expansion of the  Universe 	  After discovering that there are galaxies beyond the Milky Way, Edwin Hubble went on to measure the distance to hundreds of other galaxies. His data would eventually show how the universe is changing, and would even yield clues as to how the universe formed. 
Redshift 	  If you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum, or a range of colors through the rainbow. The spectrum will have specific dark bands where elements in the star absorb light of certain energies. By examining the arrangement of these dark absorption lines, astronomers can determine the composition of elements that make up a distant star. In fact, the element helium was first discovered in our Sun not on Earth by analyzing the absorption lines in the spectrum of the Sun. While studying the spectrum of light from distant galaxies, astronomers noticed something strange. The dark lines in the spectrum were in the patterns they expected, but they were shifted toward the red end of the spectrum, as shown in Figure 26.24. This shift of absorption bands toward the red end of the spectrum is known as redshift. Redshift is a shift in absorption bands toward the red end of the spectrum. What could make the absorption bands of a star shift toward the red? Redshift occurs when the light source is moving away from the observer or when the space between the observer and the source is stretched. What does it mean that stars and galaxies are redshifted? When astronomers see redshift in the light from a galaxy, they know that the galaxy is moving away from Earth. If galaxies were moving randomly, would some be redshifted but others be blueshifted? Of course. Since almost every galaxy in the universe has a redshift, almost every galaxy is moving away from Earth. Redshift can occur with other types of waves too. This phenomenon is called the Doppler Effect. An analogy to redshift is the noise a siren makes as it passes you. You may have noticed that an ambulance seems to lower the pitch of its siren after it passes you. The sound waves shift towards a lower pitch when the ambulance speeds away from you. Though redshift involves light instead of sound, a similar principle operates in both situations. An animation of Doppler Effect URL . 
The  Expanding  Universe 	  Edwin Hubble combined his measurements of the distances to galaxies with other astronomers measurements of redshift. From this data, he noticed a relationship, which is now called Hubbles Law: The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. What could this mean about the universe? It means that the universe is expanding. In this diagram of the expansion of the universe over time, the distance between galaxies gets bigger over time, although the size of each galaxy stays the same. 
Expansion of the  Universe  Diagram 	  An inflating balloon is only a rough analogy to the expanding universe for several reasons. One important reason is that the surface of a balloon has only two dimensions, while space has three dimensions. But space itself is stretching out between galaxies like the rubber stretches when a balloon is inflated. This stretching of space, which increases the distance between galaxies, is what causes the expansion of the universe. An animation of an expanding universe is shown here: URL html . One other difference between the universe and a balloon involves the actual size of the galaxies. On balloon, the dots will become larger in size as you inflate it. In the universe, the galaxies stay the same size, just the space between the galaxies increases. 
Formation of the  Universe 	  Before Hubble, most astronomers thought that the universe didnt change. But if the universe is expanding, what does that say about where it was in the past? If the universe is expanding, the next logical thought is that in the past it had to have been smaller. 
The  Big  Bang  Theory 	  The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted cosmological explanation of how the universe formed. If we start at the present and go back into the past, the universe is contracting  getting smaller and smaller. What is the end result of a contracting universe? According to the Big Bang theory, the universe began about 13.7 billion years ago. Everything that is now in the universe was squeezed into a very small volume. Imagine all of the known universe in a single, hot, chaotic mass. An enormous explosion a big bang caused the universe to start expanding rapidly. All the matter and energy in the universe, and even space itself, came out of this explosion. What came before the Big Bang? There is no way for scientists to know since there is no remaining evidence. 
After the  Big  Bang 	  In the first few moments after the Big Bang, the universe was unimaginably hot and dense. As the universe expanded, it became less dense and began to cool. After only a few seconds, protons, neutrons, and electrons could form. After a few minutes, those subatomic particles came together to create hydrogen. Energy in the universe was great enough to initiate nuclear fusion and hydrogen nuclei were fused into helium nuclei. The first neutral atoms that included electrons did not form until about 380,000 years later. The matter in the early universe was not smoothly distributed across space. Dense clumps of matter held close together by gravity were spread around. Eventually, these clumps formed countless trillions of stars, billions of galaxies, and other structures that now form most of the visible mass of the universe. If you look at an image of galaxies at the far edge of what we can see, you are looking at great distances. But you are also looking across a different type of distance. What do those far away galaxies represent? Because it takes so long for light from so far away to reach us, you are also looking back in time ( Figure 26.26). Images from very far away show what the universe was like not too long after the Big Bang. After the origin of the Big Bang hypothesis, many astronomers still thought the universe was static. Nearly all came around when an important line of evidence for the Big Bang was discovered in 1964. In a static universe, the space between objects should have no heat at all; the temperature should measure 0 K (Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale). But two researchers at Bell Laboratories used a microwave receiver to learn that the background radiation in the universe is not 0 K, but 3 K ( Figure 26.27). This tiny amount of heat is left over from the Big Bang. Since nearly all astronomers now accept the Big Bang hypothesis, what is it usually referred to as? Background radiation in the universe was good evidence for the Big Bang Theory. An explanation of the Big Bang: URL . How we know about the early universe: URL .

Dark  Matter and  Dark  Energy 	  The Big Bang theory is still the best scientific model we have for explaining the formation of the universe and many lines of evidence support it. However, recent discoveries continue to shake up our understanding of the universe. Astronomers and other scientists are now wrestling with some unanswered questions about what the universe is made of and why it is expanding. A lot of what cosmologists do is create mathematical models and computer simulations to account for these unknown phenomena. 
Dark  Matter 	  The things we observe in space are objects that emit some type of electromagnetic radiation. However, scientists think that matter that emits light makes up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter, about 80%, is dark matter. Dark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation so we cant observe it directly. However, astronomers know that dark matter exists because its gravity affects the motion of objects around it. When astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate, they find that the outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than they can see. Gravitational lensing occurs when light is bent from a very distant bright source around a super-massive object ( Figure 26.28). To explain strong gravitational lensing, more matter than is observed must be present. The arc around the galaxies at the center of this image is caused by gravitational lensing. The addition of gravitational pull from dark matter is required to explain this phenomenon. With so little to go on, astronomers dont really know much about the nature of dark matter. One possibility is that it could just be ordinary matter that does not emit radiation in objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and brown dwarfs  objects larger than Jupiter but smaller than the smallest stars. But astronomers cannot find enough of these types of objects, which they have named MACHOS (massive astrophyiscal compact halo object), to account for all the dark matter, so they are thought to be only a small part of the total. Another possibility is that the dark matter is thought to be much different from the ordinary matter we see. Some appear to be particles that have gravity, but dont otherwise appear to interact with other particles. Scientists call these theoretical particles WIMPs, which stands for Weakly Interactive Massive Particles. Most scientists who study dark matter think that the dark matter in the universe is a combination of MACHOS and some type of exotic matter such as WIMPs. Researching dark matter is an active area of scientific research, and astronomers knowledge about dark matter is changing rapidly. A video explaining dark matter is here: URL . 
Dark  Energy 	  Astronomers who study the expansion of the universe are interested in knowing the rate of that expansion. Is the rate fast enough to overcome the attractive pull of gravity? If yes, then the universe will expand forever, although the expansion will slow down over time. If no, then the universe would someday start to contract, and eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch, the opposite of the Big Bang. Recently astronomers have made a discovery that answers that question: the rate at which the universe is expanding is actually increasing. In other words, the universe is expanding faster now than ever before, and in the future it will expand even faster. So now astronomers think that the universe will keep expanding forever. But it also proposes a perplexing new question: What is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate? One possible hypothesis involves a new, hypothetical form of energy called dark energy ( Figure 26.29). Some scientists think that dark energy makes up as much as 72% of the total energy content of the universe. Other scientists have other hypotheses about why the universe is continuing to expand; the causes of the universes expansion is another unanswered question that scientists are researching. 
D:  Dark  Energy 	  Meet one of the three winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, Lawrence Berkeley Lab astrophysicist Saul Perlmutter. He explains how dark energy, which makes up 70 percent of the universe, is causing our universe to expand. Learn more at: URL . 
Lesson  Summary 	  The universe contains all the matter and energy that exists now, that existed in the past, and that will exist in the future. The universe also includes all of space and time. Redshift is a shift of element lines toward the red end of the spectrum. Redshift occurs when the source of light is moving away from the observer. Light from almost every galaxy is redshifted. The farther away a galaxy is, the more its light is redshifted, and the faster it is moving away from us. The redshift of galaxies means that the universe is expanding. The universe was squeezed into a very small volume and then exploded in the Big Bang theory about 13.7 billion years ago. Recent evidence shows that there is a lot of matter in the universe that we cannot detect directly. This matter is called dark matter. The rate of the expansion of the universe is increasing. The cause of this increase is unknown; one possible explanation involves a new form of energy called dark energy. 
The  Big  Bang: http://hurricanes.nasa.gov/universe/science/bang.html 	  The expansion of the universe is sometimes modeled using a balloon with dots marked on it, as described earlier in the lesson. In what ways is this a good model, and it what ways does it not correctly represent the expanding universe? Can you think of a different way to model the expansion of the universe?
