1.1 Deﬁning Chemistry

• Deﬁne the term "chemistry."
• List modern items produced by chemistry.

How does soap relate to chemistry?

Chemistry affects every area of our lives. Here is just one example of chemistry in action – the making of
soaps. Soap was once made by boiling animal fat in ashes – the product was hard on the skin and not very pleasant
to use. Today, soap manufacture involves complicated chemical processes to provide a wide variety of soaps for
different skin types. Colors and odors can be custom-made for that individual experience.

Deﬁning Chemistry

What is this made of? How can we produce this material quicker and at lower cost? Will this product harm us or
help us? All of these questions can be answered using the science of chemistry.

What Is Chemistry?

If we look up the word “chemistry” in the dictionary, we’ll ﬁnd something like this: “The science of the composition,
structure, properties, and reactions of matter, especially of atomic and molecular systems” (Free Online Dictionary).
This deﬁnition is certainly accurate, but does not give a good picture of the scope of chemistry or of the many
interesting aspects of the ﬁeld.

Introduction to Chemistry

Chemistry touches every area of our lives. The medicines we take, the food we eat, the clothes we wear – all these
materials and more are, in some way or another, products of chemistry.

What Is the World Made Of?

Questions about matter have been asked for centuries. The ancient Greek philosophes spent a lot of time trying
to ﬁgure out what matter was. Different philosophers debated whether matter was earth, water, air, ﬁre, or some
combination. They argued, but did not do any experiments at that time.
It took many centuries for humans to develop a better concept of what matter really is. Even today, we have an
incomplete picture of exactly what this stuff is that we can touch and see. Chemistry involves the study of these
substances, both in terms of basic properties and also learning all the things we can do with matter.
Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic
world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and
measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter
and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic
in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as
a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and
thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result
of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain. Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch
back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds.

Summary

• Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes it undergoes.
• Chemistry considers both macroscopic and microscopic information.

1.2 Events in Chemistry History

• Name famous chemists and the contributions they made to the science of chemistry.

Where did chemistry come from?
Early “chemists” focused on practical questions – how to make dyes and perfumes, soap manufacture, uses of metals,
and glass production among others. The goal was not to understand the physical world – that came later. People
just wanted to make things that would improve their lives in some way.

History of Chemistry

The history of chemistry is an interesting and challenging one. Very early chemists were often motivated mainly
by the achievement of a speciﬁc goal or product. Making perfume or soaps did not need a lot of theory, just a good
recipe and careful attention to detail. There was no standard way of naming materials (and no periodic table that
we could all agree on).
It is often difﬁcult to ﬁgure out exactly what a particular person was using. However, the
science developed over the centuries.
Major progress was made in putting chemistry on a solid foundation when Robert Boyle (1637-1691) began his
research in chemistry. He developed the basic ideas for the behavior of gases. We could then describe gases
mathematically. Boyle also helped develop the idea that small particles could combine to form molecules. Many
years later, John Dalton used these ideas to develop the atomic theory.

acterized several gases: oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide.
It was later discovered that nitrous oxide
(“laughing gas”) worked as an anesthetic. This gas was used for that purpose for the ﬁrst time in 1844 during a tooth
extraction. Other gases discovered during that time were chlorine, by C.W. Scheele (1742-1786) and nitrogen, by
Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794). Lavoisier has been considered by many scholars to be the “father of chemistry.”
Chemists continued to discover new compounds in the 1800s. The science also began to develop a more theoretical
foundation.
John Dalton (1766-1844) put forth his atomic theory in 1807. This idea allowed scientists to think
about chemistry in a much more systematic way. Amadeo Avogadro (1776-1856) laid the groundwork for a more
quantitative approach to chemistry by calculating the number of particles in a given amount of a gas. A lot of
effort was put forth in studying chemical reactions. These efforts led to new materials being produced. Following
the invention of the battery by Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), the ﬁeld of electrochemistry (both theoretical and
applications) developed through major contributions by Humphry Davy (1778-1829) and Michael Faraday (1791-
1867). Other areas of the discipline also progressed rapidly.
It would take a large book to cover developments in chemistry during the twentieth century and up to today. One
major area of expansion was in the area of the chemistry of living processes. Research in photosynthesis in plants,
the discovery and characterization of enzymes as biochemical catalysts, elucidation of the structures of biomolecules
such as insulin and DNA – these efforts gave rise to an explosion of information in the ﬁeld of biochemistry.
The practical aspects of chemistry were not ignored. The work of Volta, Davy, and Faraday eventually led to the
development of batteries that provided a source of electricity to power a number of devices.
Charles Goodyear (1800-1860) discovered the process of vulcanization, allowing a stable rubber product to be pro-
duced for the tires of all the vehicles we have today. Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) pioneered the use of heat sterilization
to eliminate unwanted microorganisms in wine and milk. Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) invented dynamite. After his
death, the fortune he made from this product was used to fund the Nobel Prizes in science and the humanities. J.W
Hyatt (1837-1920) developed the ﬁrst plastic. Leo Baekeland (1863-1944) developed the ﬁrst synthetic resin, widely
used for inexpensive and sturdy dinnerware.

Summary

• Many civilizations contributed to the growth of chemistry.
• A lot of early chemical researched focused on practical uses.
• Basic chemistry theories were developed during the nineteenth century.
• New materials and batteries are a few of the products of modern chemistry.

1.3 Areas of Chemistry

• List and deﬁne the ﬁve areas of chemistry.

How do guitars vary in both sound and style?

In talking with guitar players, it is not enough to say “I play the guitar.” The next question is always “Oh, what do
you play?” In the picture above, we see several styles of guitars. There are two acoustic guitars (non-electric, non-
ampliﬁed) and three different electric guitars. Not shown are instruments such as a classical guitar (six nylon strings
instead of steel strings), a bass guitar (usually four strings, but some have ﬁve), a resonator guitar for slide blues
(uses open tunings), an electric steel guitar (for country music) and a Hawaiian guitar. Guitar players specialize in
a type of instrument and style of music. The same is true of chemistry and other sciences.

Areas of Chemistry

The study of modern chemistry has many branches, but can generally be broken down into ﬁve main disciplines, or
areas of study:

• physical chemistry
• organic chemistry

9

1.3. Areas of Chemistry

• inorganic chemistry
• analytical chemistry
• biochemistry

Physical Chemistry

www.ck12.org

Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic properties, atomic properties, and phenomena in chemical sys-
tems. A physical chemist may study such things as the rates of chemical reactions, the energy transfers that occur
in reactions, or the physical structure of materials at the molecular level.

Organic Chemistry

Organic chemistry is the study of chemicals containing carbon. Carbon is one of the most abundant elements on
Earth and is capable of forming a tremendously vast number of chemicals (over twenty million so far). Most of the
chemicals found in all living organisms are based on carbon.

Inorganic Chemistry

Inorganic chemistry is the study of chemicals that do not, in general, contain carbon.
Inorganic chemicals are
commonly found in rocks and minerals. One current important area of inorganic chemistry deals with the design
and properties of materials involved in energy and information technology.

Analytical Chemistry

Analytical chemistry is the study of the composition of matter. It focuses on separating, identifying, and quantifying
chemicals in samples of matter. An analytical chemist may use complex instruments to analyze an unknown material
in order to determine its various components.

Introduction to Chemistry

Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes that occur in living things. Research may cover basic cellular
processes up to understanding disease states so better treatments can be developed.

In practice, chemical research is often not limited to just one of the ﬁve major disciplines. A particular chemist may
use biochemistry to isolate a particular chemical found in the human body such as hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying
component of red blood cells. He or she may then proceed to analyze the hemoglobin using methods that would
pertain to the areas of physical or analytical chemistry. Many chemists specialize in areas that are combinations of
the main disciplines, such as bioinorganic chemistry or physical organic chemistry.

– physical chemistry

1.4 Pure and Applied Chemistry

• Deﬁne pure and applied research.
• Explain the differences between the two.
• Give examples of pure and applied research.

How does research enable us to understand chemistry?

How did chemistry develop? What is happening in the ﬁeld of chemistry today? What can I do with a chemistry
degree? All of these are good questions and they should be asked by students interested in chemistry. Research
in chemistry (or any other ﬁeld, for that matter) is interesting and challenging. But there are different directions a
person can take as they explore research opportunities.

Types of Research

In science, we usually talk about two types of research: pure and applied. Pure research focuses on answering
basic questions such as, "how do gases behave?" Applied research would be involved in the process of developing a
speciﬁc preparation for a gas in order for it to be produced and delivered efﬁciently and economically. This division
sounds like it would be easy to make, but sometimes we cannot draw a clear line between what is “pure” and what
is “applied.”

Examples of “Pure” Research

A lot of “pure” research is of the “what is this?” or “how does it work?” variety. The early history of chemistry
contains many examples. The ancient Greek philosophers debated the composition of matter (earth? air? ﬁre?
water? all of the above?). They weren’t going to do anything with their knowledge – they just wanted to know.

13

1.4. Pure and Applied Chemistry

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 1.7
Ancient Greek philosophers.

Studies on the elements (especially after Mendeleev’s periodic table was published) were primarily “pure” research
types of experiments. Does this element exist? What are its properties? The scientists did not have any practical
application in mind, but were curious about the world around them.

Examples of “Applied” Research

There is a great deal of “applied” research taking place today. In general, no new science principles are discovered,
but existing knowledge is used to develop a new product. Research on laundry detergents will probably not give
us any new concepts about soap, but will help us develop materials that get our clothes cleaner, use less water, and
create lower amounts of pollution.
A lot of research is done by petroleum companies. They want to ﬁnd better ways to power vehicles, better lubricants
to cut down on engine wear, and better ways to lower air pollution. These companies will use information that is
readily available to come up with new products.

Introduction to Chemistry

Some “In-Between” Examples

Sometimes it is hard to differentiate between pure and applied research. What may start out as simply asking a
question may result is some very useful information. If scientists are studying the biochemistry of a microorganism
that causes a disease, they may soon ﬁnd information that would suggest a way to make a chemical that would
inactivate the microorganism. The compound could be used to learn more about the biochemistry, but could also be
used to cure the disease.
Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen in the bloodstream. Scientists studied hemoglobin
simply to learn how it worked. Out of this research came an understanding of how the protein changes shape
when oxygen attaches to it. This information was then applied to help patients with sickle cell anemia, a disorder
caused by an abnormal hemoglobin structure that makes hemoglobin molecules clump up when oxygen leaves the
protein. Basic knowledge of protein structure led to an improved understanding of a wide-spread disease and opened
the door for development of treatments.

Summary

• Pure research focuses on understanding basic properties and processes.
• Applied research focuses on the use of information to create useful materials.
• Sometimes there is no clear line between pure and applied research.

1.5. Energy in Chemistry

1.5 Energy in Chemistry

• Explain the source of chemical energy.
• Describe ways chemical energy is generated and used.

What are some types of chemical reactions?

Some chemistry reactions can be very calm and boring, while other reactions release a great deal of energy. Dyna-
mite is a chemical that can explode violently. Here we see dynamite being used to move boulders to clear a path for
a road. The chemical reactions involved here release tremendous amounts of energy very quickly.
Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1866. Nitroglycerin, a very unstable explosive, was already known. No-
bel mixed the nitroglycerin with silica to stabilize it and form a solid material. He made a fortune with this discovery
and established the Nobel Foundation, which funds the Nobel Prizes every year.

Energy in Chemical Bonds

Chemical reactions either require energy or release energy. The amount of energy needed or released depends
upon the structure of the molecules that are involved in the reaction. Some reactions need to be heated for long
periods of time in order for change to take place. Other reactions release energy, allowing heat to be given off to the
surroundings.
This energy can be used in a variety of ways.

Heating

Coal, natural gas, oil – these materials can be burned to produce heat. The reaction with oxygen releases a great
deal of energy that can warm homes and ofﬁces. Wood is another example of a chemical (yes, a very complicated
one) that will release energy when burned.

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Chemistry

A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical
used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited,
a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an
internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of
the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push
the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel
(either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

FIGURE 1.9
Rocket launch.

Batteries

A major source of energy produced by chemical reactions involves batteries. There are many types of batteries that
operate using a variety of chemical reactions. The general principle behind these reactions is the release of electrons
that can then ﬂow through a circuit, producing an electrical current.

FIGURE 1.10
Car battery.

17

1.5. Energy in Chemistry

www.ck12.org

Batteries are used in a wide variety of applications:

1. ﬂashlights
2. watches
3. computers
4. cars
5. hybrid vehicles – provide some power to wheels
6. cell phones
7. many other uses

Batteries in cars, computers, cell phones, and other devices are usually rechargeable. An electric current is passed
through the battery to provide electrons that reverse (at least partially) the chemical reactions originally used to
create the electric current. However, eventually the system can no longer be recharged and the battery has to be
discarded.

Hand-Warmers

Hikers, campers, and other outdoor folks take advantage of chemical reactions to keep their hands warm. Small
containers of chemicals can undergo reaction to generate heat that can be used to avoid frostbite. Some products
contain iron ﬁlings that will react with air to release thermal energy. These types of warmer cannot be reused. Other
systems rely on heat being released when certain chemicals crystallize. If the warmer is placed in very hot water
after use, the system can be regenerated.

Summary

• Some chemical reactions release energy.
• This energy can be used in a variety of ways.

• Describe contributions chemistry has made to medicine.

Diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by the body’s inability to use glucose (a component of table sugar). Glu-
cose is needed to provide biochemical energy for all the cells of the body. When the body cannot make energy using
glucose, it begins to break down fat and protein to provide the needed energy, eventually leading to death. Diabetes
is the result of the pancreas losing the ability to make insulin, a protein that helps glucose enter the cells and be used
for biochemical energy. A key piece of the puzzle surrounding our understanding of diabetes came when Frederick
Sanger, a British biochemist, carried out experiments that gave him the structure of the insulin molecule. Sanger
used basic chemistry techniques and reactions and took twelve years to complete his research. Today, automated
instruments based on his approach can perform the same analysis in a matter of days. Sanger was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 for his insulin research.

Chemistry in Medicine

Major contributions to health care have been made by chemistry. The development of new drugs involves chemical
analysis and synthesis of new compounds. Many recent television programs advertise the large number of new
drugs produced by chemists.

Introduction to Chemistry

The development of a new drug is long and complicated. The chemistry of the disease must be studied, as well how
the drug affects the human body. A drug may work well in animals, but not in humans. Out of a hundred drugs that
look like they help treat a disease, only a small handful actually turns out to be both safe and effective.

FIGURE 1.11
Drug for treatment of disease.

Chemistry contributes to the preparation and use of materials for surgery (sutures, artiﬁcial skin, and sterile materi-
als). The sutures used in many surgeries today do not have to be removed, because the simply dissolve in the body
after a period of time. Replacement blood vessels for heart and other types of surgery are often make of chemicals
that do not react with the tissues, so they will not be rejected by the body. Artiﬁcial skin can be used to replace
human skin for burn patients.

FIGURE 1.12
Surgical procedure.

Clinical laboratory testing uses a wide variety of chemical techniques and instrumentation for analysis. Clinical
laboratory testing allows us to answer commonly asked questions such as "is your cholesterol to high?" and "do you
have diabetes?" Some of the laboratory tests use simple techniques. Other processes involve complex equipment
and computer analysis of the data in order to perform measurements on large numbers of patient samples.

Laboratory testing has come to the local drug store or grocery store because of developments in chemistry. You can
test your blood glucose using a simple portable device that runs a chemical test on the blood sample and tells you
how much glucose is present, allowing a diabetic patient to regulate how much insulin to administer (chemistry is
also used to produce the insulin and the disposable syringe that administers the drug).

1.7 Agriculture

• Describe ways chemistry has contributed to the success of modern agriculture.

How does chemistry aid the success of crops?

In the spring, many people begin to plant their gardens. They see ads in catalogs or shop the gardening section of
a local store to get ideas. The right place in the garden is selected, seeds or plants are put in the soil, and then the
wait. Whether it is a small home garden or a large thousand acre farm, chemistry contributes greatly to the success
of the crop.

Agriculture

Crops need three things for good growth: water, nutrients from the soil, and protection from predators such as
insects. Chemistry has made major contributions in all three areas. Water puriﬁcation uses a number of chemical
and physical techniques to remove salts and contaminants that would pollute the soil. Chemical analysis of soil
allows the grower to see what nutrients are lacking so they can be added.
In the spring, grocery stores, hardware
stores, and gardening centers have high stacks of bags containing fertilizers and weed killers that enrich the soil and
keep down unwanted plants. These same stores also provide a number of sprays or solid treatments for insects that
might otherwise have a snack on the plants.

Water Puriﬁcation

Fresh water is essential for good crops. In some areas of the world, there is enough rain to accomplish this task. In
other locales, water must be provided so the crops will grow. Worldwide, irrigation covers about 18% of farm land

and produces some 40% of crops. A major source of cleaner water in many parts of the world is provided by the
process of desalinization.

FIGURE 1.16
Desalinization equipment.

Sea water is treated to remove salts and the resulting water can then be used for irrigation without contaminating the
soil with materials that harm the growing plants.

Soil Nutrients

In many areas of the world, the soil is deﬁcient in essential nutrients. A number of minerals such as phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, and magnesium may not be present in large enough amounts to cause good plant growth. Ni-
trogen is extremely important for good crops.
Soil analysis is available from a variety of labs. Local university extension services can provide valuable information
as to the composition of a soil and will also make suggestions as to the types and amounts of needed nutrients. Fer-
tilizers can be purchased and added to the soil to enrich it and ensure better yield of crops.

Insect Control

Even if the crop grows well, there is still the possibility of insect or pest damage. The insect or pest can consume
the crop or can damage it to the point where it will not grow well. Infestations of armyworms can do major damage
to corn and grain crops. Aphids and boll weevils are major predators of cotton crops. Failure to control these pests
will result in widespread crop damage and ﬁnancial loss to the farmer.

Introduction to Chemistry

A wide variety of pesticides have been developed by chemists and other scientists to deal with all these pests. The
basic approach is to have the pesticide interfere with some biochemical process in the pest.
Ideally, the pesticide
will not affect other living organisms, but this is not always the case.
It is very important to read the labels and
observe all precautions when using pesticides.

Summary

• Plant nutrients are very important for good plant growth.
• Chemical analysis of soil can tell he farmer or gardener what nutrients are needed.
• Chemists have developed many pesticides that will kill plant predators such as the army worm and the boll

weevil.

1.8 Materials

• List ways chemistry has contributed to the development of materials.

How does chemistry affect the clothing that we wear?

Chemistry research is often full of surprises. One such surprise came to Stephanie Kwolek of the DuPont chemical
company. She was working on a type of material known as polymers. These chemicals had been around for a while
and were being used for new types of textiles. Kwolek was looking for a strong and rigid petroleum product. She
came up with a material that did not look like your average polymer. But she played a hunch and had it made into
threads. This new material had stiffness about nine times that of any of the known polymers of the time. Further
research and development led to the production of Kevlar, a material now widely used in body armor (see ﬁgure
above).
In addition, Kevlar has found wide application in racing sails, car tires, brakes, and ﬁre-resistant clothing
worn by ﬁreﬁghters.

Materials

Electronics

Chemists are involved in the design and production of new materials. Some of the materials that chemists have
helped discover or develop in recent years include polymers, ceramics, adhesives, coatings, and liquid crystals. Liq-
uid crystals are used in electronic displays, as in watches and calculators. The silicon-based computer chip has
revolutionized modern society and chemists have played a key role in their design and continued improvement. The
calculator shown below uses both a liquid crystal display and chips inside the device.

Superconductors

Many chemists are currently working in the ﬁeld of superconductivity. Superconductors are materials that are able
to conduct electricity with 100% efﬁciency, meaning that no energy is lost during the electrical transmission, as
happens with conventional conducting materials like copper cable. The challenge is to design materials that can act
as superconductors at normal temperatures, as opposed to only being able to superconduct at very low temperatures.

Clothing

The ﬁbers that compose the materials for our clothes are either natural or human-made. Silk and cotton would
be examples of natural ﬁbers. Silk is produced by the silkworm and cotton is grown as a plant. Human-made
fabrics include nylon, orlon, and a number of other polymers. These materials are made from hydrocarbons found in
petroleum products. Synthetic polymers are also used in shoes, raingear, and camping items. The synthetic fabrics
tend to be lighter than the natural ones and can be treated to make them more water-resistant and durable.
Materials originally developed as textiles are ﬁnding a wide variety of other uses. Nylon is found in a number of
plastic utensils. Taking advantages of its strength and light weight, nylon is a component of ropes, ﬁshing nets,
tents, and parachutes.

• List contributions made by chemistry to solving environmental contamination problems.

What are the effects of waste within our environment?

Where to dump the garbage? Where to put the waste materials we don’t want, after we have made what we do
want? For many years we just dumped the waste in the nearest lake, river, empty spot of ground, and didn’t worry
about it. However, as we learn more about the effects of chemicals on living systems, we have become more
concerned about the effects of all this dumping.
In many cases, we just didn’t know what the long-term effects
would be. Today, dumpiong is generally illegal and offenders pay heavy penalties of ﬁnes and jail sentences.

Environment

Many chemicals that were once commonly used were later found out to be harmful to the environment, to human
health, or both. The element lead was once a common additive to gasoline and to paint. Plumbing pipes were once
typically made of lead. Only since the 1970s has the danger of lead become apparent. It causes brain damage and
small children (who often chewed on objects painted with lead-based paint) are particularly susceptible. The use
of lead in gasoline, paint, and plumbing pipes is now banned and new materials are being developed to replace the
hazardous lead components.
Lead is still widely used in car batteries. In recent years, battery recycling is becoming very common - about 98%
of car batteries a recycled today. The used batteries go to a processing plant where they are crushed and placed in a
tank. The lead sinks to the bottom and can be separated, melted and used again. Plastic materials ﬂoat to the top,
are separated, and melted. The plastic can then be used in a number of applications. The battery acids are treated
with chemicals to neutralize them before they are disposed of.

How Chemists Help the Environment

Chemists are involved in all aspects of environmental protection. In the case of lead, chemists measured the amount
of lead in soil, paint, plumbing, blood, and other materials. Chemists studied the chemical processes in the body
to see how lead did its damage. Methods for removal of lead from the body were developed with the help of
chemists. New gasoline products were developed that gave good fuel efﬁciency and smooth running of the engine
without the presence of lead.
Chemists continue to look for threats to our health and the environment and to search for alternatives so that harmful
chemicals can be replaced with others that will do the job as effectively, but without the harm.

1.10 Alchemy

• Describe the efforts by the alchemists to make gold from lead.

What’s the value of gold?
One area of technology that was common to all the societies we have mentioned was metallurgy. Useful tools could
be made that would last a long time. Weapons could stay sharp longer with improved metals. Precious metals
such as gold and silver could be reﬁned and used for jewelry or for money. Because it was fairly rare, gold was
considered to be very valuable and became a common means of paying for goods and services.
But mining for gold is a slow, dirty, and dangerous process. Not everyone owns a gold mine –in both the ancient
Egyptian society and during the Roman Empire, the gold mines were the property of the state, not an individual or
group. So there were few ways for most people to legally get any gold for themselves.

Alchemy

The alchemists were a varied group of scholars and charlatans whose goal was two-fold: to create the Philosopher’s
Stone (which caused the transmutation of lead into gold) and the discovery of the Elixir of Life (bestowing immor-
tality on the person who possessed it). The origin of the term “ alchemy” is uncertain. There are roots to Greek,
Arabic, and ancient Egyptian words. Three major streams of alchemy are known –Chinese, Indian, and European,
with all three streams having some factors in common. We will not focus on the philosophical or religious aspects
of alchemy, but will look brieﬂy at the techniques developed in the European stream that ultimately inﬂuenced the
development of the science of chemistry.
Many of the speciﬁc approaches that alchemists used when they tried changing lead into gold are vague and
unclear. Each alchemist had his own code for recording his data. The processes were kept secret so others could

not proﬁt from them. Different scholars developed their own set of symbols as they recorded the information they
came up with. Many alchemists were not very honest, taking money from a nobleman by claiming to be able to
make gold from lead, then leaving town in the middle of the night. Sometimes the nobleman would detect the fraud
and have the alchemist hung. By the 1300s, several European rulers had declared alchemy to be illegal and set out
strict punishments for those practicing the alchemical arts.

FIGURE 1.23
Alchemist recipe.

Alchemist Contributions to Chemistry

However, out of all this secrecy came several contributions to modern-day chemistry. Early acids and bases were
discovered. Glassware for running chemical reactions was developed. Alchemy helped improve the study of
metallurgy and the extraction of metals from ores. More systematic approaches to research were being developed,
although the idea of orderly scientiﬁc experimentation had not become well-established yet. But the groundwork
was laid to the development of chemistry as a foundational science.
The alchemists were never successful in changing lead into gold. But modern nuclear physics can accomplish this
task. Lead is subjected to nuclear bombardment in a particle accelerator. A small amount of gold can be obtained
by this process. However, the cost of the procedure is far more than the amount of gold obtained. So the dream of
the alchemists has never (and will never) come true.

Summary

• Gold has been considered valuably by all civilizations.

1.11 Nature of Science

• Deﬁne science.
• Explain the goal of science.
• Describe how science advances knowledge.
• Design a scientiﬁc experiment.

Does the word science make you think of high-tech labs and researchers in white coats like the ones in this picture?
This is often an accurate image of science but not always. If you look up science in a dictionary, you would ﬁnd that
it comes from a Latin word that means “having knowledge.” However, this isn’t an adequate deﬁnition either.

What Is Science?

Science is more about gaining knowledge than it is about simply having knowledge. Science is a way of learning
about the natural world that is based on evidence and logic. In other words, science is a process, not just a body of
facts. Through the process of science, our knowledge of the world advances.

The Goal of Science

Scientists may focus on very different aspects of the natural world. For example, some scientists focus on the world
of tiny objects, such as atoms and molecules. Other scientists devote their attention to huge objects, such as the sun
and other stars. But all scientists have at least one thing in common. They want to understand how and why things
happen. Achieving this understanding is the goal of science.
Have you ever experienced the thrill of an exciting ﬁreworks show like the one pictured in the Figure 1.24?
Fireworks show how the goal of science leads to discovery. Fireworks were invented at least 2000 years ago in
China, but explaining how and why they work didn’t happen until much later. It wasn’t until scientists had learned
about elements and chemical reactions that they could explain what caused ﬁreworks to create brilliant bursts of
light and deep rumbling booms.

FIGURE 1.24
Fireworks were invented long before scientists could actually explain how
and why they explode.

How Science Advances

Sometimes learning about science is frustrating because scientiﬁc knowledge is always changing. But that’s also
what makes science exciting. Occasionally, science moves forward in giant steps. More commonly, however,
science advances in baby steps.
Giant steps in science may occur if a scientist introduces a major new idea. For example, in 1666, Isaac Newton
introduced the idea that gravity is universal. People had long known that things fall to the ground because they are
attracted by Earth. But Newton proposed that everything in the universe exerts a force of attraction on everything
else. This idea is known as Newton’s law of universal gravitation.
Q: How do you think Newton’s law of universal gravitation might have inﬂuenced the advancement of science?
A: Newton’s law allowed scientists to understand many different phenomena. It explains not only why things always
fall down toward the ground or roll downhill. It also explains the motion of many other objects. For example, it
explains why planets orbit the sun. The idea of universal gravity even helped scientists discover the planets Neptune
and Pluto. The caption and diagram in the Figure 1.25 explain how.
Baby steps in science occur as small bits of evidence gradually accumulate. The accumulating evidence lets scientists
reﬁne and expand on earlier ideas. For example, the scientiﬁc idea of the atom was introduced in the early 1800s.
But scientists came to understand the structure of the atom only as evidence accumulated over the next two centuries.
Their understanding of atomic structure continues to expand today.
The advancement of science is sometimes a very bumpy road. New knowledge and ideas aren’t always accepted
at ﬁrst, and scientists may be mocked for their ideas. The idea that Earth’s continents drift on the planet’s surface
is a good example. This idea was ﬁrst proposed by a scientist named Alfred Wegener in the early 1900s. Wegener
also proposed that all of the present continents had once formed one supercontinent, which he named Pangaea (see
Figure 1.26). Other scientists not only rejected Wegener’s ideas, but ridiculed Wegener for even suggesting them. It
wasn’t until the 1950s that enough evidence had accumulated for scientists to realize that Wegener had been right.
Unfortunately, Wegener did not live long enough to see his ideas accepted.
Q: What types of evidence might support Wegener’s ideas?
A: Several types of evidence support Wegener’s ideas. For example, similar fossils and rock formations have been
found on continents that are now separated by oceans. It is also now known that Earth’s crust consists of rigid
plates that slide over molten rock below them. This explains how continents can drift. Even the shapes of today’s
continents show how they once ﬁt together, like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle.

1.12 Scientiﬁc Problem Solving

• Describe the approach of the ancient Greek philosophers to understanding the world around them.
• Deﬁne inductive and deductive reasoning.
• Describe the scientiﬁc method.

How can we use problem solving in our everyday routines?

One day you wake up and realize your clock radio did not turn on to get you out of bed. You are puzzled, so you
decide to ﬁnd out what happened. You list three possible explanations:

1. There was a power failure and your radio cannot turn on..
2. Your little sister turned it off as a joke.
3. You did not set the alarm last night.

Upon investigation you ﬁnd that the clock is on, so there is no power failure. Your little sister was spending the
night with a friend and could not have turned the alarm off. You notice that the alarm is not set – your forgetfulness
made you late. You have used the scientiﬁc method to ﬁnd an answer to a question.

Scientiﬁc Problem Solving

Humans have always wondered about the world around them. One of the questions of interest was (and still is) what
is this world made of? Chemistry has been deﬁned in various ways as the study of matter. What that matter consists
of has been a source of debate over the centuries. One of the key arenas for this debate in the Western world was
Greek philosophy.

The basic approach of these philosophers to questions about the world was discussion and debate. There was no
gathering of information to speak of, just talking. As a result, several ideas about matter were put forth, but never
resolved. The ﬁrst philosopher to carry out the gathering of data was Aristotle (384-322 B.C.). He recorded many
observations on the weather, on plant and animal life and behavior, on physical motions, and a number of other
topics. Aristotle could probably be considered the ﬁrst “real” scientist since he made systematic observations of
nature and tried to understand what he was seeing.

Inductive and Deductive Reasoning

Two approaches to logical thinking developed over the centuries. These two methods are inductive reasoning and
deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning involves getting a collection of speciﬁc examples and drawing a general
conclusion from them. Deductive reasoning takes a general principle and then draws a speciﬁc conclusion from the
general concept. Both are used in the development of scientiﬁc ideas.
Inductive reasoning ﬁrst involves the collection of data. If I add sodium metal to water, I will observe a very violent
reaction. Every time I repeat the process, I see the same thing happening. I draw a general conclusion from these
observations: the addition of sodium to water results in a violent reaction.
In deductive reasoning, I make a speciﬁc prediction based on a general principle. One general principle is that acids
turn blue litmus paper red. If I have a bottle of liquid labeled “acid,” I expect the litmus paper to turn red when I
immerse it in the liquid.

The Idea of the Experiment

Chapter 1.

Introduction to Chemistry

Inductive reasoning is at the heart of what we call the “ scientiﬁc method.” In European culture, this approach was
developed mainly by Francis Bacon (1561-1626), a British scholar. He advocated the use of inductive reasoning in
every area of life, not just science. The scientiﬁc method as developed by Bacon and others involved several steps:

1. ask a question – identify the problem to be considered
2. make observations – gather data that pertains to the question
3. propose an explanation ( a hypothesis) for the observations
4. make new observations to test the hypothesis further

FIGURE 1.28
Sir Francis Bacon.

Note that this should not be considered a “cookbook” for scientiﬁc research. Scientists do not sit down with their
daily “to do” list and write down these steps. The steps may not necessarily be followed in order. But this does
provide a general idea of how scientiﬁc research is usually done.
When a hypothesis is conﬁrmed repeatedly, it eventually becomes a theory – a general principle that is offered to
explain natural phenomena. Note a key word – explanation. The theory offers a description of why something
happens. A law, on the other hand, is a statement that is always true, but does not explain why. The law of gravity
says a rock will fall when dropped, but does not explain why (gravitational theory is very complex and incomplete
at present). The kinetic-molecular theory of gases, on the other hand, tells what happens when a gas is heated in
a closed container (the pressure increases), but also explains why (the motions of the gas molecules are increased
due to the change in temperature). Theories do not get “promoted” to laws because laws do not answer the “why”
question.

Summary

• The early Greek philosophers spend their time talking about nature, but did little or no actual exploration or

investigation.

• inductive reasoning – developing a general conclusion from a collection of observations.
• deductive reasoning – making a speciﬁc statement based on a general principle.
• scientiﬁc method – a process of observation, developing a hypothesis, and testing that hypothesis.

2.1 Substances

• Deﬁne substance.

Have you ever had the experience of opening the refrigerator and seeing something you don’t recognize?
Not an unfamiliar food, but something that has changed over the time period it was in the refrigerator. You are not
sure just what it is, so you call it “stuff”. Looking at it, you know it’s not a good idea to eat it, so you throw it out. If
you’re not sure just what it is, you certainly don’t want to put it in your body.

Substances

Silver and ordinary table salt are two examples of chemical substances. A substance is matter that has a uniform
and deﬁnite composition. All samples of substances, sometimes called pure substances, have identical properties.
When chemists run a chemical reaction, they want to use pure materials so they know exactly what they are dealing
with. They know that the reaction involves a speciﬁc substance, so they expect the same reaction to give the same
results each time it is run.
One of the characteristics of a substance is that it cannot be separated into components by physical separation
techniques. The compound acetylsalicylic acid (the active ingredient in aspirin) is a substance because it is a
chemical compound that cannot be further reduced to other materials by physical means. However, the aspirin
that contains the acetylsalicylic acid is a mixture. In addition to the active pain-relieving ingredient, aspirin also
may contain waxes, corn starch, and cellulose, among other ingredients. These added materials bind the tablet
components into a solid pill and inﬂuence how rapidly the material dissolves.
Substances may be either elements or pure compounds. They may also be solid, liquid, or gas. Some of the elements
(such as silver) exist in the solid form. Other elements (mercury) exist as liquids at room temperature. Elements
such as helium and radon exist as gases at room temperature. A compound such as water will take the form of a
solid, a liquid, or a gas, depending upon the temperature.

Why are drag car standards constantly reinforced?

Drag racing is a highly competitive (and expensive) sport. There are a variety of classes of vehicles, ranging from
stock classes (depending on car weight, engine size, and degree of engine modiﬁcation) all the way up to the Top
Fuel class with weights of over two thousand pounds and capable of top speeds of well over 300 miles per hour at
the end of the quarter-mile. The standards for each class are well deﬁned and frequent checks are made of engine
dimensions and components to ensure that the rules are followed.

Physical Properties

A physical property is a characteristic of a substance that can be observed or measured without changing the
identity of the substance. Silver is a shiny metal that conducts electricity very well. It can be molded into thin
sheets, a property called malleability. Salt is dull and brittle and conducts electricity when it has been dissolved
into water, which it does quite easily. Physical properties of matter include color, hardness, malleability, solubility,
electrical conductivity, density, melting points, and boiling points.

50

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter and Change

For the elements, color does not vary much from one element to the next. The vast majority of elements are colorless,
silver, or gray. Some elements do have distinctive colors: sulfur and chlorine are yellow, copper is (of course) copper-
colored, and elemental bromine is red.
Density can be a very useful parameter for identifying an element. Of the materials that exist as solids at room
temperature, iodine has a very low density compared to zinc, chromium, and tin. Gold has a very high density, as
does platinum.
Hardness helps determine how an element (especially a metal) might be used. Many elements are fairly soft (silver
and gold, for example) while others (such as titanium, tungsten, and chromium) are much harder. Carbon is an
interesting example of hardness. In graphite (the “lead” found in pencils) the carbon is very soft, while the carbon
in a diamond is roughly seven times as hard.

FIGURE 2.2
Pencil.

FIGURE 2.3
Diamond ring.

Melting and boiling points are somewhat unique identiﬁers, especially of compounds. In addition to giving some
idea as to the identity of the compound, important information can be obtained about the purity of the material.

How much is twenty dollars really worth?

I agree to mow someone’s lawn for twenty dollars (it’s a fairly big yard). When they pay me, they give me a $20
bill. It doesn’t matter whether the bill is brand new or old, dirty, and wrinkled – all these bills have the same value
of $20. If I want more $20 bills, I have to mow more lawns. I can’t say, “This particular bill is actually worth more
than $20.” To have more money, I have to put in more work.

Extensive and Intensive Properties

Extensive Properties

Some properties of matter depend on the size of the sample, while some do not. An extensive property is a property
that depends on the amount of matter in a sample. The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter that
an object contains. A small sample of a certain type of matter will have a small mass, while a larger sample will
have a greater mass. Another extensive property is volume. The volume of an object is a measure of the space that
is occupied by that object.
The ﬁgure below illustrates the extensive property of volume. The pitcher and glass both contain milk. The pitcher
holds approximately two quarts and the glass will hold about 8 ounces of milk. The same milk is in each container.
The only difference is the amount of milk contained in the glass and in the pitcher

Intensive Properties

The electrical conductivity of a substance is a property that depends only on the type of substance. Silver, gold, and
copper are excellent conductors of electricity, while glass and plastic are poor conductors. A larger or smaller piece
of glass will not change this property. An intensive property is a property of matter that depends only on the type
of matter in a sample and not on the amount. Other intensive properties include color, temperature, density, and
solubility.

The copper wire shown in the picture below has a certain electrical conductivity. You could cut off the small end
sticking out and it would have the same conductivity as the entire long roll of wire shown here. The conductivity is
a property of the copper metal itself, not of the length of the wire.

• An extensive property is a property that depends on the amount of matter in a sample.
• Mass and volume are examples of extensive properties.
• An intensive property is a property of matter that depends only on the type of matter in a sample and not on

the amount.

2.4 Solid, Liquid, and Gas

• Deﬁne, solid, liquid, and gas.
• Explain differences among these three phases of matter.

Why is the state of water different in each picture?
Water can take many forms. At low temperatures (below 0◦C), it is a solid. When at “normal” temperatures (between
0◦C and 100◦C), it is a liquid. While at temperatures above 100◦C, water is a gas (steam).
The state the water is in depends upon the temperature. Each state (solid, liquid, and gas) has its own unique set of
physical properties.

Matter and Its States

Matter typically exists in one of three states: solid, liquid, or gas. The state a given substance exhibits is also a
physical property. Some substances exist as gases at room temperature (oxygen and carbon dioxide), while others,
like water and mercury metal, exist as liquids. Most metals exist as solids at room temperature. All substances can
exist in any of these three states.
Note: Technically speaking a fourth state of matter called plasma exists, but it does not naturally occur on earth, so
we will omit it from our study here.

Liquid

Liquids have the following characteristics:

• no deﬁnite shape (takes the shape of its container)
• has deﬁnite volume
• particles are free to move over each other, but are still attracted to each other

A familiar liquid is mercury metal. Mercury is an anomaly. It is the only metal we know of that is liquid at room
temperature. Mercury also has an ability to stick to itself (surface tension) – a property all liquids exhibit. Mercury
has a relatively high surface tension, which makes it very unique. Here you see mercury in its common liquid form.
If we were to heat liquid mercury to its boiling point of 357◦C, and under the right pressure conditions, we would
notice all particles in the liquid state go into the gas state.

Gas

Gases have the following characteristics:

56

Chapter 2. Matter and Change

FIGURE 2.6
Mercury.

• no deﬁnite shape (takes the shape of its container)
• no deﬁnite volume
• particles move in random motion with little or no attraction to each other
• highly compressible

Solid

Solids are deﬁned by the following characteristics:

• deﬁnite shape (rigid)
• deﬁnite volume
• particles vibrate around ﬁxed axes

If we were to cool liquid mercury to its freezing point of -39◦C, and under the right pressure conditions, we would
notice all of the liquid particles would go into the solid state.
The video below shows this process.

As you can see in the video, mercury can be solidiﬁed when its temperature is brought to its freezing point. However,
when returned to room temperature conditions, mercury does not exist in solid state for long, and returns back to its
more common liquid form.

How does a car go from new and shiny to old and beaten up?

Want to buy a car – cheap? Notice there is no speciﬁcation such as “in good condition” or “needs a little work.”
The car above is pretty beat up. The body is damaged, the windows are broken, and the interior is probably torn up.
But this is still a car. It has all the components of a car, even though you would not want to buy it in the present
condition. But change that condition and you have a (possibly) useable car.

Physical Change

As an ice cube melts, its shape changes as it acquires the ability to ﬂow. However, its composition does not change.
Melting is an example of a physical change. A physical change is a change to a sample of matter in which some
properties of the material change, but the identity of the matter does not. Physical changes can further be classiﬁed as
reversible or irreversible. The melted ice cube may be refrozen, so melting is a reversible physical change. Physical
changes that involve a change of state are all reversible. Other changes of state include vaporization (liquid to gas),
freezing (liquid to solid), and condensation (gas to liquid). Dissolving is also a reversible physical change. When
salt is dissolved into water, the salt is said to have entered the aqueous state. The salt may be regained by boiling
off the water, leaving the salt behind.
When a piece of wood is ground into sawdust, that change is irreversible since the sawdust could not be reconstituted
into the same piece of wood that it was before. Cutting the grass or pulverizing a rock would be other irreversible
physical changes. Fire wood also represents an irreversible physical change since the pieces cannot be put back
together to form the tree.

How do you like your coffee?

Many people enjoy a cup of coffee at some point during the day. Some may drink it black, while others may put
cream (or some dairy substitute) and sugar in their coffee. You can buy high-end coffee drinks at espresso stands
(either sit-down or drive-through). Whatever your preference, you want the coffee to be the same at the beginning
and the end of your drink. You don’t want the components to separate out, but you want your drink to be uniform
from top to bottom.

Mixtures

Ordinary table salt is called sodium chloride. It is considered a substance because it has a uniform and deﬁnite
composition. All samples of sodium chloride are chemically identical. Water is also a pure substance. Salt easily
dissolves in water, but salt water cannot be classiﬁed as a substance because its composition can vary. You may
dissolve a small amount of salt or a large amount into a given amount of water. A mixture is a physical blend of two
or more components, each of which retains its own identity and properties in the mixture. Only the form of the salt
is changed when it is dissolved into water. It retains its composition and properties.

Homogeneous Mixtures

A homogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the composition is uniform throughout the mixture. The salt water
described above is homogeneous because the dissolved salt is evenly distributed throughout the entire salt water

Chapter 2. Matter and Change

sample. Often it is easy to confuse a homogeneous mixture with a pure substance because they are both uniform. The
difference is that the composition of the substance is always the same. The amount of salt in the salt water can vary
from one sample to another. All solutions would be considered homogeneous because the dissolved material is
present in the same amount throughout the solution.
One characteristic of mixtures is that they can be separated into their components. Since each part of the mixture
has not reacted with another part of the mixture, the identities of the different materials is unchanged.

Summary

• A homogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the composition is uniform throughout the mixture.
• All solutions would be considered homogeneous.

What’s the best way to eat a bag of jelly beans?

Many people open the bag and eat all the candy, no matter what ﬂavor each piece is. Others pick through the
collection. They might say “I don’t like the orange ones.” Or maybe they just care for the lemon ones. There are
different kinds of jelly beans in the mixture and people will eat what they want and get rid of the rest.

Heterogeneous Mixtures

A heterogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the composition is not uniform throughout the mixture. Vegetable
soup is a heterogeneous mixture. Any given spoonful of soup will contain varying amounts of the different vegetables
and other components of the soup.
A phase is any part of a sample that has a uniform composition and properties. By deﬁnition, a pure substance or a
homogeneous mixture consists of a single phase. A heterogeneous mixture consists of two or more phases. When
oil and water are combined, they do not mix evenly, but instead form two separate layers. Each of the layers is called
a phase.
In the vegetable soup example, one phase would be the liquid soup itself. This phase has vitamins, minerals, and
other components dissolved in the water. This phase would be homogeneous. The carrots, peas, corn, or other

vegetables represent other phases of the soup. The various vegetables are not mixed evenly mixed in the soup, but
are spread around at random.
There are a large number of heterogeneous mixtures around us. Soil is composed of a variety of substances and is
often of different composition depending on the sample taken. One shovel may come up with dirt and grass while
the next shovel could contain an earthworm.
Smog is another example of a heterogeneous mixture. This murky collection of pollutants can be a mixture of water
and contaminants from burning gasoline or plastics mixed with nitric oxide derivatives and ozone. You can see that
the smog distribution in the air illustrate below is not evenly spread out, but varies from one part of the atmosphere
to another.

2.8 Methods for Separating Mixtures

• Describe techniques for separation of mixtures.

How did goldminers search for gold?

Beginning in the late 1840s, thousands of prospectors rushed to California to search for gold. One of the approaches
taken to isolate the gold from the soil was called “panning.” Dirt would be placed in the pan and covered with water.
After thorough mixing, the pan is gently swirled to remove dissolved material while the heavier gold settles to the
bottom of the pan. The gold is then separated from the mixture of soil and water.

Separation of Mixtures

Not everyone is out searching for gold (and not many of those searchers is going to get much gold, either). In a
chemical reaction, it is important to isolate the component(s) of interest from all the other materials so they can be
further characterized. Studies of biochemical systems, environmental analysis, pharmaceutical research – these and
many other areas of research require reliable separation methods.
Here are a number of common separation techniques:

67

2.8. Methods for Separating Mixtures

www.ck12.org

Chromatography

Chromatography is the separation of a mixture by passing it in solution or suspension or as a vapor (as in gas
chromatography) through a medium in which the components move at different rates. Thin-layer chromatography is
a special type of chromatography used for separating and identifying mixtures that are or can be colored, especially
pigments.

Distillation

Distillation is an effective method to separate mixtures comprised of two or more pure liquids. Distillation is a
puriﬁcation process where the components of a liquid mixture are vaporized and then condensed and isolated. In
simple distillation, a mixture is heated and the most volatile component vaporizes at the lowest temperature. The
vapor passes through a cooled tube (a condenser), where it condenses back into its liquid state. The condensate that
is collected is called distillate.

FIGURE 2.11
Distillation apparatus.

In the Figure 2.11, we see several important pieces of equipment. There is a heat source, a test tube with a one-
hole stopper attached to a glass elbow and rubber tubing. The rubber tubing is placed into a collection tube which
is submerged in cold water. There are other more complicated assemblies for distillation that can also be used,
especially to separate mixtures, which are comprised of pure liquids with boiling points that are close to one another.

Evaporation

Evaporation is a technique used to separate out homogenous mixtures where there is one or more dissolved solids.
This method drives off the liquid components from the solid components. The process typically involves heating
the mixture until no more liquid remains, Prior to using this method, the mixture should only contain one liquid
component, unless it is not important to isolate the liquid components. This is because all liquid components will
evaporate over time. This method is suitable to separate a soluble solid from a liquid.
In many parts of the world, table salt is obtained from the evaporation of sea water. The heat for the process comes
from the sun.

Filtration

Filtration is a separation method used to separate out pure substances in mixtures comprised of particles some of
which are large enough in size to be captured with a porous material. Particle size can vary considerably, given the
type of mixture. For instance, stream water is a mixture that contains naturally occurring biological organisms like

bacteria, viruses, and protozoans. Some water ﬁlters can ﬁlter out bacteria, the length of which is on the order of 1
micron. Other mixtures, like soil, have relatively large particle sizes, which can be ﬁltered through something like a
coffee ﬁlter.

FIGURE 2.13
Filtration.

Summary

• Mixtures can be separated using a variety of techniques.
• Chromatography involves solvent separation on a solid medium.
• Distillation takes advantage of differences in boiling points.
• Evaporation removes a liquid from a solution to leave a solid material.
• Filtration separates solids of different sizes.

Who is Sherlock Holmes?

The famous ﬁctional British detective Sherlock Holmes was often said to make the statement “elementary, my dear
Watson.” In reality, the closest he ever came to that line was an exchange with Watson in the short story “The
Crooked Man.” Holmes shows shrewd insight into Watson’s activities of the day. When asked how he knew what
Watson was doing, Holmes simply replies “Elementary.” Regardless of exactly how he put it, Sherlock was simply
referring to what the Free Dictionary deﬁnes as “relating to, or constituting the basic, essential, or fundamental part.”

Elements

An element is the simplest form of matter that has a unique set of properties. Examples of well-known ele-
ments include oxygen, iron, and gold (see the ﬁgure below). Elements cannot be broken down into a simpler
substance. Likewise, one element cannot be chemically converted into a different element.
Some elements have been known for centuries (gold, silver, iron, copper, among others) while others have been
created in the lab only within the last several years. Most elements do not exist as such in nature. They are so
reactive that they can be found only in combination with other materials.

Chemical elements are the simplest of substances. (A) An oxygen tank like this is used by people with a need
for breathing assistance. (B) A simple skillet can be made from cast iron. (C) Gold bars are formed and used for
monetary purposes.

Several of the elements are very valuable while others are quite inexpensive. Gold is currently worth almost $1700
per ounce. Aluminum, on the other hand, only sells for about 90 cents per pound, considerably lower than gold.
Copper is worth somewhat more, selling for approximately $3.50 pound. Platinum is very valuable at about $1650
an ounce, not quite as expensive as gold.

What do you need to start building a house?
When building a house, you start with a blueprint of what the house will look like. The plan states how many
windows and what kind, how many doors and what style, how many rooms and what type (bedroom, kitchen,
other). The blueprint shows how the different pieces will go together to make the house. As long as the blueprint
is followed and exactly the same items are used, the houses will be identical.

Compounds

A compound is a substance that contains two or more elements chemically combined in a ﬁxed proportion. The
elements carbon and hydrogen combine to form many different compounds. One of the simplest is called methane,
in which there are always four times as many hydrogen particles as carbon particles. Methane is a pure substance
because it always has the same composition. However, it is not an element because it can be broken down into
simpler substances –carbon and hydrogen.
Recall that the components of a mixture can be separated from one another by physical means. This is not true for
a compound. Table salt is a compound consisting of equal parts of the elements sodium and chlorine. Salt cannot
be separated into its two elements by ﬁltering, distillation, or any other physical process. Salt and other compounds

74

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Matter and Change

can only be decomposed into their elements by a chemical process. A chemical change is a change that produces
matter with a different composition. Many compounds can be decomposed into their elements by heating. When
sugar is heated, it decomposes to carbon and water. Water is still a compound, but one which cannot be broken
down into hydrogen and oxygen by heating. Instead, the passage of an electrical current through water will produce
hydrogen and oxygen gases.
The properties of compounds are generally very different than the properties of the elements from which the
compound is formed. Sodium is an extremely reactive soft metal that cannot be exposed to air or water. Chlorine is
a deadly gas. The compound sodium chloride is a white solid which is essential for all living things ( Figure 2.15).

Do you like to cook?

Cooking is a valuable skill that everyone should have. Whether it is ﬁxing a simple grilled cheese sandwich or
preparing an elaborate meal, cooking demonstrates some basic ideas in chemistry. When you bake bread, you mix
some ﬂour, sugar, yeast, and water together. After baking, this mixture has been changed to form bread, another
substance that has different characteristics and qualities from the original materials. The process of baking has
produced chemical changes in the ingredients that result in bread being made.

Chemical Change

Most of the elements we know about do not exist freely in nature. Sodium cannot be found by itself (unless we
prepare it in the laboratory) because it interacts easily with other materials. On the other hand, the element helium
does not interact with other elements to any extent. We can isolate helium from natural gas during the process of
drilling for oil.
A chemical change produces a different materials than the ones we started with. One aspect of the science of
chemistry is the study of the changes that matter undergoes. If all we had were the elements and they did nothing,
life would be very boring (in fact, life would not exist since the elements are what make up our bodies and sustain
us). But the processes of change that take place when different chemicals are combined produce all the materials
that we use daily.

77

2.11. Chemical Change

www.ck12.org

One type of chemical change (already mentioned) is when two elements combine to form a compound. Another
type involves the breakdown of a compound to produce the elements that make it up. If we pass an electric current
through bauxite (aluminum oxide, the raw material for aluminum metal), we get metallic aluminum as a product.

FIGURE 2.16
Electrolytic production of aluminum.

However, the vast majority of chemical changes involve one compound being transformed into another compound. There
are literally millions of possibilities when we take this approach to chemical change. New compounds can be made
to produce better fabrics that are easier to clean and maintain; they can help preserve food so it doesn’t spoil as
quickly; and, we can make new medicines to treat diseases –all made possible by studying chemical change.

How do chess players monitor their moves in a game?

Suppose you were walking along and noticed a piece of paper on the ground with markings on it. You pick it up
and see the paper in the picture above.
To most people, these notes are meaningless (maybe they’re a secret spy code). But to a chess player, these symbols
tell the story of a chess game. Each abbreviation describes a chess piece or a move during the game. The use of
special symbols allows us to “see” the game without having to read a wordy and possibly incomplete description of
what happened.

Chemical Symbols and Formulas

In order to illustrate chemical reactions and the elements and compounds involved in them, chemists use symbols
and formulas. A chemical symbol is a one-or two-letter designation of an element. Some examples of chemical
symbols are "O" for oxygen, "Zn" for zinc, and "Fe" for iron. The ﬁrst letter of a symbol is always capitalized. If the
symbol contains two letters, the second letter is lower case. The majority of elements have symbols that are based
on their English names. However, some of the elements that have been known since ancient times have maintained
symbols that are based on their Latin names, as shown in Table 2.1.

Have you ever left your bicycle out in the rain?
It’s not a good idea because the bicycle can soon begin to rust. You start to get a reddish-orange build-up of a rough
deposit on the metal. It may start with the chain, but can spread to other parts of the bicycle, especially if there are
scratches that create a bare metal surface. The formation of rust is a chemical process that takes place when iron is
exposed to water and oxygen. It is estimated that damage due to rust costs U.S. businesses, military, and government
over 276 billion dollars a year - a very expensive chemical process.

Chemical Properties

A chemical property describes the ability of a substance to undergo a speciﬁc chemical change. A chemical
property of iron is that it is capable of combining with oxygen to form iron oxide, the chemical name of rust. The
more general term for rusting and other similar processes is corrosion. Other terms that are commonly used in
descriptions of chemical changes are burn, rot, explode, decompose, and ferment. Chemical properties are very
useful in identifying substances. However, unlike physical properties, chemical properties can only be observed as
the substance is in the process of being changed into a different substance.

Chemical Change

A chemical change is also called a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction is a process that occurs when one or
more substances are changed into one or more new substances. Zinc (Zn) is a silver gray element that can be ground

into a powder. If zinc is mixed at room temperature with powdered sulfur (S), a bright yellow element, the result will
simply be a mixture of zinc and sulfur. No chemical reaction occurs. However, if energy is provided to the mixture
in the form of heat, the zinc will chemically react with the sulfur to form the compound zinc sulﬁde (ZnS). The
ﬁgure below shows the substances involved in this reaction.

What would you do without a computer?

Over the last few decades, computers have proven to be extremely useful tools for organizing and processing
information. You put data into the computer (such as the structural parameters of a compound) and your output can
be a detailed diagram of how that molecule looks in three dimensions. The computer and its programs transform
input data into a useful ﬁnal product.

Chemical Equation

The reaction between zinc and sulfur can be shown in what is called a chemical equation. In words, we could write
the reaction as:

zinc + sulfur → zinc sulﬁde

The more convenient way to express a chemical reaction is to use the symbols and formulas of the substances
involved:

Zn + S → ZnS

The substance(s) to the left of the arrow in a chemical equation are called reactants. A reactant is a substance that
is present at the start of a chemical reaction. The substance(s) to the right of the arrow are called products. A

are the reactants that chemically combine to form the zinc sulﬁde product.
There is a standard way of writing chemical equations. The reactants are all written on the left-hand side of the
equation, with the products on the right-hand side. An arrow points from the reactants to the products to indicate
the direction of the reaction:
reactants → products

In the equation above, the zinc and sulfur

When appropriate, a symbol may be written above or below the arrow to indicate some special circumstance. The
symbol "∆" is often used to indicate that the reaction is to be heated.
The presence of the arrow also indicates that the reaction goes in one direction under the conditions indicated. There
are reactions which can be easily reversed, but we will not take those up right now.
There are a wide variety of reactions possible: elements may form compounds (as seen in the reaction above),
compounds may form elements (water will break down in the presence of an electric current to form hydrogen gas
and oxygen gas) or compounds may combine, break apart, or rearrange to form new materials.

Summary

• A chemical equation describes a chemical reaction.
• Reactants are starting materials and are written on the left-hand side of the equation.
• Products are the end-result of the reaction and are written on the right-hand side of the equation.

2.15 Recognizing Chemical Reactions

• Describe ways a chemical reaction can be recognized.

Have you ever cooked a pizza?
Making a pizza can be as easy as buying a “take and bake” from a store and putting it in the oven to mixing up the
dough and loading it up with your favorite toppings before baking it. How do you know when it is done? The most
obvious sign is that the crust turns light brown. The dough is no longer ﬂexible, but much more solid. Maybe the
cheese has melted. You want the pizza to be cooked, not half-raw.

Recognizing Chemical Reactions

How can you tell if a chemical reaction is taking place? There are four visual clues that indicate that a chemical
reaction is likely occurring.

1. A change of color occurs during the reaction.
2. A gas is produced during the reaction.
3. A solid product called a precipitate is produced in the reaction.
4. A transfer of energy occurs as a result of the reaction.

Mercury(II) oxide is a red solid. When it is heated to a temperature above 500°C, it easily decomposes into mercury
and oxygen gas. The red color of the mercury oxide reactant becomes the silver color of mercury. The color change
is the sign that the reaction is occurring.
When zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid, the reaction bubbles vigorously as hydrogen gas is produced. The produc-
tion of a gas is also an indication that a chemical reaction is occurring.

Mercuric oxide.

FIGURE 2.20
Mercury metal.

FIGURE 2.21
Zinc reacting with hydrochloric acid produces bubbles of hydrogen gas.

When a colorless solution of lead(II) nitrate is added to a colorless solution of potassium iodide, a yellow solid called
a precipitate is instantly produced. A precipitate is a solid product that forms from a reaction and settles out of a
liquid mixture. The formation of a precipitate is an indication of a chemical reaction.
All chemical changes involve a transfer of energy. When zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid, the test tube becomes
very warm as energy is released during the reaction. Some other reactions absorb energy. While energy changes are
a potential sign of a chemical reaction, care must be taken to ensure that a chemical reaction is indeed taking place.
Physical changes also involve a transfer of energy. Melting of a solid absorbs energy, while the condensation of a
gas releases energy. The only way to be certain that a chemical reaction has taken place is to test the composition of
the substances after the change has taken place to see if they are different from the starting substances.

Summary

• There are four visual clues that indicate that a chemical reaction is likely occurring.

– A change of color occurs during the reaction.
– A gas is produced during the reaction.

3.1 SI Base Units

• Deﬁne the SI system of units.
• List the seven base units of measurement.

How long is a yard?
It depends on whom you ask and when you asked the question. Today we have a standard deﬁnition of the yard,
which you can see marked on every football ﬁeld. If you move the ball ten yards, you get a ﬁrst down and it doesn’t
matter whether you are playing in Los Angeles, Dallas, or Green Bay. But at one time that yard was arbitrarily
deﬁned as the distance from the tip of the king’s nose to the end of his outstretched hand. Of course, the problem
there is simple: new king, new distance (and then you have to remark all those football ﬁelds).

SI Base Units

All measurements depend on the use of units that are well known and understood. The English system of measure-
ment units (inches, feet, ounces, etc.) are not used in science because of the difﬁculty in converting from one unit to
another. The metric system is used because all metric units are based on multiples of 10, making conversions very
simple. The metric system was originally established in France in 1795. The International System of Units is a
system of measurement based on the metric system. The acronym SI is commonly used to refer to this system and
stands for the French term, Le Système International d’Unités. The SI was adopted by international agreement in
1960 and is composed of seven base units, as shown in Table 3.1.

The ﬁrst ﬁve units are frequently encountered in chemistry. All other measurement quantities, such as volume, force,
and energy, can be derived from these seven base units.
The map in Figure 3.3 shows the adoption of the SI units in countries around the world. The United States has
legally adopted the metric system for measurements, but does not use it in everyday practice. Great Britain and
much of Canada use a combination of metric and imperial units.

Summary

• The SI system is based on multiples of ten.
• There are seven basic units in the SI system.
• Five of these units are commonly used in chemistry.

3.2 Metric Preﬁxes

• List common metric preﬁxes and their exponential values.
• Convert from one exponential factor to another for a given unit.

What do Latin and Greek have to do with modern science?
Isn’t it hard enough to learn English terms? For hundreds of years, the languages of the educated class were Latin
and Greek. In part, because the literature of philosophy was Latin and Greek. Even the medieval Bibles were written
in those two languages – the ﬁrst English translation was in the late 1380s. Using Latin and Greek allowed scholars
from different countries to communicate more easily with one another. Today we still see many Latin phrases in
legal communications (“pro bono” meaning to do something “for the good” and not charge legal fees), scientiﬁc
naming of biological species, and Latin is used for the annual student speech at Harvard University graduations. Not
bad for a “dead” language.

Metric Preﬁxes

Conversions between metric system units are straightforward because the system is based on powers of ten. For
example, meters, centimeters, and millimeters are all metric units of length. There are 10 millimeters in 1 centimeter

95

3.2. Metric Preﬁxes

www.ck12.org

and 100 centimeters in 1 meter. Metric preﬁxes are used to distinguish between units of different size. These
preﬁxes all derive from either Latin or Greek terms. For example, mega comes from the Greek word µ´εγας, meaning
“great”
Table 3.2 lists the most common metric preﬁxes and their relationship to the central unit that has no preﬁx. Length
is used as an example to demonstrate the relative size of each preﬁxed unit.

There are more preﬁxes - some of them rarely used. Have you ever heard of a zeptometer? You can learn more about
preﬁxes at https://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/preﬁxes.html .
There are a couple of odd little practices with the use of metric abbreviations. Most abbreviations are lower-case.
We use “m” for meter and not “M”. However, when it comes to volume, the base unit “liter” is abbreviated as “L”
and not “l”. So we would write 3.5 milliliters as 3.5 mL.
As a practical matter, whenever possible you should express the units in a small and manageable number. If you are
measuring the weight of a material that weighs 6.5 kg, this is easier than saying it weighs 6500 g or 0.65 dag. All
three are correct, but the kg units in this case make for a small and easily managed number. However, if a speciﬁc
problem needs grams instead of kilograms, go with the grams for consistency.

Summary

• Metric preﬁxes derive from Latin or Greek terms.
• The preﬁxes are used to make the units manageable.

3.3 Scientiﬁc Notation in Chemistry

• Deﬁne scientiﬁc (exponential) notation.
• Use this notation to simplify very large or very small numbers.

How far is the Sun from Earth?
Astronomers are used to really big numbers. While the moon is only 406,697 km from earth at its maximum
distance, the sun is much further away (150 million km). Proxima Centauri, the star nearest the earth, is 39, 900,
000, 000, 000 km away and we have just started on long distances. On the other end of the scale, some biologists
deal with very small numbers: a typical fungus could be as small as 30 µmeters (0.000030 meters) in length and a
virus might only be 0.03 µmeters (0.00000003 meters) long.

Scientiﬁc Notation

Scientiﬁc notation is a way to express numbers as the product of two numbers: a coefﬁcient and the number 10
raised to a power. It is a very useful tool for working with numbers that are either very large or very small. As
an example, the distance from Earth to the Sun is about 150,000,000,000 meters –a very large distance indeed.
In
scientiﬁc notation, the distance is written as 1.5 × 1011 m. The coefﬁcient is the 1.5 and must be a number greater
than or equal to 1 and less than 10. The power of 10, or exponent, is 11 because you would have to multiply 1.5 by
1011 to get the correct number. Scientiﬁc notation is sometimes referred to as exponential notation. A summary of
SI units is given in Table 3.3.

3.4 SI Length and Volume Units

• Deﬁne length.
• Deﬁne volume.
• Describe standard measure of length and volume.

How were sailors able to measure the depths of seas?

Back in the days before all the electronic gadgets for measuring depth and locating undersea objects existed, the
"fathom" was the unit of measurement for depth. A rope was knotted every six feet and the end was dropped over
the side of the ship. You could tell how deep the water was by how many knots went under the water before the rope
hit bottom. Today we just turn on an instrument and read the depth to a high level of accuracy.

Length and Volume

Length is the measurement of the extent of something along its greatest dimension. The SI basic unit of length, or
linear measure, is the meter (m). All measurements of length may be made in meters, though the preﬁxes listed in
various tables will often be more convenient. The width of a room may be expressed as about 5 meters (m), whereas
a large distance, such as the distance between New York City and Chicago, is better expressed as 1150 kilometers
(km). Very small distances can be expressed in units such as the millimeter or the micrometer. The width of a typical
human hair is about 20 micrometers (µm).
Volume is the amount of space occupied by a sample of matter. The volume of a regular object can be calculated
by multiplying its length by its width by its height. Since each of those is a linear measurement, we say that units
of volume are derived from units of length. The SI unit of volume is the cubic meter (m3), which is the volume
occupied by a cube that measures 1 m on each side. This very large volume is not very convenient for typical use
in a chemistry laboratory. A liter (L) is the volume of a cube that measures 10 cm (1 dm) on each side. A liter is
thus equal to both 1000 cm3 (10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm) and to 1 dm3. A smaller unit of volume that is commonly

101

3.4. SI Length and Volume Units

www.ck12.org

used is the milliliter (mL – note the capital L which is a standard practice). A milliliter is the volume of a cube that
measures 1 cm on each side. Therefore, a milliliter is equal to a cubic centimeter (cm3). There are 1000 mL in 1 L,
which is the same as saying that there are 1000 cm3 in 1 dm3.

3.5 SI Mass and Weight Units

• Deﬁne mass.
• Deﬁne weight.
• Explain the difference between mass and weight.

How is he ﬂoating?
One of the many interesting things about travel in outer space is the idea of weightlessness. If something is not
fastened down, it will ﬂoat in mid-air. Early astronauts learned that weightlessness had bad effects on bone structure.
If there was no pressure on the legs, those bones would begin to lose mass. Weight provided by gravity is needed
to maintain healthy bones. Specially designed equipment is now a part of every space mission so the astronauts can
maintain good body ﬁtness.

Mass and Weight

Mass is a measure of the amount of matter that an object contains. The mass of an object is made in comparison
to the standard mass of 1 kilogram. The kilogram was originally deﬁned as the mass of 1 L of liquid water at 4◦C
(volume of a liquid changes slightly with temperature). In the laboratory, mass is measured with a balance ( Figure
3.7), which must be calibrated with a standard mass so that its measurements are accurate.
Other common units of mass are the gram and the milligram. A gram is 1/1000th of a kilogram, meaning that there
are 1000 g in 1 kg. A milligram is 1/1000th of a gram, so there are 1000 mg in 1 g.
Mass is often confused with the term weight. Weight is a measure of force that is equal to the gravitational pull on
an object. The weight of an object is dependent on its location. On the moon, the force due to gravity is about one
sixth that of the gravitational force on Earth. Therefore, a given object will weigh six times more on Earth than it
does on the moon. Since mass is dependent only on the amount of matter present in an object, mass does not change
with location. Weight measurements are often made with a spring scale by reading the distance that a certain object
pulls down and stretches a spring.

3.6 SI Kinetic Energy Units

• Deﬁne kinetic energy.
• Deﬁne potential energy.
• Write the expression for calculating energy in joules.

Have you ever watched a cat in action?
When cats are chasing something, they move very fast. We may comment, “That cat has a lot of energy”. In saying
that, we are more correct than we realize. One form of energy is seen when an object is moving and this type of
energy is the basis for many chemical processes.

SI Kinetic Energy Units

An object’s kinetic energy is the energy due to motion. Kinetic energy can be deﬁned mathematically as

KE =

1
2

mv2

where KE = kinetic energy

m = mass
v = velocity

Energy is deﬁned as the capacity to do work or to produce heat. As discussed previously, kinetic energy is one
type of energy and is associated with motion. Another frequently encountered energy is potential energy, a type of
energy that is stored in matter and released during a chemical reaction. The joule (J) is the SI unit of energy and is
named after English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818-1889). If we go back to the equation for kinetic energy

107

3.6. SI Kinetic Energy Units

www.ck12.org

written above, we can put units in (kg for mass and m2/s2 for velocity squared). Then, in terms of SI base units a
joule is equal to a kilogram times meter squared divided by a second squared (kg • m2/s2). Another common unit of
energy that is often used is the calorie (cal), which is equivalent to 4.184 J.

• Energy is the capacity to do work or to produce heat.
• Kinetic energy is the energy due to motion.
• Potential energy is energy stored in matter.

3.7 Temperature and Temperature Scales

• Deﬁne temperature.
• Describe the Fahrenheit temperature scale.
• Describe the Celsius temperature scale.
• Describe the Kelvin temperature scale.

Touch the top of the stove after it has been on and it feels hot. Hold an ice cube in your hand and it feels cold.
Why? The particles of matter in a hot object are moving much faster than the particles of matter in a cold object.
An object’s kinetic energy is the energy due to motion. The particles of matter that make up the hot stove have a
greater amount of kinetic energy than those in the ice cube.

Temperature and Temperature Scales

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature
indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When
a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material.
Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes)
will be viable longer at lower temperatures.

FIGURE 3.9
The glowing charcoal on the left repre-
sents high kinetic energy, while the snow
and ice on the right are of much lower
kinetic energy.

Temperature Scales

The ﬁrst thermometers were glass and contained alcohol, which expanded and contracted as the temperature changed.
The German scientist, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit used mercury in the tube, an idea put forth by Ismael Boulliau. The
Fahrenheit scale was ﬁrst developed in 1724 and tinkered with for some time after that. The main problem with this
scale is the arbitrary deﬁnitions of temperature. The freezing point of water was deﬁned as 32°F and the boiling
point as 212°F. The Fahrenheit scale is typically not used for scientiﬁc purposes.
The Celsius scale of the metric system is named after Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701-1744). The Celsius
scale sets the freezing point and boiling point of water at 0°C and 100°C respectively. The distance between those
two points is divided into 100 equal intervals, each of which is one degree. Another term sometimes used for the
Celsius scale is “centigrade” because there are 100 degrees between the freezing and boiling points of water on this
scale. However, the preferred term is “Celsius.”
The Kelvin temperature scale is named after Scottish physicist and mathematician Lord Kelvin (1824-1907). It is
based on molecular motion, with the temperature of 0 K, also known as absolute zero, being the point where all

molecular motion ceases. The freezing point of water on the Kelvin scale is 273.15 K, while the boiling point is
373.15 K. Notice that here is no “degree” used in the temperature designation. Unlike the Fahrenheit and Celsius
scales where temperatures are referred to as “degrees F” or “degrees C,” we simply designated temperatures in the
Kelvin scale as kelvins.
As can be seen by the 100 kelvin difference between the two, a change of one degree on the Celsius scale is equivalent
to the change of one kelvin on the Kelvin scale. Converting from one scale to another is easy, as you simply add or
subtract 273.

Summary

• Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter.
• The Fahrenheit scale deﬁnes the freezing point of water as 32°F and the boiling point as 212°F.
• The Celsius scale sets the freezing point and boiling point of water at 0°C and 100°C respectively.
• The Kelvin scale is based on molecular motion, with the temperature of 0 K, also known as absolute zero,

being the point where all molecular motion ceases.

Conversion Factors

Many quantities can be expressed in several different ways. The English system measurement of 4 cups is also equal
to 2 pints, 1 quart, and 1

4 of a gallon.

4 cups = 2 pints = 1 quart = 0.25 gallon

Notice that the numerical component of each quantity is different, while the actual amount of material that it
represents is the same. That is because the units are different. We can establish the same set of equalities for
the metric system:

1 meter = 10 decimeters = 100 centimeters = 100 millimeters

The metric system’s use of powers of 10 for all conversions makes this quite simple.
Whenever two quantities are equal, a ratio can be written that is numerically equal to 1. Using the metric examples
above:

100 cm = 1 m

1 m
100 cm = 100 cm
1 m
100 cm is called a conversion factor. A conversion factor is a ratio of equivalent measurements. Because both
The
1 m and 100 cm represent the exact same length, the value of the conversion factor is 1. The conversion factor is
read as “1 meter per 100 centimeters”. Other conversion factors from the cup measurement example can be:

1 m = 1

4 cups
2 pints =

2 pints
1 quart =

1 quart
0.25 gallon = 1

Since the numerator and denominator represent equal quantities in each case, all are valid conversion factors.

Scientiﬁc Dimensional Analysis

Conversion factors are used in solving problems in which a certain measurement must be expressed with different
units. When a given measurement is multiplied by an appropriate conversion factor, the numerical value changes,
but the actual size of the quantity measured remains the same. Dimensional analysis is a technique that uses the
units (dimensions) of the measurement in order to correctly solve problems. Dimensional analysis is best illustrated
with an example.

Sample Problem: Dimensional Analysis

How many seconds are in a day?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• 1 day = 24 hours
• 1 hour = 60 minutes
• 1 minute = 60 seconds

114

www.ck12.org

Unknown

• 1 day = ? seconds

Chapter 3. Measurements

The known quantities above represent the conversion factors that we will use. The ﬁrst conversion factor will have
day in the denominator so that the “day” unit will cancel. The second conversion factor will then have hours in the
denominator, while the third conversion factor will have minutes in the denominator. As a result, the unit of the last
numerator will be seconds and that will be the units for the answer.
Step 2: Calculate

1 d× 24 h
1 d

× 60 min
1 h

× 60 s
1 min

= 86,400 s

Applying the ﬁrst conversion factor, the “d” unit cancels and 1 × 24 = 24. Applying the second conversion
factor, the “h” unit cancels and 24 × 60 = 1440. Applying the third conversion factor, the “min” unit cancels
and 1440 × 60 = 86,400. The unit that remains is “s” for seconds.
Step 3: Think about your result.
Seconds is a much smaller unit of time than a day, so it makes sense that there are a very large number of seconds in
one day.

3.9 Metric Unit Conversions

• Use dimensional analysis to carry out metric unit conversions.

How can a number of track laps be converted to a distance in meters?

You are training for a 10-kilometer run by doing laps on a 400-meter track. You ask yourself “How many times do
I need to run around this track in order to cover ten kilometers?” (more than you realize). By using dimensional
analysis, you can easily determine the number of laps needed to cover the 10 k distance.

Metric Unit Conversions

The metric system’s many preﬁxes allow quantities to be expressed in many different units. Dimensional analysis is
useful to convert from one metric system unit to another.
Sample Problem: Metric Unit Conversions
A particular experiment requires 120 mL of a solution. The teacher knows that he will need to make enough solution
for 40 experiments to be performed throughout the day. How many liters of solution should he prepare?

Chapter 3. Measurements

Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• 1 exp requires 120 mL
• 1 L = 1000 mL

Unknown

• L of solution for 40 exp

Since each experiment requires 120 ml of solution and the teacher needs to prepare enough for 40 experiments,
multiply 120 by 40 to get 4800 mL of solution needed. Now you must convert ml to L by using a conversion factor.
Step 2: Calculate

4800 mL× 1 L

1000 mL

= 4.8 L

Note that conversion factor is arranged so that the mL unit is in the denominator and thus cancels out, leaving L as
the remaining unit in the answer.
Step 3: Think about your result.
A liter is much larger than a milliliter, so it makes sense that the number of liters required is less than the number of
milliliters.

Two-Step Metric Unit Conversions

Some metric conversion problems are most easily solved by breaking them down into more than one step. When
both the given unit and the desired unit have preﬁxes, one can ﬁrst convert to the simple (unpreﬁxed) unit, followed
by a conversion to the desired unit. An example will illustrate this method.

Convert 4.3 cm to µm.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• 1 m = 100 cm
• 1 m = 106 µm

Unknown

• 4.3 cm = ? µm

You may need to consult a table for the multiplication factor represented by each metric preﬁx. First convert cm to
m, followed by a conversion of m to µm.

to builders who want to erect either commercial or residential properties. In order to sell, an accurate property tile is
needed. The dimensions of the farm must be determined and the acreage calculated from those dimensions.
Dimensional Analysis and Derived Units
Some units are combinations of SI base units. A derived unit is a unit that results from a mathematical combination
of SI base units. We have already discussed volume and energy as two examples of derived units. Some others are
listed in the Table 3.4:

Using dimensional analysis with derived units requires special care. When units are squared or cubed as with area
or volume, the conversion factors themselves must also be squared. Shown below is the conversion factor for cubic
centimeters and cubic meters.

(cid:0) 1 m

100 cm

(cid:1)3

= 1 m3

106 cm3 = 1

Because a cube has 3 sides, each side is subject to the conversion of 1 m to 100 cm. Since 100 cubed is equal to
1 million (106), there are 106 cm3 in 1 m3. Two convenient volume units are the liter, which is equal to a cubic
decimeter, and the milliliter, which is equal to a cubic centimeter. The conversion factor would be:

(cid:17)3

(cid:16) 1 dm

10 cm

= 1 dm3

1000 cm3 = 1

There are thus 1000 cm3 in 1 dm3, which is the same thing as saying there are 1000 mL in 1 L

FIGURE 3.14
There are 1000 cm3 in 1 dm3. Since a
cm3 is equal to a mL and a dm3 is equal
to a L, we can say that there are 1000 mL
in 1 L.

Sample Problem: Derived Unit Conversion
Convert 3.6 × 108 mm3 to mL.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• 1 m = 1000 mm
• 1 ml = 1 cm3
• 1 m = 100 cm

Unknown

• 3.6 mm3 = ? mL

This problem requires multiple steps and the technique for converting with derived units. Simply proceed one step
at a time: mm3 to m3 to cm3 = mL.

(cid:19)3 × 1 mL

1 cm3 = 0.0036 mL

Numerically, the steps are to divide 3.6 by 109, followed by multiplying by 106. You may ﬁnd that you can shorten
the problem by a step by ﬁrst determining the conversion factor from mm to cm and using that instead of ﬁrst
converting to m. There are 10 mm in 1 cm.

3.6 mm3 ×(cid:0) 1 cm

10 mm

(cid:1)3 × 1 mL

1 cm3 = 0.0036 mL

In this case 3.6 / 1000 gives the same result of 0.0036.
Step 3: Think about your result.
Cubic millimeters are much smaller than cubic centimeters, so the ﬁnal answer is much less than the original number
of mm3.

How do logs stay aﬂoat in water?

After trees are cut, logging companies often move these materials down a river to a sawmill where they can be shaped
into building materials or other products. The logs ﬂoat on the water because they are less dense than the water they
are in. Knowledge of density is important in the characterization and separation of materials.
Information about
density allows us to make predictions about the behavior of matter.

Density

A golf ball and a table tennis ball are about the same size. However, the golf ball is much heavier than the table tennis
ball. Now imagine a similar size ball made out of lead. That would be very heavy indeed! What are we comparing?
By comparing the mass of an object relative to its size, we are studying a property called density. Density is the
ratio of the mass of an object to its volume.

Chapter 3. Measurements

Density is an intensive property, meaning that it does not depend on the amount of material present in the sample.
Water has a density of 1.0 g/mL. That density is the same whether you have a small glass of water or a swimming
pool full of water. Density is a property that is constant for the particular identity of the matter being studied.
The SI units of density are kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3), since the kg and the m are the SI units for mass and
length respectively. In everyday usage in a laboratory, this unit is awkwardly large. Most solids and liquids have
densities that are conveniently expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). Since a cubic centimeter is equal to
a milliliter, density units can also be expressed as g/mL. Gases are much less dense than solids and liquids, so their
densities are often reported in g/L. Densities of some common substances at 20°C are listed in the Table 3.5

Since most materials expand as temperature increases, the density of a substance is temperature dependent and
usually decreases as temperature increases.
You know that ice ﬂoats in water and it can be seen from the table that ice is less dense. Alternatively, corn syrup,
being denser, would sink if placed into water.

Sample Problem: Density Calculations

An 18.2 g sample of zinc metal has a volume of 2.55 cm3. Calculate the density of zinc.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• mass = 18.2 g
• volume = 2.55 cm3

Unknown

• density = ? g/cm3

Use the equation for density, D = m
Step 2: Calculate

V , to solve the problem.

D = m

V =

18.2 g
2.55 cm3 = 7.14 g/cm3

Step 3: Think about your result.

123

3.11. Density

www.ck12.org

If 1 cm3 of zinc has a mass of about 7 grams, then 2 and a half cm3 will have a mass about 2 and a half times as
great. Metals are expected to have a density greater than that of water and zinc’s density falls within the range of the
other metals listed above
Since density values are known for many substances, density can be used to determine an unknown mass or an
unknown volume. Dimensional analysis will be used to ensure that units cancel appropriately.

Sample Problem: Using Density to Determine Mass and Volume

1. What is the mass of 2.49 cm3 of aluminum?
2. What is the volume of 50.0 g of aluminum?

Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• density = 2.70 g/cm3
• 1. volume = 2.49 cm3
• 2. mass = 50.0 g

Unknown

• 1. mass = ? g
• 2. volume = ? cm3

Use the equation for density, D = m
Step 2: Calculate

V , and dimensional analysis to solve each problem.

1. 2.49 cm3 × 2.70 g
2. 50.0 g× 1 cm3

1 cm3 = 6.72 g
2.70 g = 18.5 cm3

In problem 1, the mass is equal to the density multiplied by the volume. In problem 2, the volume is equal to the
mass divided by the density.
Step 3: Think about your results.
Because a mass of 1 cm3 of aluminum is 2.70 g, the mass of about 2.5 cm3 should be about 2.5 times larger. The 50
g of aluminum is substantially more than its density, so that amount should occupy a relatively large volume.

Summary

• Density is the ratio of the mass of an object to its volume.
• Gases are less dense that either solids or liquids
• Both liquid and solid materials can have a variety of densities
• For liquids and gases, the temperature will affect the density to some extent.

3.12 Accuracy and Precision

• Deﬁne accuracy.
• Deﬁne precision.
• Describe situations with varying levels of accuracy and precision.

How do professional basketball players improve their shooting accuracy?

Basketball is one of those sports where you need to hit the target. A football ﬁeld goal kicker might have room for
some deviation from a straight line –for college and pro football there is an 18 foot 6 inch space for the ball to go
through.
In basketball, the basket is only 18 inches across and the ball is a little less than 10 inches across –not
much room for error. The ball has to be on target in order to go into the basket and score.

Accuracy and Precision

In everyday speech, the terms accuracy and precision are frequently used interchangeably. However, their scientiﬁc
meanings are quite different. Accuracy is a measure of how close a measurement is to the correct or accepted value
of the quantity being measured. Precision is a measure of how close a series of measurements are to one another.
Precise measurements are highly reproducible, even if the measurements are not near the correct value.
Darts thrown at a dartboard are helpful in illustrating accuracy and precision
Assume that three darts are thrown at the dartboard, with the bulls-eye representing the true, or accepted, value of
what is being measured. A dart that hits the bulls-eye is highly accurate, whereas a dart that lands far away from the
bulls-eye displays poor accuracy. The Figure 3.15 demonstrates four possible outcomes.

Chapter 3. Measurements

FIGURE 3.15
The distribution of darts on a dartboard
shows the difference between accuracy
and precision.

a. The darts have landed far from each other and far from the bulls-eye. This grouping demonstrates measure-

ments that are neither accurate, nor precise.

b. The darts are close to one another, but far from the bulls-eye. This grouping demonstrates measurements that
are precise, but not accurate. In a laboratory situation, high precision with low accuracy often results from a
systematic error. Either the measurer makes the same mistake repeatedly or the measuring tool is somehow
ﬂawed. A poorly calibrated balance may give the same mass reading every time, but it will be far from the
true mass of the object.

c. The darts are not grouped very near to each other, but are generally centered around the bulls-eye. This
demonstrates poor precision, but fairly high accuracy. This situation is not desirable in a lab situation because
the “high” accuracy may simply be random chance and not a true indicator of good measuring skill.

d. The darts are grouped together and have hit the bulls-eye.

This demonstrates high precision and high

accuracy. Scientists always strive to maximize both in their measurements.

3.13 Percent Error

• Deﬁne accepted value.
• Deﬁne experimental value.
• Deﬁne error and calculate the error given appropriate data.
• Deﬁne percent error and calculate the error given appropriate data.

How does an electrical circuit work?

A complicated piece of electronics equipment may contain several resistors whose role is to control the voltage and
current in the electrical circuit. Too much current and the apparatus malfunctions. Too little current and the system
simply does not perform. The resistors values are always given with an error range. A resistor may have a stated
value of 200 ohms, but a 10% error range, meaning the resistance could be anywhere between 195-205 ohms. By
knowing these values, an electronics person can design and service the equipment to make sure it functions properly.

Percent Error

An individual measurement may be accurate or inaccurate, depending on how close it is to the true value. Suppose
that you are doing an experiment to determine the density of a sample of aluminum metal. The accepted value of
a measurement is the true or correct value based on general agreement with a reliable reference. For aluminum the
accepted density is 2.70 g/cm3. The experimental value of a measurement is the value that is measured during the
experiment. Suppose that in your experiment you determine an experimental value for the aluminum density to be
2.42 g/cm3. The error of an experiment is the difference between the experimental and accepted values.

129

3.13. Percent Error

www.ck12.org

Error = experimental value− accepted value

If the experimental value is less than the accepted value, the error is negative. If the experimental value is larger than
the accepted value, the error is positive. Often, error is reported as the absolute value of the difference in order to
avoid the confusion of a negative error. The percent error is the absolute value of the error divided by the accepted
value and multiplied by 100%.

% Error =

|experimental value− accepted value|

accepted value

× 100%

To calculate the percent error for the aluminum density measurement, we can substitute the given values of 2.45
g/cm3 for the experimental value and 2.70 g/cm3 for the accepted value.

% Error =

|2.45 g/cm3 − 2.70 g/cm3|

2.70 g/cm3

× 100% = 9.26%

If the experimental value is equal to the accepted value, the percent error is equal to 0. As the accuracy of a
measurement decreases, the percent error of that measurement rises.

Summary

• Deﬁnitions of accepted value and experimental value are given.
• Calculations of error and percent error are demonstrated.

3.14 Measurement Uncertainty

• Describe uncertainty in measurements.

How do police ofﬁcers identify criminals?

After a bank robbery has been committed, police will ask witnesses to describe the robbers. They will usually get
some answer such as “medium height.” Others may say “between 5 foot 8 inches and 5 foot 10 inches.” In both
cases, there is a signiﬁcant amount of uncertainty about the height of the criminals.

Measurement Uncertainty

Some error or uncertainty always exists in any measurement. The amount of uncertainty depends both upon the
skill of the measurer and upon the quality of the measuring tool. While some balances are capable of measuring
masses only to the nearest 0.1 g, other highly sensitive balances are capable of measuring to the nearest 0.001 g or
even better. Many measuring tools such as rulers and graduated cylinders have small lines which need to be carefully
read in order to make a measurement. The ﬁgure below shows two rulers making the same measurement of an object
(indicated by the blue arrow).
With either ruler, it is clear that the length of the object is between 2 and 3 cm. The bottom ruler contains no
millimeter markings. With that ruler, the tenths digit can be estimated and the length may be reported as 2.5
cm. However, another person may judge that the measurement is 2.4 cm or perhaps 2.6 cm. While the 2 is
known for certain, the value of the tenths digit is uncertain.
The top ruler contains marks for tenths of a centimeter (millimeters). Now the same object may be measured as 2.55
cm. The measurer is capable of estimating the hundredths digit because he can be certain that the tenths digit is a 5.

131

3.14. Measurement Uncertainty

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 3.17
Uncertainty in measurement.

Again, another measurer may report the length to be 2.54 cm or 2.56 cm. In this case, there are two certain digits
(the 2 and the 5), with the hundredths digit being uncertain. Clearly, the top ruler is a superior ruler for measuring
lengths as precisely as possible.

Summary

• Uncertainty exists in all measurements.
• The degree of uncertainty is affected in part by the quality of the measuring tool.

3.15 Signiﬁcant Figures

• Deﬁne signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
• Use signiﬁcant ﬁgure rules to express numerical values correctly.

How fast do you drive?

As you enter the town of Jacinto City, Texas, the sign below tells you that the speed limit is 30 miles per hour. But
what if you happen to be driving 31 miles an hour? Are you in trouble? Probably not, because there is a certain
amount of leeway built into enforcing the regulation. Most speedometers do not measure the vehicle speed very
accurately and could easily be off by a mile or so (on the other hand, radar measurements are much more accurate).
So, a couple of miles/hour difference won’t matter that much. Just don’t try to stretch the limits any further unless
you want a trafﬁc ticket.

Signiﬁcant Figures

The signiﬁcant ﬁgures in a measurement consist of all the certain digits in that measurement plus one uncertain or
estimated digit. In the ruler illustration below, the bottom ruler gave a length with 2 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, while the
top ruler gave a length with 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures. In a correctly reported measurement, the ﬁnal digit is signiﬁcant
but not certain. Insigniﬁcant digits are not reported. With either ruler, it would not be possible to report the length
as 2.553 cm as there is no possible way that the thousandths digit could be estimated. The 3 is not signiﬁcant and
would not be reported.
When you look at a reported measurement, it is necessary to be able to count the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures. The
Table 3.6 details the rules for determining the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in a reported measurement. For the
examples in the table, assume that the quantities are correctly reported values of a measured quantity.

3.15. Signiﬁcant Figures

FIGURE 3.18
Measurement with two different rulers.

TABLE 3.6: Signiﬁcant Figure Rules

Rule
1. All nonzero digits in a measurement are signiﬁcant

2. Zeros that appear between other nonzero digits are
always signiﬁcant.
3. Zeros that appear in front of all of the nonzero digits
are called left-end zeros.
Left-end zeros are never
signiﬁcant
4. Zeros that appear after all nonzero digits are called
right-end zeros. Right-end zeros in a number that lacks
a decimal point are not signiﬁcant.
5. Right-end zeros in a number with a decimal point are
signiﬁcant. This is true whether the zeros occur before
or after the decimal point.

Examples
A. 237 has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
B. 1.897 has four signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
A. 39,004 has ﬁve signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
B. 5.02 has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures
A. 0.008 has one signiﬁcant ﬁgure.
B. 0.000416 has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

A. 140 has two signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
B. 75,210 has four signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

A. 620.0 has four signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
B. 19.000 has ﬁve signiﬁcant ﬁgures

It needs to be emphasized that to say a certain digit is not signiﬁcant does not mean that it is not important or can
be left out. Though the zero in a measurement of 140 may not be signiﬁcant, the value cannot simply be reported as
14. An insigniﬁcant zero functions as a placeholder for the decimal point. When numbers are written in scientiﬁc
notation, this becomes more apparent. The measurement 140 can be written as 1.4 × 102 with two signiﬁcant
ﬁgures in the coefﬁcient. For a number with left-end zeros, such as 0.000416, it can be written as 4.16 × 10−4 with
3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures. In some cases, scientiﬁc notation is the only way to correctly indicate the correct number of
signiﬁcant ﬁgures. In order to report a value of 15,000,000 with four signiﬁcant ﬁgures, it would need to be written
as 1.500 × 107. The right-end zeros after the 5 are signiﬁcant. The original number of 15,000,000 only has two
signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Summary

• Signiﬁcant ﬁgures give an indication of the certainty of a measurement.
• Rules allow decisions to be made about how many digits to use in any given situation.

3.16 Rounding

• Learn and apply rules for rounding numbers.

Have you ever been ﬁshing?

People who ﬁsh often are a little unreliable when it comes to describing what they caught and how much it weighed.
It’s easier to say your ﬁsh weighed ten pounds than it is to accurately describe the weight of 8 pounds 11 ounces.
Ten pounds is “close enough” when you are talking about your catch.

Rounding

Before dealing with the speciﬁcs of the rules for determining the signiﬁcant ﬁgures in a calculated result, we need to
be able to round numbers correctly. To round a number, ﬁrst decide how many signiﬁcant ﬁgures the number should
have. Once you know that, round to that many digits, starting from the left. If the number immediately to the right
of the last signiﬁcant digit is less than 5, it is dropped and the value of the last signiﬁcant digit remains the same. If
the number immediately to the right of the last signiﬁcant digit is greater than or equal to 5, the last signiﬁcant digit
is increased by 1.
Consider the measurement 207.518 m. Right now, the measurement contains six signiﬁcant ﬁgures. How would we
successively round it to fewer and fewer signiﬁcant ﬁgures? Follow the process as outlined in Table 3.7.

Who should report the numbers - you or your calculator?

Calculators do just what you ask of them, no more and no less. However, they sometimes can get a little out
of hand.
If I multiply 2.48 times 6.3, I get an answer of 15.687, a value that ignores the number of signiﬁcant
ﬁgures in either number. Division with a calculator is even worse. When I divide 12.2 by 1.7, the answer I obtain
is 7.176470588. Neither piece of data is accurate to nine decimal places, but the calculator doesn’t know that. The
human being operating the instrument has to make the decision about how many places to report.

Uncertainty in Multiplication and Division

The density of a certain object is calculated by dividing the mass by the volume. Suppose that a mass of 37.46 g is
divided by a volume of 12.7 cm3. The result on a calculator would be:

D =

m
V =

37.46 g
12.7 cm3 = 2.949606299 g/cm3

The value of the mass measurement has four signiﬁcant ﬁgures, while the value of the volume measurement has
only three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. For multiplication and division problems, the answer should be rounded to the same

137

3.17. Uncertainty in Multiplication and Division

www.ck12.org

number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures as the measurement with the least number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Applying this rule
results in a density of 2.95 g/cm3, for three signiﬁcant ﬁgures –the same as the volume measurement.

Sample Problem: Signiﬁcant Figures in Calculations

Perform the following calculations, rounding the answers to the appropriate number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

A. 0.048 m× 32.97 m
B. 14,570 kg÷ 5.81 L

Step 1: Plan the problem.
Analyze each of the measured values to determine how many signiﬁcant ﬁgures should be in the result. Perform the
calculation and round appropriately. Apply the correct units to the answer. When multiplying or dividing, the units
are also multiplied or divided.
Step 2: Calculate

A. 0.048 m× 32.97 m = 1.6 m2 Round to two signiﬁcant ﬁgures because 0.048 has two.
B. 14,570 kg÷ 5.81 L = 2510 kg/L Round to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures because 5.81 has three.

Summary

• For multiplication and division problems, the answer should be rounded to the same number of signiﬁcant

ﬁgures as the measurement with the least number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

3.18 Uncertainty in Addition and Subtraction

• State the rule for rounding values obtained by addition or subtraction.
• Apply the rule to appropriate problems.

How old do you think this calculator is?

Calculators are great devices. Their invention has allowed for quick computation at work, school, or other places
where manipulation of numbers needs to be done rapidly and accurately. But they are only as good as the numbers
put into them. The calculator cannot determine how accurate each of a set of numbers is and the answer given on
the screen must be assessed by the user for reliability.

Uncertainty in Addition and Subtraction

Consider two separate mass measurements: 16.7 g and 5.24 g. The ﬁrst mass measurement (16.7 g) is known only
to the tenths place or to one digit after the decimal point. There is no information about its hundredths place and so
that digit cannot be assumed to be zero. The second measurement (5.24 g) is known to the hundredths place or to
two digits after the decimal point.

139

3.18. Uncertainty in Addition and Subtraction

www.ck12.org

When these masses are added together, the result on a calculator is 16.7 + 5.24 = 21.94 g. Reporting the answer as
21.94 g suggests that the sum is known all the way to the hundredths place. However that cannot be true because
the hundredths place of the ﬁrst mass was completely unknown. The calculated answer needs to be rounded in such
a way as to reﬂect the certainty of each of the measured values that contributed to it. For addition and subtraction
problems, the answer should be rounded to the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the least
number of decimal places. The sum of the above masses would be properly rounded to a result of 21.9 g.
When working with whole numbers, pay attention to the last signiﬁcant digit that is to the left of the decimal point
and round your answer to that same point. For example, consider the subtraction: 78,500 m –362 m. The calculated
result is 78,138 m. However, the ﬁrst measurement is known only to the hundreds place, as the 5 is the last signiﬁcant
digit. Rounding the result to that same point means that the correct result is 78,100 m.

Summary

• For addition and subtraction problems, the answer should be rounded to the same number of decimal places

as the measurement with the least number of decimal places.

4.1. Democritus’ Idea of the Atom

www.ck12.org

4.1 Democritus’ Idea of the Atom

• Describe how the Greek philosophers approached nature.
• Describe the discussion about matter.
• Describe the contribution Democritus made to our understanding of matter.

What would the philosophers do?

People enjoy getting together to discuss things, whether it is how your favorite sports team is doing, what the best
new movie is, the current politics, or any number of other topics. Often the question is raised about who is right
and who is wrong. If the football game is to be played this coming weekend, all we can do is offer opinions as to its
outcome. The game has not been played yet, so we don’t know who will actually win.
The ancient Greek philosophers did a lot of discussing, with part of their conversations concerning the physical
world and its composition. There were different opinions about what made up matter. Some felt one thing was
true while others believed another set of ideas. Since these scholars did not have laboratories and had not developed
the idea of the experiment, they were left to debate. Whoever could offer the best argument was considered right.
However, often the best argument had little to do with reality.
One of the on-going debates had to do with sand. The question posed was: into how small of pieces can you divide
a grain of sand? The prevailing thought at the time, pushed by Aristotle, was that the grain of sand could be divided

144

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Atomic Structure

indeﬁnitely, that you could always get a smaller particle by dividing a larger one and there was no limit to how small
the resulting particle could be.

FIGURE 4.1
Into how small of pieces can you divide a
grain of sand?

Since Aristotle was such an inﬂuential philosopher, very few people disagreed with him. However, there were
some philosophers who believed that there was a limit to how small a grain of sand could be divided. One of
these philosophers was Democritus (~460-~370 B.C.), often referred to as the “laughing philosopher” because of
his emphasis on cheerfulness. He taught that there were substances called atoms and that these atoms made up all
material things. The atoms were unchangeable, indestructible, and always existed.

FIGURE 4.2
Democritus.

The word “ atom” comes from the Greek atomos and means “indivisible.” The atomists of the time (Democritus
being one of the leading atomists) believed there were two realities that made up the physical world: atoms and void.
There was an inﬁnite number of atoms, but different types of atoms had different sizes and shapes. The void was the
empty space in which the atoms moved and collided with one another. When these atoms collided with one another,
they might repel each other or they might connect in clusters, held together by tiny hooks and barbs on the surface
of the atoms.
Aristotle disagreed with Democritus and offered his own idea of the composition of matter. According to Aristotle,

145

4.1. Democritus’ Idea of the Atom

www.ck12.org

everything was composed of four elements: earth, air, ﬁre, and water. The theory of Democritus explained things
better, but Aristotle was more inﬂuential, so his ideas prevailed. We had to wait almost two thousand years before
scientists came around to seeing the atom as Democritus did.

How right was Democritus?

It is very interesting that Democritus had the basic idea of atoms, even though he had no experimental evidence to
support his thinking. We now know more about how atoms hold together in “clusters” (compounds), but the basic
concept existed over two thousand years ago. We also know that atoms can be further subdivided, but there is still
a lower limit to how small we can break up that grain of sand.

Summary

• Greek philosophers debated about many things.
• Aristotle and others believed that a grain of sand could be divided indeﬁnitely.
• Democritus believed there was a lower limit to the dividing of a grain of sand.

4.2 Conservation of Mass

• Describe an example of mass remaining the same in a change of matter.
• State the law of conservation of mass.

If you build a campﬁre like this one, you start with a big pile of logs. As the ﬁre burns, the pile of logs slowly
shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that’s left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you
started with? Was it destroyed by the ﬁre?

Where’s the Matter?

It may seem as though burning destroys matter, but the same amount, or mass, of matter still exists after a campﬁre
as before. Look at the sketch in Figure 4.3. It shows that when wood burns, it combines with oxygen and changes
not only to ashes but also to carbon dioxide and water vapor. The gases ﬂoat off into the air, leaving behind just the
ashes. Suppose you had measured the mass of the wood before it burned and the mass of the ashes after it burned.
Also suppose you had been able to measure the oxygen used by the ﬁre and the gases produced by the ﬁre. What
would you ﬁnd? The total mass of matter after the ﬁre would be the same as the total mass of matter before the ﬁre.
Q: What can you infer from this example?
A: You can infer that burning does not destroy matter. It just changes matter into different substances.

Law of Conservation of Mass

This burning campﬁre example illustrates a very important law in science: the law of conservation of mass. This
law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Even when matter goes through a physical or chemical change,
the total mass of matter always remains the same.
Q: How could you show that the mass of matter remains the same when matter changes state?

A: You could ﬁnd the mass of a quantity of liquid water. Then you could freeze the water and ﬁnd the mass of the
ice. The mass before and after freezing would be the same, showing that mass is conserved when matter changes
state.

Summary

• Burning and other changes in matter do not destroy matter. The mass of matter is always the same before and

after the changes occur.

• The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed.

4.3 Law of Deﬁnite Proportions

• State the law of deﬁnite proportions.

We use electricity for many purposes, from cooking to powering our televisions to charging our cell phones. Wher-
ever we travel in the United States, we want electricity to be available. What we also want (although we usually
don’t think about it) is for the electricity supply to be the same wherever we go. We want the same voltage (110
volts for the U.S.) to come from the outlet to whatever we plug in. If the voltage is less, the system will not work. If
it is more, the equipment will be damaged. We want a deﬁnite amount of voltage –no more and no less.

Law of Deﬁnite Proportions

The discovery that mass was always conserved in chemical reactions was soon followed by the law of deﬁnite
proportions, which states that a given chemical compound always contains the same elements in the exact same
proportions by mass. As an example, any sample of pure water contains 11.19% hydrogen and 88.81% oxygen by
mass. It does not matter where the sample of water came from or how it was prepared. Its composition, like that of
every other compound, is ﬁxed.
Another example is carbon dioxide. This gas is produced from a variety of reactions, often by the burning of
materials. The structure of the gas consists of one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen. Carbon dioxide
production is of interest in many areas, from the amount we breather out to the amount of the gas produced by
burning wood or fossil fuels. By knowing the exact composition of carbon dioxide, we can make predictions as to
the effects of different chemical processes.

Summary

• The law of deﬁnite proportions states that a given chemical compound always contains the same elements in

the exact same proportions by mass.

4.4 Law of Multiple Proportions

• State the law of multiple proportions.

What are the similarities and differences between a unicycle and a bicycle?
Just from the words themselves, the astute Latin-speaking scholar can tell that, whatever it is made of, the unicycle
has one of them (uni = “one”) and the bicycle has two (bi = “two”). From the picture above, we get additional
information that helps us tell the two apart. The unicycle has one wheel and the bicycle has two. In particular,
they are made up of the same materials and the only signiﬁcant difference is the number of wheels on the two
vehicles. Now - how many wheels on a tricycle?

Law of Multiple Proportions

Once the idea that elements combined in deﬁnite proportions to form compounds was established, experiments also
began to demonstrate that the same pairs of certain elements could combine to form more than one compound. Con-
sider the elements carbon and oxygen. Combined in one way, they form the familiar compound called carbon
dioxide.
In every sample of carbon dioxide, there is 32.0 g of oxygen present for every 12.0 g of carbon. By
dividing 32.0 by 12.0, this simpliﬁes to a mass ratio of oxygen to carbon of 2.66 to 1. There is another compound
that forms from the combination of carbon and oxygen called carbon monoxide. Every sample of carbon monoxide
contains 16.0 g of oxygen for every 12.0 g of carbon. This is a mass ratio of oxygen to carbon of 1.33 to 1. In the
carbon dioxide, there is exactly twice as much oxygen present as there is in the carbon monoxide. This example
illustrates the law of multiple proportions: Whenever the same two elements form more than one compound, the
different masses of one element that combine with the same mass of the other element are in the ratio of small whole
numbers.
In carbon monoxide, on the left, there is 1.333 g of oxygen for every 1 g of carbon. In carbon dioxide, on the right,
there is 2.666 g of oxygen for every gram of carbon. So the ratio of oxygen in the two compounds is 1:2, a small
whole number ratio.

152

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Atomic Structure

FIGURE 4.6
Carbon can form two different compounds
with oxygen.

The difference between carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is signiﬁcant. Carbon monoxide is a deadly gas,
formed from the incomplete combustion of some carbon-containing materials (such as wood and gasoline). This
compound will attach to hemoglobin in the red blood cell and block the binding of oxygen to those cells. If oxygen
does not bind, it cannot be carried to the cells of the body where it is needed and death can occur. Carbon dioxide,
on the other hand, is not toxic like carbon monoxide is. However, it can displace oxygen in systems since it is
heavier. Carbon dioxide ﬁre extinguishers cut off the ﬂow of oxygen in a ﬁre, putting out the ﬁre.

Summary

• The law of multiple proportions states that whenever the same two elements form more than one compound,
the different masses of one element that combine with the same mass of the other element are in the ratio of
small whole numbers.

4.5 Mass Ratio Calculation

• Deﬁne mass ratio.
• Calculate the mass ratio of an element in two different compounds.

What are the similarities and differences between these two equations?

One of the fundamental laws of chemistry deals with the fact that we cannot (using chemical means) create or destroy
matter. When a reaction is run, the number of atoms of each speciﬁc type must be the same on both sides of the
equation. For some materials, it turns out that one element can combine with a second element in more than one
ratio. Carrying out mass ratio calculations helped establish the law of multiple proportions.

Mass Ratio Calculations

Copper reacts with chlorine to form two compounds. Compound A consists of 4.08 g of copper for every 2.28 g of
chlorine. Compound B consists of 7.53 g of copper for every 8.40 g of chlorine. What is the lowest whole number
mass ratio of copper that combines with a given mass of chlorine?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.

Known
Compound A = 4.08 g Cu and 2.28 g Cl
Compound B = 7.53 g Cu and 8.40 g Cl

Apply the law of multiple proportions to the two compounds. For each compound, ﬁnd the grams of copper that
combine with 1.00 g of chlorine by dividing the mass of copper by the mass of chlorine. Then ﬁnd the ratio of the
masses of copper in the two compounds by dividing the larger value by the smaller value.
Step 2: Calculate

Compare the masses of copper per gram of chlorine in the two samples.
1.79 g Cu (in compound A)
0.896 g Cu (in compound B) = 2.00
The mass ratio of copper per gram of chlorine in the two compounds is 2:1.
Step 3: Think about your result.
The ratio is a small whole-number ratio. For a given mass of chlorine, compound A contains twice the mass of
copper as does compound B.

Pick a little, talk a little, pick a little, talk a little,
Cheep cheep cheep, talk a lot, pick a little more
These lyrics from the musical “Music Man” summed up the way science was done for centuries. OK, the lyrics
referred to a group of gossiping ladies, but the outcome was the same. The Greek and Roman philosophers
debated, discussed, and sometimes even attacked one another. But the mode of discovery was talk. There was
no experimentation –the idea had not been thought of yet. So science did not develop very far and there was no
reliable way to establish what was true and what was false.

John Dalton

While it must be assumed that many more scientists, philosophers and others studied the composition of matter after
Democritus, a major leap forward in our understanding of the composition of matter took place in the 1800s with
the work of the British scientist John Dalton. He started teaching school at age twelve, and was primarily known as

158

Chapter 4. Atomic Structure

a teacher. In his twenties, he moved to the growing city of Manchester, where he was able to pursue some scientiﬁc
studies. His work in several areas of science brought him a number of honors. When he died, over 40,000 people
in Manchester marched at his funeral.
Dalton studied the weights of various elements and compounds. He noticed that matter always combined in
ﬁxed ratios based on weight, or volume in the case of gases. Chemical compounds always contain the same
proportion of elements by mass, regardless of amount, which provided further support for Proust’s law of deﬁnite
proportions. Dalton also observed that there could be more than one combination of two elements.

Dalton’s Atomic Theory (1804)

From his experiments and observations, as well as the work from peers of his time, Dalton proposed a new theory of
the atom. This later became known as Dalton’s atomic theory. The general tenets of this theory were as follows:

• All matter is composed of extremely small particles called atoms.
• Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and other properties. Atoms of different elements differ

in size, mass, and other properties.

• Atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed.
• Atoms of different elements can combine in simple whole number ratios to form chemical compounds.
• In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated, or rearranged

Dalton’s atomic theory has been largely accepted by the scientiﬁc community, with the exception of three changes.
We know now that (1) an atom can be further sub-divided, (2) all atoms of an element are not identical in mass, and
(3) using nuclear ﬁssion and fusion techniques, we can create or destroy atoms by changing them into other atoms.

4.7 Cathode Ray Tube

• Describe how the Crooke’s tube functioned.
• Describe experiments that showed that cathode rays had mass.

How old do you think this TV is?

The TV set seen above is becoming harder and harder to ﬁnd these days. The main reason is because they are older
and based on outdated technology. The new TV sets are ﬂat screen technology that take up less space and give
better picture quality, especially with the advent of high-deﬁnition broadcasting. The technology used in the older
TV sets used cathode ray tubes. A beam of electrons was sprayed to a picture tube which was treated to react with
the electrons to produce an image. Similar CRT devices were used in computer monitors, now also replaced by ﬂat
screen monitors.

Discovery of the Electron

The ﬁrst discovery of a subatomic particle was a result of experiments into the nature of the relationship between
electricity and matter.

Cathode Rays

The ﬁrst cathode ray tube prototype was developed by Heinrich Geissler, a German glassblower and physicist. He
used a mercury pump to create a vacuum in a tube. Geissler explored a number of techniques to remove air from the

161

4.7. Cathode Ray Tube

www.ck12.org

tube and to prevent leaks, as well as ways to get good connections of the wires in the tubes.
In 1878, Sir William Crookes, a British scientist, displayed the ﬁrst cathode rays using a modiﬁcation of the Geissler
apparatus. His major contribution to construction of the tube was to develop ways to evacuate almost all the air
from the tube. Crookes also carried out many experiments using more reliable equipment to conﬁrm earlier ﬁnding
about the properties of cathode rays. He discovered two things which supported the hypothesis that the cathode ray
consisted of a stream of particles:

• When an object was placed between the cathode and the opposite end of the tube, it cast a shadow on the glass.
The shadow caused by the object indicates that particles were being blocked on their way from the cathode to
the anode.

• A cathode ray tube was constructed with a small metal rail between the two electrodes. Attached to the rail
was a paddle wheel capable of rotating along the rail. Upon starting up the cathode ray tube, the wheel rotated
from the cathode towards the anode. Notice that the cathode and anode are positioned so that the rays will
strike the top of the paddle wheel. Crookes concluded that the cathode ray was made of particles which must
have mass.

Further Research with the Crookes Tube

Crookes’ work opened the door to a number of important discoveries. Other scientists were able to demonstrate
that the “cathode ray” was actually a stream of electrons.
In 1897, Karl Ferdinand Braun developed the ﬁrst
oscilloscope, using a cathode ray tube to see an electrical pulse as it passed through the instrument. The invention
of television would not have been possible without the cathode ray tube. Work with a modiﬁed system led to the
discovery of X-rays in 1895 by the German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen. This simple device has led to major
advances in science and technology.

electrons.

What Are Electrons?

Electrons are one of three main types of particles that make up atoms. The other two types are protons and neutrons.
Unlike protons and neutrons, which consist of smaller, simpler particles, electrons are fundamental particles that do
not consist of smaller particles. They are a type of fundamental particles called leptons. All leptons have an electric
charge of -1 or 0. For an excellent video about electrons and other fundamental particles in atoms, go to this URL:

Properties of Electrons

Chapter 4. Atomic Structure

Electrons are extremely small. The mass of an electron is only about 1/2000 the mass of a proton or neutron, so
electrons contribute virtually nothing to the total mass of an atom. Electrons have an electric charge of -1, which is
equal but opposite to the charge of proton, which is +1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons, so
the positive and negative charges “cancel out,” making atoms electrically neutral.

Where Are Electrons?

Unlike protons and neutrons, which are located inside the nucleus at the center of the atom, electrons are found
outside the nucleus. Because opposite electric charges attract each other, negative electrons are attracted to the
positive nucleus. This force of attraction keeps electrons constantly moving through the otherwise empty space
around the nucleus. The Figure 4.11 is a common way to represent the structure of an atom. It shows the electron
as a particle orbiting the nucleus, similar to the way that planets orbit the sun.

FIGURE 4.11

Orbitals

The atomic model in the Figure 4.11 is useful for some purposes, but it’s too simple when it comes to the location
of electrons. In reality, it’s impossible to say what path an electron will follow. Instead, it’s only possible to describe
the chances of ﬁnding an electron in a certain region around the nucleus. The region where an electron is most likely
to be is called an orbital. Each orbital can have at most two electrons. Some orbitals, called S orbitals, are shaped
like spheres, with the nucleus in the center. An S orbital is pictured in Figure 4.12. Where the dots are denser,
the chance of ﬁnding an electron is greater. Also pictured in Figure 4.12 is a P orbital. P orbitals are shaped like

Q: How many electrons can there be in each type of orbital shown in the Figure 4.12?
A: There can be a maximum of two electrons in any orbital, regardless of its shape.
Q: Where is the nucleus in each orbital?
A: The nucleus is at the center of each orbital. It is in the middle of the sphere in the S orbital and in the pinched
part of the P orbital.

What’s Your Energy Level?

Electrons are located at ﬁxed distances from the nucleus, called energy levels. You can see the ﬁrst three energy
levels in the Figure 4.13. The diagram also shows the maximum possible number of electrons at each energy level.

• Electrons at lower energy levels, which are closer to the nucleus, have less energy. At the lowest energy level,

which has the least energy, there is just one orbital, so this energy level has a maximum of two electrons.

• Only when a lower energy level is full are electrons added to the next higher energy level. Electrons at higher
energy levels, which are farther from the nucleus, have more energy. They also have more orbitals and greater
possible numbers of electrons.

• Electrons at the outermost energy level of an atom are called valence electrons. They determine many of
the properties of an element. That’s because these electrons are involved in chemical reactions with other
atoms. Atoms may share or transfer valence electrons. Shared electrons bind atoms together to form chemical
compounds.

A: The atom will have two electrons at the ﬁrst energy level, eight at the second energy level, and the remaining two

Q: Sometimes, an electron jumps from one energy level to another. How do you think this happens?
A: To change energy levels, an electron must either gain or lose energy. That’s because electrons at higher energy
levels have more energy than electrons at lower energy levels.

an electric charge of -1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons.

4.9 Oil Drop Experiment

• Describe the oil drop experiment.

How tall are you? How much do you weigh? Questions like these are easy to answer because we have the tools to
make the measurements. A yard stick or tape measure will sufﬁce to measure height. You can stand on a bathroom
scale and determine your weight.
But it is a very different matter to measure properties of objects that we cannot see with the naked eye. If we want to
measure the size of a germ, we have to use a microscope. To learn the size of a single molecule, we have to use even
more sophisticated instruments. So how would we measure something even smaller than a molecule, even smaller
than an atom?

Charge and Mass of the Electron

The man who measured properties of the electron was Robert Millikan (1868-1953). He taught himself physics
while a student at Oberlin College since there was nobody on the faculty to instruct him in this ﬁeld. Millikan
completed postgraduate research training in the U.S. and in Germany. His studies on the properties of the electron
proved to be of great value in many areas of physics and chemistry.

FIGURE 4.14
Robert Millikan.

Oil Drop Experiment

Millikan carried out a series of experiments between 1908 and 1917 that allowed him to determine the charge of a
single electron, famously know as the oil drop experiment.
He sprayed tiny drops of oil into a chamber. In his ﬁrst experiment, he simply measured how fast the drops fell under
the force of gravity. He could then calculate the mass of the individual drops. Then he sprayed oil drops and applied
an electrical charge to them by shining X-rays up through the bottom of the apparatus. The X-rays ionized the air,
causing electrons to attach to the oil drops. The oil drops picked up static charge and were suspended between two
charged plates. Millikan was able to observe the motion of the oil drops with a microscope and found that the drops
lined up in a speciﬁc way between the plates, based on the number of electric charges they had acquired.

4.9. Oil Drop Experiment

FIGURE 4.15
Oil drop experiment.

Millikan used the information to calculate the charge of an electron. He determined the charge to be 1.5924 × 10−19 C,
where C stands for coulomb, which is one ampere/second. Today the accepted value of the charge of an electron
is 1.602176487 × 10−19 C. Millikan’s experimental value proved very accurate; it is within 1% of the currently
accepted value. Millikan later used the information from his oil drop experiment to calculate the mass of an electron.
The accepted value today is 9.10938215 ×10−31 kg. The incredibly small mass of the electron was found to be
approximately 1/1840 the mass of a hydrogen atom. Therefore, scientists realized that atoms must contain another
particle that carries a positive charge and is far more massive than the electron.

is the gigantic sun related to the extremely tiny proton? Read on to ﬁnd out.

What Is a Proton?

A proton is one of three main particles that make up the atom. The other two particles are the neutron and electron.
Protons are found in the nucleus of the atom. This is a tiny, dense region at the center of the atom. Protons have
a positive electrical charge of one (+1) and a mass of 1 atomic mass unit (amu), which is about 1.67 × 10−27
kilograms. Together with neutrons, they make up virtually all of the mass of an atom. For an excellent video on

Q: How do you think the sun is related to protons?
A: The sun’s tremendous energy is the result of proton interactions. In the sun, as well as in other stars, protons from
hydrogen atoms combine, or fuse, to form nuclei of helium atoms. This fusion reaction releases a huge amount of
energy and takes place in nature only at the extremely high temperatures of stars such as the sun.

Identical Protons, Different Elements

All protons are identical. For example, hydrogen protons are exactly the same as protons of helium and all other
elements, or pure substances. However, atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons. In fact,
atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all
other elements. For example, a hydrogen atom has just one proton, whereas a helium atom has two protons. The
number of protons in an atom determines the electrical charge of the nucleus. The nucleus also contains neutrons,
but they are neutral in charge. The one proton in a hydrogen nucleus, for example, gives it a charge of +1, and the
two protons in a helium nucleus give it a charge of +2. To learn more about the relationship between protons and
elements, go to this URL:

Q: There are six protons in each atom of carbon. What is the electrical charge of a carbon nucleus?
A: The electrical charge of a carbon nucleus is +6.

What Are Protons Made of?

Protons are made of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons. As you can see in the Figure 4.16, a proton
contains three quarks (colored circles) and three streams of gluons (wavy white lines). Two of the quarks are
called up quarks (u), and the third quark is called a down quark (d). The gluons carry the strong nuclear force
between quarks, binding them together. This force is needed to overcome the electric force of repulsion between
positive protons. Although protons were discovered almost 100 years ago, the quarks and gluons inside them were
discovered much more recently. Scientists are still learning more about these fundamental particles. You can take

The arrow in this photo is pointing to a star that doesn’t look like much compared with some of the other stars in the
picture. It’s certainly much smaller than most other stars. In fact, it’s only about 20 kilometers in diameter. Compare
that with the 1.4-million-kilometer diameter of our own sun. Despite its small size, however, this star has greater
mass than the sun, making it incredibly dense. It also has tremendous gravity. In fact, gravity on its surface is about
2 × 1011 times the gravity we feel on Earth! What type of star is it? It’s called a neutron star. That’s because it
consists solely of neutrons. You can learn more about these fascinating stars at the URL below. You will read about

What Is a Neutron?

A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom. The other two particles are the proton and electron.
Atoms of all elements—except for most atoms of hydrogen—have neutrons in their nucleus. The nucleus is the
small, dense region at the center of an atom where protons are also found. Atoms generally have about the same
number of neutrons as protons. For example, all carbon atoms have six protons and most also have six neutrons.
A model of a carbon atom is shown in the Figure 4.17. For an excellent video explaining the structure of atoms,

Properties of Neutrons

Unlike protons and electrons, which are electrically charged, neutrons have no charge. In other words, they are
electrically neutral. That’s why the neutrons in the diagram above are labeled n0. The zero stands for “zero charge.”
The mass of a neutron is slightly greater than the mass of a proton, which is 1 atomic mass unit (amu). (An atomic
mass unit equals about 1.67 × 10−27 kilograms.) A neutron also has about the same diameter as a proton, or 1.7 ×
10−17 meters.

Same Element, Different Numbers of Neutrons

All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons. The number of neutrons, however,
may vary for atoms of the same element. For example, almost 99 percent of carbon atoms have six neutrons, but
the rest have either seven or eight neutrons. Atoms of an element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called
isotopes. The nuclei of these isotopes of carbon are shown in the Figure 4.18. The isotope called carbon-14 is used
to ﬁnd the ages of fossils. You can learn how at this URL: http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth
/geology/carbon-14.htm .

FIGURE 4.18

Q: Notice the names of the carbon isotopes in the diagram. Based on this example, infer how isotopes of an element
are named.
A: Isotopes of an element are named for their total number of protons and neutrons.
Q: The element oxygen has 8 protons. How many protons and neutrons are there in oxygen-17?
A: Oxygen-17—like all atoms of oxygen—has 8 protons. Its name provides the clue that it has a total of 17 protons
and neutrons. Therefore, it must have 9 neutrons (8 + 9 = 17).

Particles in Neutrons

Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons. Each neutron contains three quarks, as
shown in the diagram below. Two of the quarks are called down quarks (d) and the third quark is called an up quark
(u). Gluons (represented by wavy black lines in the diagram) are fundamental particles that are given off or absorbed
by quarks. They carry the strong nuclear force that holds together quarks in a neutron.

Summary

• A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom. It is found in the nucleus and is neutral in
electric charge. It has about the same mass and diameter as a proton. Neutrons are found in all atoms except
for most atoms of hydrogen.

• All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons, but they may vary in their
numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
• Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons. Gluons carry the strong nuclear force

that binds together the quarks in a neutron.

4.12 Thomson’s Atomic Model

• Explain what a model is.
• Describe the “plum pudding” model of the atom.

What is this model airplane composed of?

Millions of children over the years have enjoyed building models - this model airplane is one example of the types
of models that can be constructed. Perhaps sixty years ago the models were made of balsa wood, a very light
material. Parts would be cut by hand, carefully glued together, and then covered with paper or other fabric. The
development of plastics made the construction of model aircraft much simpler in many respects. And, the end-
product is more durable and damage-proof.
A model serves a useful purpose –it gives us an idea of what the real thing is like. The model plane seen above has
wings, a tail, and an engine just like the real thing. This model also has a propeller, as is the case with most small
planes and some smaller passenger planes. However, the model is not the real thing. We certainly cannot ﬂy people
or cargo in the model (besides maybe a tiny mouse), but we can get some idea of what a real plane looks like and
how it works.
Science uses many models to explain ideas. We model the electron as a very small particle with a negative
charge. That gives us a picture, but a very incomplete one. This picture works ﬁne for most chemists, but is
inadequate for a physicist. Models give us a start toward understanding structures and processes, but certainly are
not a complete representation of the entity we are examining.

4.12. Thomson’s Atomic Model

Atomic Models

www.ck12.org

The electron was discovered by J.J. Thomson in 1897. The existence of protons was also known, as was the fact
that atoms were neutral in charge. Since the intact atom had no net charge and the electron and proton had opposite
charges, the next step after the discovery of subatomic particles was to ﬁgure out how these particles were arranged
in the atom. This is a difﬁcult task because of the incredibly small size of the atom. Therefore, scientists set out to
design a model of what they believed the atom could look like. The goal of each atomic model was to accurately
represent all of the experimental evidence about atoms in the simplest way possible.
Following the discovery of the electron, J.J. Thomson developed what became known as the “ plum pudding” model
in 1904. Plum pudding is an English dessert similar to a blueberry mufﬁn. In Thomson’s plum pudding model of
the atom, the electrons were embedded in a uniform sphere of positive charge like blueberries stuck into a mufﬁn.
The positive matter was thought to be jelly- like or a thick soup. The electrons were somewhat mobile. As they got
closer to the outer portion of the atom, the positive charge in the region was greater than the neighboring negative
charges and the electron would be pulled back more toward the center region of the atom.

FIGURE 4.19
The “plum pudding” model.

However, this model of the atom soon gave way to a new model developed by New Zealander Ernest Rutherford
(1871-1937) about ﬁve years later. Thomson did still receive many honors during his lifetime, including being
awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 and a knighthood in 1908.

Summary

• A model gives an idea of what something looks like, but is not the real thing.
• The “plum pudding” model of the atom consisted of a uniform sphere of positive charge with negative

electrons embedded in the sphere.

How much space do bricks occupy?

As we look at the world around us, it looks pretty solid. We hit a wall with our hand and the hand stops –it does
not (normally) go through the wall. We think of matter as occupying space. But there is a lot of empty space in
matter. In fact, most of the matter is empty space.

The Gold Foil Experiment

In 1911, Rutherford and coworkers Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden initiated a series of groundbreaking experi-
ments that would completely change the accepted model of the atom. They bombarded very thin sheets of gold
foil with fast moving alpha particles. Alpha particles, a type of natural radioactive particle, are positively charged
particles with a mass about four times that of a hydrogen atom.
According to the accepted atomic model, in which an atom’s mass and charge are uniformly distributed throughout
the atom, the scientists expected that all of the alpha particles would pass through the gold foil with only a slight
deﬂection or none at all. Surprisingly, while most of the alpha particles were indeed undeﬂected, a very small

(A) The experimental setup for Ruther-
ford’s gold foil experiment: A radioactive
element that emitted alpha particles was
directed toward a thin sheet of gold foil
that was surrounded by a screen which
would allow detection of the deﬂected par-
ticles.
(B) According to the plum pud-
ding model (top) all of the alpha particles
should have passed through the gold foil
with little or no deﬂection. Rutherford
found that a small percentage of alpha
particles were deﬂected at large angles,
which could be explained by an atom with
a very small, dense, positively-charged
nucleus at its center (bottom).

percentage (about 1 in 8000 particles) bounced off the gold foil at very large angles. Some were even redirected
back toward the source. No prior knowledge had prepared them for this discovery. In a famous quote, Rutherford
exclaimed that it was “as if you had ﬁred a 15-inch [artillery] shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and
hit you.”
Rutherford needed to come up with an entirely new model of the atom in order to explain his results. Because the
vast majority of the alpha particles had passed through the gold, he reasoned that most of the atom was empty space.
In contrast, the particles that were highly deﬂected must have experienced a tremendously powerful force within the
atom. He concluded that all of the positive charge and the majority of the mass of the atom must be concentrated in
a very small space in the atom’s interior, which he called the nucleus. The nucleus is the tiny, dense, central core of
the atom and is composed of protons and neutrons.
Rutherford’s atomic model became known as the nuclear model. In the nuclear atom, the protons and neutrons,
which comprise nearly all of the mass of the atom, are located in the nucleus at the center of the atom. The electrons
are distributed around the nucleus and occupy most of the volume of the atom. It is worth emphasizing just how small
the nucleus is compared to the rest of the atom. If we could blow up an atom to be the size of a large professional
football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a marble.
Rutherford’s model proved to be an important step towards a full understanding of the atom. However, it did not
completely address the nature of the electrons and the way in which they occupied the vast space around the nucleus.
It was not until some years later that a full understanding of the electron was achieved. This proved to be the key to
understanding the chemical properties of elements.

An atomic bomb explodes and generates a huge mushroom cloud. The tremendous energy released when the bomb
explodes is incredibly destructive. Where does all the energy come from? The answer is the nucleus of the atom.

At the Heart of It All

The nucleus (plural, nuclei) is a positively charged region at the center of the atom. It consists of two types of
subatomic particles packed tightly together. The particles are protons, which have a positive electric charge, and
neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge. Outside of the nucleus, an atom is mostly empty space, with orbiting
negative particles called electrons whizzing through it. The Figure 4.21 shows these parts of the atom.

Size and Mass of the Nucleus

The nucleus of the atom is extremely small. Its radius is only about 1/100,000 of the total radius of the atom. If an
atom were the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a pea! You can see another sports

Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of mass for their size. As a result, the nucleus
has virtually all the mass of an atom. Given its great mass and tiny size, the nucleus is very dense. If an object the
size of a penny had the same density as the nucleus of an atom, its mass would be greater than 30 million tons! You

Holding It All Together

Particles with opposite electric charges attract each other. This explains why negative electrons orbit the positive
nucleus. Particles with the same electric charge repel each other. This means that the positive protons in the nucleus
push apart from one another. So why doesn’t the nucleus ﬂy apart? An even stronger force—called the strong

Q: Can you guess why an atomic bomb releases so much energy when it explodes?
A: When an atomic bomb explodes, the nuclei of atoms undergo a process called ﬁssion, in which they split apart.
This releases the huge amount of energy that was holding together subatomic particles in the nucleus.

Summary

• The nucleus is a small, dense region at the center of the atom. It consists of positive protons and neutral

neutrons, so it has an overall positive charge.

• The nucleus is just a tiny part of the atom, but it contains virtually all of the atom’s mass.
• The strong nuclear force holds together protons and neutrons in the nucleus and overcomes the electric force

of repulsion between protons.

• Explain what mass number represents.

Athletes wearing the same-colored jerseys are all on the same team. In addition, each player’s jersey has a unique
number to distinguish him from his teammates. Imagine how confusing it would be if members of both teams wore
the same-colored jerseys or all the members of a team had the same number on their jerseys. How could you tell the
athletes apart?

Telling Atoms Apart

It’s often useful to have ways to signify different people or objects like athletes on teams. The same is true of
atoms. It’s important to be able to distinguish atoms of one element from atoms of other elements. Elements are
pure substances that make up all other matter, so each one is given a unique name. The names of elements are also
represented by unique one- or two-letter symbols, such as H for hydrogen, C for carbon, and He for helium. You
can see other examples in the Figure 4.22.
Q: The table shown in the Figure 4.22 is called the periodic table of the elements. Each symbol stands for a different
element. What do you think the symbol K stands for?
A: The symbol K stands for the element potassium. The symbol comes from the Latin name for potassium, which
is kalium.
The symbols in the Figure 4.22 would be more useful if they revealed more information about the atoms they
represent. For example, it would be useful to know the numbers of protons and neutrons in the atoms. That’s where
atomic number and mass number come in.

FIGURE 4.22

Atomic Number

The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. This number is very important because it is unique
for atoms of a given element. All atoms of an element have the same number of protons, and every element has a
different number of protons in its atoms. For example, all helium atoms have two protons, and no other elements
have atoms with two protons. In the case of helium, the atomic number is 2. The atomic number of an element is
usually written in front of and slightly below the element’s symbol, like in the Figure 4.23 for helium.

FIGURE 4.23

Atoms are neutral in electrical charge because they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons.
Therefore, the atomic number of an atom also tells you how many electrons the atom has. This, in turn, determines
many of the atom’s properties.

190

www.ck12.org

Mass Number

Chapter 4. Atomic Structure

There is another number in the Figure 4.23 for helium. That number is the mass number, which is the mass of the
atom in a unit called the atomic mass unit (amu). One atomic mass unit is the mass of a proton, or about 1.67 ×
10−27 kilograms, which is an extremely small mass. To better appreciate how small an atomic mass unit is, go to
this URL: http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/periodic_table/atomic_mass.html .
A neutron has just a tiny bit more mass than a proton, so its mass is often assumed to be one atomic mass unit as
well. Because electrons have virtually no mass, just about all the mass of an atom is in its protons and neutrons.
Therefore, the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom determines its mass in atomic mass units.
Consider helium again. Most helium atoms have two neutrons in addition to two protons. Therefore the mass of most
helium atoms is 4 atomic mass units (2 amu for the protons + 2 amu for the neutrons). However, some helium atoms
have more or less than two neutrons. Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are
called isotopes. Because the number of neutrons can vary for a given element, the mass numbers of different atoms
of an element may also vary. For example, some helium atoms have three neutrons instead of two. Therefore, they
have a different mass number than the one given in the Figure 4.23.
Q: What is the mass number of a helium atom that has three neutrons?
A: The mass number is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. For helium atoms with three neutrons,
the mass number is 2 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 5.
Q: How would you represent this isotope of helium to show its atomic number and mass number?
A: You would represent it by the element’s symbol and both numbers, with the mass number on top and the atomic
number on the bottom:

How can you determine the mass of a chemical?

Often a student will need to weigh out a chemical for an experiment. If he or she uses a watch glass (a small, round
piece that will hold the solid chemical), the weight of the watch glass must be determined ﬁrst. Then the solid is
added to the glass and the weight of the glass plus the solid is measured. The balance reading will be the total of
the glass plus the chemical.

History of Atomic Weight Determinations

As a part of his research on atoms, John Dalton determined a number of atomic weights of elements in the early
1800s. Atomic weights were the basis for the periodic table that Mendeleev developed. Originally all atomic
weights were based on a comparison to hydrogen, which has an atomic weight of one. After the discovery of the
proton, scientists assumed that the weight of an atom was essentially that of the protons –electrons were known to
contribute almost nothing to the atomic weight of the element.

193

4.16. Mass Number

www.ck12.org

This approach worked until we learned how to determine the number of protons in an element. We then saw that
the atomic weight for an element was often twice the number of protons (or more). The discovery of the neutron
provided the missing part of the picture. The atomic mass now known to be the sum of the protons and neutrons in
the nucleus.

Mass Number

Rutherford showed that the vast majority of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which is composed of
protons and neutrons. The mass number is deﬁned as the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom. Consider

two neutrons. Since 2 + 2 = 4, we know that the mass number of the helium atom is 4. Finally, the helium atom
also contains two electrons since the number of electrons must equal the number of protons. This example may lead
you to believe that atoms have the same number of protons and neutrons, but further examination of the Table 4.1
will show that this is not the case. Lithium, for example has three protons and four neutrons, leaving it with a mass
number of 7.
Knowing the mass number and the atomic number of an atom allows you to determine the number of neutrons
present in that atom by subtraction.

Number of neutrons = mass number - atomic number

Atoms of the element chromium (Cr) have an atomic number of 24 and a mass number of 52. How many neutrons
are in the nucleus of a chromium atom? To determine this, you would subtract as shown:

52 - 24 = 28 neutrons in a chromium atom

The composition of any atom can be illustrated with a shorthand notation using the atomic number and the mass
number. Both are written before the chemical symbol, with the mass number written as a superscript and the atomic
number written as a subscript. The chromium atom discussed above would be written as:

24Cr
Another way to refer to a speciﬁc atom is to write the mass number of the atom after the name, separated by a
hyphen. The above atom would be written as chromium-52.

Summary

• The mass number is deﬁned as the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom.
• The number of neutrons = mass number - atomic number.

4.17 Isotopes

• Deﬁne isotope.
• Describe three isotopes of hydrogen.
• State how isotopes are named.
• Explain why many isotopes are radioactive.

Is this creature a space alien? It may look alien, but the sketch is actually just a scientist wearing a special suit to
protect himself from harmful radiation. The scientist is working with radioactive chemicals called isotopes. Not all
isotopes are radioactive, but many of them are. To understand why, you ﬁrst need to know what isotopes are.

What Are Isotopes?

All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but some may have different numbers of neutrons.
For example, all carbon atoms have six protons, and most have six neutrons as well. But some carbon atoms have
seven or eight neutrons instead of the usual six. Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons
are called isotopes. Many isotopes occur naturally. Usually one or two isotopes of an element are the most stable
and common. Different isotopes of an element generally have the same physical and chemical properties. That’s
because they have the same numbers of protons and electrons. For a video explanation of isotopes, go to this URL:

An Example: Hydrogen Isotopes

Hydrogen is an example of an element that has isotopes. Three isotopes of hydrogen are modeled in the Figure
4.24. Most hydrogen atoms have just one proton and one electron and lack a neutron. These atoms are just called
hydrogen. Some hydrogen atoms have one neutron as well. These atoms are the isotope named deuterium. Other
hydrogen atoms have two neutrons. These atoms are the isotope named tritium. For animated versions of these
hydrogen isotopes, go to this URL: http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/physics/atomic-structure/revise-it/isotopes .

FIGURE 4.24

Q: The mass number of an atom is the sum of its protons and neutrons. What is the mass number of each isotope of
hydrogen shown in the Figure 4.24?
A: The mass numbers are: hydrogen = 1, deuterium = 2, and tritium = 3.

Naming Isotopes

For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass number. For example, carbon atoms with
the usual 6 neutrons have a mass number of 12 (6 protons + 6 neutrons = 12), so they are called carbon-12. Carbon

197

4.17. Isotopes

www.ck12.org

atoms with 7 neutrons have an atomic mass of 13 (6 protons + 7 neutrons = 13). These atoms are the isotope called
carbon-13.
Q: Some carbon atoms have 8 neutrons. What is the name of this isotope of carbon?
A: Carbon atoms with 8 neutrons have an atomic mass of 14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons = 14), so this isotope of carbon
is named carbon-14.

Stability of Isotopes

Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a stable nucleus. Having too many or too few neutrons
relative to protons results in an unstable, or radioactive, nucleus that will sooner or later break down to a more stable
form. This process is called radioactive decay. Many isotopes have radioactive nuclei, and these isotopes are referred
to as radioisotopes. When they decay, they release particles that may be harmful. This is why radioactive isotopes
are dangerous and why working with them requires special suits for protection. The isotope of carbon known as
carbon-14 is an example of a radioisotope. In contrast, the carbon isotopes called carbon-12 and carbon-13 are
stable.

Summary

• Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Different isotopes of
an element generally have the same physical and chemical properties because they have the same numbers of
protons and electrons.

• Most hydrogen atoms lack a neutron and are just called hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms with one neutron are the

isotope known as deuterium, and those with two neutrons are the isotope named tritium.

• For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass number, which is the number of

protons plus neutrons. For example, carbon with a mass number of 14 is called carbon-14.

• Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a stable nucleus. If they have too many or too few
neutrons relative to protons, they are radioactive and will decay to more stable forms. Isotopes with radioactive
nuclei are called radioisotopes.

4.18 Atomic Mass Unit

• Deﬁne atomic mass unit.
• Explain how atomic mass units are determined.

How many gallons of gas can ﬁll a car’s tank?

The current system of measurement in the Unites States is a hodge-podge of different units, many of which are hard
to interconvert, unlike the metric system. We at least have standardized units these days, unlike centuries past. At
one time, measurements of length often were deﬁned as the distance from the end of one appendage to another. For
example, the yard would be deﬁned as the distance from the king’s nose to the tip of his thumb when his arm was
stretched out.
Standardized measurements make it possible for people everywhere to get the same amount of something. Note
the red and white labels on the gas pump above. These labels certify that the gas pump has been checked and is
pumping an accurate gallon of gas. Standard measurements in science are very important so that we can compare
experimental data from one lab to another and make sure we all are talking about the same thing.

Atomic Mass

Masses of individual atoms are very, very small. Using a modern device called a mass spectrometer, it is possible
to measure such minuscule masses. An atom of oxygen-16, for example, has a mass of 2.66 × 10−23 g. While
comparisons of masses measured in grams would have some usefulness, it is far more practical to have a system
that will allow us to more easily compare relative atomic masses. Scientists decided on using the carbon-12 nuclide
as the reference standard by which all other masses would be compared. By deﬁnition, one atom of carbon-12 is
assigned a mass of 12 atomic mass units (amu). An atomic mass unit is deﬁned as a mass equal to one twelfth the

200

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Atomic Structure

mass of an atom of carbon-12. The mass of any isotope of any element is expressed in relation to the carbon-12
standard. For example, one atom of helium-4 has a mass of 4.0026 amu. An atom of sulfur-32 has a mass of 31.972
amu.

FIGURE 4.25
Mass spectrometer schematic.

The carbon-12 atom has six protons and six neutrons in its nucleus for a mass number of 12. Since the nucleus
accounts for nearly all of the mass of the atom, a single proton or single neutron has a mass of approximately 1 amu.
However, as seen by the helium and sulfur examples, the masses of individual atoms are not whole numbers. This is
because an atom’s mass is affected very slightly by the interactions of the various particles within the nucleus, and
the small mass of the electron is taken into account.

Summary

• Carbon-12 is the reference for all atomic mass calculations.
• An atomic mass unit is deﬁned as a mass equal to one twelfth the mass of an atom of carbon-12.
• The mass of an atom is affected by the interactions of particles within the nucleus.

are fairly small, you can get a shovel to pick them up. Larger rocks could be moved by hand, but big boulders will

deciding how to approach the job.

For some elements, one particular isotope predominates greatly over the other isotopes. Naturally occurring hy-
drogen is nearly all hydrogen-1 and naturally occurring oxygen is nearly all oxygen-16. For many other elements,
however, more than one isotope may exist in more substantial quantities. Chlorine (atomic number 17) is a yellowish-
green toxic gas. About three quarters of all chlorine atoms have 18 neutrons, giving those atoms a mass number of
35. About one quarter of all chlorine atoms have 20 neutrons, giving those atoms a mass number of 37. Were you to
simply calculate the arithmetic average of the precise atomic masses, you would get 36.
(34.969+36.966)

= 35.968 amu

Clearly the actual average atomic mass from the last column of the table is signiﬁcantly lower. Why? We need to
take into account the percent natural abundances of each isotope in order to calculate what is called the weighted
average. The atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the atomic masses of the naturally occurring
isotopes of that element. The sample problem below demonstrates how to calculate the atomic mass of chlorine.
Sample Problem: Calculating Atomic Mass
Use the atomic masses of each of the two isotopes of chlorine along with their percent abundances to calculate the
average atomic mass of chlorine.
Step 1: List the known and unknown quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• chlorine-35: atomic mass = 34.969 amu and % abundance = 75.77%
• chlorine-37: atomic mass = 36.966 amu and % abundance = 24.23%

Unknown

• Average atomic mass of chlorine

Change each percent abundance into decimal form by dividing by 100. Multiply this value by the atomic mass of
that isotope. Add together for each isotope to get the average atomic mass.
Step 2: Calculate

chlorine-35
chlorine-37
average atomic mass

0.7577× 34.969 = 26.50 amu
0.2423× 36.966 = 8.957 amu
26.50 + 8.957 = 35.45 amu

Note: Applying signiﬁcant ﬁgure rules results in the 35.45 amu result without excessive rounding error. In one step:
(0.7577× 34.969) + (0.2423× 36.966) = 35.45 amu
Step 3: Think about your result.
The calculated average atomic mass is closer to 35 than to 37 because a greater percentage of naturally occurring
chlorine atoms have the mass number of 35. It agrees with the value from the Table 4.2.

5.1 Properties of Light

• Describe problems with Rutherford’s model of the atom.
• List types of electromagnetic radiation

What are waves?

Waves can come in many sizes. Here we see a large wave crashing on the beach. Other waves can be very small
and regular. We normally think of waves as being made of water, but there are forms of energy that take on the
characteristics of waves. The idea of a wave has played a major role in our understanding of how the atom is put
together and why it behaves the way it does.

Properties of Light

The nuclear atomic model proposed by Rutherford was a great improvement over previous models, but was still
not complete. It did not fully explain the location and behavior of the electrons in the vast space outside of the
nucleus. In fact, it was well known that oppositely charged particles attract one another. Rutherford’s model did not
explain why the electrons don’t simply move toward and eventually collide with the nucleus. Experiments in the
early twentieth century began to focus on the absorption and emission of light by matter. These studies showed how
certain phenomena associated with light reveal insight into the nature of matter, energy, and atomic structure.

Wave Nature of Light

In order to begin to understand the nature of the electron, we ﬁrst need to look at the properties of light. Prior
to 1900, scientists thought light behaved solely as a wave. As we will see later, this began to change as new

experiments demonstrated that light also has some of the characteristics of a particle. First, we will examine the
wavelike properties of light.
Visible light is one type of electromagnetic radiation, which is a form of energy that exhibits wavelike behavior
as it moves through space. Other types of electromagnetic radiation include gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet light,
infrared light, microwaves, and radio waves. The ﬁgure below shows the electromagnetic spectrum, which is
all forms of electromagnetic radiation. Notice that visible light makes up only a very, very small portion of the
entire electromagnetic spectrum. All electromagnetic radiation moves through a vacuum at a constant speed of
2.998 × 108 m/s. While the presence of air molecules slows the speed of light by a very small amount, we will use
the value of 3.00 × 108 m/s as the speed of light in air.

FIGURE 5.1
The electromagnetic spectrum encom-
passes a very wide range of wavelengths
and frequencies. Visible light is only a
very small portion of the spectrum with
wavelengths from 400-700 nm.

The Figure 5.1 shows how the electromagnetic spectrum displays a wide variation in wavelength and frequency.
Radio waves have wavelengths of as long as hundreds of meters, while the wavelength of gamma rays are on the
order of 10−12 m. The corresponding frequencies range from 106 to 1021 Hz. Visible light can be split into colors
with the use of a prism ( Figure 5.2), yielding the visible spectrum of light. Red light has the longest wavelength
and lowest frequency, while violet light has the shortest wavelength and highest frequency. Visible light wavelength
ranges from about 400 –700 nm with frequencies in the range of 1014 Hz.

FIGURE 5.2
A small beam of white light is (refracted)
bent as it passes through a glass prism.
The shorter the wavelength of light, the
greater is the refraction, so the light is
separated into all its colors.

Do you enjoy going to the beach?
During the summer, almost everyone enjoys going to the beach. They can swim, have picnics, and work on their
tans. But if you get too much sun, you can burn. A particular set of solar wavelengths are especially harmful to
the skin. This portion of the soar spectrum is known as UV B, with wavelengths of 280-320 nm. Sunscreens are
effective in protecting the skin against both the immediate skin damage and the long-term possibility of skin cancer.

Waves

Waves are characterized by their repetitive motion. Imagine a toy boat riding the waves in a wave pool. As the
water wave passes under the boat, it moves up and down in a regular and repeated fashion. While the wave travels
horizontally, the boat only travels vertically up and down. The Figure 5.3 shows two examples of waves.
A wave cycle consists of one complete wave –starting at the zero point, going up to a wave crest, going back down
to a wave trough, and back to the zero point again. The wavelength of a wave is the distance between any two
corresponding points on adjacent waves. It is easiest to visualize the wavelength of a wave as the distance from one
wave crest to the next. In an equation, wavelength is represented by the Greek letter lambda (λ). Depending on the

type of wave, wavelength can be measured in meters, centimeters, or nanometers (1 m = 109 nm). The frequency,
represented by the Greek letter nu (ν), is the number of waves that pass a certain point in a speciﬁed amount of time.
Typically, frequency is measured in units of cycles per second or waves per second. One wave per second is also
called a Hertz (Hz) and in SI units is a reciprocal second (s−1).
Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave
clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point
watching these waves pass by, more waves of the ﬁrst kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the
frequency of the ﬁrst waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore
inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two
is:

c = λν

The variable c is the speed of light. For the relationship to hold mathematically, if the speed of light is used in m/s,
the wavelength must be in meters and the frequency in Hertz.

5.3 Quantization of Energy

• Deﬁne quantum.
• Describe the relationship between the amount of energy absorbed or released by an object and the frequency

of the radiation observed.

Every so often you hear a commercial or a news story with the words “quantum leap” in it. The quantum leap is
supposed to be a major breakthrough, a big change, something extraordinarily large. The reality is far different.
Instead of the big, extravagant change the “quantum” that scientists know about is a very small difference in the
location of an electron around a nucleus –hardly an enormous shift at all.

Quantization of Energy

German physicist Max Planck (1858-1947) studied the emission of light by hot objects. You have likely seen a
heated metal object glow an orange-red color (see Figure 5.4).

FIGURE 5.4
A heated object may glow different col-
ors. The atoms in this piece of metal are
releasing energy in discrete units called
quanta.

Classical physics, which explains the behavior of large, everyday objects, predicted that a hot object would emit
electromagnetic energy in a continuous fashion. In other words, every wavelength of light could possibly be emitted.
Instead, what Planck found by analyzing the spectra was that the energy of the hot body could only be lost in small
discrete units. A quantum is the minimum quantity of energy that can either be lost or gained by an atom. An
analogy is that a brick wall can only undergo a change in height by units of one or more bricks and not by any
possible height. Planck showed that the amount of radiant energy absorbed or emitted by an object is directly
proportional to the frequency of the radiation.

Chapter 5. Electrons in Atoms

In the equation, E is the energy, in joules, of a quantum of radiation, v is the frequency, and h is a fundamental
constant called Planck’s constant. The value of Planck’s constant is h = 6.626× 10−34 J· s. The energy of any
system must increase or decrease in units of h× v. A small energy change results in the emission or absorption
of low-frequency radiation, while a large energy change results in the emission or absorption of high-frequency
radiation.

Sample Problem: Quantized Energy
What is the energy of a photon of green light with a frequency of 5.75 × 1014 Hz?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• frequency (ν) = 5.75 × 1014 Hz
• Planck’s constant (h) = 6.626 × 10−34 J • s

Unknown

• energy (E)

Apply the equation E = hv to solve for the energy.
Step 2: Calculate

E = (6.626× 10−34 J· s)× (5.75× 1014 Hz) = 3.81× 10−19 J

Step 3: Think about your result.
While the resulting energy may seem very small, this is for only one photon of light. Visible quantities of light
consist of huge quantities of photons. Recall that a hertz is equal to a reciprocal second, so the units agree in the
equation.

Photoelectric Effect and the Particle Nature of Light

In 1905 Albert Einstein (1879-1955) proposed that light be described as quanta of energy that behave as particles. A
photon is a particle of electromagnetic radiation that has zero mass and carries a quantum of energy. The energy of
photons of light is quantized according to the E = hv equation. For many years light had been described using only
wave concepts, and scientists trained in classical physics found this wave-particle duality of light to be a difﬁcult idea
to accept. A key experiment that was explained by Einstein using light’s particle nature was called the photoelectric
effect.
The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon that occurs when light shined onto a metal surface causes the ejection
of electrons from that metal. It was observed that only certain frequencies of light are able to cause the ejection of
electrons. If the frequency of the incident light is too low (red light, for example), then no electrons were ejected
even if the intensity of the light was very high or it was shone onto the surface for a long time. If the frequency of
the light was higher (green light, for example), then electrons were able to be ejected from the metal surface even
if the intensity of the light was very low or it was shone for only a short time. This minimum frequency needed to
cause electron ejection is referred to as the threshold frequency.
Classical physics was unable to explain the photoelectric effect. If classical physics applied to this situation, the
electron in the metal could eventually collect enough energy to be ejected from the surface even if the incoming light

217

5.4. Photoelectric Effect

www.ck12.org

was of low frequency. Einstein used the particle theory of light to explain the photoelectric effect as shown in the
Figure 5.5.

FIGURE 5.5
Low frequency light (red) is unable to
cause ejection of electrons from the metal
surface. At or above the threshold fre-
quency (green) electrons are ejected.
Even higher
frequency incoming light
(blue) causes ejection of the same num-
ber of electrons but with greater speed.

Consider the E = hv equation. The E is the minimum energy that is required in order for the metal’s electron to be
ejected. If the incoming light’s frequency, v, is below the threshold frequency, there will never be enough energy to
cause electron to be ejected. If the frequency is equal to or higher than the threshold frequency, electrons will be
ejected. As the frequency increases beyond the threshold, the ejected electrons simply move faster. An increase in
the intensity of incoming light that is above the threshold frequency causes the number of electrons that are ejected
to increase, but they do not travel any faster. The photoelectric effect is applied in devices called photoelectric
cells, which are commonly found in everyday items such as a calculator which uses the energy of light to generate
electricity.

FIGURE 5.6
Photoelectric cells convert light energy into electrical energy which powers
this calculator.

Summary

• Light has properties of both a wave and a particle.
• The photoelectric effect is produced by light striking a metal and dislodging electrons form the surface of the

metal.

How much energy does it take to shoot an arrow?

Archery as a sport or a means of defense has existed for centuries. At rest, there is no tension on the bowstring and
no force on the arrow. When the string and arrow are pulled back, we now have a situation where kinetic energy
(pulling of the string) has been converted to potential energy (the tension on the string). The archer releases the
arrow and the potential energy is translated into kinetic energy as the arrow moves. It turns out that electrons behave
the same way when energy is put into the system or released from the system.

Atomic Emission Spectra

The electrons in an atom tend to be arranged in such a way that the energy of the atom is as low as possible. The
ground state of an atom is the lowest energy state of the atom. When those atoms are given energy, the electrons
absorb the energy and move to a higher energy level. These energy levels of the electrons in atoms are quantized,
meaning again that the electron must move from one energy level to another in discrete steps rather than continuously.
An excited state of an atom is a state where its potential energy is higher than the ground state. An atom in the
excited state is not stable. When it returns back to the ground state, it releases the energy that it had previously
gained in the form of electromagnetic radiation.
So how do atoms gain energy in the ﬁrst place? One way is to pass an electric current through an enclosed sample
of a gas at low pressure. Since the electron energy levels are unique for each element, every gas discharge tube will
glow with a distinctive color depending on the identity of the gas (see Figure 5.7).

220

Chapter 5. Electrons in Atoms

FIGURE 5.7
Gas discharge tubes are enclosed glass tubes ﬁlled with a gas at low pressure through which an electric current
is passed. Electrons in the gaseous atoms ﬁrst become excited, and then fall back to lower energy levels, emitting
light of a distinctive color in the process. Shown are gas discharge tubes of helium, neon, argon, krypton, and
xenon.

“Neon” signs are familiar examples of gas discharge tubes. However, only signs that glow with the red-orange color
seen in the ﬁgure are actually ﬁlled with neon. Signs of other colors contain different gases or mixtures of gases.
Scientists studied the distinctive pink color of the gas discharge created by hydrogen gas. When a narrow beam
of this light was viewed through a prism, the light was separated into four lines of very speciﬁc wavelengths (and
frequencies since λ and v are inversely related). An atomic emission spectrum is the pattern of lines formed when
light passes through a prism to separate it into the different frequencies of light it contains. The Figure 5.8 shows
the atomic emission spectrum of hydrogen.

When light

221

5.5. Atomic Emission Spectra

www.ck12.org

Classical theory was unable to explain the existence of atomic emission spectra, also known as line-emission spectra.
According to classical physics, a ground state atom would be able to absorb any amount of energy rather than only
discrete amounts. Likewise, when the atoms relaxed back to a lower energy state, any amount of energy could
be released. This would result in what is known a continuous spectrum, where all wavelengths and frequencies
are represented. White light viewed through a prism and a rainbow are examples of continuous spectra. Atomic
emission spectra were more proof of the quantized nature of light and led to a new model of the atom based on
quantum theory.

5.6 Bohr’s Atomic Model

How does this worker’s energy change as he climbs up and down the ladder?

Climbing a ladder takes energy. At every step, you are pushing yourself up against gravity, and accumulating
potential energy. Coming back down releases that potential energy as you descend step by step. If you are not
careful, you can release that potential energy all at once when you fall off the ladder (never a good idea). In addition,
you take the climb or descent in steps. There is no “in-between” position on the ladder –your foot either hits a rung
or it hits empty space and you are in trouble until you ﬁnd a rung to stand on.

Bohr’s Atomic Model

Following the discoveries of hydrogen emission spectra and the photoelectric effect, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr
(1885 –1962) proposed a new model of the atom in 1915. Bohr proposed that electrons do not radiate energy as
they orbit the nucleus, but exist in states of constant energy which he called stationary states. This means that the
electrons orbit at ﬁxed distances from the nucleus (see Figure 5.9). Bohr’s work was primarily based on the emission
spectra of hydrogen. This is also referred to as the planetary model of the atom. It explained the inner workings of
the hydrogen atom. Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1922 for his work.
Bohr explained that electrons can be moved into different orbits with the addition of energy. When the energy is
removed, the electrons return back to their ground state, emitting a corresponding amount of energy –a quantum of
light, or photon. This was the basis for what later became known as quantum theory. This is a theory based on
the principle that matter and energy have the properties of both particles and waves. It accounts for a wide range of

physical phenomena, including the existence of discrete packets of energy and matter, the uncertainty principle, and
the exclusion principle.
According to the Bohr model, often referred to as a planetary model, the electrons encircle the nucleus of the
atom in speciﬁc allowable paths called orbits. When the electron is in one of these orbits, its energy is ﬁxed. The
ground state of the hydrogen atom, where its energy is lowest, is when the electron is in the orbit that is closest to
the nucleus. The orbits that are further from the nucleus are all of successively greater energy. The electron is not
allowed to occupy any of the spaces in between the orbits. An everyday analogy to the Bohr model is the rungs of a
ladder. As you move up or down a ladder, you can only occupy speciﬁc rungs and cannot be in the spaces in between
rungs. Moving up the ladder increases your potential energy, while moving down the ladder decreases your energy.
Bohr’s work had a strong inﬂuence on our modern understanding of the inner workings of the atom. However,
his model worked well for an explanation for the emissions of the hydrogen atom, but was seriously limited when
applied to other atoms. Shortly after Bohr published his planetary model of the atom, several new discoveries were
made, which resulted in, yet again, a revised view of the atom.

Summary

• The Bohr model postulates that electrons orbit the nucleus at ﬁxed energy levels.
• Orbits further from the nucleus exist at higher energy levels.
• When electrons return to a lower energy level, they emit energy in the form of light.

Can you ﬁx a car engine?

It’s not as common any more, but there was a time when many people could work on their own cars if there was
a problem. Today, engines are computerized and require specialized training and tools in order to be ﬁxed. When
people did their own repairs, it was sometimes a trial and error process. Maybe the parks plugs needed to be replaced.
No, that didn’t ﬁx the problem completely, but it was a start in the right direction. Science operates the same way.
A theory that is developed may work for a while, but then there are data that the theory cannot explain. This means
that it’s time for a newer and more inclusive theory.

Spectral Lines of Hydrogen

Bohr’s model explains the spectral lines of the hydrogen atomic emission spectrum. While the electron of the atom
remains in the ground state, its energy is unchanged. When the atom absorbs one or more quanta of energy, the
electron moves from the ground state orbit to an excited state orbit that is further away. Energy levels are designated
with the variable n. The ground state is n = 1, the ﬁrst excited state is n = 2, and so on. The energy that is gained by
the atom is equal to the difference in energy between the two energy levels. When the atom relaxes back to a lower
energy state, it releases energy that is again equal to the difference in energy of the two orbits (see Figure 5.10).
The change in energy, ∆E, then translates to light of a particular frequency being emitted according to the equation
E = hv. Recall that the atomic emission spectrum of hydrogen had spectral lines consisting of four different
frequencies. This is explained in the Bohr model by the realization that the electron orbits are not equally spaced. As
the energy increases further and further from the nucleus, the spacing between the levels gets smaller and smaller.

FIGURE 5.10
Bohr model of the atom: electron is shown transitioning from the n = 3
energy level to the n = 2 energy level. The photon of light that is emitted
has a frequency that corresponds to the difference in energy between the
two levels.

Based on the wavelengths of the spectral lines, Bohr was able to calculate the energies that the hydrogen electron
would have in each of its allowed energy levels. He then mathematically showed which energy level transitions
corresponded to the spectral lines in the atomic emission spectrum ( Figure 5.11).

FIGURE 5.11
The electron energy level diagram for the
hydrogen atom.

He found that the four visible spectral lines corresponded to transitions from higher energy levels down to the second
energy level (n = 2). This is called the Balmer series. Transitions ending in the ground state (n = 1) are called the
Lyman series, but the energies released are so large that the spectral lines are all in the ultraviolet region of the
spectrum. The transitions called the Paschen series and the Brackett series both result in spectral lines in the infrared
region because the energies are too small.
Bohr’s model was a tremendous success in explaining the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. Unfortunately, when the
mathematics of the model was applied to atoms with more than one electron, it was not able to correctly predict
the frequencies of the spectral lines. While Bohr’s model represented a great advancement in the atomic model
and the concept of electron transitions between energy levels is valid, improvements were needed in order to fully
understand all atoms and their chemical behavior.

5.8 de Broglie Wave Equation

• State the de Broglie wave equation.
• Use this equation to calculate the wavelength of a moving object.

Bohr’s model of the atom was valuable in demonstrating how electrons were capable of absorbing and releasing
energy and how atomic emission spectra were created. However, the model did not really explain why electrons
should exist only in ﬁxed circular orbits rather than being able to exist in a limitless number of orbits all with
different energies. In order to explain why atomic energy states are quantized, scientists needed to rethink the way
in which they viewed the nature of the electron and its movement.

de Broglie Wave Equation

Planck’s investigation of the emission spectra of hot objects and the subsequent studies into the photoelectric effect
had proven that light was capable of behaving both as a wave and as a particle. It seemed reasonable to wonder
if electrons could also have a dual wave-particle nature. In 1924, French scientist Louis de Broglie (1892-1987)
derived an equation that described the wave nature of any particle. Particularly, the wavelength (λ) of any moving
object is given by:

λ =

h
mv

In this equation, h is Planck’s constant, m is the mass of the particle in kg, and v is the velocity of the particle in m/s.
The problem below shows how to calculate the wavelength of the electron.

Sample Problem: de Broglie Wave Equation
An electron of mass 9.11 × 10−31 kg moves at nearly the speed of light. Using a velocity of 3.00 × 108 m/s,
calculate the wavelength of the electron.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• mass (m) = 9.11 × 10−31 kg
• Planck’s constant (h) = 6.6262 10−34 × J • s
• velocity (v) = 3.00 × 108 m/s

Unknown

• wavelength (λ)

Apply the de Broglie wave equation λ = h
Step 2: Calculate

mv to solve for the wavelength of the moving electron.

λ = h

mv =

6.626×10−34 J·s

(9.11×10−31 kg)×(3.00×108 m/s)

= 2.42× 10−12 m

Step 3: Think about your result.
This very small wavelength is about 1/20th of the diameter of a hydrogen atom. Looking at the equation, as the
speed of the electron decreases, its wavelength increases. The wavelengths of everyday large objects with much
greater masses should be very small.
If we were to calculate the wavelength of a 0.145 kg baseball thrown at a speed of 40 m/s, we would come up
with an extremely short wavelength on the order of 10−34 m. This wavelength is impossible to detect even with
advanced scientiﬁc equipment. Indeed, while all objects move with wavelike motion, we never notice it because the
wavelengths are far too short. On the other hand, particles with measurable wavelengths are all very small. However,
the wave nature of the electron proved to be a key development in a new understanding of the nature of the electron.
An electron that is conﬁned to a particular space around the nucleus of an atom can only move around that atom in
such a way that its electron wave “ﬁts” the size of the atom correctly. This means that the frequencies of electron
waves are quantized. Based on the E = hv equation, the quantized frequencies means that electrons can only exist
in an atom at speciﬁc energies, as Bohr had previously theorized.

5.9 Quantum Mechanics

How do you study something that seemingly makes no sense? We talk about electrons being in orbits and it sounds
like we can tell where that electron is at any moment. We can draw pictures of electrons in orbit, but the reality is
that we just don’t know exactly where they are. We are going to take a quick look at an area of science that even
leaves scientists puzzled. When asked about quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr (who proposed the Bohr model of the
atom) said: “Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it”. Richard Feynman (one of the
founders of modern quantum theory) stated: “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum theory”. So,
let’s take a short trip into a land that challenges our every-day world.

Quantum Mechanics

The study of motion of large objects such as baseballs is called mechanics, or more speciﬁcally classical mechanics.
Because the quantum nature of the electron and other tiny particles moving at high speeds, classical mechanics is
inadequate to accurately describe their motion. Quantum mechanics is the study of the motion of objects that are
atomic or subatomic in size and thus demonstrate wave-particle duality. In classical mechanics, the size and mass
of the objects involved effectively obscures any quantum effects so that such objects appear to gain or lose energies
in any amounts. Particles whose motion is described by quantum mechanics gain or lose energy in the small pieces
called quanta.
One of the fundamental (and hardest to understand) principles of quantum mechanics is that the electron is both a
particle and a wave. In the everyday macroscopic world of things we can see, something cannot be both. But this
duality can exist in the quantum world of the submicroscopic at the atomic scale.
At the heart of quantum mechanics is the idea that we cannot specify accurately the location of an electron. All we
can say is that there is a probability that it exists within this certain volume of space. The scientist Erwin Schrödinger
developed an equation that deals with these calculations, which we will not pursue at this time.

• State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

What are the different uses of lasers?

Lasers have numerous applications outside the physics lab. These devices can be employed to measure distances
accurately and many commercial instruments are used in construction for laying out a building site. When the light
beam strikes a solid object, it is reﬂected back and the device determines how far away the object is. There is such
a signiﬁcant difference between the mass of the light beam (photons) and the mass of the object, the beam does not
disturb the object at all. One measurement of interest was the use of a laser to measure the distance from the Earth
to the moon (see ﬁgure above). The impact of the photons from the laser on the moon had absolutely no effect on
the moon’s orbit.

Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

Another feature that is unique to quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle states that it is impossible to determine simultaneously both the position and the velocity of a particle.
The detection of an electron, for example, would be made by way of its interaction with photons of light. Since
photons and electrons have nearly the same energy, any attempt to locate an electron with a photon will knock the
electron off course, resulting in uncertainty about where the electron is located (see Figure 5.14). We do not have
to worry about the uncertainty principle with large everyday objects because of their mass. If you are looking for
something with a ﬂashlight, the photons coming from the ﬂashlight are not going to cause the thing you are looking

envision the location of the electrons within atoms.

5.11 Quantum Mechanical Atomic Model

The news ﬂash interrupts your favorite TV program. “There has been a hold-up at the First National Bank. The
suspect ﬂed in a car and is believed to be somewhere in the downtown district. Everyone is asked to be on the alert.”
The robber can be located only within a certain area –the police do not have an exact location, just a general idea as
to the where abouts of the thief.

Quantum Mechanical Atomic Model

In 1926, Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger (1887-1961) used the wave-particle duality of the electron to develop
and solve a complex mathematical equation that accurately described the behavior of the electron in a hydrogen atom.
The quantum mechanical model of the atom comes from the solution to Schrödinger’s equation. Quantization of
electron energies is a requirement in order to solve the equation. This is unlike the Bohr model, in which quantization
was simply assumed with no mathematical basis.
Recall that in the Bohr model, the exact path of the electron was restricted to very well-deﬁned circular orbits around
the nucleus. The quantum mechanical model is a radical departure from that. Solutions to the Schrödinger wave
equation, called wave functions, give only the probability of ﬁnding an electron at a given point around the nucleus.
Electrons do not travel around the nucleus in simple circular orbits.
The location of the electrons in the quantum mechanical model of the atom is often referred to as an electron cloud.
The electron cloud can be thought of in the following way: Imagine placing a square piece of paper on the ﬂoor
with a dot in the circle representing the nucleus. Now take a marker and drop it onto the paper repeatedly, making
small marks at each point the marker hits. If you drop the marker many, many times, the overall pattern of dots

236

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Electrons in Atoms

will be roughly circular. If you aim toward the center reasonably well, there will be more dots near the nucleus and
progressively fewer dots as you move away from it. Each dot represents a location where the electron could be at
any given moment. Because of the uncertainty principle, there is no way to know exactly where the electron is. An
electron cloud has variable densities: a high density where the electron is most likely to be and a low density where
the electron is least likely to be ( Figure 5.15).

FIGURE 5.15
An electron cloud:
region
nearer the nucleus indicates a high prob-
ability of ﬁnding the electron, while the
lighter region further from the nucleus in-
dicates a lower probability of ﬁnding the
electron.

In order to speciﬁcally deﬁne the shape of the cloud, it is customary to refer to the region of space within which
there is a 90% probability of ﬁnding the electron. This is called an orbital, the three-dimensional region of space
that indicates where there is a high probability of ﬁnding an electron.

Summary

• The Schrödinger wave equation replaced the Bohr ideas about electron location with an uncertainty factor.
• The location of the electron can only be given as a probability that the electron is somewhere in a certain area.

• Deﬁne the four quantum numbers.
• Determine quantum numbers for speciﬁc electrons when given appropriate data.

Can you guess how many people are in this stadium?

If you attend a college or professional football game, you need a ticket to get in. It is very likely that your ticket may
specify a gate number, a section number, a row, and a seat number. No other ticket can have the same four parts to it.
It may have the same gate, section, and seat number, but it would have to be in a different row. Each seat is unique
and allows only one occupant to ﬁll it.

Quantum Numbers

We use a series of speciﬁc numbers, called quantum numbers, to describe the location of an electron in an
associated atom. Quantum numbers specify the properties of the atomic orbitals and the electrons in those orbitals.
An electron in an atom or ion has four quantum numbers to describe its state. Think of them as important variables
in an equation which describes the three-dimensional position of electrons in a given atom.

Principal Quantum Number

The principal quantum number, signiﬁed by (n), is the main energy level occupied by the electron. Energy levels
are ﬁxed distances from the nucleus of a given atom. They are described in whole number increments (e.g., 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, ...). At location n = 1, an electron would be closest to the nucleus, while n = 2 the electron would be farther,

239

5.12. Quantum Numbers

www.ck12.org

and n = 3 farther yet. As we will see, the principal quantum number corresponds to the row number for an atom on
the periodic table.

Angular Momentum Quantum Number

The angular momentum quantum number, signiﬁed as (l), describes the general shape or region an electron
occupies –its orbital shape. The value of l depends on the value of the principle quantum number n. The angular
momentum quantum number can have positive values of zero to (n− 1). If n = 2, l could be either 0 or 1.

Magnetic Quantum Number

The magnetic quantum number, signiﬁed as (ml), describes the orbital orientation in space. Electrons can be
situated in one of three planes in three dimensional space around a given nucleus (x,y, and z). For a given value of
the angular momentum quantum number l, there can be (2l + 1) values for ml. As an example:

n = 2
l = 0 or 1
for l = 0, ml = 0
for l = 1, ml = −1, 0, +1

How is it that so many planes are able to ﬂy without running into each other?

The ﬂight path of a commercial airliner is carefully regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration. Each airplane
must maintain a distance of ﬁve miles from another plane ﬂying at the same altitude and 2,000 feet above and below
another aircraft (1,000 feet if the altitude is less than 29,000 feet). So, each aircraft only has certain positions it is
allowed to maintain while it ﬂies. As we explore quantum mechanics, we see that electrons have similar restrictions
on their locations.

Orbitals

We can apply our knowledge of quantum numbers to describe the arrangement of electrons for a given atom. We do
this with something called electron conﬁgurations. They are effectively a map of the electrons for a given atom.
We look at the four quantum numbers for a given electron and then assign that electron to a speciﬁc orbital.

s Orbitals

When l = 2, ml values can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2 for a total of ﬁve d orbitals. Note that all ﬁve of the orbitals have

How are buildings constructed?

Construction of a building begins at the bottom. The foundation is laid and the building goes up step by step. You
obviously cannot start with the roof since there is no place to hang it. The building goes from the lowest level to the
highest level in a systematic way.

Aufbau Principle

In order to create ground state electron conﬁgurations for any element, it is necessary to know the way in which the
atomic sublevels are organized in order of increasing energy. The Figure 5.16 shows the order of increasing energy
of the sublevels.
The lowest energy sublevel is always the 1s sublevel, which consists of one orbital. The single electron of the
hydrogen atom will occupy the 1s orbital when the atom is in its ground state. As we proceed with atoms with
multiple electrons, those electrons are added to the next lowest sublevel: 2s, 2p, 3s, and so on. The Aufbau principle
states that an electron occupies orbitals in order from lowest energy to highest. The Aufbau (German: “building up,
construction”) principle is sometimes referred to as the “building-up” principle. It is worth noting that in reality
atoms are not built by adding protons and electrons one at a time and that this method is merely an aid for us to
understand the end result.

FIGURE 5.16
Electrons are added to atomic orbitals in
order from low energy (bottom of graph)
to high (top of graph) according to the Auf-
bau principle. Principal energy levels are
color coded, while sublevels are grouped
together and each circle represents an
orbital capable of holding two electrons.

As seen in the Figure 5.16, the energies of the sublevels in different principal energy levels eventually begin to
overlap. After the 3p sublevel, it would seem logical that the 3d sublevel should be the next lowest in energy.
However, the 4s sublevel is slightly lower in energy than the 3d sublevel and thus ﬁlls ﬁrst. Following the ﬁlling of
the 3d sublevel is the 4p, then the 5s and the 4d. Note that the 4f sublevel does not ﬁll until just after the 6s sublevel.
The Figure 5.17 is a useful and simple aid for keeping track of the order of ﬁll of the atomic sublevels.

• The Aufbau principle gives the order of electron ﬁlling in an atom.
• It can be used to describe the locations and energy levels of every electron in a given atom.

5.15 Pauli Exclusion Principle

• State the Pauli exclusion principle.

Can you name one thing that easily distinguishes you from the rest of the world?
And we’re not talking about DNA –that’s a little expensive to sequence. For many people, it is their email address.
My email address allows people all over the world to contact me. It does not belong to anyone else, but serves to
identify me. Electrons also have a unique set of identiﬁers in the quantum numbers that describe their location and
spin.

Pauli Exclusion Principle

When we look at the orbital possibilities for a given atom, we see that there are different arrangements of electrons
for each different type of atom. Since each electron must maintain its unique identity, we intuitively sense that the
four quantum numbers for any given electron must not match up exactly with the four quantum numbers for any
other electron in that atom.
For the hydrogen atom, there is no problem since there is only one electron in the H atom. However, when we
get to helium we see that the ﬁrst three quantum numbers for the two electrons are the same: same energy level,
same spherical shape. What differentiates the two helium electrons is their spin. One of the electrons has a + 1
2 spin
while the other electron has a− 1
2 spin. So the two electrons in the 1s orbital are each unique and distinct from one
another because their spins are different. This observation leads to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that
no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. The energy of the electron is speciﬁed
by the principal, angular momentum, and magnetic quantum numbers. If those three numbers are identical for two
electrons, the spin numbers must be different in order for the two electrons to be differentiated from one another.
The two values of the spin quantum number allow each orbital to hold two electrons. The ﬁgure below shows how
the electrons are indicated in a diagram.

5.16 Hund’s Rule and Orbital Filling Diagrams

• State Hund’s rule.
• Apply Hund’s rule to the ﬁlling of orbitals.
• Use orbital ﬁlling diagrams to describe the locations of electrons in an atom.

Have you ever wondered what those load limit signs mean on a bridge?
The sign above says that nothing over ﬁve tons is allowed because it will do damage to the structure. There are limits
to the amount of weight that a bridge can support, there are limits to the number of people that can safely occupy a
room, and there are limits to what can go into an electron orbital.

Hund’s Rule

The last of the three rules for constructing electron arrangements requires electrons to be placed one at a time in a set
of orbitals within the same sublevel. This minimizes the natural repulsive forces that one electron has for another.
Hund’s rule states that orbitals of equal energy are each occupied by one electron before any orbital is occupied by
a second electron and that each of the single electrons must have the same spin. The Figure 5.19 shows how a set of
three p orbitals is ﬁlled with one, two, three, and four electrons.

Orbital Filling Diagrams

An orbital ﬁlling diagram is the more visual way to represent the arrangement of all the electrons in a particular
atom. In an orbital ﬁlling diagram, the individual orbitals are shown as circles (or squares) and orbitals within a
sublevel are drawn next to each other horizontally. Each sublevel is labeled by its principal energy level and sublevel.
Electrons are indicated by arrows inside the circles. An arrow pointing upwards indicates one spin direction, while

bitals of equal energy, one electron enters
each orbital before any orbital receives a
second electron.

a downward pointing arrow indicates the other direction. The orbital ﬁlling diagrams for hydrogen, helium, and
lithium are shown in Figure 5.20.

According to the Aufbau process, sublevels and orbitals are ﬁlled with electrons in order of increasing energy. Since
the s sublevel consists of just one orbital, the second electron simply pairs up with the ﬁrst electron as in helium. The
next element is lithium and necessitates the use of the next available sublevel, the 2s.
The ﬁlling diagram for carbon is shown in the Figure 5.21. There are two 2p electrons for carbon and each occupies
its own 2p orbital.

5.17 Electron Conﬁgurations

• Use electron conﬁguration notation to indicate the electron conﬁguration of an atom.

How big is a ﬁle?
If you keep your papers in manila folders, you can pick up a folder and see how much it weighs. If you want to
know how many different papers (articles, bank records, or whatever else you keep in a folder), you have to take
everything out and count. A computer directory, on the other hand, tells you exactly how much you have in each
ﬁle. We can get the same information on atoms. If we use an orbital ﬁlling diagram, we have to count arrows. When
we look at electron conﬁguration data, we simply add up the numbers.

Electron Conﬁgurations

Electron conﬁguration notation eliminates the boxes and arrows of orbital ﬁlling diagrams. Each occupied sublevel
designation is written followed by a superscript that is the number of electrons in that sublevel. For example, the
hydrogen conﬁguration is 1s1, while the helium conﬁguration is 1s2. Multiple occupied sublevels are written one
after another. The electron conﬁguration of lithium is 1s22s1. The sum of the superscripts in an electron conﬁguration
is equal to the number of electrons in that atom, which is in turn equal to its atomic number.

Sample Problem: Orbital Filling Diagrams and Electron Conﬁgurations

Step 2: Construct Diagram

FIGURE 5.25

Electron conﬁguration 1s22s22p2
Step 3: Think about your result.
Following the 2s sublevel is the 2p, and p sublevels always consist of three orbitals. All three orbitals need to be
drawn even if one or more is unoccupied. According to Hund’s rule, the sixth electron enters the second of those p
orbitals and with the same spin as the ﬁfth electron.

Second Period Elements

Periods refer to the horizontal rows of the periodic table. Looking at a periodic table you will see that the ﬁrst period
contains only the elements hydrogen and helium. This is because the ﬁrst principal energy level consists of only
the s sublevel and so only two electrons are required in order to ﬁll the entire principal energy level. Each time a
new principal energy level begins, as with the third element lithium, a new period is started on the periodic table.
As one moves across the second period, electrons are successively added. With beryllium (Z = 4), the 2s sublevel
is complete and the 2p sublevel begins with boron (Z = 5). Since there are three 2p orbitals and each orbital holds
two electrons, the 2p sublevel is ﬁlled after six elements. The Table 5.3 shows the electron conﬁgurations of the
elements in the second period.

In the study of chemical reactivity, we will ﬁnd that the electrons in the outermost principal energy level are very
important and so they are given a special name. Valence electrons are the electrons in the highest occupied principal
energy level of an atom. In the second period elements listed above, the two electrons in the 1s sublevel are called

Chapter 5. Electrons in Atoms

inner-shell electrons and are not involved directly in the element’s reactivity or in the formation of compounds.
Lithium has a single electron in the second principal energy level and so we say that lithium has one valence electron.
Beryllium has two valence electrons. How many valence electrons does boron have? You must recognize that the
second principal energy level consists of both the 2s and the 2p sublevels and so the answer is three. In fact, the
number of valence electrons goes up by one for each step across a period until the last element is reached. Neon,
with its conﬁguration ending in s2p6, has eight valence electrons.

5.19 Noble Gas Conﬁguration

• Use the noble gas conﬁguration approach to write electron conﬁgurations for the elements.

How does it feel to be full after a meal?
You had a great meal, but cannot put another bite in your mouth because there is no place for it to go. The noble
gases have the same problem –there is no room for any more electrons in their outer shells. They are completely full
and cannot handle any more.

Noble Gas Conﬁgurations

Sodium, element number eleven, is the ﬁrst element in the third period of the periodic table. Its electron conﬁguration
is 1s22s22p63s1. The ﬁrst ten electrons of the sodium atom are the inner-shell electrons and the conﬁguration of just
those ten electrons is exactly the same as the conﬁguration of the element neon (Z = 10). This provides the basis for a
shorthand notation for electron conﬁgurations called the noble gas conﬁguration. The elements that are found in the
last column of the periodic table are an important group of elements that are called the noble gases. They are helium,
neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon. A noble gas conﬁguration of an atom consists of the elemental symbol of
the last noble gas prior to that atom, followed by the conﬁguration of the remaining electrons. So for sodium, we
make the substitution of [Ne] for the 1s22s22p6 part of the conﬁguration. Sodium’s noble gas conﬁguration becomes
[Ne]3s1. Table 5.5 shows the noble gas conﬁgurations of the third period elements.

Again, the number of valence electrons increases from one to eight across the third period.
The fourth and subsequent periods follow the same pattern except for using a different noble gas. Potassium has
nineteen electrons, one more than the noble gas argon, so its conﬁguration could be written as [Ar]4s1. In a similar
fashion, strontium has two more electrons than the noble gas krypton, which would allow us to write its electrons
distribution as [Kr]5s2. All the elements can be represented in this fashion.

Summary

• The noble gas conﬁguration system allows some shortening of the total electron conﬁguration by using the

symbol for the noble gas of the previous period as part of the pattern of electrons.

• Describe Newland’s Law of Octaves.

When you go to the library to ﬁnd a book, how do you locate it?
If it is a ﬁction book, you look by author since the ﬁction materials are ﬁled by the author’s last name.
If you are
looking for a non-ﬁction publication, you look in a catalog (most likely on a computer these days). The book you
are looking for will have a number by the title. This number refers to the Dewey Decimal system, developed by
Melvil Dewey in 1876 and used in over 200,000 libraries throughout the world. Another system in wide use is
the Library of Congress approach, developed in the late 1800s-early 1900s to organize the materials in the federal
Library of Congress. This method is one of the most widely used ways to organize libraries in the world. Both
approaches organize information so that people can easily ﬁnd what they are looking for. Chemistry information
also needs to be organized so we can see patterns of properties in elements.

Early Attempts to Organize Elements

By the year 1700, only a handful of elements had been identiﬁed and isolated. Several of these, such as copper and
lead, had been known since ancient times. As scientiﬁc methods improved, the rate of discovery dramatically
increased. With the ever-increasing number of elements, chemists recognized that there may be some kind of
systematic way to organize the elements. The question was: how?
A logical way to begin grouping elements together was by their chemical properties. In other words, putting elements
in separate groups based on how they reacted with other elements. In 1829, a German chemist, Johann Dobereiner
(1780-1849), placed various groups of three elements into groups called triads. One such triad was lithium, sodium,

265

6.1. Early History of the Periodic Table

www.ck12.org

2

and potassium. Triads were based on both physical as well as chemical properties. Dobereiner found that the
atomic masses of these three elements, as well as other triads, formed a pattern. When the atomic masses of
lithium and potassium were averaged together (6.94+39.10)
= 23.02, it was approximately equal to the atomic mass
of sodium (22.99). These three elements also displayed similar chemical reactions, such as vigorously reacting with
the members of another triad: chlorine, bromine, and iodine. While Dobereiner’s system would pave the way for
future ideas, a limitation of the triad system was that not all of the known elements could be classiﬁed in this way.
English chemist John Newlands (1838-1898) ordered the elements in increasing order of atomic mass and noticed
that every eighth element exhibited similar properties. He called this relationship the “Law of Octaves.” Unfortu-
nately, there were some elements that were missing and the law did not seem to hold for elements that were heavier
than calcium. Newlands’s work was largely ignored and even ridiculed by the scientiﬁc community in his day. It
was not until years later that another more extensive periodic table effort would gain much greater acceptance and
the pioneering work of John Newlands would be appreciated.

• triad: In 1829, a German chemist, Johann Dobereiner (1780-1849), placed various groups of three elements
into groups called triads. One such triad was lithium, sodium, and potassium. Triads were based on both
physical as well as chemical properties. Dobereiner found that the atomic masses of these three elements, as
well as other triads, formed a pattern.

• octave: English chemist John Newlands (1838-1898) ordered the elements in increasing order of atomic mass
and noticed that every eighth element exhibited similar properties. He called this relationship the “Law of
Octaves.”

6.2 Mendeleev’s Periodic Table

• Describe Mendeleev’s organization of the periodic table.
• State predictions made possible by this table.

When you study for a test, how do you approach the task?
One useful way is to use ﬂash cards. You write down the vocabulary words, the foreign language terms, the math
formulas, the chemistry reactions –anything you want to learn. Then you sort these cards into categories, topics that
go together. This organization of information helps you see patterns in the material so you can tie different ideas
together and make better sense of them.
The periodic table was ﬁrst built using a set of cards. With this strategy, Mendeleev could organize and rearrange
material until patterns emerged.

Mendeleev’s Periodic Table

In 1869, Russian chemist and teacher Dmitri Mendeleev (1836-1907) published a periodic table of the elements. The
following year, German chemist Lothar Meyer independently published a very similar table. Mendeleev is generally
given more credit than Meyer because his table was published ﬁrst and because of several key insights that he made
regarding the table.
Mendeleev was writing a chemistry textbook for his students and wanted to organize all of the known elements at
that time according to their chemical properties. He famously organized the information for each element on to

separate note cards that were then easy to rearrange as needed. He discovered that when he placed them in order
of increasing atomic mass, certain similarities in chemical behavior repeated at regular intervals. This type of a
repeating pattern is called “periodic.” A pendulum that swings back and forth in a given time interval is periodic, as
is the movement of the moon around the Earth.

In the Figure 6.2, atomic mass increases from top to bottom of vertical columns, with successive columns going
left to right. As a result, elements that are in the same horizontal row are groups of elements that were known to
exhibit similar chemical properties. One of Mendeleev’s insights is illustrated by the elements tellurium (Te) and
iodine (I). Notice that tellurium is listed before iodine even though its atomic mass is higher. Mendeleev reversed
the order because he knew that the properties of iodine were much more similar to those of ﬂuorine (F), chlorine
(Cl), and bromine (Br) than they were to oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and selenium (Se). He simply assumed that there
was an error in the determination of one or both of the atomic masses. As we will see shortly, this turned out not to
be the case, but Mendeleev was indeed correct to group these two elements as he did.
Notice that there are several places in the table that have no chemical symbol, but are instead labeled with a question
mark. Between zinc (Zn) and arsenic (As) are two such missing elements. Mendeleev believed that elements with
atomic masses of 68 and 70 would eventually be discovered and that they would ﬁt chemically into each of those
spaces. Listed in the Table 6.1 are other properties that Mendeleev predicted for the ﬁrst of these two missing
elements, which he called “eka-aluminum,” compared with the element gallium.

The element gallium was discovered four years after the publication of Mendeleev’s table, and its properties matched
up remarkably well with eka-aluminum, ﬁtting into the table exactly where he had predicted. This was also the case
with the element that followed gallium, which was named eventually named germanium.
Mendeleev’s periodic table gained wide acceptance with the scientiﬁc community and earned him credit as the
discoverer of the periodic law. Element number 101, synthesized in 1955, is named mendelevium after the founder
of the periodic table. It would, however, be several years after Mendeleev died before the several discrepancies with
the atomic masses could be explained and before the reasons behind the repetition of chemical properties could be
fully explained.

We have all enjoyed playing the game “Clue.” The object of the game is to obtain information about a murder –who
did it, where they did it, and what was used as the murder weapon. As the game progresses, clues are obtained by
each player and they then must assemble these clues into a guess as to the criminal. Individual pieces of information
takes on broader signiﬁcance when put together with other parts of the puzzle.

The Periodic Law

When Mendeleev put his periodic table together, nobody knew about the existence of the nucleus. It was not until
1911 that Rutherford conducted his gold foil experiment that demonstrated the presence of the nucleus in the atom.
Just two years later, in 1913, English physicist Henry Moseley (1887-1915) examined x-ray spectra of a number
of chemical elements. He would shoot X-rays through crystals of the element and study the wavelengths of the
radiation he detected. Moseley found that there was a relationship between wavelength and atomic number. His
results led to the deﬁnition of atomic number as the number of protons contained in the nucleus of each atom. He
then realized that the elements of the periodic table should be arranged in order of increasing atomic number rather
than increasing atomic mass.

272

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. The Periodic Table

When ordered by atomic number, the discrepancies within Mendeleev’s table disappeared. Tellurium has an atomic
number of 52, while iodine has an atomic number of 53. So even though tellurium does indeed have a greater atomic
mass than iodine, it is properly placed before iodine in the periodic table. Mendeleev and Moseley are credited with
being most responsible for the modern periodic law: When elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic
number, there is a periodic repetition of their chemical and physical properties. The result is the periodic table as we
know it today. Each new horizontal row of the periodic table corresponds to the beginning of a new period because a
new principal energy level is being ﬁlled with electrons. Elements with similar chemical properties appear at regular
intervals, within the vertical columns called groups.

Summary

• Elements of the periodic table are arranged in order of increasing atomic number.
• The periodic law states “When elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, there is a periodic

repetition of their chemical and physical properties.”

How has the English dictionary evolved over time?

Language changes with time. New words enter the language and old words often disappear from lack of use. Dictio-
naries are published so that people can keep up with changes in language and know how to use words properly. These
publications may be in print, as is the law dictionary below, or they may be electronic. Dictionaries can be found on
the internet and apps are available for smartphones. Dictionaries are invaluable for good, reliable communication.

The Modern Periodic Table

The periodic table has undergone extensive changes in the time since it was originally developed by Mendeleev and
Moseley. Many new elements have been discovered, while others have been artiﬁcially synthesized. Each ﬁts
properly into a group of elements with similar properties. The periodic table is an arrangement of the elements in
order of their atomic numbers so that elements with similar properties appear in the same vertical column or group.
The ﬁgure below shows the most commonly used form of the periodic table. Each square shows the chemical
symbol of the element along with its name. Notice that several of the symbols seem to be unrelated to the name of
the element: Fe for iron, Pb for lead, etc. Most of these are the elements that have been known since ancient times
and have symbols based on their Latin names. The atomic number of each element is written above the symbol.

275

6.4. Modern Periodic Table: Periods and Groups

www.ck12.org

A period is a horizontal row of the periodic table. There are seven periods in the periodic table, with each one
beginning at the far left. A new period begins when a new principal energy level begins ﬁlling with electrons. Period
1 has only two elements (hydrogen and helium), while periods 2 and 3 have 8 elements. Periods 4 and 5 have 18
elements. Periods 6 and 7 have 32 elements because the two bottom rows that are separated from the rest of the
table belong to those periods. They are pulled out in order to make the table itself ﬁt more easily onto a single page.
A group is a vertical column of the periodic table, based on the organization of the outer shell electrons. There are
a total of 18 groups. There are two different numbering systems that are commonly used to designate groups and
you should be familiar with both. The traditional system used in the United States involves the use of the letters A
and B. The ﬁrst two groups are 1A and 2A, while the last six groups are 3A through 8A. The middle groups use B
in their titles. Unfortunately, there was a slightly different system in place in Europe. To eliminate confusion the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) decided that the ofﬁcial system for numbering groups
would be a simple 1 through 18 from left to right. Many periodic tables show both systems simultaneously.

• Identify the metals class of elements.
• Describe properties of metals.
• Explain why metals are good conductors of electricity.

When you think of metals, do you think of solid objects such as iron nails and gold jewelry? If so, it might surprise
you to learn that the shiny liquid pouring out of the pipette in the photo above is also a metal. It’s called mercury,
and it’s the only metal that normally exists on Earth as a liquid. Just what are metals, and what are their properties?
Read on to ﬁnd out.

What Are Metals?

Metals are elements that can conduct electricity. They are one of three classes of elements (the other two classes
are nonmetals and metalloids). Metals are by far the largest of the three classes. In fact, most elements are metals.
All of the elements on the left side and in the middle of the periodic table, except for hydrogen, are metals. There
are several different types of metals, including alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table, alkaline Earth metals in
group 2, and transition metals in groups 3–12. The majority of metals are transition metals.

Properties of Metals

Elements in the same class share certain basic similarities. In addition to conducting electricity, many metals have
several other shared properties, including those listed below. You can dig deeper into the properties of metals at this
URL: http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_gateway_pre_2011/periodictable/metalsrev1.shtml .

• Metals have relatively high melting points. This explains why all metals except for mercury are solids at room

temperature.

• Most metals are good conductors of heat. That’s why metals such as iron, copper, and aluminum are used for

pots and pans.

278

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. The Periodic Table

• Metals are generally shiny. This is because they reﬂect much of the light that strikes them. The mercury

pictured above is very shiny.

• The majority of metals are ductile. This means that they can be pulled into long, thin shapes, like the aluminum

electric wires pictured in the Figure 6.3.

• Metals tend to be malleable. This means that they can be formed into thin sheets without breaking. An

example is aluminum foil, also pictured in the Figure 6.3.

FIGURE 6.3

Q: The deﬁning characteristic of metals is their ability to conduct electricity. Why do you think metals have this
property?
A: The properties of metals—as well as of elements in the other classes—depend mainly on the number and
arrangement of their electrons.

Explaining the Properties of Metals

To understand why metals can conduct electricity, consider the metal lithium as an example. An atom of lithium is
modeled below. Look at lithium’s electrons. There are two electrons at the ﬁrst energy level. This energy level can
hold only two electrons, so it is full in lithium. The second energy level is another story. It can hold a maximum of
eight electrons, but in lithium it has just one. A full outer energy level is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Lithium would need to gain seven electrons to ﬁll its outer energy level and make it stable. It’s far easier for lithium
to give up its one electron in energy level 2, leaving it with a full outer energy level (now level 1). Electricity is a
ﬂow of electrons. Because lithium (like most other metals) easily gives up its “extra” electron, it is a good conductor
of electricity. This tendency to give up electrons also explains other properties of metals such as lithium.

6.6 Nonmetals

• Identify the nonmetals class of elements.
• List properties of nonmetals.
• Explain why nonmetals vary in their reactivity and cannot conduct electricity.

The three pure substances pictured above have the distinction of being among the top ten elements that make up the
human body. All three of them belong to the class of elements called nonmetals. Most of the elements that comprise
the human body—as well as the majority of other living things—are nonmetals. In fact, seven of the top ten elements
in your own body belong to this class of elements. What do you know about nonmetals? What are their properties,
and how are they different from other elements? In this article, you’ll ﬁnd out.

What Are Nonmetals?

Nonmetals are elements that generally do not conduct electricity. They are one of three classes of elements (the
other two classes are metals and metalloids.) Nonmetals are the second largest of the three classes after metals.
They are the elements located on the right side of the periodic table.
Q: From left to right across each period (row) of the periodic table, each element has atoms with one more proton
and one more electron than the element before it. How might this be related to the properties of nonmetals?
A: Because nonmetals are on the right side of the periodic table, they have more electrons in their outer energy level
than elements on the left side or in the middle of the periodic table. The number of electrons in the outer energy
level of an atom determines many of its properties.

Properties of Nonmetals

As their name suggests, nonmetals generally have properties that are very different from the properties of metals.
Properties of nonmetals include a relatively low boiling point, which explains why many of them are gases at room
temperature. However, some nonmetals are solids at room temperature, including the three pictured above, and one
nonmetal—bromine—is a liquid at room temperature. Other properties of nonmetals are illustrated and described in
the Table 6.2.

Property
Most nonmetals are poor conductors of heat. In fact,
they are such poor conductors of heat that they are often
used for insulation. For example, the down ﬁlling in
this sleeping bag is full of air, which consists primarily
of the nonmetal gases oxygen and nitrogen. These
gases prevent body heat from escaping to the cold
outside air.
Solid nonmetals are generally dull and brittle like these
pieces of iodine. Like other nonmetals, iodine lacks the
luster of metals and will easily crack and crumble.

Reactivity of Nonmetals

Reactivity is how likely an element is to react chemically with other elements. Some nonmetals are extremely
reactive, whereas others are completely nonreactive. What explains this variation in nonmetals? The answer is
their number of valence electrons. These are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that are involved in
interactions with other atoms. Let’s look at two examples of nonmetals, ﬂuorine and neon. Simple atomic models
of these two elements are shown in the Figure 6.4.
Q: Which element, ﬂuorine or neon, do you predict is more reactive?
A: Fluorine is more reactive than neon. That’s because it has seven of eight possible electrons in its outer energy
level, whereas neon already has eight electrons in this energy level.

FIGURE 6.4

Although neon has just one more electron than ﬂuorine in its outer energy level, that one electron makes a huge
difference. Fluorine needs one more electron to ﬁll its outer energy level in order to have the most stable arrangement
of electrons. Therefore, ﬂuorine readily accepts an electron from any element that is equally “eager” to give one
up, such as the metal lithium or sodium. As a result, ﬂuorine is highly reactive. In fact, reactions with ﬂuorine are
often explosive, as you can see in the URL below. Neon, on the other hand, already has a full outer energy level. It

282

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. The Periodic Table

is already very stable and never reacts with other elements. It neither accepts nor gives up electrons. Neon doesn’t
even react with ﬂuorine, which reacts with all other elements except helium.

Why Most Nonmetals Cannot Conduct Electricity

Like most other nonmetals, ﬂuorine cannot conduct electricity, and its electrons explain this as well. An electric
current is a ﬂow of electrons. Elements that readily give up electrons (the metals) can carry electric current because
their electrons can ﬂow freely. Elements that gain electrons instead of giving them up cannot carry electric current.
They hold onto their electrons so they cannot ﬂow.

Summary

• Nonmetals are elements that generally cannot conduct electricity. They are the second largest class of elements

after metals. Examples of nonmetals include hydrogen, carbon, chlorine, and helium.

• Properties of nonmetals include a relatively low boiling point, so many nonmetals are gases. Nonmetals are

also poor conductors of heat, and solid nonmetals are dull and brittle.

• Some nonmetals are very reactive, whereas others are not reactive at all. It depends on the number of electrons

in their outer energy level.

• Reactive nonmetals tend to gain electrons. This explains why they cannot conduct electricity, which is a ﬂow

of electrons.

What is this intricate orb? It is the greatly magniﬁed skeleton of single-celled ocean organisms call radiolarian. The
skeleton is made of an element that is extremely common on Earth. In fact, it is the second most abundant element
in Earth’s crust. It is also one of the most common elements in the entire universe. What is this important element?
Its name is silicon, and it belongs to a class of elements called metalloids.

What Are Metalloids

Metalloids are the smallest class of elements. (The other two classes of elements are metals and nonmetals). There
are just six metalloids. In addition to silicon, they include boron, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium.
Metalloids fall between metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. They also fall between metals and nonmetals in
terms of their properties.
Q: How does the position of an element in the periodic table inﬂuence its properties?
A: Elements are arranged in the periodic table by their atomic number, which is the number of protons in their atoms.
Atoms are neutral in electric charge, so they always have the same number of electrons as protons. It is the number
of electrons in the outer energy level of atoms that determines most of the properties of elements.

Chemical Properties of Metalloids

How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of electrons in
the outer energy level of their atoms. Metalloids have from three to six electrons in their outer energy level. Boron,
pictured in the Figure 6.5, is the only metalloid with just three electrons in its outer energy level. It tends to act
like metals by giving up its electrons in chemical reactions. Metalloids with more than four electrons in their outer

285

6.7. Metalloids

energy level (arsenic, antimony, and tellurium) tend to act like nonmetals by gaining electrons in chemical reactions.
Those with exactly four electrons in their outer energy level (silicon and germanium) may act like either metals or
nonmetals, depending on the other elements in the reaction.

FIGURE 6.5

Physical Properties of Metalloids

Most metalloids have some physical properties of metals and some physical properties of nonmetals. For example,
metals are good conductors of both heat and electricity, whereas nonmetals generally cannot conduct heat or
electricity. And metalloids? They fall between metals and nonmetals in their ability to conduct heat, and if they
can conduct electricity, they usually can do so only at higher temperatures. Metalloids that can conduct electricity
at higher temperatures are called semiconductors. Silicon is an example of a semiconductor. It is used to make the
tiny electric circuits in computer chips. You can see a sample of silicon and a silicon chip in the Figure 6.6.

Chapter 6. The Periodic Table

Metalloids tend to be shiny like metals but brittle like nonmetals. Because they are brittle, they may chip like glass
or crumble to a powder if struck. Other physical properties of metalloids are more variable, including their boiling
and melting points, although all metalloids exist as solids at room temperature. You can learn about the properties
of speciﬁc metalloids by watching the video at this URL:

Summary

• Metalloids are the smallest class of elements, containing just six elements. They fall between metals and

nonmetals in the periodic table.

• How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of elec-
trons in the outer energy level of their atoms. Metalloids may act either like metals or nonmetals in chemical
reactions.

• Most metalloids have some physical properties of metals and some physical properties of nonmetals. They
fall between metals and nonmetals in their ability to conduct heat and electricity. They are shiny like metals
but brittle like nonmetals. All exist as solids at room temperature.

6.8 Blocks of the Periodic Table

• Identify blocks of the periodic table.
• Determine the block each element belongs in by its electron conﬁguration.

What makes these music notes unique?

We all enjoy music of some sort. Some people like classical music, others like jazz or country. Music styles change
from one period of time to the next, and from one region to another. Each type of music has its language that
describes it. Classical music has a certain structure, style, and content. There are different expressions of classical
music –the symphony, concerto, sonata. We have ballet and opera as well as choral music.
Jazz has a different
set of characteristics from classical and different styles of performance. Each type of music can be described and
compared to other types on the basis of certain common qualities like notes, chords, and melodic styles.
The elements in the periodic table could be considered to be similar to types of music. Each set of elements
has its unique set of properties, with different sets of elements having some common characteristics in terms of
electron arrangements. We can see patterns of electronic structure and reactivity in the periodic table that allow us
to understand better the behavior of individual elements.

Periods and Blocks

There are seven horizontal rows of the periodic table, called periods. The length of each period is determined by the
number of electrons that are capable of occupying the sublevels that ﬁll during that period, as seen in the Table 6.3.

Chapter 6. The Periodic Table

Recall that the four different sublevels each consist of a different number of orbitals. The s sublevel has one orbital,
the p sublevel has three orbitals, the d sublevel has ﬁve orbitals, and the f sublevel has seven orbitals. In the ﬁrst
period, only the 1s sublevel is being ﬁlled. Since all orbitals can hold two electrons, the entire ﬁrst period consists of
just two elements. In the second period, the 2s sublevel, with two electrons, and the 2p sublevel with six electrons,
are being ﬁlled. Consequently, the second period contains eight elements. The third period is similar to the second,
ﬁlling the 3s and 3p sublevels. Notice that the 3d sublevel does not actually ﬁll until after the 4s sublevel. This
results in the fourth period containing 18 elements due to the additional 10 electrons that are contributed by the d
sublevel. The ﬁfth period is similar to the fourth. After the 6s sublevel ﬁlls, the 4f sublevel with its 14 electrons ﬁlls.
This is followed by the 5d and the 6p. The total number of elements in the sixth period is 32. The later elements
in the seventh period are still being created. So while there are a possible of 32 elements in the period, the current
number is slightly less.
The period to which a given element belongs can easily be determined from its electron conﬁguration. For example,
consider the element nickel (Ni). Its electron conﬁguration is [Ar]3d84s2. The highest occupied principal energy
level is the fourth, indicated by the 4 in the 4s2 portion of the conﬁguration. Therefore, nickel can be found in the
fourth period of the periodic table.
Based on electron conﬁgurations, the periodic table can be divided into blocks denoting which sublevel is in the
process of being ﬁlled. The s, p, d, and f blocks are illustrated below.

The ﬁgure also illustrates how the d sublevel is always one principal level behind the period in which that sublevel
occurs. In other words, the 3d sublevel ﬁlls during the fourth period. The f sublevel is always two levels behind.
The 4f sublevel belongs to the sixth period.

Summary

• The horizontal rows of the periodic table are called periods.
• The length of a period depends on how many electrons are needed to occupy the sublevels that ﬁll the period.
• Blocks indicate which sublevel is being ﬁlled.

6.9 Hydrogen and Alkali Metals

• Identify the elements in group 1 of the periodic table.
• Explain why group 1 elements are very reactive.
• List other properties of alkali metals.

You probably think of water as a substance that can put out ﬁres. But some elements are so reactive that they burn
in water. In fact, they virtually explode in water. That’s what is happening in the photo above. About 3 pounds of
sodium were added to water, and the result was this explosive reaction. Why is sodium such a reactive element? In
this lesson you will ﬁnd out.

The First Group

Sodium (Na) is an element in group 1 of the periodic table of the elements. This group (column) of the table is
shown below. It includes the nonmetal hydrogen (H) and six metals that are called alkali metals. Elements in the
same group of the periodic table have the same number of valence electrons. These are the electrons in their outer
energy level that can be involved in chemical reactions. Valence electrons determine many of the properties of an
element, so elements in the same group have similar properties. All the elements in group 1 have just one valence
electron. This makes them very reactive.
Q: Why does having just one valence electron make group 1 elements very reactive?
A: With just one valence electron, group 1 elements are “eager” to lose that electron. Doing so allows them to
achieve a full outer energy level and maximum stability.

Reactivity of Group 1 Elements

Hydrogen is a very reactive gas, and the alkali metals are even more reactive. In fact, they are the most reactive
metals and, along with the elements in group 17, are the most reactive of all elements. The reactivity of alkali metals
increases from the top to the bottom of the group, so lithium (Li) is the least reactive alkali metal and francium (Fr)
is the most reactive. Because alkali metals are so reactive, they are found in nature only in combination with other
elements. They often combine with group 17 elements, which are very “eager” to gain an electron. At the URL
below, you can watch a video that shows just how reactive the alkali metals are.

Other Properties of Alkali Metals

Besides being very reactive, alkali metals share a number of other properties.

• Alkali metals are all solids at room temperature.
• Alkali metals are low in density, and some of them ﬂoat on water.
• Alkali metals are relatively soft. Some are even soft enough to cut with a knife, like the sodium pictured in

the Figure 6.7.

FIGURE 6.7

A Closer Look

Although all group 1 elements share certain properties, such as being very reactive, they are not alike in every way.
Three different group 1 elements are described in more detail below ( Figures 6.8, 6.9, and 6.10). Notice the ways
in which they differ from one another.

FIGURE 6.8
Hydrogen has the smallest, lightest atoms
of all elements.
Pure hydrogen is a
colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that is
nontoxic but highly ﬂammable. Hydrogen
gas exists mainly as diatomic (“two-atom”)
molecules (H2), as shown in the diagram
on the right. Hydrogen is the most abun-
dant element in the universe and the third
most abundant element on Earth, occur-
ring mainly in compounds such as water.

Q: Why do you think hydrogen gas usually exists as diatomic molecules?

293

6.9. Hydrogen and Alkali Metals

www.ck12.org

A: Each hydrogen atom has just one electron. When two hydrogen atoms bond together, they share a pair of
electrons. The shared electrons ﬁll their only energy level, giving them the most stable arrangement of electrons.

FIGURE 6.9
Potassium is a soft, silvery metal
that
ignites explosively in water. It easily loses
its one valence electron to form positive
potassium ions (K+), which are needed
by all living cells. Potassium is so impor-
tant for plants that it is found in almost
all fertilizers,
like the one shown here.
Potassium is abundant in Earth’s crust in
minerals such as feldspar.

Q: Francium decays too quickly to form compounds with other elements. Which elements to you think it would
bond with if it could?
A: With one valence electron, francium would bond with a halogen element in group 17, which has seven valence
electrons and needs one more to ﬁll its outer energy level. Elements in group 17 include ﬂuorine and chlorine.

Summary

• Group 1 of the periodic table includes hydrogen and the alkali metals.
• Because they have just one valence electron, group 1 elements are very reactive. As a result, they are found in

nature only in combination with other elements.

• Alkali metals are all solids at room temperature. They are relatively soft and low in density.
• From the top to the bottom of group 1, the elements have heavier, more reactive atoms.

Sparklers like the one this girl is holding make festive additions to many celebrations. You may use them yourself.
But watch out if you do because their ﬂames are really hot! The bright white ﬂames are produced when magnesium

Barium (Ba) is one of six elements in group 2 of the periodic table, which is shown below. Elements in this group are

Reactivity of Alkaline Earth Metals

All alkaline Earth metals have similar properties because they all have two valence electrons. They readily give up
their two valence electrons to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. As
a result, they are very reactive, although not quite as reactive as the alkali metals in group 1. For example, alkaline
Earth metals will react with cold water, but not explosively as alkali metals do. Because of their reactivity, alkaline
Earth metals never exist as pure substances in nature. Instead, they are always found combined with other elements.
The reactivity of alkaline Earth metals increases from the top to the bottom of the group. That’s because the atoms
get bigger from the top to the bottom, so the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus. When valence electrons
are farther from the nucleus, they are attracted less strongly by the nucleus and more easily removed from the atom.
This makes the atom more reactive.
Q: Alkali metals have just one valence electron. Why are alkaline Earth metals less reactive than alkali metals?
A: It takes more energy to remove two valence electrons from an atom than one valence electron. This makes
alkaline Earth metals with their two valence electrons less reactive than alkali metals with their one valence electron.

Examples of Alkaline Earth Metals

www.ck12.org

For a better understanding of alkaline Earth metals, let’s take a closer look at two of them: calcium (Ca) and
strontium (Sr). Calcium is a soft, gray, nontoxic alkaline Earth metal. Although pure calcium doesn’t exist in nature,
calcium compounds are very common in Earth’s crust and in sea water. Calcium is also the most abundant metal
in the human body, occurring as calcium compounds such as calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. These
calcium compounds are found in bones and make them hard and strong. The skeleton of the average adult contains
about a kilogram of calcium. Because calcium—like barium—absorbs x-rays, bones show up white in x-ray images.
Calcium is an important component of a healthy human diet. Good food sources of calcium are pictured in Figure
6.11.

FIGURE 6.11

Q: What health problems might result from a diet low in calcium?
A: Children who don’t get enough calcium while their bones are forming may develop a deﬁciency disease called
rickets, in which their bones are softer than normal and become bent and stunted. Adults who don’t get enough
calcium may develop a condition called osteoporosis, in which the bones lose calcium and become weak and brittle.
People with osteoporosis are at high risk of bone fractures.
Strontium is a silver-colored alkaline Earth metal that is even softer than calcium. Strontium compounds are quite
common and have a variety of uses—from ﬁreworks to cement to toothpaste. In ﬁreworks, strontium compounds

chloride reduces tooth sensitivity.

Summary

• Elements in group 2 of the periodic table are called alkaline Earth metals. They are silvery or gray in color.

They are also relatively soft and low in density.

• Alkaline Earth metals are very reactive because they readily give up their two valence electrons to achieve a
full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Reactivity increases from the top to
the bottom of the group.

• Examples of alkaline Earth metals include calcium, which is needed for strong bones, and strontium, which is

used for making cement and other products.

Okay, helium balloons are light, but they’re not that light! This fanciful picture serves to make the point that helium
is one of the lightest elements. Helium belongs to a group of elements called the noble gases.

What Are Noble Gases?

Noble gases are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the periodic table. As you can see in the periodic
table in Figure 6.13, noble gases include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon
(Rn). All noble gases are colorless and odorless. They also have low boiling points, explaining why they are gases
at room temperature. Radon, at the bottom of the group, is radioactive, so it constantly decays to other elements. For
an excellent overview of the noble gases, watch the video at this URL:

FIGURE 6.13

Q: Based on their position in the periodic table ( Figure 6.13), how many valence electrons do you think noble gases
have?
A: The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in group 1. It then increases by one from left to right
across each period (row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18. Therefore, noble gases have eight valence
electrons.

301

6.11. Noble Gases

www.ck12.org

Chemical Properties of Noble Gases

Noble gases are the least reactive of all known elements. That’s because with eight valence electrons, their outer
energy levels are full. The only exception is helium, which has just two electrons. But helium also has a full outer
energy level, because its only energy level (energy level 1) can hold a maximum of two electrons. A full outer energy
level is the most stable arrangement of electrons. As a result, noble gases cannot become more stable by reacting
with other elements and gaining or losing valence electrons. Therefore, noble gases are rarely involved in chemical
reactions and almost never form compounds with other elements.

Noble Gases and the Octet Rule

Because the noble gases are the least reactive of all elements, their eight valence electrons are used as the standard
for nonreactivity and to explain how other elements interact. This is stated as the octet (“group of eight”) rule.
According to this rule, atoms react to form compounds that allow them to have a group of eight valence electrons
like the noble gases. For example, sodium (with one valence electron) reacts with chlorine (with seven valence
electrons) to form the stable compound sodium chloride (table salt). In this reaction, sodium donates an electron and
chlorine accepts it, giving each element an octet of valence electrons.

Some Uses of Noble Gases

Did you ever get helium balloons like those in the opening picture? Unlike a balloon ﬁlled with air, a balloon ﬁlled
with helium needs to be weighted down so it won’t ﬂoat away —although you don’t have to use an elephant!.
Q: Why does a helium balloon ﬂoat away if it’s not weighted down?
A: Helium atoms have just two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons, so they have less mass than any other
atoms except hydrogen. As a result, helium is lighter than air, explaining why a helium balloon ﬂoats up into the air
unless weighted down.
Early incandescent light bulbs, like the one pictured in the Figure 6.14, didn’t last very long. The ﬁlaments quickly
burned out. Although air was pumped out of the bulb, it wasn’t a complete vacuum. Oxygen in the small amount
of air remaining inside the light bulb reacted with the metal ﬁlament. This corroded the ﬁlament and caused dark
deposits on the glass. Filling a light bulb with argon gas prevents these problems. That’s why modern light bulbs are
ﬁlled with argon.
Q: How does argon prevent the problems of early light bulbs?
A: As a noble gas with eight electrons, argon doesn’t react with the metal in the ﬁlament. This protects the ﬁlament
and keeps the glass blub free of deposits.
Noble gases are also used to ﬁll the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure 6.15. Although noble gases
are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this
happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they
give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light,
like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.

Summary

• Noble gases are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the periodic table.
• Noble gases are the least reactive of all elements. That’s because they have eight valence electrons, which
ﬁll their outer energy level. This is the most stable arrangement of electrons, so noble gases rarely react with
other elements and form compounds.

• Identify halogens.

• List some uses of halogens.

You’ve probably seen halogen lights like the ones pictured here. You may even have halogen lights in your home. If
you do, you may have noticed that they get really hot and give off a lot of light for their size. A halogen light differs
from a regular incandescent light bulb in having a small amount of halogen gas inside the bulb. The gas combines
chemically with the metal in the ﬁlament, and this extends the life of the ﬁlament. It allows the lamp to get hotter and
give off more light than a regular incandescent light without burning out quickly. What is halogen gas, and which
elements are halogens? In this article, you’ll ﬁnd out.

Meet the Halogens

Halogens are highly reactive nonmetallic elements in group 17 of the periodic table. As you can see in the periodic
table shown in the Figure 6.16, the halogens include the elements ﬂuorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine
(I), and astatine (At). All of them are relatively common on Earth except for astatine. Astatine is radioactive and
rapidly decays to other, more stable elements. As a result, it is one of the least common elements on Earth.
Q: Based on their position in the periodic table from the Figure 6.16, how many valence electrons do you think
halogens have?
A: The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in group 1. It then increases by one from left to right
across each period (row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18. Therefore, halogens have seven valence
electrons.

Chemical Properties of Halogens

The halogens are among the most reactive of all elements, although reactivity declines from the top to the bottom of
the halogen group. Because all halogens have seven valence electrons, they are “eager” to gain one more electron.
Doing so gives them a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Halogens often
combine with alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table. Alkali metals have just one valence electron, which they
are equally “eager” to donate. Reactions involving halogens, especially halogens near the top of the group, may be
explosive. You can see some examples in the video at the URL below. (Warning: Don’t try any of these reactions at

Physical Properties of Halogens

The halogen group is quite diverse.
It includes elements that occur in three different states of matter at room
temperature. Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine and astatine are solids. Halogens also
vary in color, as you can see in the Figure 6.17. Fluorine and chlorine are green, bromine is red, and iodine and
astatine are nearly black. Like other nonmetals, halogens cannot conduct electricity or heat. Compared with most
other elements, halogens have relatively low melting and boiling points. You can watch a lab demonstration of the

Use
Bromine is used to purify water in swimming pools and
hot tubs. It reacts with bacteria and other germs and
renders them harmless.

Iodine is added to alcohol and used as an antiseptic. It
reacts with germs on cuts and wounds. Small amounts
of iodine are also needed for good health.
In the
U.S., iodine is added to table salt to prevent iodine
deﬁciencies. Does the salt you use contain iodine?

Q: Can you relate some of these uses of halogens to the properties of these elements?
A: The ability of halogens to kill germs and bleach clothes relates to their highly reactive nature.

Summary

• Halogens are highly reactive nonmetal elements in group 17 of the periodic table.
• Halogens include solids, liquids, and gases at room temperature, and they vary in color.
• Halogens are among the most reactive of all elements. They have seven valence electrons, so they are very

“eager” to gain one electron to have a full outer energy level.

• Halogens have a variety of important uses, such as preventing tooth decay and killing germs.

• Identify the transition metals on the periodic table.
• Describe the characteristic electron conﬁguration of the transition elements.

What are the similarities and differences between these two cars?

From the outside, the two cars above look the same (except for the ﬂashy paint job on the racing model). They are
the same model of the car, but one is a stock edition for regular driving while the other one is built for high-speed
racing. We really can’t tell much from the external view. To see the differences, we need to go under the hood, take
the engines apart, and look at the braking and suspension systems in order to see how the two cars differ.
Many electron conﬁgurations of elements are simple and straightforward. We can look at the outer shell and easily
understand how that set of elements will react in terms of electron gain or loss. However, there are sets of elements
that are more complex in their behavior. One such group is called the transition elements.

Transition elements are the elements that are found in Groups 3-12 (old groups IIA-IIB) on the periodic table
(salmon-colored block in the middle of the table). The term refers to the fact that the d sublevel, which is in the

309

6.13. Transition Elements

www.ck12.org

process of being ﬁlled, is in a lower principal energy level than the s sublevel ﬁlled before it. For example, the
electron conﬁguration of scandium, the ﬁrst transition element, is [Ar]3 d14s2. Remember that the conﬁguration is
reversed from the ﬁll order –the 4s ﬁlled before the 3d begins. Because they are all metals, the transition elements
are often called the transition metals. As a group, they display typical metallic properties and are less reactive than
the metals in Groups 1 and 2. Some of the more familiar ones are so unreactive that they can be found in nature in
their free, or uncombined state. These include platinum, gold, and silver. Because of this unique ﬁlling order, the
transition elements are often referred to as “d-block” elements.

FIGURE 6.18

Compounds of many transition elements are distinctive for being widely and vividly colored. As visible light passes
through a transition metal compound dissolved in water, the d-orbitals absorb light of various energies. The visible
light of a given energy level which is not absorbed produces a distinctly colored solution.

ors. From left to right are shown solutions

Summary

• The transition elements are found in groups IIIA-IIB (new groups 3-12).
• These elements are characterized by having unﬁlled d sublevels.
• In general, the next higher s sublevel is already ﬁlled or has one electron missing.
• Many transition element compounds are brightly colored due to the inner-level d electron transitions.

How many dolls are in this picture?

Russian “nesting dolls” (often known as matryoshka dolls) have a long history in Russia. These dolls are designed
to nest inside of one another. When we open the largest doll, we ﬁnd a somewhat smaller doll inside it. These dolls
can often go down seven or eight layers. The set seen above is unusual in that it has over thirty-ﬁve layers.

Lanthandies and Actinides

We see some hidden “layers” in chemistry. As we look at the periodic table below, we see two pink boxes –one
between Ba (element 56) and Hf (element 72) and the other between Ra (88) and Rf (104). These elements all have
unﬁlled f -sublevels. Because of the uniqueness of the electron conﬁgurations, these elements ﬁt into the two boxes
in the larger periodic table.
As the number of elecrons in an atom increases, we begin to see some strange behaviors. Due to the way the electron
energy levels work, some inner levels ﬁll after one or more outer levels do. We see this in two similar groups of
elements –the lanthanides and the actinides.

Chapter 6. The Periodic Table

The f-Block

The ﬁrst of the f sublevels to begin ﬁlling is the 4f sublevel. It ﬁlls after the 6s sublevel, meaning that f sublevels are
two principal energy levels behind. The general electron conﬁguration for elements in the f block is (n - 2)f 1−14ns2.
The seven orbitals of the f sublevel accommodate 14 electrons, so the f block is 14 elements in length. It is pulled
out of the main body of the period table and is shown at the very bottom. Because of that, the elements of the f
block do not belong to a group, being wedged in between Groups 3 and 4. The lanthanides are the 14 elements from
cerium (atomic number 58) to lutetium (atomic number 71). The word comes from the Greek “lanthanein” meaning
“to be hidden.” The name probably arose because these elements all hide behind one another in the periodic table.
The 4f sublevel is in the process of being ﬁlled for the lanthanides. They are all metals and are similar in reactivity
to the Group 2 alkaline earth metals.
The actinides are the 14 elements from thorium (atomic number 90) to lawrencium (atomic number 103). The 5f
sublevel is in the process of being ﬁlled. The actinides are all radioactive elements and only the ﬁrst four have been
found naturally on Earth. All of the others have only been artiﬁcially made in the laboratory. The lanthanides and
actinides together are sometimes called the inner transition elements.

Uses of Lanthanides

Lanthanides have been widely used as alloys to impart strength and hardness to metals. The main lanthanide used
for this purpose is cerium, mixed with small amounts of lanthanum, neodymium, and praseodymium. These metals
are also widely used in the petroleum industry for reﬁning of crude oil into gasoline products.
Erbium and other lanthanides are widely used in some optical devices, such as night vision goggles, laser beams,
and phosphorescent materials.

How can all of these people ﬁt in such a small space?

Events draw large numbers of people to them. Even an outdoor event can ﬁll up so that there is no room for more
people. The crowd capacity depends on the amount of space in the venue, and the amount of space depends on
the size of the objects ﬁlling it. We can get more people into a given space than we can elephants, because the
elephants are larger than people. We can get more squirrels into that same space than we can people for the same
reason. Knowing the sizes of objects we are dealing with can be important in deciding how much space is needed.

Atomic Radius

The size of atoms is important when trying to explain the behavior of atoms or compounds. One of the ways we can
express the size of atoms is with the atomic radius. This data helps us understand why some molecules ﬁt together
and why other molecules have parts that get too crowded under certain conditions.
The size of an atom is deﬁned by the edge of its orbital. However, orbital boundaries are fuzzy and in fact are
variable under different conditions. In order to standardize the measurement of atomic radii, the distance between
the nuclei of two identical atoms bonded together is measured. The atomic radius is deﬁned as one-half the distance
between the nuclei of identical atoms that are bonded together.
Atomic radii have been measured for elements. The units for atomic radii are picometers, equal to 10−12 meters. As
an example, the internuclear distance between the two hydrogen atoms in an H2 molecule is measured to be 74 pm.
Therefore, the atomic radius of a hydrogen atom is 74

2 = 37 pm.

Periodic Trend

The atomic radius of atoms generally decreases from left to right across a period. There are some small exceptions,
such as the oxygen radius being slightly greater than the nitrogen radius. Within a period, protons are added to the
nucleus as electrons are being added to the same principal energy level. These electrons are gradually pulled closer

317

6.15. Periodic Trends: Atomic Radius

www.ck12.org

to the nucleus because of its increased positive charge. Since the force of attraction between nuclei and electrons
increases, the size of the atoms decreases. The effect lessens as one moves further to the right in a period because of
electron-electron repulsions that would otherwise cause the atom’s size to increase.

Group Trend

The atomic radius of atoms generally increases from top to bottom within a group. As the atomic number increases
down a group, there is again an increase in the positive nuclear charge. However, there is also an increase in the
number of occupied principle energy levels. Higher principal energy levels consist of orbitals which are larger in
size than the orbitals from lower energy levels. The effect of the greater number of principal energy levels outweighs
the increase in nuclear charge and so atomic radius increases down a group.

is shown in a different color. As the

Why do sheep travel in herds?

Like many other animals, sheep travel in herds. The tendency is for each individual sheep to stay with the herd.
However, a sheep may sometimes wander off, depending on how strong the attraction is for a particular food or
water supply. At other times, a sheep may become frightened and run off. Whether a sheep chooses to stay with the
herd or go its own way depends on the balance between attraction to the herd and attraction to the outside inﬂuence.
There is an on-going tension between the electrons and protons in an atom. Reactivity of the atom depends in
part on how easily the electrons can be removed from the atom. We can measure this quantity and use it to make
predictions about the behaviors of atoms.

Ionization Energy

Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from a speciﬁc atom. It is measured in kJ/mol,
which is an energy unit, much like calories. The ionization energies associated with some elements are described
in the Table 6.6. For any given atom, the outermost valence electrons will have lower ionization energies than the
inner-shell kernel electrons. As more electrons are added to a nucleus, the outer electrons become shielded from the
nucleus by the inner shell electrons. This is called electron shielding.

If we plot the ﬁrst ionization energies vs. atomic number for the main group elements, we would have the following
trend

FIGURE 6.26
Ionization energy and atomic number.

Moving from left to right across the periodic table, the ionization energy for an atom increases. We can explain this
by considering the nuclear charge of the atom. The more protons in the nucleus, the stronger the attraction of the
nucleus to electrons. This stronger attraction makes it more difﬁcult to remove electrons.
Within a group, the ionization energy decreases as the size of the atom gets larger. On the graph, we see that the
ionization energy increases as we go up the group to smaller atoms.
In this situation, the ﬁrst electron removed is
farther from the nucleus as the atomic number (number of protons) increases. Being farther away from the positive
attraction makes it easier for that electron to be pulled off.

What is the goal of a roller derby game?

Roller derby is a popular sport, although it is unfamiliar to many people. The basic purpose is to set one team
member (the “jammer”) past the opposing team to score points. Other members of the team serve as blockers to
prevent the opposing team from stopping the jammer. Blockers interfere with the interaction between the jammer
and the opponents by getting between the jammer and the skaters trying to stop her.
The attraction between an electron and the nucleus of the atom is not a simple issue. Only with hydrogen is there a
one-to-one relationship that can be discussed in terms of direct charge attraction. As the size of the atom increases,
the number of protons and electrons also increase. These changes inﬂuence how the nucleus attracts electrons.

Electron Shielding

In general, the ionization energy of an atom will increase as we move from left to right across the periodic table.
There are several exceptions to the general increase in ionization energy across a period. The elements of Group 13
(B, Al, etc.) have lower ionization energies than the elements of Group 2 (Be, Mg, etc.). This is an illustration of a
concept called “ electron shielding.” Outer electrons are partially shielded from the attractive force of the protons
in the nucleus by inner electrons.
To explain how shielding works, consider a lithium atom. It has three protons and three electrons –two in the ﬁrst
principal energy level and its valence electron in the second. The valence electron is partially shielded from the

323

terior electron cloud (light blue) shielding

attractive force of the nucleus. A larger
shielding effect results in a decrease in
ionization energy.

attractive force of the nucleus by the two inner electrons. Removing that valence electron becomes easier because
of the shielding effect.
There is also a shielding effect that occurs between sublevels within the same principal energy level. Speciﬁcally, an
electron in the “s” sublevel is capable of shielding electrons in the “p” sublevel of the same principal energy level.
This is because of the spherical shape of the “s” orbital. The reverse is not true –electrons in “p” orbitals do not
shield electrons in “s” orbitals.

FIGURE 6.28
The spherical 3s orbital exhibits a shield-
ing effect on the dumbbell shaped 3p
orbital that is of slightly higher energy.
This reduces the ionization energy of a 3p
electron compared to a 3s electron.

The electron being removed from an Al atom is a 3p electron, which is shielded by the two 3s electrons as well as
all the inner core electrons. The electron being removed from a Mg atom is a 3s electron, which is only shielded
by the inner core electrons. Since there is a greater degree of electron shielding in the Al atom, it is slightly easier to
remove the valence electron and its ionization energy is less than that of Mg. This is despite the fact that the nucleus
of the Al atom contains one more proton than the nucleus of the Mg atom.

324

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. The Periodic Table

There is another anomaly between Groups 15 and 16. Atoms of Group 16 (O, S, etc.) have lower ionization energies
than atoms of Group 15 (N, P, etc.). Hund’s rule is behind the explanation. In a nitrogen atom, there are three
electrons in the 2p sublevel and each is unpaired. In an oxygen atom, there are four electrons in the 2p sublevel, so
one orbital contains a pair of electrons. It is that second electron in the orbital that is removed in the ionization of an
oxygen atom. Since electrons repel each other, it is slightly easier to remove the electron from the paired set in the
oxygen atom than it is to remove an unpaired electron from the nitrogen atom.

Summary

• Electron shielding refers to the blocking of valence shell electron attraction by the nucleus due to the presence

of inner-shell electrons.

• Electrons in an s orbital can shield p electrons at the same energy level because of the spherical shape of the s

orbital.

• Electrons in paired spin conﬁgurations are slightly easier to remove than unpaired electrons.

Do you tend to overpack before going on trips?

Packing for a trip can be very challenging. What do you take with you? Where will you be going and what will
you need? We usually pack too much (like the suitcase above) and then ﬁnd it hard to close the suitcase. When the
suitcase is over-full, there is stress on the system and forces pushing the suitcase open. When electrons are added
to an atom, the increased negative charge puts stress on the electrons already there, causing energy to be released.
When electrons are removed from an atom, that process requires energy to pull the electron away from the nu-
cleus. Addition of an electron releases energy from the process.

Electron Afﬁnity

In most cases, the formation of an anion by the addition of an electron to a neutral atom releases energy. This can be
shown for the chloride ion formation below:

Cl + e− → Cl− + energy

The energy change that occurs when a neutral atom gains an electron is called its electron afﬁnity. When energy
is released in a chemical reaction or process, that energy is expressed as a negative number. The ﬁgure below

electron afﬁnities. This means that more energy is released in the formation of a halide ion than for the anions of any
other elements. Considering electron conﬁguration, it is easy to see why. The outer conﬁguration of all halogens
is ns2np5. The addition of one more electron gives the halide ions the same electron conﬁguration as a noble gas,
which we have seen is particularly stable.
Period and group trends for electron afﬁnities are not nearly as regular as for ionization energy. In general, electron
afﬁnities increase (become more negative) from left to right across a period and decrease (become less negative)
from top to bottom down a group. However, there are many exceptions, owing in part to inherent difﬁculties in
accurately measuring electron afﬁnities.

Summary

• Electron afﬁnity is a measure of the energy released when an extra electron is added to an atom.
• Electron afﬁnities are measured in the gaseous state.
• In general, electron afﬁnities become more negative as we move from left to right on the periodic table.
• In general, electron afﬁnities become less negative from top to bottom of a group.

How are peanuts sold?

Peanuts can be sold two ways. The bare peanut without the shell (brown inner portion of peanut) can be purchased
in jars and packages for casual munching or for cooking. The size of the peanut in this situation is smaller than the
peanut plus shell since the outer portion is missing. If we add the shell to the peanut, we have a larger size for the
combination.
Electrons and protons are strongly attracted to one another. The strength of that attraction and the relative numbers
of the two particles in a given atom or ion have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the size of that species. When an atom
loses one or more electrons, the resulting ion becomes smaller. If electrons are added to the atom, the ion becomes
larger.

Ionic Radius

The ionic radius for an atom is measured in a crystal lattice, requiring a solid form for the compound. These radii
will differ somewhat depending upon the technique used. Usually X-ray crystallography is employed to determine
the radius for an ion.

Groups 1, 2, 13, 16 and 17. The atoms
are shown in gray. Groups 1, 2, and 13
are metals and form cations, shown in
red. Groups 16 and 17 are nonmetals and
form anions, shown in blue.

The removal of electrons always results in a cation that is considerably smaller than the parent atom. When the
valence electron(s) are removed, the resulting ion has one fewer occupied principal energy level, so the electron
cloud that remains is smaller. Another reason is that the remaining electrons are drawn closer to the nucleus because
the protons now outnumber the electrons. One other factor is the number of electrons removed. The potassium
atom has one electron removed to for the corresponding ion, while calcium loses two electrons.
The addition of electrons always results in an anion that is larger than the parent atom. When the electrons outnumber
the protons, the overall attractive force that the protons have for the electrons is decreased. The electron cloud also
spreads out because more electrons results in greater electron-electron repulsions. Notice that the group 16 ions are
larger than the group 17 ions. The group 16 elements each add two electrons while the group 17 elements add one
electron per atom for form the anions.

Summary

• Ionic radius is determined by measuring the atom in a crystal lattice.
• Removal of electrons results in an ion that is smaller than the parent element.
• Addition of electrons results in an ion that is larger than the parent atom.

• Describe trends in electronegativity in the periodic table.

Is it easy or hard for you to make new friends?

Have you ever noticed how some people attract others to them? Whether it is their personality, attractiveness, or
athletic skills –something pulls people toward them, while others have a smaller group of friends and acquain-
tances. Atoms do the same thing. One atom may pull electrons strongly to it, while a second type of atom has
much less “pulling power.”

Electronegativity

Valence electrons of both atoms are always involved when those two atoms come together to form a chemical bond.
Chemical bonds are the basis for how elements combine with one another to form compounds. When these chemical
bonds form, atoms of some elements have a greater ability to attract the valence electrons involved in the bond than
other elements.
Electronegativity is a measure of the ability of an atom to attract the electrons when the atom is part of a compound.
Electronegativity differs from electron afﬁnity because electron afﬁnity is the actual energy released when an atom
gains an electron. Electronegativity is not measured in energy units, but is rather a relative scale. All elements are
compared to one another, with the most electronegative element, ﬂuorine, being assigned an electronegativity value
of 3.98. Fluorine attracts electrons better than any other element. The table below shows the electronegativity values
for the elements.
Since metals have few valence electrons, they tend to increase their stability by losing electrons to become cations.
Consequently, the electronegativities of metals are generally low. Nonmetals have more valence electrons and
increase their stability by gaining electrons to become anions. The electronegativities of nonmetals are generally
high.

Trends

Electronegativities generally increase from left to right across a period. This is due to an increase in nuclear charge.
Alkali metals have the lowest electronegativities, while halogens have the highest. Because most noble gases do not

form compounds, they do not have electronegativities. Note that there is little variation among the transition metals.
Electronegativities generally decrease from top to bottom within a group due to the larger atomic size.
Of the main group elements, ﬂuorine has the highest electronegativity (EN = 4.0) and cesium the lowest (EN = 0.79).
This indicates that ﬂuorine has a high tendency to gain electrons from other elements with lower electronegativities.
We can use these values to predict what happens when certain elements combine. The following video shows this.

When the difference between electronegativities is greater than ~1.7, then a complete exchange of electrons occurs.
Typically this exchange is between a metal and a nonmetal. For instance, sodium and chlorine will typically combine
to form a new compound and each ion becomes isoelectronic with its nearest noble gas. When we compare the EN
values, we see that the electronegativity for Na is 0.93 and the value for Cl is 3.2. The absolute difference between
ENs is |0.93 - 3.2| = 2.27. This value is greater than 1.7, and therefore indicates a complete electron exchange occurs.

What are we eating as a nation?
The graph above indicates some trends in our diet over a thirty-year period. By observing the direction our eating
habits are going, we can take steps to help prevent bad eating habits and decrease problems such as high blood
pressure and heart attacks.
Development of the periodic table has helped organize chemical information in many ways. We can now see trends
among properties of different atoms and make predictions about the behavior of speciﬁc materials.

Metallic and Nonmetallic Character

Metallic character refers to the level of reactivity of a metal. Metals tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions,
as indicated by their low ionization energies. Within a compound, metal atoms have relatively low attraction for
electrons, as indicated by their low electronegativities. By following the trend summary in the ﬁgure below, you
can see that the most reactive metals would reside in the lower left portion of the periodic table. The most reactive
metal is cesium, which is not found in nature as a free element. It reacts explosively with water and will ignite
spontaneously in air. Francium is below cesium in the alkali metal group, but is so rare that most of its properties
have never been observed.
Reactivity of metals is based on processes such as the formation of halide compounds with halogens and how easily
they displace hydrogen from dilute acids.

335

6.21. Metallic and Nonmetallic Character

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 6.32
Trends in behaviors of elements.

The metallic character increases as you go down a group. Since the ionization energy decreases going down a group
(or increases going up a group), the increased ability for metals lower in a group to lose electrons makes them more
reactive. In addition, the atomic radius increases going down a group, placing the outer electrons further away from
the nucleus and making that electron less attracted by the nucleus.
Nonmetals tend to gain electrons in chemical reactions and have a high attraction for electrons within a compound.
The most reactive nonmetals reside in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Since the noble gases are a special
group because of their lack of reactivity, the element ﬂuorine is the most reactive nonmetal. It is not found in nature
as a free element. Fluorine gas reacts explosively with many other elements and compounds and is considered to be
one of the most dangerous known substances.
Note that there is no clear division between metallic and non-metallic character. As we move across the periodic
table, there is an increasing tendency to accept electrons (non-metallic) and a decrease in the possibility that an atom
would give up one or more electrons.

Summary

• Metallic character refers to the level of reactivity of a metal.
• Non-metallic character relates to the tendency to accept electrons during chemical reactions.
• Metallic tendency increases going down a group.
• Non-metallic tendency increases going from left to right across the periodic table.

• Deﬁne molecular formula.
• Describe how to write molecular formulas.

Why are music notes a unique "language"?

There are many “universal languages” in the world. Musicians of every culture recognize the music embodied in a
series of notes on a staff.
This passage from a Bach cello suite could be played by any trained musician from any country, because there is
agreement as to what the symbols on the page mean.
In the same way, molecules are represented using symbols
that all chemists agree upon.

Molecular Formula

A molecule is two or more atoms that have been chemically combined. A molecular formula is a chemical formula
of a molecular compound that shows the kinds and numbers of atoms present in a molecule of the compound.
Ammonia is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen as shown below:

Note from the example that there are some standard rules to follow in writing molecular formulas. The arrangements
of the elements depend on the particular structure, so we will not concern ourselves with that point right now. The
number of atoms of each kind is indicated by a subscript following the atom. If there is only one atom, no number
is written.
If there is more than one atom of a speciﬁc kind, the number is written as a subscript following the
atom. We would not write N3H for ammonia, because that would mean that there are three nitrogen atoms and one
hydrogen atom in the molecule, which is incorrect.
The molecular formula does not tell us anything about the shape of the molecule or where the different atoms
are. The molecular formula for sucrose (table sugar) is C12H22O11. This simply tells us the number of carbon, hy-
drogen, and oxygen atoms in the molecule. There is nothing said about where the individual atoms are located. We

341

7.1. Molecular Formula

need a much more complicated formula (shown below) to communicate that information.

Summary

• A molecular formula tells us what atoms and how many of each type of atom are present in a molecule.
• If only one atom of a speciﬁc type is present, no subscript is used.
• For atoms that have two or more present, a subscript is written after the symbol for that atom.
• Molecular formulas do not indicate how the atoms are arranged in the molecule.

7.2 Empirical Formula

• Deﬁne empirical formula.
• Describe how to determine the empirical formula for a compound.

What might the scientists in this picture be discussing?

When the French scientist Antoine Lavoisier conducted his experiments, he did not know what the products of
reactions were going to be. He had to isolate the material (whether he was heating mercury or measuring gases from
breathing) and then study its elemental composition before he could understand the processes that were occurring.
Discovering that a new compound exists is the start of a long research project. In order to make this new compound
in the lab, we need to know a lot about its structure. Often, the place to start is to determine the elements in the
material. Then we can ﬁnd out the relative amounts of each element to continue our evaluation of this new material.

Empirical Formula

An empirical formula is a formula that shows the elements in a compound in their lowest whole-number ratio.
Glucose is an important simple sugar that cells use as their primary source of energy.
Its molecular formula is
C6H12O6. Since each of the subscripts is divisible by 6, the empirical formula for glucose is CH2O. When chemists
analyze an unknown compound, often the ﬁrst step is to determine its empirical formula. There are a great many
compounds whose molecular and empirical formulas are the same. If the molecular formula cannot be simpliﬁed
into a smaller whole-number ratio, as in the case of H2O or P2O5, then the empirical formula is also the molecular
formula.
How would we determine an empirical formula for a compound? Let’s take a compound composed of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen. We can analyze the relative amounts of each element in the compound. When we
get a percent ﬁgure for each element, we now know how many grams of each are in 100 grams of the original
material. This allows us to determine the number of moles for each element. The ratios can then be reduced to
small whole numbers to give the empirical formula. If we wanted a molecular formula, we would need to determine
the molecular weight of the compound.

Have you ever gone digging for gold?

When the prospectors during the California Gold Rush (1848-1855) searched for gold nuggets in the earth, they were
able to ﬁnd these nuggets because gold is an unreactive material that exists in its elemental state in many places. Not
everyone was fortunate enough to ﬁnd large nuggets such as those shown above, but a number of these miners did
become very wealthy (of course, a large number of others went back home broke).
Many of the elements we know about do not exist in their native form. They are so reactive that they are found only
in compounds. These non-elemental forms are known as ions. Their properties are very different from those of the
elements they come from. The term comes from a Greek word meaning “move” and was ﬁrst coined by Michael
Faraday, who studied the movement of materials in an electrical ﬁeld.

Cations

Some elements lose one or more electrons in forming ions. These ions are known as “ cations” because they
are positively charged and migrate toward the negative electrode ( cathode) in an electrical ﬁeld. Looking at the
periodic table below, we know that the group 1 elements are all characterized by having one s electron in the outer
orbit and group 2 elements have two s electrons in the outer orbit. These electrons are loosely attached to the atom
and can easily be removed, leaving more protons in the atom that there are electrons, so the resulting ion has a
positive charge. Cations can also be formed from electron loss to many of the transition elements.

The cations are designated by the symbol for the parent element and a plus charge as a superscript after the element
symbol - the potassium cation would be indicated as K+. Note that the charge is placed after the symbol and not
before it. The potassium ion is monovalent, meaning that it has lost one electron and has a +1 charge. The symbol
for the magnesium cation would be Mg2+ or Mg++ to indicate that it has lost two electrons and has a +2 charge, so
the magnesium cation would be referred to as a divalent cation.
The cations are simply named as the parent element. The sodium cation is still called “sodium.” Often, the charge
would be attached for clarity, so the sodium cation might be referred to as “sodium one plus.”

Applications of Cations

Cations play important roles in our daily lives. Sodium, potassium, and magnesium ions are essential for such
processes as blood pressure regulation and muscle contraction. Calcium ion is an important part of bone struc-
ture. Sodium ions can used in water softeners to remove other harmful elements. We put sodium chloride (table
salt) on our food and use it as a preservative.

What does the amount of salt in seaweed tell us?

Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difﬁculties, including
problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could
usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to
add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion
are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater ﬁsh.
When a metal loses an electron, energy is needed to remove that electron. The other part of this process involves the
addition of the electron to another element. The electron adds to the outer shell of the new element. Just as the loss
of the electron from the metal produces a full shell, when the electron or electrons are added to the new element, it
also results in a full shell.

Anions

Anions are negative ions that are formed when a nonmetal atom gains one or more electrons. Anions are so named
because they are attracted to the anode (positive ﬁeld) in an electric ﬁeld. Atoms typically gain electrons so that

348

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Chemical Nomenclature

they will have the electron conﬁguration of a noble gas. All the elements in Group 17 have seven valence electrons
due to the outer ns2np5 conﬁguration. Therefore, each of these elements would gain one electron and become an
anion with a 1− charge. Likewise, Group 16 elements form ions with a 2− charge, and the Group 15 nonmetals
form ions with a 3− charge.

Naming anions is slightly different than naming cations. The ending of the element’s name is dropped and replaced
with the –ide sufﬁx. For example, F− is the ﬂuoride ion, while O2− is the oxide ion. As is the case with cations, the
charge on the anion is indicated by a superscript following the symbol. Common anions are listed in the Table 7.1 :

balance in blood. Iodide ion is needed by the thyroid gland to make the hormone thyroxine.

What kind of coin is this?

Most of us are familiar with the common coins: penny, nickel, quarter.
In some areas (such as Las Vegas), you
might see large amounts of silver dollars (these get a little heavy in your pocket). But most of us have probably
never seen a platiunum eagle –an eagle coin, but one that is held primarily by collectors.
If you were to take a
one-ounce platinum eagle into a store and try to buy one hundred dollars worth of items, the store owner most likely
would not believe you when you told them the coin was worth one hundred dollars. It would also be awkward and
annoying if you lost one of these coins out of your pocket. Platinum is just one of several transition metals that is
worth a lot of money (gold is another one).
The group 1 and 2 elements form cations through a simple process that involves the loss of one or more outer shell
electrons. These electrons come from the s orbital and are removed very readily.

Transition Metal Ions

Most transition metals differ from the metals of Groups 1, 2, and 13 in that they are capable of forming more than
one cation with different ionic charges. As an example, iron commonly forms two different ions. It can sometimes
lose two electrons to form the Fe2+ ion, while at other times it loses three electrons to form the Fe3+ ion. Tin and
lead, though members of the p block rather than the d block, also are capable of forming multiple ions.

351

7.5. Transition Metal Ions

www.ck12.org

Ionic formation for transition metals is complicated by the fact that these elements have unﬁlled inner d shells. Al-
though the next higher s orbitals are actually at a lower energy level than the d level, these s electrons are the ones
that are removed during ionization.
The Table 7.2 lists the names and formulas of some of the common transition metal ions:

Uses for Transition Metals

Because there are so many metals in this group, there are a wide variety of uses. Many of the metals are used in
electronics, while others (such as gold and silver) are used in monetary systems. Iron is a versatile structural mate-
rial. Cobalt, nickel, platinum, and other metals are employed as catalysts in a number of chemical reactions. Zinc
is a signiﬁcant component of batteries.

Do you know the proper name for this insect?

Proper naming is important for identiﬁcation purposes. Medicine names must be precise so that the correct drug is
given, one that will help the patient and not harm them. Biological classiﬁcation of species requires accurate naming
for proper categorization. The insect above has been properly categorized by genus and species, so it is uniquely
identiﬁed. Names must be correct for the tracing family trees in genealogical studies. Compounds used in chemical
reactions must be correctly speciﬁed in order for the reaction to occur.

Binary Ionic Compounds

A binary ionic compound is a compound composed of a monatomic metal cation and a monatomic nonmetal anion.

Naming Binary Ionic Compounds

When examining the formula of a compound in order to name it, you must ﬁrst decide what kind of compound it is.
For a binary ionic compound, a metal will always be the ﬁrst element in the formula, while a nonmetal will always

354

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Chemical Nomenclature

be the second. The metal cation is named ﬁrst, followed by the nonmetal anion. Subscripts in the formula do not
affect the name. The Table 7.3 shows three examples:

TABLE 7.3: Naming Binary Ionic Compounds

Formula

KF
Na3N
Ca3P2

Name

potassium ﬂuoride
sodium nitride
calcium phosphide

Notice that in each of the formulas above, the overall charge of the compound is zero. Potassium ion is K+, while
ﬂuoride ion is F−. Since the magnitude of the charges is equal, the formula contains one of each ion. This would
also be the case for a compound such as MgS, in which the ions are Mg2+ and S2−. For sodium nitride, the sodium
ion is Na+, while the nitride ion is N3−. In order to make a neutral compound, three of the 1+ sodium ions are
required in order to balance out the single 3− nitride ion. So the Na is given a subscript of 3. For calcium phosphide,
the calcium ion is Ca2+, while the phosphide ion is P3−. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. To make the
compound neutral, three calcium ions have a total charge of 6+, while two phosphide ions have a total charge of 6−.
The Ca is given a subscript of 3, while the P is given a subscript of 2.

Summary

• A binary ionic compound is a compound composed of a monatomic metal cation and a monatomic nonmetal

anion.

• The metal part of the compound is named as the element.
• The non-metallic part of the compound is named by dropping the end of the element and adding –ide.
• For binary compounds, it is not necessary to indicate the number of ions in the compound.

• Name compounds using the Stock system.
• Write formulas of compounds when given the Stock name.

How is an mp3 player designed?

In describing many technological items, it’s not enough to simply say what brand or model we have. We talk about
details such as how much horsepower is “under the hood” for a car or how fast the chip is for our computer. Even a
simple device like an mp3 player has more than one size. We can get an 8 MB player, or a 16 MB player. Desig-
nation of the item often is incomplete without other information as to its capabilities.
Transition metals have more than one possibility for ion formation. In order to name these compounds correctly, we
need to be able to indicate which ion is involved in any given compound.

Naming Compounds Using the Stock System

Naming compounds that involve transition metal cations necessitates the use of the Stock system. Consider the
binary ionic compound FeCl3. To simply name this compound iron chloride would be incomplete because iron is
capable of forming two ions with different charges. The name of any iron-containing compound must reﬂect which
iron ion is in the compound. In this case, the subscript in the formula indicates that there are three chloride ions, each
with a 1− charge. Therefore, the charge of the single iron ion must be 3+. The correct name of FeCl3 is iron(III)
chloride, with the cation charge written as the Roman numeral. Here are several other examples.

Name
copper(I) oxide
copper(II) oxide
tin(IV) oxide

The ﬁrst two examples are both oxides of copper (shown in the Figure 7.3). The ratio of copper ions to oxide ions
determines the name. Since the oxide ion is O2−, the charges of the copper ion must be 1+ in the ﬁrst formula and
2+ in the second formula. In the third formula, there is one tin ion for every two oxide ions. This means that the tin

357

must carry a 4+ charge, making the name tin(IV) oxide.

• Be able to write formulas for binary ionic compounds when given the name.
• Be able to name the binary ionic compound when given the formula.

Shorthand was a very popular way of recording speech, especially in dictating letters and in court testimony. Instead
of trying to write out all the words, the person taking the dictation would use a set of symbols that represented
syllables or words. The pages above show a shorthand version of “A Christmas Carol” written by Charles Dick-
ens. Unless you know shorthand, the passage is meaningless. But knowing shorthand allows you to read this classic
story.
Different professions also use a type of shorthand in communication to save time. Chemists use chemical symbols
in combination to indicate speciﬁc compounds. There are two advantages to this approach:

1. The compound under discussion is clearly described so there can be no confusion about its identity.
2. Chemical symbols represent a universal language that all chemists can understand, no matter what their native

language is.

Writing Formulas for Binary Ionic Compounds

If you know the name of a binary ionic compound, you can write its chemical formula. Start by writing the metal
ion with its charge, followed by the nonmetal ion with its charge. Because the overall compound must be electrically
neutral, decide how many of each ion is needed in order for the positive and negative charge to cancel each other
out. Consider the compound aluminum nitride. The ions are:
Al3+ N3−
Since the ions have charges that are equal in magnitude, one of each will be the lowest ratio of ions in the for-
mula. The formula of aluminum nitride is AlN.

359

7.8. Formulas for Binary Ionic Compounds

www.ck12.org

The ions for the compound lithium oxide are:
Li+ O2−
In this case, two lithium ions are required to balance out the charge of one oxide ion. The formula of lithium oxide
is Li2O.
An alternative way to writing a correct formula for an ionic compound is to use the crisscross method. In this method,
the numerical value of each of the ion charges is crossed over to become the subscript of the other ion. Signs of the
charges are dropped. Shown below is the crisscross method for aluminum oxide.

The red arrows indicate that the 3 from the 3+ charge will cross over to become the subscript of the O. The 2 from
the 2− charge will cross over to become the subscript of the Al. The formula for aluminum oxide is Al2O3.
Be aware that ionic compounds are empirical formulas and so must be written as the lowest ratio of the ions.
In
the case of aluminum nitride, the crisscross method would yield a formula of Al3N3, which is not correct.
It must
be reduced to AlN. Following the crisscross method to write the formula for lead(IV) oxide would involve the
following steps:

The crisscross ﬁrst yields Pb2O4 for the formula, but that must be reduced to the lower ratio and PbO2 is the correct
formula.

Summary

• Formulas for binary compounds begin with the metal followed by the non-metal.
• Positive and negative charges must cancel each other out.
• Ionic compound formulas are written using the lowest ratio of ions.

Shakespeare once wrote, “A rose by any other name would smell as sweet,” part of the romantic balcony scene
between Romeo and Juliet in the play of that name. The two families were bitter rivals, but Juliet was saying she
loved Romeo no matter what his name was. Some names are simple –we know Romeo mainly as Romeo. Most
have us have a ﬁrst name, middle name (often not used), and last name. In some cultures, names will be much more
complex. The full name of the famous 20th century artist Pablo Picasso is Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan
Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Martyr Patricio Clito Ruíz y Picass.
Many materials exist as simple binary compounds composed of a metal cation and a non-metal anion, with each
ion consisting of only one type of atom. Other combinations of atoms also exist, either larger ionic complexes or
complete molecules. Some of the most useful materials we work with contain polyatomic ions.

the difference between the ions is in the number of oxygen atoms present, while the overall charge is the same. As
a class, these are called oxoanions. When there are two oxoanions for a particular element, the one with the greater
number of oxygen atoms gets the –ate sufﬁx, while the one with the fewer number of oxygen atoms gets the –ite

Most people enjoy eating pizza. When they order a pizza (either by phone, on-line, or in a restaurant), they don’t just
order “pizza.” Even the simplest “binary” pizza will have a topping and cheese –maybe pepperoni, maybe something
else. However, many pizzas quickly become more complex. One person may want pepperoni and sausage, another
may wish to order Canadian bacon and pineapple, and then you have the folks that can’t decide, so they order
half-this and half-that. The combinations may be more complex, but the same basic ideas about pizza are valid.

Ternary Ionic Compounds

Not all ionic compounds are composed of only monatomic ions. A ternary ionic compound is an ionic compound
composed of three or more elements. In a typical ternary ionic compound, there is still one type of cation and one
type of anion involved. The cation, the anion, or both, is a polyatomic ion.

Naming Ternary Ionic Compounds

The process of naming ternary ionic compounds is the same as naming binary ionic compounds. The cation is named
ﬁrst, followed by the anion. Some examples are shown in the Table 7.6:

TABLE 7.6: Examples of Ternary Ionic Compounds

NH4Cl
Fe(OH)3

TABLE 7.6: (continued)

sodium nitrate
ammonium chloride
iron(III) hydroxide

When more than one polyatomic ion is present in a compound, the formula of the ion is placed in parentheses with a
subscript outside of the parentheses that indicates how many of those ions are in the compound. In the last example
above, there is one Fe3+ cation and three OH− anions.

Writing Formulas for Ternary Ionic Compounds

Writing a formula for a ternary ionic compound also involves the same steps as for a binary ionic compound. Write
the symbol and charge of the cation followed by the symbol and charge of the anion. Use the crisscross method to
ensure that the ﬁnal formula is neutral. Calcium nitrate is composed of a calcium cation and a nitrate anion.

The charge is balanced by the presence of two nitrate ions and one calcium ion. Parentheses are used around the
nitrate ion because more than one of the polyatomic ion is needed. If only one polyatomic ion is in a formula,
parentheses are not used. As an example, the formula for calcium carbonate is CaCO3. The carbonate ion carries a
2− charge and so exactly balances the 2+ charge of the calcium ion.
2+ ion is called either the dimercury ion
There are two polyatomic ions that produce unusual formulas. The Hg2
or, preferably, the mercury(I) ion. When bonded with an anion with a 1− charge, such as chloride, the formula
is Hg2Cl2. Because the cation consists of two Hg atoms bonded together, this formula is not reduced to HgCl.
2−, is also a unit that must stay together in its formulas. For example, the formula for
Likewise, the peroxide ion, O2
potassium peroxide is K2O2.

Summary

• Ternary compounds are composed of three or more elements.
• Ternary compounds are named by stating the cation ﬁrst, followed by the anion.
• Positive and negative charges must balance.

Why do so many relatives in royalty share the same name?

Some families name a son (usually the ﬁrstborn) after his father. So it is somewhat common to ﬁnd John Smith,
Jr. named after John Smith the father. A few families may take it further and name the grandson John Smith
III. Countries with long histories of royalty take the naming even further. One line of kings named Henry goes up
to Henry the Eighth (not the nicest guy in the world –he had six wives and two of them came to untimely ends). The
use of numbering for names adds clarity to a system –we always know which Henry we are talking about.
Inorganic chemical compounds can be broadly classiﬁed into two groups: ionic compounds and molecular com-
pounds. The structure of all ionic compounds is an extended three-dimensional array of alternating positive and
negative ions. Since ionic compounds do not take the form of individual molecules, they are represented by empirical
formulas. Now we will begin to examine the formulas and nomenclature of molecular compounds.

Molecular Compounds

Molecular compounds are inorganic compounds that take the form of discrete molecules. Examples include such
familiar substance as water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). These compounds are very different from ionic
compounds like sodium chloride (NaCl). Ionic compounds are formed when metal atoms lose one or more of their
electrons to nonmetal atoms. The resulting cations and anions are electrostatically attracted to each other.

369

7.11. Naming Binary Molecular Compounds

www.ck12.org

So what holds the atoms of a molecule together? Rather than forming ions, the atoms of a molecule share their
valence electrons in such a way that a bond forms between pairs of atoms. In a carbon dioxide molecule, there are
two of these bonds, each occurring between the carbon atom and one of the two oxygen atoms.

FIGURE 7.4
Carbon dioxide molecules consist of a central carbon atom bonded to 2
oxygen atoms.

Larger molecules can have many, many bonds that serve to keep the molecule together. In a large sample of a given
molecular compound, all of the individual molecules are identical.

Naming Binary Molecular Compounds

Recall that a molecular formula shows the number of atoms of each element that a molecule contains. A molecule
of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, so its formula is H2O. A molecule of octane, which is
a component of gasoline, contains 8 atoms of carbon and 18 atoms of hydrogen. The molecular formula of octane
is C8H18.

FIGURE 7.5
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a reddish-brown toxic gas that is a prominent air
pollutant produced by internal combustion engines.

A binary molecular compound is a molecular compound that is composed of two elements. The elements that
combine to form binary molecular compounds are both nonmetal atoms. This contrasts with ionic compounds,
which were formed from a metal ion and a nonmetal ion. Therefore, binary molecular compounds are different
because ionic charges cannot be used to name them or to write their formulas. Another difference is that two
nonmetal atoms will frequently combine with one another in a variety of ratios. Consider the elements nitrogen
and oxygen. They combine to make several compounds including NO, NO2, and N2O. They all can’t be called
nitrogen oxide. How would someone know which one you were talking about? Each of the three compounds has

370

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Chemical Nomenclature

very different properties and reactivity. A system to distinguish between compounds such as these is necessary.
Preﬁxes are used in the names of binary molecular compounds to identify the number of atoms of each element. The
Table 7.7 shows the preﬁxes up to ten.

The rules for using the preﬁx system of nomenclature of binary molecular compounds can be summarized as follows.

1. Generally, the less-electronegative element is written ﬁrst in the formula, though there are a few excep-
tions. Carbon is always ﬁrst in a formula and hydrogen is after nitrogen in a formula such as NH3. The
order of common nonmetals in binary compound formulas is C, P, N, H, S, I, Br, Cl, O, F.

2. When naming, the appropriate preﬁx is used only if there are more than one atom of that element in the

formula.

3. The second element is named after the ﬁrst, but with the ending of the element’s name changed to –ide. The

appropriate preﬁx is always used for the second element.

4. The a or o at the end of a preﬁx is usually dropped from the name when the name of the element begins with

a vowel. As an example, four oxygen atoms is tetroxide instead of tetraoxide.

Some examples of molecular compounds are listed in the Table 7.8.

S2Cl2
Cl2O7

TABLE 7.8:

Name
nitrogen monoxide
dinitrogen monoxide
disulfur dichloride
dichlorine heptoxide

Notice that the mono- preﬁx is not used with the nitrogen in the ﬁrst compound, but is used with the oxygen in both
of the ﬁrst two examples. The S2Cl2 emphasizes that the formulas for molecular compounds are not reduced to their
lowest ratios. The o of mono- and the a of hepta- are dropped from the name when paired with oxide.

Summary

• Molecular compounds are inorganic compounds that take the form of discrete molecules.
• The atoms of these compounds are held together by covalent bonds.
• Preﬁxes are used to indicate the number of atoms of an element that are in the compound.

7.12 Naming Acids

• Deﬁne acid.
• State rules for naming acids.
• Write name of acid when given formula.

A spot test for gold has been in use for decades. The sample is ﬁrst treated with nitric acid. Other metals may react
or dissolve in this acid, but gold will not. Then the sample is added to a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric
acid. Gold will only dissolve in this mixture. The term “acid test” arose from the California gold rush in the late
1840s when this combination was used to test for the presence of real gold. It has since come to mean, “tested and
approved” in a number of ﬁelds.

Acids

An acid can be deﬁned in several ways. The most straightforward deﬁnition is that an acid is a molecular compound
that contains one or more hydrogen atoms and produces hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water.
This is a different type of compound than the others we have seen so far. Acids are molecular, which means that
in their pure state they are individual molecules and do not adopt the extended three-dimensional structures of ionic
compounds like NaCl. However, when these molecules are dissolved in water, the chemical bond between the
hydrogen atom and the rest of the molecule breaks, leaving a positively-charged hydrogen ion and an anion. This
can be symbolized in a chemical equation:

HCl → H+ + Cl−

373

7.12. Naming Acids

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 7.6
(A) Vinegar comes in a variety of types,
but all contain acetic acid. (B) Citrus fruits
like grapefruit contain citric and ascorbic
acids.

Since acids produce H+ cations upon dissolving in water, the H of an acid is written ﬁrst in the formula of an
inorganic acid. The remainder of the acid (other than the H) is the anion after the acid dissolves. Organic acids
are also an important class of compounds, but will not be discussed here. A binary acid is an acid that consists of
hydrogen and one other element. The most common binary acids contain a halogen. An oxoacid is an acid that
consists of hydrogen, oxygen, and a third element. The third element is usually a nonmetal.

Naming Acids

Since all acids contain hydrogen, the name of an acid is based on the anion that goes with it. These anions can either
be monatomic or polyatomic. The name of all monatomic ions ends in –ide. The majority of polyatomic ions end
in either –ate or –ite, though there are a few exceptions such as the cyanide ion (CN−). It is this sufﬁx of the anion
that determines how the acid is named as displayed in the rules and Table 7.9.

TABLE 7.9: Naming System for Acids

Anion Sufﬁx
-ide
-ate
-ite

Example
chloride (Cl−)
2−)
sulfate (SO4
−)
nitrite (NO2

Name of Acid
hydro_____ic acid
_____ic acid
_____ous acid

Example
hydrochloric acid (HCl)
sulfuric acid (H2SO4)
nitrous acid (HNO2)

The three different sufﬁxes that are possible for the anions lead to the three rules below.

1. When the anion ends in –ide, the acid name begins with the preﬁx hydro-. The root of the anion name goes in
the blank (chlor for chloride), followed by the sufﬁx –ic. HCl is hydrochloric acid because Cl− is the chloride
ion. HCN is hydrocyanic acid because CN− is the cyanide ion.

2. When the anion ends in –ate, the name of the acid is the root of the anion followed by the sufﬁx –ic. There is

no preﬁx. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid (not sulﬁc) because SO4

2− is the sulfate ion.

3. When the anion ends in –ite, the name of the acid is the root of the anion followed by the sufﬁx –ous. Again,

there is no preﬁx. HNO2 is nitrous acid because NO2

− is the nitrite ion.

Note how the root for a sulfur-containing oxoacid is sulfur- instead of just sulf-. The same is true for a phosphorus-
containing oxoacid. The root is phosphor- instead of simply phosph-.
Many foods and beverages contain citric acid. Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic acid. Car batteries contain
sulfuric acid that helps in the release of electrons to create electricity.

What different things are these workers doing to make soap?

Soap making has a long history. Until recently, soap was made using animal fats and lye from wood ashes. The
lye served as a base to break down the fats and help form the soap. Needless to say, unless the soap was washed to
remove the lye, it was very harsh on the skin. Many families would make their own soap by boiling the lye and fat
in a large kettle over an open ﬁre, a long and hot task.

Bases

The simplest way to deﬁne a base is an ionic compound that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water. One
of the most commonly used bases is sodium hydroxide, illustrated below.

Notice that because bases are ionic compounds, the number of hydroxides in the formula does not affect the
name.
The compound must be neutral, so the charges of the ions are balanced just as for other ionic com-
pounds. Sodium ion (Na+) requires one OH− ion to balance the charge, so the formula is NaOH. Calcium ion
(Ca2+) requires two OH− ions to balance the charge, so the formula is Ca(OH)2. Hydroxide ion is a polyatomic ion
and must be put in parentheses when there are more than on in a formula.

8.1 Electron Dot Diagrams

• Describe the electron dot diagram system of representing structure.
• Draw electron dot diagrams for elements.

How do we show electrons in atoms?
Diagrams contain a lot of useful information in a compact format. What does the diagram above tell us? The
football play diagrammed above describes the lineup of each player on the team and describes how they will move
when the ball is snapped. Diagrams of electrons give similar information about where certain electrons are. We
can mark these electrons and indicate what happens to them when an element reacts.

Electron Dot Diagrams

Recall that the valence electrons of an atom are the electrons located in the highest occupied principal energy
level. Valence electrons are primarily responsible for the chemical properties of elements. The number of valence
electrons can be easily determined from the electron conﬁguration.
Several examples from the second period
elements are shown in the Table 8.1.

beryllium
nitrogen
neon

2 valence electrons
5 valence electrons
8 valence electrons

In each case, valence electrons are those in the second principal energy level. As one proceeds left to right across

equal to the group number minus ten. Group 13 has three valence electrons, Group 14 has four, up through Group
18 with eight. The eight valence electrons, a full outer s and p sublevel, give the noble gases their special stability.
When examining chemical bonding, it is necessary to keep track of the valence electrons of each atom. Electron dot
diagrams are diagrams in which the valence electrons of an atom are shown as dots distributed around the element’s
symbol. A beryllium atom, with two valence electrons, would have the electron dot diagram below.

381

8.1. Electron Dot Diagrams

www.ck12.org

Since electrons repel each other, the dots for a given atom are distributed evenly around the symbol before they are
paired. The Table 8.2 shows the electron dot diagrams for the entire second period.

Electron dot diagrams would be the same for each element in the representative element groups. Most transition
elements have two valence electrons, though some that have unusual electron conﬁgurations have only one.

• Electron dot diagrams show the valence electrons for an atom.
• The dot diagrams are the same for each element in the representative element groups.

8.2 Octet Rule

• State the octet rule.
• Use the octet rule to predict outcomes of chemical reactions.

How are electrons organized in atoms?
Graduations are exciting events in one’s life. The processional, the ceremonies, even the speeches can be handled
because this marks the end of a stage of life and the beginning of another one. The ceremony itself is challenging for
those organizing it. There are just enough seats on the stage for the graduates. How do you avoid getting too many
people in a row and not enough in the next row? Someone is stationed at the end of the row to count the students as
they enter. Only so many are allowed to go into a row, and then you begin to ﬁll the next row. Electrons in atoms
behave the same way. There are rules that determine where electrons go in compounds.

Octet Rule

The noble gases are unreactive because of their electron conﬁgurations. The noble gas neon has the electron
conﬁguration of 1s22s22p6. It has a full outer shell and cannot incorporate any more electrons into the valence shell.
The other noble gases have the same outer shell electron conﬁguration even though they have different numbers of
inner-shell electrons.
American chemist Gilbert Lewis (1875-1946) used this observation to explain the types of ions and molecules that
are formed by other elements. He called his explanation the octet rule. The octet rule states that atoms tend
to form compounds in ways that give them eight valence electrons and thus the electron conﬁguration of a noble
gas. An exception to an octet of electrons is in the case of the ﬁrst noble gas, helium, which only has two valence
electrons. This primarily affects the element hydrogen, which forms stable compounds by achieving two valence
electrons. Lithium, an alkali metal with three electrons, is also an exception to the octet rule. Lithium tends to
lose one electron to take on the electron conﬁguration of the nearest noble gas, helium, leaving it with two valence
electrons.

Electron conﬁguration of neon atom.

There are two ways in which atoms can satisfy the octet rule. One way is by sharing their valence electrons with
other atoms. The second way is by transferring valence electrons from one atom to another. Atoms of metals
tend to lose all of their valence electrons, which leaves them with an octet from the next lowest principal energy
level. Atoms of nonmetals tend to gain electrons in order to ﬁll their outermost principal energy level with an octet.
Summary

• Atoms form compounds in ways that give them eight valence electrons.
• Metals tend to lose electrons to achieve this conﬁguration.
• Nonmetals tend to gain electrons to achieve this conﬁguration.

8.3. Cation Formation

8.3 Cation Formation

• Deﬁne cation.
• Describe how cations are formed.
• Write equations to illustrate cation formation.

How are cations formed?
In many parts of the country, the water contains high concentrations of minerals that stain clothes, build up deposits
on bathtubs and water heaters, and create problems with soap foaming properly. This problem is caused by what is
called “hard water.” The water contains excessive amounts of cations such as iron and calcium. These ions create a
lot of problems in the water. Ion exchange resins (seen above) will remove these minerals and clean up the water.

Cation Formation

Cations are the positive ions formed by the loss of one or more electrons. The most commonly formed cations of
the representative elements are those that involve the loss of all of the valence electrons. Consider the alkali metal
sodium (Na). It has one valence electron in the third principal energy level. Upon losing that electron, the sodium
ion now has an octet of electrons from the second principal energy level. The equation below illustrates this process.

Na
1s22s22p63s1

→ Na+ + e−

1s22s22p6 (octet)

The electron conﬁguration of the sodium ion is now the same as that of the noble gas neon. The term isoelectronic
refers to an atom and an ion of a different atom (or two different ions) that have the same electron conﬁguration. The
sodium ion is isoelectronic with the neon atom. Consider a similar process with magnesium and with aluminum:

Mg
1s22s22p63s2
Al
1s22s22p63s23p1

→ Mg2+ + 2e−
1s22s22p6 (octet)
→ Al3+ + 3e−
1s22s22p6 (octet)

386

www.ck12.org

Chapter 8.

Ionic and Metallic Bonding

In this case, the magnesium atom loses its two valence electrons in order to achieve the same noble-gas conﬁgu-
ration. The aluminum atom loses its three valence electrons. The Mg2+ ion, the Al3+ ion, the Na+ ion, and the
Ne atom are all isoelectronic. For representative elements under typical conditions, three electrons is the maximum
number that will be lost.
We can also show the loss of valence electron(s) with an electron dot diagram.

Na· → Na+ + e−
·Mg· → Mg2+ + 2e−

Summary

• Cations form when an atom loses one or more electrons.
• The resulting cation has the electron conﬁguration of the noble gas atom in the row above it in the periodic

table.

How do you make chlorine safe to eat?
How do you transform a deadly gas into something you can sprinkle on your eggs and eat for breakfast? Chlorine
in its free form is very dangerous if you breathe the fumes or come in contact with the gas. However, after reaction
with sodium, we have sodium chloride formed as the sodium atom gives up an electron to chlorine which accepts
the electron to form the chloride anion.

Anions

Anions are the negative ions formed from the gain of one or more electrons. When nonmetal atoms gain electrons,
they often do so until their outermost principal energy level achieves an octet. This process is illustrated below for
the elements ﬂuorine, oxygen, and nitrogen.

All of these anions are isoelectronic with each other and with neon. They are also isoelectronic with the three
cations from the previous section. Under typical conditions, three electrons is the maximum that will be gained in
the formation of anions.
Outer electron conﬁgurations are constant within a group, so this pattern of ion formation repeats itself for Periods
3, 4, and following (see Figure 8.3).

FIGURE 8.3

It is important not to misinterpret the concept of being isoelectronic. A sodium ion is very different from a neon
atom because the nuclei of the two contain different numbers of protons. One is an essential ion that is a part of
table salt, while the other is an unreactive gas that is a very small part of the atmosphere. Likewise, sodium ions are
very different than magnesium ions, ﬂuoride ions, and all the other members of this isoelectronic series (N3−, O2−,
F−, Ne, Na+, Mg2+, Al3+).

8.5 Transition Metal Ion Formation

• Describe the formation of transition metal ions.

How do transition metals form ions?
The transition metals are an interesting and challenging group of elements. They have perplexing patterns of
electron distribution that don’t always follow the electron ﬁlling rules. Predicting how they will form ions is also
not always obvious.

Transition Metal Ions

Transition metals belong to the d block, meaning that the d sublevel of electrons is in the process of being ﬁlled
with up to ten electrons. Many transition metals cannot lose enough electrons to attain a noble-gas electron con-
ﬁguration. In addition, the majority of transition metals are capable of adopting ions with different charges. Iron,
which forms either the Fe2+ or Fe3+ ions, loses electrons as shown below.

→ Fe2+ + 2e−

→ Fe3+ + 3e−

Fe
[Ar]3d64s2
Fe
[Ar]3d64s2

[Ar]3d6

[Ar]3d5

According to the Aufbau process, the electrons ﬁll the 4s sublevel before beginning to ﬁll the 3d sublevel. However,
the outermost s electrons are always the ﬁrst to be removed in the process of forming transition metal cations. Be-
cause most transition metals have two valence electrons, the charge of 2+ is a very common one for their ions. This

391

8.5. Transition Metal Ion Formation

www.ck12.org

is the case for iron above. A half-ﬁlled d sublevel (d5) is particularly stable, which is the result of an iron atom
losing a third electron.

FIGURE 8.5
A. Rust is a complex combination of ox-
ides of iron(III), among them iron(III) ox-
ide, Fe2O3. B. Iron(II) sulfate, FeSO4, has
been known since ancient times as green
vitriol and was used for centuries in the
manufacture of inks.

Some transition metals that have relatively few d electrons may attain a noble-gas electron conﬁguration. Scandium
is an example.

[Ar]3d14s2

Sc3+ + 3e−

[Ar]3d10

The resulting conﬁguration above, with 18 electrons in the outermost principal energy level, is referred to as a
pseudo noble-gas electron conﬁguration. It gives particular stability to the Zn2+ and Cu+ ions.

Summary

• Transition metal ion formation is more complex than simple cation formation.
• Transition metal ions often involve rearrangements of both d and s electrons.

Does the sea really have salt in it?
We can get common table salt from several sources.
It can be mined in the solid form in salt mines or found as a
solid in deposits. We can also get salt from the ocean, but it really does not exist as salt when in solution. The
sodium ions and chloride ions are dissolved, but not combined into a structure until all the water is removed.
Most of the rocks and minerals that make up the Earth’s crust are composed of positive and negative ions held
together by ionic bonding. An ionic compound is an electrically neutral compound consisting of positive and
negative ions. You are very familiar with some ionic compounds such as sodium chloride (NaCl). A sodium
chloride crystal consists of equal numbers of positive sodium ions (Na+) and negative chloride ions (Cl−).

Ionic Bonds

Oppositely charged particles attract each other. This attractive force is often referred to as an electrostatic force. An
ionic bond is the electrostatic force that holds ions together in an ionic compound. The strength of the ionic bond
is directly dependent upon the quantity of the charges and inversely dependent on the distance between the charged
particles. A cation with a 2+ charge will make a stronger ionic bond than a cation with a 1+ charge. A larger ion
makes a weaker ionic bond because of the greater distance between its electrons and the nucleus of the oppositely
charged ion.

Electron Dot Diagrams

Chapter 8.

Ionic and Metallic Bonding

We will use sodium chloride as an example to demonstrate the nature of the ionic bond and how it forms. As you
know, sodium is a metal and loses its one valence electron to become a cation. Chlorine is a nonmetal and gains
one electron in becoming an anion. Both achieve a noble-gas electron conﬁguration. However, electrons cannot be
simply “lost” to nowhere in particular. A more accurate way to describe what is happening is that a single electron
is transferred from the sodium atom to the chlorine atom as shown below.

The ionic bond is the attraction of the Na+ ion for the Cl− ion.
It is conventional to show the cation without dots
around the symbol to emphasize that the original energy level that contained the valence electron is now empty. The
anion is now shown with a complete octet of electrons.
For a compound such as magnesium chloride, it is not quite as simple. Because magnesium has two valence
electrons, it needs to lose both to achieve the noble-gas conﬁguration. Therefore, two chlorine atoms will be
needed.

The ﬁnal formula for magnesium chloride is MgCl2.

Summary

• An ionic compound contains positive and negative ions.
• An ionic bond is electrostatic in nature.
• Electron dot diagrams can be used to illustrate electron movements and ion formation.

magical qualities. For others, the “magic” is in the regular structure of the crystal as the cations and anions line up

alternating cations and anions. This maximizes the attractive forces between the oppositely charges ions. The
ﬁgure below shows two different ways of representing the ionic crystal lattice. A ball and stick model makes it
easier to see how individual ions are oriented with respect to one another. A space ﬁlling diagram is a more accurate

• Deﬁne coordination number.
• Determine coordination number when given the lattice structure of the crystal.

What makes the colors different?
The two cobalt salts pictured above both contain Co2+ cations. The difference in color is due to the species
surrounding the cobalt ion. The presence of water molecules in the coordination sphere around the central cobalt
ion changes the distances among species and the color of the material.

Coordination Number

The coordination number is the number of ions that immediately surround an ion of the opposite charge within a
crystal lattice. If you examine the ﬁgure below, you will see that there are six chloride ions immediately surrounding
a single sodium ion. The coordination number of sodium is 6. Likewise, six sodium ions immediately surround
each chloride ions, making the coordination number of chloride also equal to 6. Because the formula unit of sodium
chloride displays a 1:1 ratio between the ions, the coordination numbers must be the same.

coordination numbers are not 6 as in NaCl. The center ion is the Cs+ ion and is surrounded by the eight Cl−
ions at the corners of the cube. Each Cl− ion is also surrounded by eight Cs+ ions. The coordination numbers in

this type of crystal are both 8. CsCl and NaCl do not adopt identical crystal packing arrangements because the Cs+
ion is considerably larger than the Na+ ion.

FIGURE 8.9
In a cesium chloride crystal, the cesium ion (orange) occupies the center,
while the chloride ions (green) occupy each corner of the cube. The
coordination number for both ions is 8.

Another type of crystal is illustrated by titanium(IV) oxide, TiO2, which is commonly known as rutile. The rutile
crystal is shown below.

FIGURE 8.10
Titanium(IV) oxide forms tetragonal crystals. The coordination number of

the Ti4+ ions (gray) is 6, while the coordination number of the O2

The gray Ti4+ ions are surrounded by six red O2− ions. The O2− ions are surrounded by three Ti4+ ions. The
coordination of the titanium(IV) cation is 6, which is twice the coordination number of the oxide anion, which is
3. This ﬁts with the formula unit of TiO2, since there are twice as many O2− ions as Ti4+ ions.
The crystal structure of all ionic compounds must reﬂect the formula unit. In a crystal of iron(III) chloride, FeCl3,
there are three times as many chloride ions as iron(III) ions.

What produces colored crystals?
The ﬁgure above shows just a few examples of the color and brilliance of naturally occurring ionic crystals. The
regular and orderly arrangement of ions in the crystal lattice is responsible for the various shapes of these crystals,
while transition metal ions give rise to the colors.

Physical Properties of Ionic Compounds

Melting Points

Because of the many simultaneous attractions between cations and anions that occur, ionic crystal lattices are very
strong. The process of melting an ionic compound requires the addition of large amounts of energy in order to break
all of the ionic bonds in the crystal. For example, sodium chloride has a melting temperature of about 800°C.

Shattering

Ionic compounds are generally hard, but brittle. Why? It takes a large amount of mechanical force, such as striking
a crystal with a hammer, to force one layer of ions to shift relative to its neighbor. However, when that happens,
it brings ions of the same charge next to each other (see Figure 8.13). The repulsive forces between like-charged
ions cause the crystal to shatter. When an ionic crystal breaks, it tends to do so along smooth planes because of the
regular arrangement of the ions.

FIGURE 8.13
(A) The sodium chloride crystal is shown
in two dimensions. (B) When struck by a
hammer, the negatively-charged chloride
ions are forced near each other and the
repulsive force causes the crystal to shat-
ter.

Conductivity

Another characteristic property of ionic compounds is their electrical conductivity. The ﬁgure below shows three
experiments in which two electrodes that are connected to a light bulb are placed in beakers containing three different
substances.
In the ﬁrst beaker, distilled water does not conduct a current because water is a molecular compound. In the second
beaker, solid sodium chloride also does not conduct a current. Despite being ionic and thus composed of charges
particles, the solid crystal lattice does not allow the ions to move between the electrodes. Mobile charged particles
are required for the circuit to be complete and the light bulb to light up.
In the third beaker, the NaCl has been
dissolved into the distilled water. Now the crystal lattice has been broken apart and the individual positive and
negative ions can move. Cations move to one electrode, while anions move to the other, allowing electricity to ﬂow
(see Figure 8.15). Melting an ionic compound also frees the ions to conduct a current. Ionic compounds conduct
an electric current when melted or dissolved in water.

Summary

• Ionic compounds have high melting points.
• Ionic compounds are hard and brittle.
• Solutions of ionic compounds and melted ionic compounds conduct electricity, but solid materials do not.

• Deﬁne metallic bond.
• Describe properties of metals.

Why do metals behave the way they do?
The image above is of a copper plate that was made in 1893. The utensil has a great deal of elaborate decoration
and the item is very useful. What would have happened if we decided that copper (I) chloride was just as good a
material (well, it does have copper in it). The CuCl would end up as a powder when we pounded on it to shape
it. Metals behave in unique ways. The bonding that occurs in a metal is responsible for its distinctive properties:
luster, malleability, ductility, and excellent conductivity.

The Metallic Bond

Pure metals are crystalline solids, but unlike ionic compounds, every point in the crystal lattice is occupied by an
identical atom. The electrons in the outer energy levels of a metal are mobile and capable of drifting from one
metal atom to another. This means that the metal is more properly viewed as an array of positive ions surrounded
by a sea of mobile valence electrons. Electrons which are capable of moving freely throughout the empty orbitals
of the metallic crystal are called delocalized electrons (see Figure 8.16). A metallic bond is the attraction of the
stationary metal cations to the surrounding mobile electrons.

Properties of Metals

The metallic bonding model explains the physical properties of metals. Metals conduct electricity and heat very
well because of their free-ﬂowing electrons. As electrons enter one end of a piece of metal, an equal number of
electrons ﬂow outward from the other end. When light is shone on to the surface of a metal, its electrons absorb
small amounts of energy and become excited into one of its many empty orbitals. The electrons immediately fall
back down to lower energy levels and emit light. This process is responsible for the high luster of metals.

In a metal, the stationary metal cations
are surrounded by a sea of mobile va-

FIGURE 8.17
The American Platinum Eagle is the of-
ﬁcial platinum bullion coin of the United
States and was ﬁrst minted in 1997. The
luster of a metal
is due to its metallic
bonds.

Recall that ionic compounds are very brittle. Application of a force results in like-charged ions in the crystal coming
too close to one another, causing the crystal to shatter. When a force is applied to a metal, the free-ﬂowing electrons
can slip in between the stationary cations and prevent them from coming in contact.
Imagine ball bearings that
have been coated with oil sliding past one another. As a result, metals are very malleable and ductile. They can be
hammered into shapes, rolled into thin sheets, or pulled into thin wires.

Summary

• The metallic bond is responsible for the properties of metals.
• Metals conduct electricity and heat well.
• Metals are ductile and malleable.
• Metals have luster.

How would you stack cannon balls?
Before modern artillery with explosive shells, cannons were used to ﬁre cannon balls at the enemy. The soldiers
operating the cannon needed to be able to get to the cannon balls quickly and efﬁciently. An arrangement such as
the pyramid worked well for the purpose.

Crystal Structures of Metals

When identical spheres are stacked, each successive layer ﬁts into the small spaces where different spheres come
together. This orderly and regular arrangement of the metal balls minimizes the empty space between them. Closest
packing is the most efﬁcient arrangement of spheres. Atoms of a metal crystal are arranged in similar patterns,
called close-packed structures. Pure metals adopt one of several related close-packed structures as shown below.

of these three closest packing arrange-

In the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, there are eight atoms at each corner of the cube and six
atoms in the center of each face. The coordination number of each atom in the face-centered cubic structure is
12. The hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure also has a coordination number of 12, but crystals of this type are
hexagonally shaped rather than cubic.

8.12 Alloys

• Deﬁne alloy.
• Describe compositions and uses for common alloys.

What are the best guitar strings to use?
Many guitar players are very meticulous when it comes to their strings. There is a variety to select from, depending
on the type of guitar and the style of music. Electric guitars need steel strings so the magnetic pick-up will detect
the string vibrations. Acoustic guitar players have several choices. Bronze strings (mixed with different amounts
of cooper and zinc) have perhaps the brightest tone. There are several combinations of bronze alloys to choose
from. For those with lots of money, titanium strings are available (but very expensive). Gold coating also helps
string life and makes its unique contribution to tone. Alloy chemistry has contributed greatly to the strength,
durability, and tonal quality of guitar strings.

Alloys

An alloy is a mixture composed of two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal. You are probably familiar
with some alloys such as brass and bronze. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Bronze is an alloy of copper
and tin. Alloys are commonly used in manufactured items because the properties of these metal mixtures are often
superior to a pure metal. Bronze is harder than copper and more easily cast. Brass is very malleable and its acoustic
properties make it useful for musical instruments.
Steels are a very important class of alloys. The many types of steels are primarily composed of iron, with various
amounts of the elements carbon, chromium, manganese, nickel, molybdenum, and boron. Steels are widely used in
building construction because of their strength, hardness, and resistance to corrosion. Most large modern structures
like skyscrapers and stadiums are supported by a steel skeleton (see Figure 8.20).

FIGURE 8.19
Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, has
been in use since ancient times. The
Bronze Age saw the increased use of
metals rather than stone for weapons,
tools, and decorative objects. Brass, an
alloy of copper and zinc, is widely used in
musical instruments like the trumpet and
trombone.

FIGURE 8.20
The Willis Tower (formerly called the Sears Tower) in Chicago was once
the tallest building in the world and is still the tallest in the Western
Hemisphere. The use of steel columns makes it possible to build taller,
stronger, and lighter buildings.

Alloys can be one of two general types. In one type, called a substitutional alloy, the various atoms simply replace
each other in the crystal structure. In another type, called an interstitial alloy, the smaller atoms such as carbon ﬁt
in between the larger atoms in the crystal packing arrangement.

Summary

• Alloys are mixtures of materials, at least one of which is a metal.
• Bronze alloys were widely used in weapons.
• Brass alloys have long been employed in musical instruments.
• Steel alloys are strong and durable.

www.ck12.org

9.1 Energy and Covalent Bond Formation

• Deﬁne diatomic molecule.
• Draw the potential energy diagram for two atoms that are bonding.
• Deﬁne covalent molecule.

Why do BeCl2 and LiCl bond differently?
We have learned that halide salts of elements in group1 are typically ionic compounds. We would expect LiCl to
exist as Li+ cations and Cl− anions (and it does). However, if we move one column to the right, lithium’s neighbor
beryllium forms a different type of bond altogether. This bond consists of shared electrons between the Be and Cl
atoms, not electrostatic attraction among ions.

Energy and Covalent Bond Formation

Molecular compounds are those that take the form of an individual molecule. Molecular compounds are generally
comprised of two or more nonmetal atoms. Familiar examples include water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and
ammonia (NH3). Recall that the molecular formula shows the number of each atom that occurs in a molecule of
that compound. One molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Hydrogen (H2) is an
example of an element that exists naturally as a diatomic molecule. A diatomic molecule is a molecule containing
two atoms.
Most atoms attain a lower potential energy when they are bonded to other atoms than when they are separated. Con-
sider two isolated hydrogen atoms that are separated by a distance large enough to prevent any interaction between
them. At this distance, the potential energy of the system is said to be equal to zero (see Figure 9.1).

FIGURE 9.1
The graph shows how the potential en-
ergy of two hydrogen atoms changes as
a function of their separation distance.

As the atoms approach one another, their electron clouds gradually begin to overlap. Now there are several
interactions which begin to occur. One is that the single electrons that each hydrogen atom possesses begin to

418

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9. Covalent Bonding

repel each other. This repulsive force would tend to make the potential energy of the system increase. However,
the electron of each atom begins to be attracted to the nucleus of the other atom. This attractive force tends to make
the potential energy of the system decrease.
As the atoms ﬁrst begin to interact, the attractive force is stronger than the repulsive force and so the potential
energy of the system decreases, as seen in the diagram. Remember that the lower potential energy increases the
stability of the system. As the two hydrogen atoms move closer and closer together, the potential energy continues to
decrease. Eventually, a position is reached where the potential energy is at its lowest possible point. If the hydrogen
atoms move any closer together, a third interaction begins to dominate and that is the repulsive force between the
two positively-charged nuclei. This repulsive force is very strong as can be seen by the sharp rise in energy at the
far left of the diagram.
The point at which the potential energy reached its minimum represents the ideal distance between hydrogen atoms
for a stable chemical bond to occur. This type of chemical bond is called a covalent bond. A covalent bond is a
bond in which two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. The single electrons from each of the two hydrogen
atoms are shared when the atoms come together to form a hydrogen molecule (H2).

Summary

• Covalent bonds are formed when atoms share electrons between them.

• Deﬁne single covalent bond.
• Deﬁne structural formula.

What does cholesterol really look like?
We can write the structure of the cholesterol molecule a couple of different ways. The simplest approach is to
just write C27H46O. This “structure” is not very useful because it does not tell us how the carbons, hydrogens, and
oxygen are connected to one another. The structure in the ﬁgure above is much more helpful –we see how the
different atoms are connected together to form the molecule.

Lewis Electron-Dot Structures

In a previous chapter, you learned that the valence electrons of an atom can be shown in a simple way with an
electron dot diagram. A hydrogen atom is shown as H• because of its one valence electron. The structures of
molecules that are held together by covalent bonds can be diagrammed by Lewis electron-dot structures. The
hydrogen molecule is shown in the Figure 9.2.
The shared pair of electrons is shown as two dots in between the two H symbols (H:H). This is called a single
covalent bond, when two atoms are joined by the sharing of one pair of electrons. The single covalent bond can
also be shown by a dash in between the two symbols (H–H). A structural formula is a formula that shows the
arrangement of atoms in a molecule and represents covalent bonds between atoms by dashes.

The Octet Rule and Covalent Bonds

When ions form, they conform to the octet rule by either losing or gaining electrons in order to achieve the
electron conﬁguration of the nearest noble gas.
In a similar way, nonmetal atoms share electrons in the formation
of a covalent in bond such a way that each of the atoms involved in the bond can attain a noble-gas electron
conﬁguration. The shared electrons are “counted” for each of the atoms involved in the sharing. For hydrogen

(H2), the shared pair of electrons means that each of the atoms is able to attain the electron conﬁguration of helium,
the noble gas with two electrons. For atoms other than hydrogen, the sharing of electrons will usually provide each
of the atoms with eight valence electrons.

9.3 Single Covalent Bonds

• Deﬁne a single covalent bond.
• Draw Lewis dot structures of molecules containing single covalent bonds.

What holds molecules together?

In one form or another, the idea of atoms connecting to form larger substances has been with us for a long time. The
Greek philosopher Democritus (460-370 BC) believed that atoms had hooks on them that allowed atoms to connect
with one another. Today we believe that atoms are held together by bonds formed when two atoms share a set of
electrons, a much more complicated picture than the simple hooks that Democritus preferred.

Single Covalent Bonds

A covalent bond forms when two orbitals with one electron each overlap each other. For the hydrogen molecule,
this can be shown as:

Upon formation of the H2 molecule, the shared electrons must have opposite spin, so they are shown with opposite
spin in the atomic 1s orbital.
The halogens also form single covalent bonds in their diatomic molecules. An atom of any halogen, such as ﬂuorine,
has seven valence electrons. Its unpaired electron is located in the 2p orbital.

422

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9. Covalent Bonding

The single electrons in the third 2p orbital combine to form the covalent bond:

FIGURE 9.3
On the left is a ﬂuorine atom with seven
valence electrons. On the right is the F2
molecule.

The diatomic ﬂuorine molecule (F2) contains a single shared pair of electrons. Each F atom also has three pair of
electrons that are not shared with the other atom. A lone pair is a pair of electrons in a Lewis electron-dot structure
that is not shared between atoms. The oxygen atom in the water molecule shown below has two lone pair sets of
electrons. Each F atom has three lone pairs. Combined with the two electrons in the covalent bond, each F atom
follows the octet rule.

Sample Problem 9.1: Lewis Electron Dot Structures

Draw the Lewis electron dot structure for water.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem
Known

• molecular formula of water = H2O
• 1 O atom = 6 valence electrons
• 2 H atoms = 2 × 1 = 2 valence electrons
• total number of valence electrons = 8

Use the periodic table to determine the number of valence electrons for each atom and the total number of valence
electrons. Arrange the atoms and distribute the electrons so that each atom follows the octet rule. The oxygen atom

What do you do with your leftovers?
When working with covalent structures, it sometimes looks like you have leftover electrons. You apply the rules you
learned so far and there are still some electrons hanging out there unattached. You can’t just leave them there. So
where do you put them?
Multiple Covalent Bonds
Some molecules are not able to satisfy the octet rule by making only single covalent bonds between the atoms. Con-
sider the compound ethene, which has a molecular formula of C2H4. The carbon atoms are bonded together, with
each carbon also being bonded to two hydrogen atoms.

two C atoms = 2× 4 = 8 valence electrons
four H atoms = 4× 1 = 4 valence electrons
total of 12 valence electrons in the molecule

If the Lewis electron dot structure was drawn with a single bond between the carbon atoms and with the octet rule
followed, it would look like this:

FIGURE 9.4

9.4. Multiple Covalent Bonds

This Lewis structure is incorrect because it contains a total of 14 electrons. However, the Lewis structure can be
changed by eliminating the lone pairs on the carbon atoms and having the share two pairs instead of only one pair.

FIGURE 9.5
Correct dot structure for ethene.

A double covalent bond is a covalent bond formed by atoms that share two pairs of electrons. The double covalent
bond that occurs between the two carbon atoms in ethane can also be represented by a structural formula and with a
molecular model as shown in Figure 9.6.

A triple covalent bond is a covalent bond formed by atoms that share three pairs of electrons. The element nitrogen
is a gas that composes the majority of Earth’s atmosphere. A nitrogen atom has ﬁve valence electrons, which can
be shown as one pair and three single electrons. When combining with another nitrogen atom to form a diatomic
molecule, the three single electrons on each atom combine to form three shared pairs of electrons.

Each nitrogen atom follows the octet rule with one lone pair of electrons and six electrons that are shared between

Is sharing a good thing?
Remember when you were younger and were told to share your favorite toy with your brother or sister or friend?
You probably didn’t want to share, but did anyway. It turned out that you had more fun playing with the toy together
than if you had kept it to yourself. Atoms also have to share what’s theirs with another atom that has nothing to
contribute to the situation. But the end result is a new structure.

Coordinate Covalent Bonds

Each of the covalent bonds that we have looked at so far has involved each of the atoms that are bonding contributing
one of the electrons to the shared pair. There is an alternate type of covalent bond in which one of the atoms provided
both of the electrons in a shared pair. Carbon monoxide, CO, is a toxic gas that is released as a by-product during
the burning of fossil fuels. The bonding between the C atom and the O atom can be thought of as proceeding in this
way.

FIGURE 9.8
Formation of a CO double bond (incorrect
structure).

At this point, a double bond has formed between the two atoms, with each atom providing one of the electrons to
each bond. The oxygen atom now has a stable octet of electrons, but the carbon atom only has six electrons and is
unstable. This situation is resolved if the oxygen atom contributes one of its lone pairs in order to make a third bond
with the carbon atom.

FIGURE 9.9
Correct CO structure.

The carbon monoxide molecule is correctly represented by a triple covalent bond between the carbon and oxygen
atoms. One of the bonds is a coordinate covalent bond, a covalent bond in which one of the atoms contributes
both of the electrons in the shared pair.
Once formed, a coordinate covalent bond is the same as any other covalent bond. It is not as if the two conventional
bonds in the CO molecule are stronger or different in any other way than the coordinate covalent bond.

Summary

• Coordinate covalent bonds can form when one atom provides a lone pair of electrons to the bond.
• Coordinate covalent bonds are as strong as other covalent bonds.

9.6 Covalent Bonding in Polyatomic Ions

• Draw the Lewis structure of a polyatomic ion when given appropriate information.

How do we extend basic principles?
The United States Supreme Court has the unenviable task of deciding what the law is. This responsibility can
be a major challenge when there is no clear principle involved or where there is a new situation not encountered
before. Chemistry faces the same challenge in extending basic concept to ﬁt a new situation. Drawing of Lewis
structures for polyatomic ions uses the same approach, but tweaks the process a little to ﬁt a somewhat different set
of circumstances.

Polyatomic Ions

Recall that a polyatomic ion is a group of atoms that are covalently bonded together and which carry an overall
electrical charge. The ammonium ion, NH4
+, is formed when a hydrogen ion (H+) attaches to the lone pair of an
ammonia (NH3) molecule in a coordinate covalent bond.
When drawing the Lewis structure of a polyatomic ion, the charge of the ion is reﬂected in the number of total
valence electrons in the structure. In the case of the ammonium ion:

1 N atom = 5 valence electrons
4 H atoms = 4× 1 = 4 valence electrons
subtract 1 electron for the 1 + charge of the ion
total of 8 valence electrons in the ion

430

Chapter 9. Covalent Bonding

FIGURE 9.10
The ammonium ion.

It is customary to put the Lewis structure of a polyatomic ion into a large set of brackets, with the charge of the ion
as a superscript outside the brackets.

molecular formula of sulfate ion = SO4
1 S atom = 6 valence electrons
4 O atoms = 4× 6 = 24 valence electrons
add 2 electrons for the 2− charge of the ion
total of 32 valence electrons

The less electronegative sulfur atom is the central atom in the structure. Place the oxygen atoms around the sulfur
atom, each with a single covalent bond. Distribute lone pairs to each oxygen atom in order to satisfy the octet
rule. Count the total number of atoms.
If there are too many electrons in the structure, make multiple bonds
between the S and O.
Step 2: Solve.
Step 3: Think about your result.
The Lewis structure for the sulfate ion consists of a central sulfur atom with four single bonds to oxygen atoms. This
yields the expected total of 32 electrons. Since the sulfur atom started with six valence electrons, two of the S-O
bonds are coordinate covalent.

Summary

• Lewis structures for polyatomic ions follow the same rules as those for other covalent compounds.

• Deﬁne resonance.
• Draw resonance structures of appropriate compounds.

Which image is real?
We look at the picture above and think we are looking at the image of a room as reﬂected in a mirror (and we
probably are). But we can crop the picture in such a way as to give the impression we are looking at the real
room through a door. We would see the same thing and receive the same information, but it would be from a
different perspective. There are molecules that can be represented in different ways and reality becomes a matter of
interpretation.
Resonance
There are some cases in which more than one viable Lewis structure can be drawn for a molecule. An example is
the ozone (O3) molecule in the Figure 9.12. There are a total of 18 electrons in the structure and so the following
two structures are possible.

FIGURE 9.12
Resonance forms of ozone.

The structure on the left (see Figure 9.12) can be converted to the structure on the right by a shifting of electrons
without altering the positions of the atoms.
It was once thought that the structure of a molecule such as O3 consisted of one single bond and one double
bond which then shifted back and forth as shown above. However, further studies showed that the two bonds

433

9.7. Resonance

www.ck12.org

are identical. Any double covalent bond between two given atoms is typically shorter than a single covalent
bond. Studies of the O3 and other similar molecules showed that the bonds were identical in length. Interestingly,
the length of the bond is in between the lengths expected for an O-O single bond and a double bond.
Resonance is the use of two or more Lewis structures to represent the covalent bonding in a molecule. One of the
valid structures is referred to as a resonance structure.
It is now understood that the true structure of a molecule
which displays resonance is that of an average or a hybrid of all the resonance structures.
In the case of the O3
molecule, each of the covalent bonds between O atoms is best thought of as being “one and a half” bonds, as
opposed to either a pure single bond or a pure double bond. This “half-bond” can be shown as a dotted line in both
the Lewis structure and the molecular model (see Figure 9.13).

The bond lengths between the central N atom and each O atom are identical and the bonds can be approximated as

• Bond lengths are intermediate between covalent single bonds and covalent double bonds.

9.8 Exceptions to the Octet Rule

• List the exceptions to the octet rule.

Are rules always followed?
Every spring, millions of Americans ﬁle their income tax forms. The different rules determine how much tax a
person pays. There are also exceptions to the rules. You pay less tax if you are married and/or have children. There
are certain limits on how much money you can make before paying taxes. The rule is that you pay taxes, but there
are also exceptions based on your personal situation. The bonding rules for molecules are generally applicable, but
there are some exceptions allowed.

Exceptions to the Octet Rule

As the saying goes, all rules are made to be broken. When it comes to the octet rule, that is true. Exceptions
to the octet rule fall into one of three categories: (1) an incomplete octet, (2) odd-electron molecules, and (3) an
expanded octet.

Incomplete Octet

In some compounds, the number of electrons surrounding the central atom in a stable molecule is fewer than
eight. Beryllium is an alkaline earth metal and so may be expected to form ionic bonds. However, its very small
size and somewhat higher ionization energy compared to other metals actually lead to beryllium forming primarily
molecular compounds. Since beryllium only has two valence electrons, it does not typically attain an octet through
sharing of electrons. The Lewis structure of gaseous beryllium hydride (BeH2) consists of two single covalent bonds
between Be and H (see Figure 9.15).

436

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9. Covalent Bonding

FIGURE 9.15
Beryllium hydride.

Boron and aluminum, with three valence electrons, also tend to form covalent compounds with an incomplete
octet. The central boron atom in boron trichloride (BCl3) has six valence electrons as shown in the Figure 9.16.

FIGURE 9.16
Boron trichloride.

Odd-Electron Molecules

There are a number of molecules whose total number of valence electrons is an odd number. It is not possible for all
of the atoms in such a molecule to satisfy the octet rule. An example is nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Each oxygen atom
contributes six valence electrons and the nitrogen atom contributes ﬁve for a total of seventeen. The lewis structure
for NO2 appears in the Figure 9.17.

FIGURE 9.17
The Lewis structure for nitrogen dioxide, an odd electron molecule.

Expanded Octets

Atoms of the second period cannot have more than eight valence electrons around the central atom. However, atoms
of the third period and beyond are capable of exceeding the octet rule by having more than eight electrons around the
central atom. Starting with the third period, the d sublevel becomes available, so it is possible to use these orbitals
in bonding, resulting in an expanded octet.
Phosphorus and sulfur are two elements that react with halogen elements and make stable compounds with expanded
octets. In phosphorus pentachloride, the central phosphorus atom makes ﬁve single bonds to chlorine atoms and as

a result has ten electrons surrounding it (see Figure 9.18). In sulfur hexaﬂuoride, the central sulfur atom has twelve
electrons from its six bonds to ﬂuorine atoms (see Figure 9.19).

9.9 Bond Energy

• Deﬁne bond energy.
• Describe the relationship between reactivity and bond energy.

How does smog form?
We know that nitrogen makes up about 79% of the gases in the air and that this gas is chemically very inert. However,
we also know that a major contributor to the production of smog is a mixture of nitrogen compounds collectively
referred to as NOx. Due to the high combustion temperatures in modern car engines (brought about by the need for
better fuel efﬁciency), we make more NOx that will react with other materials to create smog. So, our inert nitrogen
gas can be converted to other compounds if enough energy is available to break the triple bonds in the N2 molecule.

Bond Energy

The formation of a chemical bond results in a decrease in potential energy. Consequently, breaking a chemical bond
requires an input of energy. Bond energy is the energy required to break a covalent bond between two atoms. A
high bond energy means that a bond is strong and the molecule that contains that bond is likely to be stable and
less reactive. More reactive compounds will contain bonds that have generally lower bond energies. Some bond
energies are listed in the Table 9.1

The halogen elements all exist naturally as diatomic molecules (F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2). They are generally very
reactive and thus have relatively low bond energies.
As can be seen by a comparison of the bond energies for the various carbon-carbon bonds, double bonds are
substantially stronger than single bonds. Likewise, triple bonds are even stronger. The triple bond that exists
between the nitrogen atoms in nitrogen gas (N2) makes it very unreactive. All plants and animals require the
element nitrogen, but it cannot be obtained from the direct absorption of nitrogen gas from the atmosphere because
of its strong, unreactive triple bond. Instead, bacteria convert the nitrogen to a more usable form such as ammonium
and nitrate ions, which is then absorbed by plants from the soil. Animals only obtain nitrogen by eating those plants.

Summary

• Bond energy is an indication of the amount of energy needed for a chemical reaction.
• The higher the bond energy, the less reactive the bond is.

9.10 VSEPR Theory

• Deﬁne the VSEPR theory.

What do I do now?
In every scientist’s life comes that moment when you realize that you were wrong. Sometimes you think about a
problem and recognize where you went astray. Other times you ﬁnd out when you go into the lab and the experiment
doesn’t work (or gets way too exciting). What has to happen then is a change in direction. The good scientist sees
the problem and comes up with a new answer. Then that answer has to be tested to see how it works.
Putting atoms together to form compounds can be done on paper or in the lab. However, when the shape of the
molecule made in the lab is different from the shape of the molecule drawn on paper, then we need to rethink our
ideas and ﬁnd better explanations.

VSEPR Theory

In 1956, British scientists R.J. Gillespie and R.S. Nyholm recognized that the current model for explaining bond
angles did not work well. The theory at that time relied on hybrid orbitals to explain all aspects of bonding. The
problem was that the theory gave incorrect prediction of bond angles for many compounds. They developed a new
approach based on earlier work by other scientists that incorporated a consideration of electron pairs in predicting
three-dimensional structure.
The valence shell is the outermost electron-occupied shell of an atom. The valence shell holds the electrons that
are involved in bonding and are the electrons shown in a Lewis structure. The acronym VSEPR stands for the

441

9.10. VSEPR Theory

www.ck12.org

valence-shell electron pair repulsion model. The model states that electron pairs will repel each other such that
the shape of the molecule will adjust so that the valence electron-pairs stay as far apart from each other as possible.
Molecules can be systematically classiﬁed according to the number of bonding pairs of electrons as well as the
number of nonbonding or lone pairs around the central atom. For the purposes of the VSEPR model, a double or
triple bond is no different in terms of repulsion than a single bond.

Summary

• VSEPR theory allows more accurate predictions of molecular shape.

• Describe molecules whose shapes are inﬂuenced by VSEPR theory.

How does an electroscope work?
An electroscope is a device used to study charge. When a positively charged object (the rod) nears the upper post,
electrons ﬂow to the top of the jar leaving the two gold leaves postivley charged. The leaves repel each other since
both hold postive, like charges. The VSEPR theory says that electron pairs, also a set of like charges, will repel each
other such that the shape of the molecule will adjust so that the valence electron-pairs stay as far apart from each
other as possible.

Central Atom with No Lone Pairs

In order to easily understand the types of molecules possible, we will use a simple system to identify the parts of any
molecule.

A = central atom in a molecule
B = atoms surrounding the central atom

Subscripts after the B will denote the number of B atoms that are bonded to the central A atom. For example, AB4
is a molecule with a central atom surrounded by four covalently bonded atoms. Again, it does not matter if those
bonds are single, double, or triple bonds.

The molecular geometry of the methane molecule is tetrahedral (see Figure 9.26). The H-C-H bond angles are
109.5°, which is larger than the 90° that they would be if the molecule was planar. When drawing a structural
formula for a molecule such as methane, it is advantageous to be able to indicate the three-dimensional character of
its shape. The structural formula below is called a perspective drawing. The dotted line bond is to be visualized as
receding into the page, while the solid triangle bond is to be visualized as coming out of the page.

How can all these clothes ﬁt into such a small space?
When we travel, we often take a lot more stuff than we need. Trying to ﬁt it all in a suitcase can be a real
challenge. We may have to repack or just squeeze it all in. Atoms often have to rearrange where the electrons are
in order to create a more stable structure.

Central Atom with One or More Lone Pairs

The molecular geometries of molecules change when the central atom has one or more lone pairs of electrons. The
total number of electron pairs, both bonding pairs and lone pairs, leads to what is called the electron domain
geometry. When one or more of the bonding pairs of electrons is replaced with a lone pair, the molecular geometry
(actual shape) of the molecule is altered. In keeping with the A and B symbols established in the previous section,
we will use E to represent a lone pair on the central atom (A). A subscript will be used when there is more than one
lone pair. Lone pairs on the surrounding atoms (B) do not affect the geometry.

AB3E: Ammonia, NH3

The ammonia molecule contains three single bonds and one lone pair on the central nitrogen atom (see Figure 9.27).

The domain geometry for a molecule with four electron pairs is tetrahedral, as was seen with CH4. In the ammonia
molecule, one of the electron pairs is a lone pair rather than a bonding pair. The molecular geometry of NH3 is
called trigonal pyramidal (see Figure 9.28).

Recall that the bond angle in the tetrahedral CH4 molecule is 109.5°. Again, the replacement of one of the bonded
electron pairs with a lone pair compresses the angle slightly. The H-N-H angle is approximately 107°.

A water molecule consists of two bonding pairs and two lone pairs (see Figure 9.29).

As for methane and ammonia, the domain geometry for a molecule with four electron pairs is tetrahedral.
In the

The sulfur atom has ﬁve electron groups around it, which corresponds to the trigonal bipyramidal domain geometry,

atoms attached to the central atom. Because of the greater repulsion of a lone pair, it is one of the equatorial atoms
that are replaced by a lone pair. The geometry of the molecule is called a distorted tetrahedron or seesaw.

9.13 Bond Polarity

• Deﬁne electronegativity.
• Use electronegativity values to determine bond type.

What makes people share?
Have you ever spent time with someone you really didn’t like? You had nothing in common with them and did not
want to have anything to do with them. On the other hand, there are people you enjoy being with. You have a lot in
common and like to share with them. Atoms work the same way. If there are strong differences in their attraction
of electrons, one atoms gets the electrons and the other atom loses them. If they are similar, they share the electrons
to form a covalent bond.

Bond Polarity

Electronegativity is deﬁned as the ability of an atom to attract electrons when the atoms are in a compound. Elec-
tronegativities of elements are shown in the periodic table below.
The degree to which a given bond is ionic or covalent is determined by calculating the difference in electronegativity
between the two atoms involved in the bond.
As an example, consider the bond that occurs between an atom of potassium and an atom of ﬂuorine. Using the
table, the difference in electronegativity is equal to 4.0 - 0.8 = 3.2. Since the difference in electronegativity is
relatively large, the bond between the two atoms is ionic. Since the ﬂuorine atom has a much larger attraction for
electrons than the potassium atom does, the valence electron from the potassium atom is completely transferred to
the ﬂuorine atom. The diagram below shows how difference in electronegativity relates to the ionic or covalent
character of a chemical bond.

Chapter 9. Covalent Bonding

A bond in which the electronegativity difference is less than 1.7 is considered to be mostly covalent in charac-
ter. However, at this point we need to distinguish between two general types of covalent bonds. A nonpolar
covalent bond is a covalent bond in which the bonding electrons are shared equally between the two atoms.
In a
nonpolar covalent bond, the distribution of electrical charge is balanced between the two atoms.

FIGURE 9.35
A nonpolar covalent bond is one in which
the distribution of electron density be-
tween the two atoms is equal.

The two chlorine atoms share the pair of electrons in the single covalent bond equally, and the electron density
surrounding the Cl2 molecule is symmetrical. Also note that molecules in which the electronegativity difference
is very small (<0.4) are also considered nonpolar covalent. An example would be a bond between chlorine and
bromine (∆EN = 3.0− 2.8 = 0.2).
Polar Covalent Bonds
A bond in which the electronegativity difference between the atoms is between 0.4 and 1.7 is called a polar covalent
bond. A polar covalent bond is a covalent bond in which the atoms have an unequal attraction for electrons and so
the sharing is unequal. In a polar covalent bond, sometimes simply called a polar bond, the distribution of electrons
around the molecule is no longer symmetrical.

FIGURE 9.36
In the polar covalent bond of HF, the electron density is unevenly dis-
tributed. There is a higher density (red) near the ﬂuorine atom, and a
lower density (blue) near the hydrogen atom.

An easy way to illustrate the uneven electron distribution in a polar covalent bond is to use the Greek letter delta (δ).

The atom with the greater electronegativity acquires a partial negative charge, while the atom with the lesser
electronegativity acquires a partial positive charge. The delta symbol is used to indicate that the quantity of charge
is less than one. A crossed arrow can also be used to indicate the direction of greater electron density.

9.14 Polar Molecules

• Deﬁne polar molecule.
• Describe how to determine polarity of a molecule.

How cold are ultracold polar molecules?
Ultracold polar molecules have been created by research scientists. These “molecules” consists of Rb and K atoms
excited by lasers to form a type of Rb-K compound where the Rb has a positive charge and the K has a negative
charge. The material is formed at temperatures extremely close to absolute zero. The researchers believe these
techniques will help them make new reactions and new materials.

Polar Molecules

A polar molecule is a molecule in which one end of the molecule is slightly positive, while the other end is slightly
negative. A diatomic molecule that consists of a polar covalent bond, such as HF, is a polar molecule. The two

455

9.14. Polar Molecules

www.ck12.org

electrically charged regions on either end of the molecule are called poles, similar to a magnet having a north and a
south pole. A molecule with two poles is called a dipole (see Figure 9.39). Hydrogen ﬂuoride is a dipole.

FIGURE 9.39
A dipole is any molecule with a positive end and a negative end, resulting
from unequal distribution of electron density throughout the molecule.

Polar molecules orient themselves in the presence of an electric ﬁeld with the positive ends of the molecules being
attracted to the negative plate while the negative ends of the molecules are attracted to the positive plate (see Figure
9.40).

FIGURE 9.40
Polar molecules are randomly oriented in
the absence of an applied electric ﬁeld
(top).
In an electric ﬁeld, the molecules
orient themselves because of the attrac-
tion of opposite charges (bottom).

For molecules with more than two atoms, the molecular geometry must also be taken into account when determining
if the molecule is polar or nonpolar. The Figure 9.41 shows a comparison between carbon dioxide and water. Car-
bon dioxide (CO2) is a linear molecule. The oxygen atoms are more electronegative than the carbon atom, so there
are two individual dipoles pointing outward from the C atom to each O atom. However, since the dipoles are of
equal strength and are oriented in this way, they cancel each other out and the overall molecular polarity of CO2 is
zero.
Water is a bent molecule because of the two lone pairs on the central oxygen atom. The individual dipoles point
from the H atoms toward the O atom. Because of the shape, the dipoles do not cancel each other out and the water
molecule is polar. In the Figure 9.41, the net dipole is shown in blue and points upward.
Some other molecules are shown in the Figure 9.42. Notice that a tetrahedral molecule such as CH4 is nonpo-
lar. However, if one of the peripheral H atoms is replaced with another atom that has a different electronegativity,
the molecule becomes polar. A trigonal planar molecule (BF3) may be nonpolar if all three peripheral atoms are the
same, but a trigonal pyramidal molecule (NH3) is polar.

Summary

• Polar molecules result from differences in electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule.

How to Keep it Cool?

Magnetic resonance imaging (NMR) devices use liquid nitrogen to cool the superconducting magnets. Nitrogen
is a gas at room temperature and liqueﬁes at -195.8°C.
Its neighbor on the periodic table (oxygen) boils at -
182.95°C. The interactions between nitrogen molecules (N2) are weaker, so the boiling point is lower. Interactions
between non-polar molecules depend on the degree of electron ﬂuctuation within the molecule.

Van der Waals Forces

The ﬁrst type of intermolecular force we will consider are called van der Waals forces, after Dutch chemist Johannes
van der Waals (1837-1923). Van der Waals forces are the weakest intermolecular force and consist of dipole-dipole
forces and dispersion forces.

Dipole-Dipole Forces

www.ck12.org

Dipole-dipole forces are the attractive forces that occur between polar molecules. A molecule of hydrogen chloride
has a partially positive hydrogen atom and a partially negative chlorine atom.
In a collection of many hydrogen
chloride molecules, they will align themselves so that the oppositely charged regions of neighboring molecules are
near each other.

FIGURE 9.43
Dipole-dipole forces are a result of the at-
traction of the positive end of one dipole to
the negative end of a neighboring dipole.

Dipole-dipole forces are similar in nature, but much weaker than ionic bonds.

London Dispersion Forces

Dispersion forces are also considered a type of van der Waals force and are the weakest of all intermolecular
forces. They are often called London forces after Fritz London (1900-1954), who ﬁrst proposed their existence
in 1930. London dispersion forces are the intermolecular forces that occur between atoms and between nonpolar
molecules as a result of the motion of electrons.
The electron cloud of a helium atom contains two electrons, which can normally be expected to be equally distributed
spatially around the nucleus. However, at any given moment the electron distribution may be uneven, resulting in an
instantaneous dipole. This weak and temporary dipole subsequently inﬂuences neighboring helium atoms through
electrostatic attraction and repulsion. It induces a dipole on nearby helium atoms (see Figure 9.44).

The instantaneous and induced dipoles are weakly attracted to one another. The strength of dispersion forces
increases as the number of electrons in the atoms or nonpolar molecules increases.

The dispersion forces are strongest for iodine molecules because they have the greatest number of electrons. The
relatively stronger forces result in melting and boiling points which are the highest of the halogen group. These
forces are strong enough to hold iodine molecules close together in the solid state at room temperature. The
dispersion forces are progressively weaker for bromine, chlorine, and ﬂuorine and this is illustrated in their steadily
lower melting and boiling points. Bromine is a liquid at room temperature, while chlorine and ﬂuorine are gases,
whose molecules are much further apart from one another.
Intermolecular forces are nearly nonexistent in the gas
state, and so the dispersion forces in chlorine and ﬂuorine only become measurable as the temperature decreases and
they condense into the liquid state.

What’s the difference between these two molecules?
A rough rule of thumb is that higher molecular-weight materials have higher boiling points than their lower molecular
weight counterparts. More energy is needed to move the larger molecule from the liquid state to the vapor
state. However, ammonia has a boiling point of -33.34°C and a molecular weight of 17 while nitrogen (molecular
weight 28) has a boiling point of -195.8°C. The lighter ammonia molecule must have other factors that inﬂuence its
physical properties.

Hydrogen Bonding

The attractive force between water molecules is a dipole interaction. The hydrogen atoms are bound to the highly
electronegative oxygen atom (which also possesses two lone pair sets of electrons, making for a very polar bond. The
partially positive hydrogen atom of one molecule is then attracted to the oxygen atom of a nearby water molecule
(see Figure 9.45).
A hydrogen bond is an intermolecular attractive force in which a hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to a
small, highly electronegative atom is attracted to a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a neighboring molecule.
Hydrogen bonds are very strong compared to other dipole interactions. The strength of a typical hydrogen bond is
about 5% of that of a covalent bond.
Hydrogen bonding occurs only in molecules where hydrogen is covalently bonded to one of three elements: ﬂuorine,
oxygen, or nitrogen. These three elements are so electronegative that they withdraw the majority of the electron
density in the covalent bond with hydrogen, leaving the H atom very electron-deﬁcient. The H atom nearly acts as
a bare proton, leaving it very attracted to lone pair electrons on a nearby atom.
The hydrogen bonding that occurs in water leads to some unusual, but very important properties. Most molecular
compounds that have a mass similar to water are gases at room temperature. Because of the strong hydrogen bonds,

water molecules are able to stay condensed in the liquid state. The Figure 9.46 shows how the bent shape and two
hydrogen atoms per molecule allows each water molecule to be able to hydrogen bond to two other molecules.

another. When water is cooled, the molecules begin to slow down. Eventually, when water is frozen to ice, the
hydrogen bonds become permanent and form a very speciﬁc network (see Figure 9.47).
The bent shape of the molecules leads to gaps in the hydrogen bonding network of ice.

What happens next?
We have seen that the old ﬁsh-hook idea of atoms connecting that Democritus liked so much just doesn’t work. Elec-
trons don’t have little hooks on them, but they are the basis for connecting atoms to form molecules. You have
learned how to write Lewis electron-dot structures for molecules and predict their shape using VSEPR theory. Now
it is time to apply these abilities to understand how the electrons behave in their atomic orbitals when a covalent
bond forms.

Valence Bond Theory

You have learned that a covalent bond forms when the electron clouds of two atoms overlap with each other.
In
a simple H2 molecule, the single electron in each atom becomes attracted to the nucleus of the other atom in the
molecule as the atoms come closer together. An optimum distance, equal to the bond length, is eventually attained,
and the potential energy reaches a minimum. A stable, single covalent bond has formed between the two hydrogen
atoms. Other covalent bonds form in the same way as unpaired electrons from two atoms “match up” to form the
In a ﬂuorine atom, there is an unpaired electron in one of the 2p orbitals. When a F2 molecule forms, the

2p orbitals from each of the two atoms overlap to produce the F−F covalent bond. The overlapping orbitals do not
have to be of the same type. In a molecule of HF, the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atom overlaps with the 2p orbital of
the ﬂuorine atom (see Figure 9.48).
In essence, any covalent bond results from the overlap of atomic orbitals. This idea forms the basis for a quantum

Do you recognize this plant?
If we were walking on the beach, the plants shown above would look very different. They would be short and
sticking out of the sand. When we see them this way, we do not immediately recognize them as beach plants. Often
we need to look at the world around us in different ways to understand things better.

Hybrid Orbitals –sp3

The bonding scheme described by valence bond theory must account for molecular geometries as predicted by
VSEPR theory. To do that, we must introduce a concept called hybrid orbitals.
sp3 Hybridization
Unfortunately, overlap of existing atomic orbitals (s, p, etc.) is not sufﬁcient to explain some of the bonding and
molecular geometries that are observed. Consider the element carbon and the methane (CH4) molecule. A carbon
atom has the electron conﬁguration of 1s2 2s2 2p2, meaning that it has two unpaired electrons in its 2p orbitals, as
shown in the Figure 9.49.
According to the description of valence bond theory so far, carbon would be expected to form only two bonds,
corresponding to its two unpaired electrons. However, methane is a common and stable molecule, with four
equivalent C−H bonds. To account for this, one of the 2s electrons is promoted to the empty 2p orbital (see Figure
9.50).

Promotion of carbon s electron to empty p orbital.

Now, four bonds are possible. The promotion of the electron “costs” a small amount of energy, but recall that the
process of bond formation is accompanied by a decrease in energy. The two extra bonds that can now be formed
results in a lower overall energy and thus greater stability to the CH4 molecule. Carbon normally forms four bonds
in most of its compounds.
The number of bonds is now correct, but the geometry is wrong. The three p orbitals (px, py, pz) are oriented at
90o relative to one another. However, as was seen from VSEPR theory, the observed H−C−H bond angle in the
tetrahedral CH4 molecule is actually 109.5o. Therefore, the methane molecule cannot be adequately represented by
simple overlap of the 2s and 2p orbitals of carbon with the 1s orbitals of each hydrogen atom.
To explain the bonding in methane, it is necessary to introduce the concept of hybridization and hybrid atomic
orbitals. Hybridization is the mixing of the atomic orbitals in an atom to produce a set of hybrid orbitals. When
hybridization occurs, it must do so as a result of the mixing of nonequivalent orbitals. In other words, s and p orbitals
can hybridize but p orbitals cannot hybridize with other p orbitals. Hybrid orbitals are the atomic orbitals obtained
when two or more nonequivalent orbitals form the same atom combine in preparation for bond formation.
In the
current case of carbon, the single 2s orbital hybridizes with the three 2p orbitals to form a set of four hybrid orbitals,
called sp3 hybrids (see Figure 9.51).

FIGURE 9.51
Carbon sp3 hybrid orbitals.

The sp3 hybrids are all equivalent to one another. Spatially, the hybrid orbitals point towards the four corners of a
tetrahedron (see Figure 9.52).

Summary

• Electrons hybridize in order to form covalent bonds.
• Nonequivalent orbitals mix to form hybrid orbitals.

How do you open the closed circle?
Romeo and Juliet were two of the great lovers of all time. Their embrace allowed no other person to be a part of it
–they only wanted to be with each other. It took outside intervention (parents are like that!) to get them away from
one another. Paired electrons are similar to the lovers. They do not bond covalently until they are unpaired. Then
they can become a part of a larger chemical structure.

Hybrid Orbitals –sp and sp2

sp Hybridization

A beryllium hydride (BeH2) molecule is predicted to be linear by VSEPR. The beryllium atom contains all paired
electrons and so must also undergo hybridization. One of the 2s electrons is ﬁrst promoted to the empty 2px orbital
(see Figure 9.53).
Now the hybridization takes place only with the occupied orbitals and the result is a pair of sp hybrid orbitals. The
two remaining p orbitals (py and pz) do not hybridize and remain unoccupied (see Figure 9.54).
The geometry of the sp hybrid orbitals is linear, with the lobes of the orbitals pointing in opposite directions along
one axis, arbitrarily deﬁned as the x-axis (see Figure 9.55). Each can bond with a 1s orbital from a hydrogen atom
to form the linear BeH2 molecule.

The process of sp hybridization is the
mixing of an s orbital with a single p orbital
(the pxorbital by convention), to form a set

sp hybrids point opposite one another to
produce a linear molecule.

Other molecules whose electron domain geometry is linear and for whom hybridization is necessary also form sp
hybrid orbitals. Examples include CO2 and C2H2, which will be discussed in further detail later.

sp2 Hybridization

Boron triﬂuoride (BF3) is predicted to have a trigonal planar geometry by VSEPR. First a paired 2s electron is
promoted to the empty 2py orbital (see Figure 9.56).

FIGURE 9.56
Promotion of 2s electron.

This is followed by hybridization of the three occupied orbitals to form a set of three sp2 hybrids, leaving the 2pz
orbital unhybridized (see Figure 9.57).

The geometry of the sp2 hybrid orbitals is trigonal planar, with the lobes of the orbitals pointing towards the corners
of a triangle (see Figure 9.58). The angle between any two of the hybrid orbital lobes is 120°. Each can bond with
a 2p orbital from a ﬂuorine atom to form the trigonal planar BF3 molecule.

The process of sp2 hybridization is the mixing of an s orbital with a set of two p orbitals (px and py) to form a set

Other molecules with a trigonal planar electron domain geometry form sp2 hybrid orbitals. Ozone (O3) is an
example of a molecule whose electron domain geometry is trigonal planar, though the presence of a lone pair on the
central oxygen makes the molecular geometry bent. The hybridization of the central O atom of ozone is sp2.

9.20 Sigma and Pi Bonds

• Deﬁne sigma and pi bonds.
• Describe hybridization of electrons in sigma and pi bonds.

How many people do you think are squeezed on this street?
Our minds can handle two electrons interacting with one another in a sphere of space. But then we start putting in
double bonds and triple bonds. The way we draw these bonds on paper suggests we are squeezing more electrons
into the same space, and that doesn’t work. Electrons don’t like to be pushed together (especially since they all have
negative charges that repel one another). So we need a more complex picture that works for all these electrons.

Sigma and Pi Bonds

The hybridization model helps explain molecules with double or triple bonds (see Figure 9.59). Ethene (C2H4)
contains a double covalent bond between the two carbon atoms and single bonds between the carbon atoms and the
hydrogen atoms. The entire molecule is planar.
As can be seen in the Figure 9.60, the electron domain geometry around each carbon independently is trigonal
planar. This corresponds to sp2 hybridization. Previously, we saw carbon undergo sp3 hybridization in a CH4
molecule, so the electron promotion is the same for ethene, but the hybridization occurs only between the single s
orbital and two of the three p orbitals. Thus generates a set of three sp2 hybrids along with an unhybridized 2pz
orbital. Each contains one electron and so is capable of forming a covalent bond.
The three sp2 hybrid orbitals lie in one plane, while the unhybridized 2pz orbital is oriented perpendicular to that
plane. The bonding in C2H4 is explained as follows. One of the three sp2 hybrids forms a bond by overlapping

with the identical hybrid orbital on the other carbon atom. The remaining two hybrid orbitals form bonds by
overlapping with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen atom. Finally, the 2pz orbitals on each carbon atom form another bond
by overlapping with one another sideways.
It is necessary to distinguish between the two types of covalent bonds in a C2H4 molecule. A sigma bond (σ
bond) is a bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in an end-to-end fashion, with the electron density concentrated
between the nuclei of the bonding atoms. A pi bond (π bond) is a bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in a
side-by-side fashion with the electron density concentrated above and below the plane of the nuclei of the bonding
atoms. The Figure 9.61 shows the two types of bonding in C2H4. The sp2 hybrid orbitals are purple and the pz
orbital is blue. Three sigma bonds are formed from each carbon atom for a total of six sigma bonds total in the
molecule. The pi bond is the “second” bond of the double bonds between the carbon atoms and is shown as an
elongated green lobe that extends both above and below the plane of the molecule. This plane contains the six
atoms and all of the sigma bonds.

In a conventional Lewis electron-dot structure, a double bond is shown as a double dash between the atoms as in
C=C. It is important to realize, however, that the two bonds are different: one is a sigma bond, while the other is a
pi bond.
Ethyne (C2H2) is a linear molecule with a triple bond between the two carbon atoms (see Figure 9.62). The
hybridization is therefore sp.

FIGURE 9.62
Ethyne structure.

The promotion of an electron in the carbon atom occurs in the same way. However, the hybridization now involves
only the 2s orbital and the 2px orbital, leaving the 2py and the 2pz orbitals unhybridized.

FIGURE 9.63
Hybridization in ethyne.

The sp hybrid orbitals form a sigma bond between each other as well as sigma bonds to the hydrogen atoms. Both
the py and the pz orbitals on each carbon atom form pi bonds between each other. As with ethene, these side-to-
side overlaps are above and below the plane of the molecule. The orientation of the two pi bonds is that they are
perpendicular to one another (see Figure 9.64). One pi bond is above and below the line of the molecule as shown,
while the other is in front of and behind the page.

FIGURE 9.64
The C2H2 molecule contains a triple bond
between the two carbon atoms, one of
which is a sigma bond, and two of which
are pi bonds.

In general, single bonds between atoms are always sigma bonds. Double bonds are comprised of one sigma and one
pi bond. Triple bonds are comprised of one sigma bond and two pi bonds.

Summary

• Sigma bonds form between two atoms.
• Pi bonds form from p orbital overlap.

Is there an easier way to load this truck?
When the weather is nice, many people begin to work on their yards and homes. For many projects, sand is needed
as a foundation for a walk or to add to other materials. You could order up twenty million grains of sand and have
people really stare at you. You could order by the pound, but that takes a lot of time weighing out. The best bet is to
order by the yard, meaning a cubic yard. The loader can easily scoop up what you need and put it directly in your
truck.

It certainly is easy to count bananas or to count elephants (as long as you stay out of their way). However, you would
be counting grains of sugar from your sugar canister for a long, long time. Atoms and molecules are extremely small
–far, far smaller than grains of sugar. Counting atoms or molecules is not only unwise, it is absolutely impossible.
One drop of water contains about 1022 molecules of water. If you counted 10 molecules every second for 50 years
without stopping you would have counted only 1.6 × 1010 molecules. Put another way, at that counting rate, it would
take you over 30 trillion years to count the water molecules in one tiny drop.
Chemists needed a name that can stand for a very large number of items. Amedeo Avogadro (1776 - 1856), an Italian
scientist, provided just such a number. He is responsible for the counting unit of measure called the mole. A mole
(mol) is the amount of a substance that contains 6.02 × 1023 representative particles of that substance. The mole is
the SI unit for amount of a substance. Just like the dozen and the gross, it is a name that stands for a number. There
are therefore 6.02 × 1023 water molecules in a mole of water molecules. There also would be 6.02 × 1023 bananas
in a mole of bananas, if such a huge number of bananas ever existed.
The number 6.02 × 1023 is called Avogadro’s number, the number of representative particles in a mole. It is an
experimentally determined number. A representative particle is the smallest unit in which a substance naturally

atoms, carbon atoms, and helium atoms, respectively. Seven elements exist in nature as diatomic molecules and
they are H2, N2, O2, F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2. The representative particle for these elements is the molecule. Likewise,
all molecular compounds such as H2O and CO2 exist as molecules and so the molecule is their representative
particle. For ionic compounds such as NaCl and Ca(NO3)2, the representative particle is the formula unit. A mole
of any substance contains Avogadro’s number (6.02 × 1023) of representative particles.

Using our unit conversion techniques, we can use the mole label to convert back and forth between the number of
particles and moles.

Sample Problem 1: Converting Number of Particles to Moles
The element carbon exists in two primary forms: graphite and diamond. How many moles of carbon atoms is 4.72 ×
1024 atoms of carbon?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.

• number of C atoms = 4.72 × 1024

• 1 mole = 6.02 × 1023atoms

• 4.72 × 1024 = ? mol C

One conversion factor will allow us to convert from the number of C atoms to moles of C atoms.
Step 2: Calculate.

4.72× 1024 atoms C×

1 mol C

6.02× 1023 atoms C

= 7.84 mol C

Step 3: Think about your result.
The given number of carbon atoms was greater than Avogadro’s number, so the number of moles of C atoms is
greater than 1 mole. Since Avogadro’s number is a measured quantity with three signiﬁcant ﬁgures, the result of the
calculation is rounded to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Suppose that you wanted to know how many hydrogen atoms were in a mole of water molecules. First, you would
need to know the chemical formula for water, which is H2O. There are two atoms of hydrogen in each molecule
of water. How many atoms of hydrogen would there be in two water molecules? There would be 2 × 2 = 4
hydrogen atoms. How about in a dozen? In that case a dozen is 12 so 12 × 2 = 24 hydrogen atoms in a dozen water
molecules. To get the answers, (4 and 24) you had to multiply the given number of molecules by two atoms of
hydrogen per molecule. So to ﬁnd the number of hydrogen atoms in a mole of water molecules, the problem could
be solved using conversion factors.

1 mol H2O× 6.02× 1023 molecules H2O

1 mol H2O

× 2 atoms H

1 molecule H2O

= 1.20× 1024 atoms H

The ﬁrst conversion factor converts from moles of particles to the number of particles. The second conversion factor
reﬂects the number of atoms contained within each molecule.

Two conversion factors will be used. First, convert atoms of oxygen to molecules of sulfuric acid. Then, convert
molecules of sulfuric acid to moles of sulfuric acid.

The original number of oxygen atoms was about 80 times larger than Avogadro’s number. Since each sulfuric acid
molecule contains 4 oxygen atoms, there are about 20 moles of sulfuric acid molecules.

I want to make a solution that contains 1.8 moles of potassium dichromate.
I don’t have a balance calibrated in

Molar Mass

Molar mass is deﬁned as the mass of one mole of representative particles of a substance. By looking at a periodic
table, we can conclude that the molar mass of lithium is 6.94 g, the molar mass of zinc is 65.38 g, and the molar
mass of gold is 196.97 g. Each of these quantities contains 6.02 × 1023 atoms of that particular element. The units
for molar mass are grams per mole or g/mol.

Molar Masses of Compounds

A molecular formula of the compound carbon dioxide is CO2. One molecule of carbon dioxide consists of 1 atom

The molecular mass of a compound is the mass of one molecule of that compound. The molecular mass of carbon

The molar mass of any compound is the mass in grams of one mole of that compound. One mole of carbon dioxide

Sample Problem: Molar Mass of a Compound

Calcium nitrate, Ca(NO3)2, is used as a component in fertilizer Determine the molar mass of calcium nitrate.
Step 1: List the known and unknown quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• formula = Ca(NO3)2
• molar mass Ca = 40.08 g/mol
• molar mass N = 14.01 g/mol
• molar mass O = 16.00 g/mol

Unknown

• molar mass Ca(NO3)2

First we need to analyze the formula. Since the Ca lacks a subscript, there is one Ca atom per formula unit. The
2 outside the parentheses means that there are two nitrate ions per formula unit and each nitrate ion consists of one
nitrogen atom and three oxygen atoms. Therefore, there are a total of 1 × 2 = 2 nitrogen atoms and 3 × 2 = 6
oxygen atoms per formula unit. Thus, 1 mol of calcium nitrate contains 1 mol of Ca atoms, 2 mol of N atoms, and
6 mol of O atoms.
Step 2: Calculate.
Use the molar masses of each atom together with the number of atoms in the formula and add together.

= 40.08 g Ca

1 mol Ca× 40.08 g Ca
1 mol Ca
2 mol N× 14.01 g N
1 mol N
6 mol O× 16.00 g O
1 mol O
molar mass of Ca(NO3)2 = 40.08 g + 28.02 g + 96.00 g = 164.10 g/mol

= 28.02 g N

= 96.00 g O

How can we get more product?
Chemical manufacturing plants are always seeking to improve their processes. One of the ways this improvement
comes about is through measuring the amount of material produced in a reaction. By knowing how much is made,
the scientists and engineers can try different ways of getting more product at less cost.

Conversions Between Moles and Mass

The molar mass of any substance is the mass in grams of one mole of representative particles of that substance. The
representative particles can be atoms, molecules, or formula units of ionic compounds. This relationship is fre-
quently used in the laboratory. Suppose that for a certain experiment you need 3.00 moles of calcium chloride
(CaCl2). Since calcium chloride is a solid, it would be convenient to use a balance to measure the mass that is
needed. The molar mass of CaCl2 is 110.98 g/mol. The conversion factor that can be used is then based on the
equality that 1 mol = 110.98 g CaCl2. Dimensional analysis will allow you to calculate the mass of CaCl2 that you
should measure.

3.00 mol CaCl2 × 110.98 g CaCl2
1 mol CaCl2

= 333 g CaCl2

When you measure the mass of 333 g of CaCl2, you are measuring 3.00 moles of CaCl2.

Known

• molar mass of Cr = 52.00 g mol
• 0.560 mol Cr

Unknown

• 0.560 mol Cr = ? g

One conversion factor will allow us to convert from the moles of Cr to mass.
Step 2: Calculate.

0.560 mol Cr× 52.00 g Cr
1 mol Cr

Step 3: Think about your result.
Since the desired amount was slightly more than one half of a mole, the mass should be slightly more than one half
of the molar mass. The answer has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures because of the 0.560 mol.
A similar conversion factor utilizing molar mass can be used to convert from the mass of an substance to moles. In a
laboratory situation, you may perform a reaction and produce a certain amount of a product which can be massed. It
will often then be necessary to determine the number of moles of the product that was formed. The next problem
illustrates this situation.

How much gas is there?
Avogadro was interested in studying gases. He theorized that equal volumes of gases under the same conditions
contained the same number of particles. Other researchers studied how many gas particles were in a speciﬁc volume
of gas. Eventually, scientists were able to develop the relationship between number of particles and mass using the
idea of moles.

Conversions Between Mass and Number of Particles

In "Conversions between Moles and Mass", you learned how to convert back and forth between moles and the
number of representative particles. Now you have seen how to convert back and forth between moles and mass of a
substance in grams. We can combine the two types of problems into one. Mass and number of particles are both
related to grams. In order to convert from mass to number of particles or vice-versa, it will ﬁrst require a conversion
to moles.

How do scuba divers know if they will run out of gas?
Knowing how much gas is available for a dive is crucial to the survival of the diver. The tank on the diver’s back is
equipped with gauges to tell how much gas is present and what the pressure is. A basic knowledge of gas behavior
allows the diver to assess how long to stay under water without developing problems.

Avogadro’s Hypothesis and Molar Volume

Volume is a third way to measure the amount of matter, after item count and mass. With liquids and solids, volume
varies greatly depending on the density of the substance. This is because solid and liquid particles are packed
close together with very little space in between the particles. However, gases are largely composed of empty space
between the actual gas particles (see Figure 10.6).
In 1811, Amedeo Avogadro explained that the volumes of all gases can be easily determined. Avogadro’s hypothesis
states that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of particles. Since
the total volume that a gas occupies is made up primarily of the empty space between the particles, the actual size
of the particles themselves is nearly negligible. A given volume of a gas with small light particles such as hydrogen
(H2) contains the same number of particles as the same volume of a heavy gas with large particles such as sulfur
hexaﬂuoride, SF6.
Gases are compressible, meaning that when put under high pressure, the particles are forced closer to one an-
other. This decreases the amount of empty space and reduces the volume of the gas. Gas volume is also affected

by temperature. When a gas is heated, its molecules move faster and the gas expands. Because of the variation in
gas volume due to pressure and temperature changes, the comparison of gas volumes must be done at one standard
temperature and pressure. Standard temperature and pressure (STP) is deﬁned as 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm
pressure. The molar volume of a gas is the volume of one mole of a gas at STP. At STP, one mole (6.02 × 1023
representative particles) of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 L ( Figure 10.7).

FIGURE 10.7
A mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L at standard temperature and pressure

The Figure 10.8 illustrates how molar volume can be seen when comparing different gases. Samples of helium (He),
nitrogen (N2), and methane (CH4) are at STP. Each contains 1 mole or 6.02 × 1023 particles. However, the mass of
each gas is different and corresponds to the molar mass of that gas: 4.00 g/mol for He, 28.0 g/mol for N2, and 16.0
g/mol for CH4.

How can you tell how much gas is in these containers?
Small gas tanks are often used to supply gases for chemistry reactions. A gas gauge will give some information
about how much is in the tank, but quantitative estimates are needed so the reaction will be able to proceed to
completion. Knowing how to calculate needed parameters for gases is very helpful to avoid running out too early.

Conversions Between Moles and Gas Volume

Molar volume at STP can be used to convert from moles to gas volume and from gas volume to moles. The equality
of 1 mole = 22.4 L is the basis for the conversion factor.

Step 2: Calculate.
We start by determining the number of moles of gas present. We know that 22.4 liters of a gas at STP equals one
mole, so:

867 litres× 1 mole
22.4 liters

= 3.87 moles

We also know the molecular weight of N2 (28.0 grams/mole), so we can then calculate the weight of nitrogen gas in
867 liters:

10.8 Gas Density

• Make calculations dealing with molar mass and density of a gas.

Why does carbon dioxide sink in air?
When we run a reaction to produce a gas, we expect it to rise into the air. Many students have done experiments
where gases such as hydrogen are formed. The gas can be trapped in a test tube held upside-down over the
reaction. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, sinks when it is released. Carbon dioxide has a density greater
that air, so it will not rise like these other gases would.

Gas Density

As you know, density is deﬁned as the mass per unit volume of a substance. Since gases all occupy the same volume
on a per mole basis, the density of a particular gas is dependent on its molar mass. A gas with a small molar mass
will have a lower density than a gas with a large molar mass. Gas densities are typically reported in g/L. Gas density
can be calculated from molar mass and molar volume.

Step 3: Think about your result.
The molar mass of nitrogen is slightly larger than molar volume, so the density is slightly greater than 1 g/L.
Alternatively, the molar mass of a gas can be determined if the density of the gas at STP is known.

If I want to visit the town of Manteo, North Carolina, out on the coast, I will need a map of how to get there. I may

direction. Chemistry road maps serve the same purpose. How do I handle a certain type of calculation? There is a
process and a set of directions to help.

Mole Road Map

Previously, we saw how the conversions between mass and number of particles required two steps, with moles as
the intermediate. This concept can now be extended to also include gas volume at STP. The resulting diagram is
referred to as a mole road map (see Figure 10.10).
The mole is at the center of any calculation involving amount of a substance. The sample problem below is one of
many different problems that can be solved using the mole road map.

10.10 Percent Composition

• Deﬁne percent composition.
• Perform percent composition calculations.

Is there anything healthy in this jar?
Packaged foods that you eat typically have nutritional information provided on the label. The label on a jar of
peanut butter (shown above) reveals that one serving size is considered to be 32 g. The label also gives the masses
of various types of compounds that are present in each serving. One serving contains 7 g of protein, 15 g of fat,
and 3 g of sugar. By calculating the fraction of protein, fat, or sugar in one serving of size of peanut butter and
converting to percent values, we can determine the composition of the peanut butter on a percent by mass basis.

Percent Composition

Chemists often need to know what elements are present in a compound and in what percentage. The percent
composition is the percent by mass of each element in a compound.
It is calculated in a similar way that we just
indicated for the peanut butter.

% by mass =

Percent Composition from Mass Data

The sample problem below shows the calculation of the percent composition of a compound based on mass data.
Sample Problem One: Percent Composition from Mass
A certain newly synthesized compound is known to contain the elements zinc and oxygen. When a 20.00 g sample
of the sample is decomposed, 16.07 g of zinc remains. Determine the percent composition of the compound.

Subtract to ﬁnd the mass of oxygen in the compound. Divide each element’s mass by the mass of the compound to
ﬁnd the percent by mass.

Mass of oxygen = 20.00 g− 16.07 g = 3.93 g O

% Zn =

% O =

16.07 g Zn

20.00 g

× 100% = 80.35% Zn

× 100% = 19.65% O

Step 3: Think about your result.
The calculations make sense because the sum of the two percentages adds up to 100%. By mass, the compound is
mostly zinc.

Percent Composition from a Chemical Formula

The percent composition of a compound can also be determined from the formula of the compound. The subscripts
in the formula are ﬁrst used to calculate the mass of each element in one mole of the compound. That is divided by
the molar mass of the compound and multiplied by 100%.

% by mass =

mass of element in 1 mol
molar mass of compound

× 100%

The percent composition of a given compound is always the same as long as the compound is pure.

Dichlorineheptoxide (Cl2O7) is a highly reactive compound used in some organic synthesis reactions. Calculate the
percent composition of dichlorineheptoxide.

70.90 g Cl

× 100% = 61.24% O

Step 3: Think about your result.
The percentages add up to 100%.
Percent composition can also be used to determine the mass of a certain element that is contained in any mass of
a compound.
In the previous sample problem, it was found that the percent composition of dichlorineheptoxide is
38.76% Cl and 61.24% O. Suppose that you needed to know the masses of chlorine and oxygen present in a 12.50
g sample of dichlorineheptoxide. You can set up a conversion factor based on the percent by mass of each element.

12.50 g Cl2O7 × 38.76 g Cl
100 g Cl2O7
12.50 g Cl2O7 × 61.24 g O
100 g Cl2O7

= 4.845 g Cl

= 7.655 g O

The sum of the two masses is 12.50 g, the mass of the sample size.

10.11 Percent of Water in a Hydrate

• Deﬁne hydrate.
• Calculate the percent water in hydrate when give relevant data.

Why does the color change?
If you look at a typical bottle of copper sulfate, it will be a bluish-green.
If someone tells you that copper sulfate
is white, you won’t believe them. You are both right; it just depends on the copper sulfate. Your blue-green
copper sulfate has several water molecules attached to it while your friend’s copper sulfate is anhydrous (no water
attached). Why the difference? The water molecules interact with some of the d electrons in the copper ion and
produce the color. When the water is removed, the electron conﬁguration changes and the color disappears.

Percent of Water in a Hydrate

Many ionic compounds naturally contain water as part of the crystal lattice structure. A hydrate is a compound
that has one or more water molecules bound to each formula unit. Ionic compounds that contain a transition metal
are often highly colored. Interestingly, it is common for the hydrated form of a compound to be of a different color
than the anhydrous form, which has no water in its structure. A hydrate can usually be converted to the anhydrous
compound by heating. For example, the anhydrous compound cobalt(II) chloride is blue, while the hydrate is a
distinctive magenta color.
The hydrated form of cobalt(II) chloride contains six water molecules in each formula unit. The name of the
compound is cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate and its formula is CoCl2•6H2O. The formula for water is set apart
at the end of the formula with a dot, followed by a coefﬁcient that represents the number of water molecules per
formula unit.

hydrate is the molar mass of the CoCl2 plus the mass of water.

10.12 Determining Empirical Formulas

• Deﬁne empirical formula.
• Calculate the empirical formula for a compound when given the elemental analysis of the compound.

What is occuring in this picture?
In the early days of chemistry, there were few tools for the detailed study of compounds. Much of the information
regarding the composition of compounds came from the elemental analysis of inorganic materials. The “new”
ﬁeld of organic chemistry (the study of carbon compounds) faced the challenge of not being able to characterize a
compound completely. The relative amounts of elements could be determined, but so many of these materials had
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and possibly nitrogen in simple ratios. We did not know exactly how many of these
atoms were actually in a speciﬁc molecule.

Determining Empirical Formulas

An empirical formula is one that shows the lowest whole-number ratio of the elements in a compound. Because
the structure of ionic compounds is an extended three-dimensional network of positive and negative ions, all for-
mulas of ionic compounds are empirical. However, we can also consider the empirical formula of a molecular
compound. Ethene is a small hydrocarbon compound with the formula C2H4 (see Figure 10.12). While C2H4 is
its molecular formula and represents its true molecular structure, it has an empirical formula of CH2. The simplest
ratio of carbon to hydrogen in ethene is 1:2. There are two ways to view that ratio. Considering one molecule of
ethene, the ratio is 1 carbon atom for every 2 atoms of hydrogen. Considering one mole of ethene, the ratio is 1 mole
of carbon for every 2 moles of hydrogen. So the subscripts in a formula represent the mole ratio of the elements in
that formula.
In a procedure called elemental analysis, an unknown compound can be analyzed in the laboratory in order to
determine the percentages of each element contained within it. These percentages can be transformed into the mole
ratio of the elements, which leads to the empirical formula. The steps to be taken are outlined below.

1. Assume a 100 g sample of the compound so that the given percentages can be directly converted into grams.
2. Use each element’s molar mass to convert the grams of each element to moles.
3. In order to ﬁnd a whole-number ratio, divide the moles of each element by whichever of the moles from step

2 is the smallest.

4. If all the moles at this point are whole numbers (or very close), the empirical formula can be written with the

moles as the subscript of each element.

5. In some cases, one or more of the moles calculated in step 3 will not be whole numbers. Multiply each of the
moles by the smallest whole number that will convert each into a whole number. Write the empirical formula.

How can you determine the differences between these two molecules?
Above we see two carbohydrates: glucose and sucrose. Sucrose is almost exactly twice the size of glucose, although
their empirical formulas are very similar. Some people could distinguish them on the basis of taste, but it’s not a

Molecular Formulas

Molecular formulas give the kind and number of atoms of each element present in a molecular compound. In many
cases, the molecular formula is the same as the empirical formula. The molecular formula of methane is CH4 and
because it contains only one carbon atom, that is also its empirical formula. Sometimes, however, the molecular
formula is a simple whole-number multiple of the empirical formula. Acetic acid is an organic acid that is the main
component of vinegar.

Empirical formulas can be determined from the percent composition of a compound.
In order to determine its
molecular formula, it is necessary to know the molar mass of the compound. Chemists use an instrument called a
mass spectrometer to determine the molar mass of compounds.
In order to go from the empirical formula to the
molecular formula, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the empirical formula mass (EFM), which is simply the molar mass represented by the empirical

formula.

2. Divide the molar mass of the compound by the empirical formula mass. The result should be a whole number

or very close to a whole number.

3. Multiply all the subscripts in the empirical formula by the whole number found in step 2. The result is the

molecular formula.

Sample Problem One: Determining the Molecular Formula of a Compound

The empirical formula of a compound of boron and hydrogen is BH3. Its molar mass is 27.7 g/mol. Determine the
molecular formula of the compound.

11.1 Word Equations

• Write word equations that describe chemical reactions.

What’s for dinner?
Various ways of recording recipes have developed over the centuries. The cookbook shown above was written by a
woman who probably collected all her own recipes. Later, printed cookbooks became available (even guys had no
excuse for not being able to cook). Today we can ﬁnd recipes on a number of internet sites and can quickly search
for information on how to cook anything we want. Reading a recipe sometimes requires we understand a few codes
and symbols (what’s the difference between a tsp and a Tsp?), but the information on what we start with and what
we end up with is there.

Writing Chemical Equations

Chemical reactions are occurring all around you. Plants use sunlight to drive their photosynthetic process and
produce energy. Cars and other vehicles burn gasoline in order to power their engines. Batteries use electrochemical
reactions to produce energy and power many everyday devices. Many chemical reactions are going on inside you as
well, especially during the digestion of food.
In math class, you have written and solved many mathematical equations. Chemists keep track of chemical reactions
by writing equations as well. In any chemical reaction one or more substances, called reactants, are converted into
one or more new substances, called products. The general form of the equation for such a process looks like this.

Reactants → Products

524

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Chemical Reactions

Unlike in a math equation, a chemical equation does not use an equal sign. Instead the arrow is called a yield sign
and so the equation is described as “reactants yield products”.

Word Equations

You can describe a chemical reaction by writing a word equation. When silver metal is exposed to sulfur it reacts
to form silver sulﬁde. Silver sulﬁde is commonly known as tarnish and turns the surface of silver objects dark and
streaky black (see Figure 11.1). The sulfur that contributes to tarnish can come from traces of sulfur in the air or
from food such as eggs. The word equation for the process is:

The silver and the sulfur are the reactants in the equation, while the silver sulﬁde is the product.

Silver + sulfur → Silver sulﬁde

FIGURE 11.1
The coffee percolator on the left has been tarnished from exposure to
sulfur. Tarnish is the chemical compound silver sulﬁde. The same
percolator on the right has been polished with a tarnish removal product
in order to restore its silver ﬁnish.

Another common chemical reaction is the burning of methane gas. Methane is the major component of natural gas
and is commonly burned on a gas stove or in a Bunsen burner ( Figure 11.2). Burning is a chemical reaction in
which some type of fuel is reacted with oxygen gas. The products of the reaction in the burning of methane as well
as other fuels are carbon dioxide and water. The word equation for this reaction is:

Methane + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water

Word equations can be very useful, but do have one major drawback. They cannot be used for any quantitative
work. A word equation does not tell how many moles of each material are needed or how many moles of product
are formed.

Summary

• Word equations are used to describe the conversion of reactants to products.

How do you make Shrimp gumbo?
Shrimp gumbo is one of many enjoyable dishes that are part of the Cajun culture in Louisiana. It’s a spicy dish that
needs careful control of all the ingredients so that it has a “kick”, but is not overwhelming. Recipes tell not only
what is in the preparation, but describes how much of each ingredient and details of how to cook the meal. Similarly,
We need this type of information in order to carry out chemical reactions successfully and safely.

Chemical Equations

Word equations are time-consuming to write and do not prove to be convenient for many of the things that chemists
need to do with equations. A chemical equation is a representation of a chemical reaction that displays the reactants
and products with chemical formulas. The chemical equation for the reaction of methane with oxygen is shown:

CH4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O

The equation above, called a skeleton equation, is an equation that shows only the formulas of the reactants and
products with nothing to indicate the relative amounts. The ﬁrst step in writing an accurate chemical equation is
to write the skeleton equation, making sure that the formulas of all substances involved are written correctly. All
reactants are written to the left of the yield arrow, separated from one another by a plus sign. Likewise, products are
written to the right of the yield arrow, also separated with a plus sign.

527

11.2. Chemical Equations

www.ck12.org

It is often important to know the physical states of the reactants and products taking part in a reaction. To do this,
put the appropriate symbol in parentheses after each formula: (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, (g) for gas, and (aq) for an
aqueous (water-based) solution. The previous reaction becomes:

CH4(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)

The Table 11.1 shows a listing of symbols used in chemical equations. Some, such as the double arrow which
represents equilibrium, and the use of a catalyst in a reaction, will be treated in detail in other concepts.

11.3 Balancing Equations

• Balance chemical equations when given the skeleton information.

Any Leftovers?
When you cook a meal, quite often there are leftovers because you prepared more than people would eat at one
sitting. Sometimes when you repair a piece of equipment, you end up with what are called “pocket parts”, small
pieces you put in your pocket because you’re not sure where they belong. Chemistry tries to avoid leftovers and
pocket parts. In normal chemical processes, we cannot create or destroy matter (law of conservation of mass). If
we start out with ten carbon atoms, we need to end up with ten carbon atoms. John Dalton’ atomic theory said that
chemical reactions basically involve the rearrangement of atoms. Chemical equations need to follow these principles
in order to be correct.

Balancing Chemical Equations

A balanced equation is a chemical equation in which mass is conserved and there are equal numbers of atoms
of each element on both sides of the equation. We can write a chemical equation for the reaction of carbon with
hydrogen gas to form methane (CH4).

Chapter 11. Chemical Reactions

In order to write a correct equation, you must ﬁrst write the correct skeleton equation with the correct chemical
formulas. Recall that hydrogen is a diatomic molecule and so is written as H2.
When we count the number of atoms of both elements, shown under the equation, we see that the equation is not
balanced. There are only 2 atoms of hydrogen on the reactant side of the equation, while there are 4 atoms of
hydrogen on the product side. We can balance the above equation by adding a coefﬁcient of 2 in front of the formula
for hydrogen.

C(s) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g)

A coefﬁcient is a small whole number placed in front of a formula in an equation in order to balance it. The 2 in
front of the H2 means that there are a total of 2× 2 = 4 atoms of hydrogen as reactants. Visually, the reaction looks
like the Figure 11.3.

FIGURE 11.3
Reaction between carbon and hydrogen to form methane.

In the balanced equation, there is one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen on both sides of the arrow. Below
are guidelines for writing and balancing chemical equations.

1. Determine the correct chemical formulas for each reactant and product.
2. Write the skeleton equation.
3. Count the number of atoms of each element that appears as a reactant and as a product. If a polyatomic ion is

unchanged on both sides of the equation, count it as a unit.

4. Balance each element on at a time by placing coefﬁcients in front of the formulas. No coefﬁcient is written
for a 1. It is best to begin by balancing elements that only appear in one formula on each side of the equation.
NEVER change the subscripts in a chemical formula –you can only balance equations by using coefﬁcients.

5. Check each atom or polyatomic ion to be sure that they are equal on both sides of the equation.
6. Make sure that all coefﬁcients are in the lowest possible ratio. If necessary, reduce to the lowest ratio.

Sample Problem: Balancing Chemical Equations

Aqueous solutions of lead(II) nitrate and sodium chloride are mixed. The products of the reaction are an aqueous
solution of sodium nitrate and a solid precipitate of lead(II) chloride.
Step 1: Plan the problem.
Follow the steps for writing and balancing a chemical equation.
Step 2: Solve.
Write the skeleton equation with the correct formulas.

Pb(NO3)2(aq) + NaCl(aq) → NaNO3(aq) + PbCl2(s)

Count the number of each atom or polyatomic ion on both sides of the equation.

TABLE 11.2:

products
1 Pb atom

The nitrate ions and the chlorine atoms are unbalanced. Start by placing a 2 in front of the NaCl. This increases the
reactant counts to 2 Na atoms and 2 Cl atoms. Then place a 2 in front of the NaNO3. The result is:

Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2NaCl(aq) → 2NaNO3(aq) + PbCl2(s)

The new count for each atom and polyatomic ion becomes:

reactants
1 Pb atom
2 NO3
2 Na atom
2 Cl atoms

− ions

Step 3: Think about your result.
The equation is now balanced since there are equal numbers of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.

11.4 Combination Reactions

• Deﬁne combination reaction.
• Write products of combination reactions when given the reactants.

How useful is a wheel rim?
A wheel rim is not very useful by itself. Driving on the rim can damage it and make for a very rough ride. When
the rim is combined with a tire, the product can be put on a car and used for a safe and comfortable ride. The two
separate items have combined to make something that improves the car ride.

Combination Reactions

A combination reaction is a reaction in which two or more substances combine to form a single new substance.
Combination reactions can also be called synthesis reactions. The general form of a combination reaction is:

A + B → AB

One combination reaction is two elements combining to form a compound. Solid sodium metal reacts with chlorine
gas to produce solid sodium chloride.

2Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2NaCl(s)

Notice that in order to write and balance the equation correctly, it is important to remember the seven elements that
exist in nature as diatomic molecules (H2, N2, O2, F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2).
One sort of combination reaction that occurs frequently is the reaction of an element with oxygen to form an
oxide. Metals and nonmetals both react readily with oxygen under most conditions. Magnesium reacts rapidly
and dramatically when ignited, combining with oxygen from the air to produce a ﬁne powder of magnesium oxide.

2Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2MgO(s)

Sulfur reacts with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide.

S(s) + O2(g) → SO2(g)

When nonmetals react with one another, the product is a molecular compound. Often, the nonmetal reactants can
combine in different ratios and produce different products. Sulfur can also combine with oxygen to produce sulfur
trioxide.

2S(s) + 3O2(g) → 2SO3(g)

Transition metals are capable of adopting multiple positive charges within their ionic compounds. Therefore, most
transition metals are capable of forming different products in a combination reaction. Iron reacts with oxygen to
form both iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide.

2Fe(s) + O2(g) → 2FeO(s)
4Fe(s) + 3O2(g) → 2Fe2O3(s)

Sample Problem: Combination Reactions

Potassium is a very reactive alkali metal that must be stored under oil in order to prevent it from reacting with air.
Write the balanced chemical equation for the combination reaction of potassium with oxygen.
Step 1: Plan the problem
Make sure formulas of all reactants and products are correct before balancing the equation. Oxygen gas is a diatomic
molecule. Potassium oxide is an ionic compound and so its formula is constructed by the crisscross method.
Potassium as an ion becomes K+, while the oxide ion is O2−.

Step 2: Solve
The skeleton (unbalanced) equation:

The equation is then easily balanced with coefﬁcients.

K(s) + O2(g) → K2O(s)

4K(s) + O2(g) → 2K2O(s)

534

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Chemical Reactions

Step 3: Think about your result
Formulas are correct and the resulting combination reaction is balanced.
Combination reactions can also take place when an element reacts with a compound to form a new compound
composed of a larger number of atoms. Carbon monoxide reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide according to
the equation:

2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g)

Two compounds may also react to from a more complex compound. A very common example is the reactions of
oxides with water. Calcium oxide reacts readily with water to produce an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide.

CaO(s) + H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq)

Sulfur trioxide gas reacts with water to form sulfuric acid. This is an unfortunately common reaction that occurs in
the atmosphere in some places where oxides of sulfur are present as pollutants. The acid formed in the reaction falls
to the ground as acid rain.

SO3(g) + H2O(l) → H2SO4(aq)

FIGURE 11.4

both natural and man-made objects. Acid
rain degrades marble statues like the one

Antoine Lavoisier is widely known as the “father of modern chemistry”. He was one of the ﬁrst to study chemical
reactions in detail. Lavoisier reacted mercury with oxygen to form mercuric oxide as part of his studies on the
composition of the atmosphere. He was then able to show that the decomposition of mercuric oxide produced
mercury and oxygen. The diagram above shows the apparatus used by Lavoisier to study the formation and
decomposition of mercuric oxide.

Decomposition Reactions

A decomposition reaction is a reaction in which a compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances.
The general form of a decomposition reaction is:

AB → A + B

Most decomposition reactions require an input of energy in the form of heat, light, or electricity.
Binary compounds are compounds composed of just two elements. The simplest kind of decomposition reaction is
when a binary compound decomposes into its elements. Mercury(II) oxide, a red solid, decomposes when heated to
produce mercury and oxygen gas.

carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.

How do you cook the perfect marshmallow?
Roasting marshmallows over an open ﬁre is a favorite past-time for campers, outdoor cook-outs, and just gathering
around a ﬁre in the back yard. The trick is to get the marshmallow a nice golden brown without catching it on ﬁre.
Too often we are not successful and we see the marshmallow burning on the stick –a combustion reaction taking
place right in front of us.

Combustion Reactions

A combustion reaction is a reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen gas, releasing energy in the form of
light and heat. Combustion reactions must involve O2 as one reactant. The combustion of hydrogen gas produces
water vapor.

2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)

Notice that this reaction also qualiﬁes as a combination reaction.

Combustion reactions must have oxygen as a reactant. Note that the water that is produced is in the gas rather than
the liquid state because of the high temperatures that accompany a combustion reaction.

11.7 Single-Replacement Reactions

• Deﬁne single-replacement reaction.
• Give examples of single-displacement reactions.

Why is the silver dark?
The cup shown above provides an example of tarnish, a chemical reaction caused when silver metal reacts with
hydrogen sulﬁde gas produced by some industrial processes or as a result of decaying animal or plant materials:

2Ag + H2S → Ag2S + H2

The tarnish can be removed using a number of polishes, but the process also removes a small amount of silver along
with the tarnish.

Single-Replacement Reactions

A single-replacement reaction is a reaction in which one element replaces a similar element in a compound. The
general form of a single-replacement (also called single-displacement) reaction is:

A + BC → AC + B

In this general reaction, element A is a metal and replaces element B, also a metal, in the compound. When the
element that is doing the replacing is a nonmetal, it must replace another nonmetal in a compound, and the general
equation becomes:

543

11.7. Single-Replacement Reactions

www.ck12.org

Y is a nonmetal and replaces the nonmetal Z in the compound with X.

Y + XZ → XY + Z

Metal Replacement

Magnesium is a more reactive metal than copper. When a strip of magnesium metal is placed in an aqueous solution
of copper(II) nitrate, it replaces the copper. The products of the reaction are aqueous magnesium nitrate and solid
copper metal.

Mg(s) + Cu(NO3)2(aq) → Mg(NO3)2(aq) + Cu(s)

This subcategory of single-replacement reactions is called a metal replacement reaction because it is a metal that is
being replaced (zinc).

Hydrogen Replacement

Many metals react easily with acids and when they do so, one of the products of the reaction is hydrogen gas. Zinc
reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce aqueous zinc chloride and hydrogen ( Figure 11.7).

Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)

In a hydrogen replacement reaction, the hydrogen in the acid is replaced by an active metal.
Some metals are so reactive that they are capable of replacing the hydrogen in water. The products of such a
reaction are the metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas. All group 1 metals undergo this type of reaction. Sodium reacts
vigorously with water to produce aqueous sodium hydroxide and hydrogen (see Figure 11.8).

2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)

Halogen Replacement

The element chlorine reacts with an aqueous solution of sodium bromide to produce aqueous sodium chloride and
elemental bromine.

Cl2(g) + 2NaBr(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + Br2(l)

The reactivity of the halogen group (group 17) decreases from top to bottom within the group. Fluorine is the most
reactive halogen, while iodine is the least. Since chlorine is above bromine, it is more reactive than bromine and can
replace it in a halogen replacement reaction.

11.8 Activity Series

• Deﬁne activity series.
• Use the activity series to predict the outcome of reactions.

What’s the difference between the two pictures above?
We see above two metals that can be exposed to water. The picture on the left is of sodium, which gives a violent
reaction when it comes in contact with water. The picture on the right is of silver, a metal so unreactive with water
that it can be made into drinking vessels. Both metals have a single s electron in their outer shell, so you would
predict similar reactivities. However, we have a better tool that allows us to make better prediction about what will
react with what.

The Activity Series

Single-replacement reactions only occur when the element that is doing the replacing is more reactive than the
element that is being replaced. Therefore, it is useful to have a list of elements in order of their relative reactivities.
The activity series is a list of elements in decreasing order of their reactivity. Since metals replace other metals,
while nonmetals replace other nonmetals, they each have a separate activity series. The Table 11.4 is an activity
series of most common metals and of the halogens.

For a single-replacement reaction, a given element is capable of replacing an element that is below it in the activity
series. This can be used to predict if a reaction will occur. Suppose that small pieces of the metal nickel were placed
into two separate aqueous solutions: one of iron(III) nitrate and one of lead(II) nitrate. Looking at the activity series,
we see that nickel is below iron, but above lead. Therefore, the nickel metal will be capable of replacing the lead in
a reaction, but will not be capable of replacing iron.

Ni(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) → Ni(NO3)2(aq) + Pb(s)
Ni(s) + Fe(NO3)3(aq) → NR (no reaction)

In the descriptions that accompany the activity series of metals, a given metal is also capable of undergoing the
reactions described below that section. For example, lithium will react with cold water, replacing hydrogen. It will
also react with steam and with acids, since that requires a lower degree of reactivity.

Sample Problem: Single-Replacement Reactions

Use the activity series to predict if the following reactions will occur. If not, write NR. If the reaction does occur,
write the products of the reaction and balance the equation.
A. Al(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq) →
B. Ag(s) + HCl(aq) →
Step 1: Plan the problem
For A, compare the placements of aluminum and zinc on the activity series. For B, compare the placements of silver
and hydrogen.
Step 2: Solve
Since aluminum is above zinc, it is capable of replacing it and a reaction will occur. The products of the reaction
will be aqueous aluminum nitrate and solid zinc. Take care to write the correct formulas for the products before
balancing the equation. Aluminum adopts a 3+ charge in an ionic compound, so the formula for aluminum nitrate is
Al(NO3)3. The balanced equation is:

2Al(s) + 3Zn(NO3)2(aq) → 2Al(NO3)3(aq) + 3Zn(s)

Since silver is below hydrogen, it is not capable of replacing hydrogen in a reaction with an acid.

Wanna trade?
The practice of barter (trading one thing for another) has been in existence from the beginning of time.
In the
illustration above, Items like chickens were bartered for newspapers. You have something I want, and I have
something you want. So we trade and we each have something new. Some chemical reactions are like that.
Compounds swap parts and you have new materials.

Double-Replacement Reactions

A double-replacement reaction is a reaction in which the positive and negative ions of two ionic compounds
exchange places to form two new compounds. The general form of a double-replacement (also called double-
displacement) reaction is:

AB +CD → AD +CB

In this reaction, A and C are positively-charged cations, while B and D are negatively-charged anions. Double-
replacement reactions generally occur between substances in aqueous solution. In order for a reaction to occur, one
of the products is usually a solid precipitate, a gas, or a molecular compound such as water.

550

www.ck12.org

Formation of a Precipitate

Chapter 11. Chemical Reactions

A precipitate forms in a double-replacement reaction when the cations from one of the reactants combine with the
anions from the other reactant to form an insoluble ionic compound. When aqueous solutions of potassium iodide
and lead(II) nitrate are mixed, the following reaction occurs.

2KI(aq) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) → 2KNO3(aq) + PbI2(s)

There are very strong attractive forces that occur between Pb2+ and I− ions and the result is a brilliant yellow
precipitate (see Figure 11.9). The other product of the reaction, potassium nitrate, remains soluble.

FIGURE 11.9
Formation of lead iodide precipitate.

Formation of a Gas

Some double-replacement reactions produce a gaseous product which then bubbles out of the solution and escapes
into the air. When solutions of sodium sulﬁde and hydrochloric acid are mixed, the products of the reaction are
aqueous sodium chloride and hydrogen sulﬁde gas.

Na2S(aq) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + H2S(g)

Formation of a Molecular Compound

Another kind of double-replacement reaction is one that produces a molecular compound as one of its products.
Many examples in this category are reactions that produce water. When aqueous hydrochloric acid is reacted with
aqueous sodium hydroxide, the products are aqueous sodium chloride and water.

HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)

Sample Problem: Double-Replacement Reactions

Write a complete and balanced chemical equation for the following double-replacement reactions. One product is
indicated as a guide.

551

11.9. Double-Replacement Reactions

www.ck12.org

A. NaCN(aq) + HBr(aq) → (hydrogen cyanide gas is formed)
B. (NH4)2SO4(aq) + Ba(NO3)2(aq) → (a precipitate of barium sulfate forms)
Step 1: Plan the problem
In A, the production of a gas drives the reaction. In B, the production of a precipitate drives the reaction. In both
cases, use the ionic charges of both reactants to construct the correct formulas of the products.
Step 2: Solve
A. The cations of both reactants are +1 charged ions, while the anions are -1 charged ions. After exchanging partners,
the balanced equation is:

NaCN(aq) + HBr(aq) → NaBr(aq) + HCN(g)

B. Ammonium ion and nitrate ion are 1+ and 1− respectively, while barium and sulfate are 2+ and 2−. This must
be taken into account when exchanging partners and writing the new formulas. Then, the equation is balanced.

(NH4)2SO4(aq) + Ba(NO3)2(aq) → 2NH4NO3(aq) + BaSO4(s)

Step 3: Think about your result
Both are double-replacement reactions. All formulas are correct and the equations are balanced. Occasionally, a
reaction will produce both a gas and a molecular compound. The reaction of a sodium carbonate solution with
hydrochloric acid produces aqueous sodium chloride, carbon dioxide gas, and water.

Na2CO3(aq) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)

Chapter 12. Stoichiometry

12.1 Everyday Stoichiometry

• Deﬁne stoichiometry.
• Describe everyday applications of the concept of stoichiometry.

How much equipment do you need for an experiment?
You are in charge of setting out the lab equipment for a chemistry experiment. If you have twenty students in the lab
(and they will be working in teams of two) and the experiment calls for three beakers and two test tubes, how much
glassware do you need to set out? Figuring this out involves a type of balanced equation and the sort of calculations
you would do for a chemical reaction.

Everyday Stoichiometry

You have learned about chemical equations and the techniques used in order to balance them. Chemists use balanced
equations to allow them to manipulate chemical reactions in a quantitative manner. Before we look at a chemical
reaction, let’s consider the equation for the ideal ham sandwich.
Our ham sandwich is composed of 2 slices of ham (H), a slice of cheese (C), a slice of tomato (T), 5 pickles (P), and
2 slices of bread (B). The equation for our sandwich is shown below:

2H + C + T + 5P + 2B → H2CTP5B2

555

12.1. Everyday Stoichiometry

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 12.1
The ideal ham sandwich.

Now let us suppose that you are having some friends over and need to make ﬁve ham sandwiches. How much of
each sandwich ingredient do you need? You would take the number of each ingredient required for one sandwich (its
coefﬁcient in the above equation) and multiply by ﬁve. Using ham and cheese as examples and using a conversion
factor, we can write:

5H2CTP5B2 ×
5H2CTP5B2 ×

2 H

1 H2CTP5B2

1 C

1 H2CTP5B2

= 10 H

= 5 C

The conversion factors contain the coefﬁcient of each speciﬁc ingredient as the numerator and the formula of on
sandwich as the denominator. The result is what you would expect. In order to make ﬁve ham sandwiches, you
would need 10 slices of ham and 5 slices of cheese.
This type of calculation demonstrates the use of stoichiometry. Stoichiometry is the calculation of the amount of
substances in a chemical reaction from the balanced equation. The sample problem below is another stoichiometry
problem involving ingredients of the ideal ham sandwich.

Sample Problem: Ham Sandwich Stoichiometry

Kim looks in the refrigerator and ﬁnds that she has 8 slices of ham. In order to make as many sandwiches as possible,
how many pickles does she need? Use the equation above.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• have 8 ham slices (H)
• 2 H = 5 P (conversion factor)

Unknown

• How many pickles (P) needed?

556

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Stoichiometry

The coefﬁcients for the two reactants (ingredients) are used to make a conversion factor between ham slices and
pickles.
Step 2: Solve.

8 H× 5 P

2 H = 20 P

Since 5 pickles combine with 2 ham slices in each sandwich, 20 pickles are needed to fully combine with 8 ham
slices.
Step 3: Think about your result.
The 8 ham slices will make 4 ham sandwiches. With 5 pickles per sandwich, the 20 pickles are used in the 4
sandwiches.

12.2 Mole Ratios

• Deﬁne mole ratio.
• Use mole ratios to determine amounts of materials involved in a reaction.

What does this porch need?
You want to add some sections to the porch seen above. Before you go to the hardware store to buy lumber, you
need to determine the unit composition (the material between two large uprights). You count how many posts, how
many boards, how many rails –then you decide how many sections you want to add before you calculate the amount
of building material needed for your porch expansion.

Mole Ratios

Stoichiometry problems can be characterized by two things: (1) the information given in the problem, and (2) the
information that is to be solved for, referred to as the unknown. The given and the unknown may both be reactants,
both be products, or one may be a reactant while the other is a product. The amounts of the substances can be
expressed in moles. However, in a laboratory situation, it is common to determine the amount of a substance by
ﬁnding its mass in grams. The amount of a gaseous substance may be expressed by its volume. In this concept, we
will focus on the type of problem where both the given and the unknown quantities are expressed in moles.
Chemical equations express the amounts of reactants and products in a reaction. The coefﬁcients of a balanced
equation can represent either the number of molecules or the number of moles of each substance. The production of
ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen and hydrogen gases is an important industrial reaction called the Haber process, after
German chemist Fritz Haber.

Chapter 12. Stoichiometry

FIGURE 12.2
Mole ratio relationship.

N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g)

The balanced equation can be analyzed in several ways, as shown in the Figure 12.3.

FIGURE 12.3
This representation of the production of
ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen
show several ways to interpret the quanti-
tative information of a chemical reaction.

We see that 1 molecule of nitrogen reacts with 3 molecules of nitrogen to form 2 molecules of ammonia. This is the
smallest possible relative amounts of the reactants and products. To consider larger relative amounts, each coefﬁcient
can be multiplied by the same number. For example, 10 molecules of nitrogen would react with 30 molecules of
hydrogen to produce 20 molecules of ammonia.
The most useful quantity for counting particles is the mole. So if each coefﬁcient is multiplied by a mole, the
balanced chemical equation tells us that 1 mole of nitrogen reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen to produce 2 moles of
ammonia. This is the conventional way to interpret any balanced chemical equation.
Finally, if each mole quantity is converted to grams by using the molar mass, we can see that the law of conservation
of mass is followed. 1 mol of nitrogen has a mass of 28.02 g, while 3 mol of hydrogen has a mass of 6.06 g, and 2
mol of ammonia has a mass of 34.08 g.

28.02 g N2 + 6.06 g H2 → 34.08 g NH3

Mass and the number of atoms must be conserved in any chemical reaction. The number of molecules is not
necessarily conserved.
A mole ratio is a conversion factor that relates the amounts in moles of any two substances in a chemical reaction.
The numbers in a conversion factor come from the coefﬁcients of the balanced chemical equation. The following
six mole ratios can be written for the ammonia forming reaction above.

In a mole ratio problem, the given substance, expressed in moles, is written ﬁrst. The appropriate conversion factor
is chosen in order to convert from moles of the given substance to moles of the unknown.

Sample Problem: Mole Ratio

How many moles of ammonia are produced if 4.20 moles of hydrogen are reacted with an excess of nitrogen?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• given: H2 = 4.20 mol

Unknown

• mol of NH3

The conversion is from mol H2 → NH3. The problem states that there is an excess of nitrogen, so we do not need to
be concerned with any mole ratio involving N2. Choose the conversion factor that has the NH3 in the numerator and
the H2 in the denominator.
Step 2: Solve.

560

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Stoichiometry

4.20 mol H2 × 2 mol NH3
3 mol H2

= 2.80 mol NH3

The reaction of 4.20 mol of hydrogen with excess nitrogen produces 2.80 mol of ammonia.
Step 3: Think about your result.
The result corresponds to the 3:2 ratio of hydrogen to ammonia from the balanced equation.

Summary

• Mole ratios allow comparison of the amounts of any two materials in a balanced equation.
• Calculations can be made to predict how much product can be obtained from a given number of moles of

reactant.

Need nails?
When you are doing a large construction project, you have a good idea of how many nails you will need (lots!).
When you go to the hardware store, you don’t want to sit there and count out several hundred nails. You can buy
nails by weight, so you determine how many nails are in a pound, calculate how many pounds you need, and you’re
on your way to begin building.
While the mole ratio is ever-present in all stoichiometry calculations, amounts of substances in the laboratory are
most often measured by mass. Therefore, we need to use mole-mass calculations in combination with mole ratios to
solve several different types of mass-based stoichiometry problems.

Mass to Moles Problems

In this type of problem, the mass of one substance is given, usually in grams. From this, you are to determine the
amount in moles of another substance that will either react with or be produced from the given substance.

mass of given → moles of given → moles of unknown

The mass of the given substance is converted into moles by use of the molar mass of that substance from the periodic
table. Then, the moles of the given substance are converted into moles of the unknown by using the mole ratio from
the balanced chemical equation.

Sample Problem: Mass-Mole Stoichiometry

Tin metal reacts with hydrogen ﬂuoride to produce tin(II) ﬂuoride and hydrogen gas according to the following
balanced equation.

Sn(s) + 2HF(g) → SnF2(s) + H2(g)

How many moles of hydrogen ﬂuoride are required to react completely with 75.0 g of tin?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• given: 75.0 g Sn
• molar mass of Sn = 118.69 g/mol
• 1 mol Sn = 2 mol HF (mole ratio)

Unknown

• mol HF

Use the molar mass of Sn to convert the grams of Sn to moles. Then use the mole ratio to convert from mol Sn to
mol HF. This will be done in a single two-step calculation.
g Sn → mol Sn → mol HF
Step 2: Solve.

75.0 g Sn× 1 mol Sn
118.69 g Sn

× 2 mol HF
1 mol Sn

= 1.26 mol HF

Step 3: Think about your result.
The mass of tin is less than one mole, but the 1:2 ratio means that more than one mole of HF is required for the
reaction. The answer has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures because the given mass has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Moles to Mass Problems

In this type of problem, the amount of one substance is given in moles. From this, you are to determine the mass of
another substance that will either react with or be produced from the given substance.

moles of given → moles of unknown → mass of unknown

The moles of the given substance are ﬁrst converted into moles of the unknown by using the mole ratio from the
balanced chemical equation. Then, the moles of the unknown are converted into mass in grams by use of the molar
mass of that substance from the periodic table.

What mass of oxygen gas is consumed in a reaction that produces 4.60 mol SO2?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.

• 2 mol SO2 = 3 mol O2 (mole ratio)
• molar mass of O2 = 32.00 g/mol

Unknown

• mass O2 = ? g

Use the mole ratio to convert from mol SO2 to mol O2. Then convert mol O2 to grams. This will be done in a single
two-step calculation.
mol SO2 → mol O2 → g O2
Step 2: Solve.

4.60 mol SO2 × 3 mol O2
2 mol SO2

× 32.00 g O2
1 mol O2

= 221 g O2

Step 3: Think about your result.
According to the mole ratio, 6.90 mol O2 is produced with a mass of 221 g. The answer has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures
because the given number of moles has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

walnuts in shells do I need to buy? To ﬁgure this out, I need to know how much the shell of a walnut weighs (about

Mass to Mass Problems

Mass-mass calculations are the most practical of all mass-based stoichiometry problems. Moles cannot be measured
directly, while the mass of any substance can generally be easily measured in the lab. This type of problem is three
steps and is a combination of the two previous types.

mass of given → moles of given → moles of unknown → mass of unknown

The mass of the given substance is converted into moles by use of the molar mass of that substance from the periodic

the balanced chemical equation. Finally, the moles of the unknown are converted to mass by use of its molar mass.

How much propane is left in the tank?
As the weather gets warmer, more and more people want to cook out on the back deck or back yard. Many folks
still use charcoal for grilling because of the added ﬂavor. But increasing numbers of back yard cooks like to use a
propane grill. The gas burns clean, the grill is ready to go as soon as the ﬂame is lit –but how do you know how
much propane is left in the tank? You can buy gauges at hardware stores that measure gas pressure and tell you how
much is left in the tank.

Volume-Volume Stoichiometry

Avogadro’s hypothesis states that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same
number of gas particles. Further, one mole of any gas at standard temperature and pressure (0°C and 1 atm) occupies
a volume of 22.4 L. These characteristics make stoichiometry problems involving gases at STP very straightforward.
Consider the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen cases to form nitrogen dioxide.

Chapter 12. Stoichiometry

Because of Avogadro’s work, we know that the mole ratios between substances in a gas-phase reaction are also
volume ratios. The six possible volume ratios for the above equation are:

1.
2.
3.

1 volume N2
2 volumes O2
1 volume N2
2 volumes NO2

or
or
or

2 volumes O2
1 volume N2
2 volumes NO2
1 volume N2
2 volumes NO2
2 volumes O2

The volume ratios above can easily be used when the volume of one gas in a reaction is known and you need to
determine the volume of another gas that will either react with or be produced from the ﬁrst gas. The pressure and
temperature conditions of both gases need to be the same.

Sample Problem: Volume-Volume Stoichiometry

The combustion of propane gas produces carbon dioxide and water vapor.

C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) → 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g)

What volume of oxygen is required to completely combust 0.650 L of propane? What volume of carbon dioxide is
produced in the reaction?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• given: 0.650 L C3H8
• 1 volume C3H8 = 5 volumes O2
• 1 volume C3H8 = 3 volumes CO2

Unknown

• volume O2 = ? L
• volume CO2 = ? L

Two separate calculations can be done using the volume ratios.
Step 2: Solve.

0.650 L C3H8 × 5 L O2
1 L C3H8
0.650 L C3H8 × 3 L CO2
1 L C3H8

= 3.25 L O2

= 1.95 L CO2

Step 3: Think about your result.
Because the coefﬁcients of the O2 and the CO2 are larger than that of the C3H8, the volumes for those two gases
are greater. Note that total volume is not necessarily conserved in a reaction because moles are not necessarily
conserved. In this reaction, 6 total volumes of reactants become 7 total volumes of products.

Summary

• Calculations of volume-volume ratios are based on Avogadro’s hypothesis.
• Pressures and temperatures of the gases involved need to be the same.

How much azide is needed to ﬁll an air bag?
Cars and many other vehicles have air bags in them. In case of a collision, a reaction is triggered so that the rapid
decomposition of sodium azide produces nitrogen gas, ﬁlling the air bag. If too little sodium azide is used, the air
bag will not ﬁll completely and will not protect the person in the vehicle. Too much sodium azide could cause the
formation of more gas that the bag can safely handle. If the bag breaks from the excess gas pressure, all protection
is lost.

Mass to Volume and Volume to Mass Problems

Chemical reactions frequently involve both solid substances whose mass can be measured as well as gases for which
measuring the volume is more appropriate. Stoichiometry problems of this type are called either mass-volume or
volume-mass problems.

mass of given → moles of given → moles of unknown → volume of unknown
volume of given → moles of given → moles of unknown → mass of unknown

Because both types of problems involve a conversion from either moles of gas to volume or vice-versa, we can use
the molar volume of 22.4 L/mol provided that the conditions for the reaction are STP.

The volume result is in liters. For much smaller amounts, it may be convenient to convert to milliliters. The answer
here has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Because the molar volume is a measured quantity of 22.4 L/mol, three is the
maximum number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures for this type of problem.

Don’t you hate running out of cooking ingredients?
Cooking is a great example of everyday chemistry. In order to correctly follow a recipe, a cook needs to make sure
that he has plenty of all the necessary ingredients in order to make his dish. Let us suppose that you are deciding to
make some pancakes for a large group of people. The recipe on the box indicates that the following ingredients are
needed for each batch of pancakes:

1 cup of pancake mix
3
4 cup milk
1 egg
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Now you check the pantry and the refrigerator and see that you have the following ingredients available:

2 boxes of pancake mix (8 cups)
Half gallon of milk (4 cups)
2 eggs
Full bottle of vegetable oil (about 3 cups)

The question that you must ask is: How many batches of pancakes can I make? The answer is two. Even though
you have enough pancake mix, milk, and oil to make many more batches of pancakes, you are limited by the fact
that you only have two eggs. As soon as you have made two batches of pancakes, you will be out of eggs and your
“reaction” will be complete.

Limiting Reactant

Chapter 12. Stoichiometry

For a chemist, the balanced chemical equation is the recipe that must be followed. As you have seen earlier, the
Haber process is a reaction in which nitrogen gas is combined with hydrogen gas to form ammonia. The balanced
equation is shown below.

N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g)

We know that the coefﬁcients of the balanced equation tell us the mole ratio that is required for this reaction to occur.
One mole of N2 will react with three moles of H2 to form two moles of NH3.
Now let us suppose that a chemist were to react three moles of N2 with six moles of H2 (see Figure 12.5).

FIGURE 12.5
Reaction in presence of limiting reagent.

So what happened in this reaction? The chemist started with 3 moles of N2. You may think of this as being 3 times
as much as the “recipe” (the balanced equation) requires since the coefﬁcient for the N2 is a 1. However, the 6 moles
of H2 that the chemist started with is only two times as much as the “recipe” requires, since the coefﬁcient for the
H2 is a 3 and 3 × 2 = 6. So the hydrogen gas will be completely used up while there will be 1 mole of nitrogen gas
left over after the reaction is complete. Finally, the reaction will produce 4 moles of NH3 because that is also two
times as much as shown in the balanced equation. The overall reaction that occurred in words:

2 mol N2 + 6 mol H2 → 4 mol NH3

All the amounts are doubled from the original balanced equation.
The limiting reactant (or limiting reagent) is the reactant that determines the amount of product that can be formed
in a chemical reaction. The reaction proceeds until the limiting reactant is completely used up. In our example above,
the H2 is the limiting reactant. The excess reactant (or excess reagent) is the reactant that is initially present in
a greater amount than will eventually be reacted. In other words, there is always excess reactant left over after the
reaction is complete. In the above example, the N2 is the excess reactant.

Summary

• The amount of limiting reactant determines how much product will be formed in a chemical reaction.

In the real world, amounts of reactants and products are typically measured by mass or by volume. It is ﬁrst necessary
to convert the given quantities of each reactant to moles in order to identify the limiting reactant.

Sample Problem: Determining the Limiting Reactant

Silver metal reacts with sulfur to form silver sulﬁde according to the following balanced equation:

2Ag(s) + S(s) → Ag2S(s)

What is the limiting reactant when 50.0 g Ag is reacted with 10.0 g S?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• given: 50.0 g Ag

12.8. Determining the Limiting Reactant

www.ck12.org

• given: 10.0 g S

Unknown

• limiting reactant

Use the atomic masses of Ag and S to determine the number of moles of each present. Then, use the balanced
equation to calculate the number of moles of sulfur that would be needed to react with the number of moles of silver
present. Compare this result to the actual number of moles of sulfur present.
Step 2: Solve.
First, calculate the number of moles of Ag and S present:

50.0 g Ag× 1 mol Ag
107.87 g Ag
10.0 g S× 1 mol S
32.07 g S

= 0.464 mol Ag

= 0.312 mol S

Second, ﬁnd the moles of S that would be required to react with all of the given Ag:

0.464 mol Ag× 1 mol S
2 mol Ag

= 0.232 mol S (required)

The amount of S actually present is 0.312 moles. The amount of S that is required to fully react with all of the Ag
is 0.232 moles. Since there is more sulfur present than what is required to react, the sulfur is the excess reactant.
Therefore, silver is the limiting reactant.
Step 3: Think about your result.
The balanced equation indicates that the necessary mole ratio of Ag to S is 2:1. Since there were not twice as many
moles of Ag present in the original amounts, that makes silver the limiting reactant.
There is a very important point to consider about the preceding problem. Even though the mass of silver present in
the reaction (50.0 g) was greater than the mass of sulfur (10.0 g), silver was the limiting reactant. This is because
chemists must always convert to molar quantities and consider the mole ratio from the balanced chemical equation.
There is one other thing that we would like to be able to determine in a limiting reactant problem - the quantity of
the excess reactant that will be left over after the reaction is complete. We will go back to the sample problem above
to answer this question.

Subtract the amount (in moles) of the excess reactant that will react from the amount that is originally present.
Convert moles to grams.
Step 2: Solve.

0.312 mol S− 0.232 mol S = 0.080 mol S (remaining after reaction)
0.080 mol S× 32.07 g S
1 mol S

= 2.57 g S

There are 2.57 g of sulfur remaining when the reaction is complete.
Step 3: Think about your result.
There were 10.0 g of sulfur present before the reaction began. If 2.57 g of sulfur remains after the reaction, then
7.43 g S reacted.

7.43 g S× 1 mol S
32.07 g S

= 0.232 mol S

This is the amount of sulfur that reacted. The problem is internally consistent.

Can we save some money?
The world of pharmaceutical production is an expensive one. Many drugs have several steps in their synthesis and
use costly chemicals. A great deal of research takes place to develop better ways to make drugs faster and more
efﬁciently. Studying how much of a compound is produced in any given reaction is an important part of cost control.

Percent Yield

Chemical reactions in the real world don’t always go exactly as planned on paper. In the course of an experiment,
many things will contribute to the formation of less product than would be predicted. Besides spills and other
experimental errors, there are usually losses due to an incomplete reaction, undesirable side reactions, etc. Chemists
need a measurement that indicates how successful a reaction has been. This measurement is called the percent yield.
To compute the percent yield, it is ﬁrst necessary to determine how much of the product should be formed based on
stoichiometry. This is called the theoretical yield, the maximum amount of product that could be formed from the
given amounts of reactants. The actual yield is the amount of product that is actually formed when the reaction is

Chapter 12. Stoichiometry

carried out in the laboratory. The percent yield is the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield, expressed as a
percentage.

Percent Yield =

Actual Yield

Theoretical Yield

× 100%

Percent yield is very important in the manufacture of products. Much time and money is spent improving the percent
yield for chemical production. When complex chemicals are synthesized by many different reactions, one step with
a low percent yield can quickly cause a large waste of reactants and unnecessary expense.
Typically, percent yields are understandably less than 100% because of the reasons indicated earlier. However,
percent yields greater than 100% are possible if the measured product of the reaction contains impurities that cause
its mass to be greater than it actually would be if the product was pure. When a chemist synthesizes a desired
chemical, he or she is always careful to purify the products of the reaction.

Sample Problem: Calculating the Theoretical Yield and the Percent Yield

Potassium chlorate decomposes upon slight heating in the presence of a catalyst according to the reaction below:

2KClO3(s) → 2KCl(s) + 3O2(g)

In a certain experiment, 40.0 g KClO3 is heated until it completely decomposes. What is the theoretical yield of
oxygen gas? The experiment is performed and the oxygen gas is collected and its mass is found to be 14.9 g. What
is the percent yield for the reaction?
Part 12.11A: First, we will calculate the theoretical yield based on the stoichiometry.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• given: mass of KClO3 = 40.0 g
• molar mass KClO3 = 122.55 g/mol
• molar mass O2 = 32.00 g/mol

Unknown

• theoretical yield O2 = ? g

Apply stoichiometry to convert from the mass of a reactant to the mass of a product:

g KClO3 → mol KClO3 → mol O2 → g O2

Step 2: Solve.

40.0 g KClO3 × 1 mol KClO3
122.55 g KClO3

× 3 mol O2
2 mol KClO3

× 32.00 g O2
1 mol O2

= 15.7 g O2

The theoretical yield of O2 is 15.7 g.

581

12.9. Theoretical Yield and Percent Yield

www.ck12.org

Step 3: Think about your result.
The mass of oxygen gas must be less than the 40.0 g of potassium chlorate that was decomposed.
Part 12.11B: Now we use the actual yield and the theoretical yield to calculate the percent yield.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• Actual yield = 14.9 g
• Theoretical yield = 15.7 g (from Part 12.11A)

Unknown

• Percent yield = ? %

Percent Yield =

Actual Yield

Theoretical Yield

× 100%

Use the percent yield equation above.
Step 2: Solve.

Percent Yield =

14.9 g
15.7 g

× 100 = 94.9%

Step 3: Think about your result.
Since the actual yield is slightly less than the theoretical yield, the percent yield is just under 100%.

Summary

• Theoretical yield is calculated based on the stoichiometry of the chemical equation.
• The actual yield is experimentally determined.
• The percent yield is determined by calculating the ratio of actual yield/theoretical yield.

13.1 Kinetic-Molecular Theory

• List the points of the kinetic-molecular-theory.

Approximately 20% of the atmosphere is oxygen. This gas is essential for life. In environments where oxygen is
in low supply, it can be provided from a tank. Since gases are very compressible, a large amount of oxygen can be
stored in a relatively small container. When it is released, the volume expands and the pressure decreases. The gas
is then available for breathing under normal pressure.

The Kinetic-Molecular Theory

The kinetic-molecular theory is a theory that explains the states of matter and is based on the idea that matter is
composed of tiny particles that are always in motion. The theory helps explain observable properties and behaviors
of solids, liquids, and gases. However, the theory is most easily understood as it applies to gases and it is with gases
that we will begin our detailed study. The theory applies speciﬁcally to a model of a gas called an ideal gas. An
ideal gas is an imaginary gas whose behavior perfectly ﬁts all the assumptions of the kinetic-molecular theory. In
reality, gases are not ideal, but are very close to being so under most everyday conditions.
The kinetic-molecular theory as it applies to gases has ﬁve basic assumptions.

1. Gases consist of very large numbers of tiny spherical particles that are far apart from one another
compared to their size. The particles of a gas may be either atoms or molecules. The distance between the
particles of a gas is much, much greater than the distances between the particles of a liquid or a solid. Most of
the volume of a gas, therefore, is composed of the empty space between the particles. In fact, the volume of
the particles themselves is considered to be insigniﬁcant compared to the volume of the empty space.

585

13.1. Kinetic-Molecular Theory

www.ck12.org

2. Gas particles are in constant rapid motion in random directions. The fast motion of gas particles gives
them a relatively large amount of kinetic energy. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy that an object
possesses because of its motion. The particles of a gas move in straight-line motion until they collide with
another particle or with one of the walls of its container.

3. Collisions between gas particles and between particles and the container walls are elastic collisions. An
elastic collision is one in which there is no overall loss of kinetic energy. Kinetic energy may be transferred
from one particle to another during an elastic collision, but there is no change in the total energy of the
colliding particles.

4. There are no forces of attraction or repulsion between gas particles. Attractive forces are responsible for
particles of a real gas condensing together to form a liquid. It is assumed that the particles of an ideal gas have
no such attractive forces. The motion of each particle is completely independent of the motion of all other
particles.

5. The average kinetic energy of gas particles is dependent upon the temperature of the gas. As the
temperature of a sample of gas is increased, the speeds of the particles are increased. This results in an
increase in the kinetic energy of the particles. Not all particles of gas in a sample have the same speed and
so they do not have the same kinetic energy. The temperature of a gas is proportional to the average kinetic
energy of the gas particles.

FIGURE 13.1
Gas particles are in random straight-line motion according to the kinetic-
molecular theory. The space between particles is very large compared to
the particle size.

Summary

• Assumptions of the kinetic-molecular theory:

– Gases consist of very large numbers of tiny spherical particles that are far apart from one another

compared to their size.

– Gas particles are in constant rapid motion in random directions.
– Collisions between gas particles and between particles and the container walls are elastic collisions.
– There are no forces of attraction or repulsion between gas particles.
– The average kinetic energy of gas particles is dependent upon the temperature of the gas.

13.2 Gas Pressure

• Deﬁne gas pressure.

How are hot air balloons able to move smoothly in the air?

Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons. Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals. Others
race in competitions. Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning
of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is ﬂat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When
the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes
up. After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the ﬂight is ready to take off.

Gas Pressure

Pressure is deﬁned as the force per unit area on a surface.

Pressure =

force
area

When a person stands on the ﬂoor, his feet exert pressure on the surface. That pressure is related to both the mass of
the person and the surface area of his feet. If the person were holding a heavy object, the pressure would increase
because of a greater force. Alternatively, if the person stands on his toes, the pressure also increases because of a
decrease in the surface area.
Gas molecules also exert pressure. Earth’s atmosphere exerts pressure because gravity acts on the huge number of
gas particles contained in the atmosphere, holding it in place. Pressure is also exerted by a small sample of gas, such
as that which is contained in a balloon. Gas pressure is the pressure that results from collisions of gas particles with

588

www.ck12.org

Chapter 13. States of Matter

an object. Inside the balloon, the gas particles collide with the balloon’s inner walls. It is those collisions which
keep the balloon inﬂated. If the gas particles were to suddenly stop moving, the balloon would instantly deﬂate. The
Figure 13.2 is an illustration of gas particles exerting pressure inside a container.

FIGURE 13.2
Collision of gas particles with container wall.

The pressure inside the hot air balloon is affected by temperature. As the molecules heat up, they move faster and
strike the inside wall of the balloon harder. This increased motion of the gas particles increases the force on an area
of the balloon, producing a rise in the pressure.

• Describe how atmospheric pressure changes with elevation above sea level.
• Describe the use of a barometer.

What do storm reports inform people of?

The pressure in the atmosphere is an important factor in determining what the weather will be like. If the barometric
pressure is high in an area, this will cause air to move to a region of lower pressure. The greater the difference
in pressure between the two areas, the stronger the winds will develop. Under certain conditions, the winds can
produce a tornado (a violent rotating column of air that reaches from a thunderstorm down to the ground).

Atmospheric Pressure

Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by gas particles in Earth’s atmosphere as those particles collide with
objects. A barometer is an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure. A traditional mercury barometer
consists of an evacuated tube immersed in a container of mercury. Air molecules push down on the surface of the
mercury. Because the inside of the tube is a vacuum, the mercury rises inside the tube. The height to which the
mercury rises is dependent on the external air pressure.
A more convenient barometer, called an aneroid barometer, measures pressure by the expansion and contraction
of a small spring within an evacuated metal capsule.

(A) A barometer measures atmospheric
pressure as the height of a column of
mercury. (B) A modern aneroid barometer
in the form of a dial
is used by meteo-
rologists to help them predict upcoming
weather.

Atmospheric Pressure and Altitude

At sea level, a mercury column will rise a distance of 760 mm. This atmospheric pressure is reported as 760
mmHg (millimeters of mercury). At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is decreased and so the column of
mercury will not rise as high. On the summit of Mt. Everest (elevation of 8848 m), the air pressure is 253 mmHg.
Atmospheric pressure is slightly dependent on weather conditions. From the graph we can see the decrease in
atmospheric pressure as the altitude increases. At sea level, the atmospheric pressure would be a little over 100 kPa
(one atmosphere or 760 mm Hg). If we climb to the top of Mount Everest (the highest mountain in the world at
29,029 feet or 8848 meters), the atmospheric pressure will drop to slightly over 30 kPa (about 0.30 atmospheres or
228 mm Hg). This marked decrease in atmospheric pressure results in much lower levels of oxygen. Teams that
climb this mountain must bring supplies of oxygen with them in order to breathe at these high altitudes.

13.4 Pressure Units and Conversions

• Be able to convert between different units of pressure.

There are several beneﬁts to maintaining the proper air pressure in a car tire. The ride is smoother and safer than with
lowered pressure. The car gets better gas mileage and the tires don’t wear out as fast. The recommended pressure
for that model of car (usually somewhere between 32-35 psi) is usually listed in the owner’s manual or stamped
somewhere inside the door. The pressure on the tire is the maximum pressure for that tire, not the recommended
one. Tire pressure is best measured when the tire is cold since driving the car for a while will heat up the air in the
tire and increase the pressure.

Pressure Units and Conversion

A barometer measures gas pressure by the height of the column of mercury. One unit of gas pressure is the millimeter
of mercury (mmHg). An equivalent unit to the mmHg is called the torr, in honor of the inventor of the barometer,
Evangelista Torricelli. The pascal (Pa) is the standard unit of pressure. A pascal is a very small amount of pressure,
so the more useful unit for everyday gas pressures is the kilopascal (kPa). A kilopascal is equal to 1000 pascals.
Another commonly used unit of pressure is the atmosphere (atm). Standard atmospheric pressure is called 1 atm of
pressure and is equal to 760 mmHg and 101.3 kPa. Atmospheric pressure is also often stated as pounds/square inch
(psi). The atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 psi.

1 atm = 760 mmHg = 760 torr = 101.3 KPa = 14.7 psi

It is important to be able to convert between different units of pressure. To do so, we will use the equivalent standard
pressures shown above.

Sample Problem: Pressure Unit Conversions

The atmospheric pressure in a mountainous location is measured to be 613 mmHg. What is this pressure in atm and
in kPa?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• given: 613 mmHg
• 1 atm = 760 mmHg
• 101.3 kPa = 760 mmHg

Unknown

• pressure = ? atm
• pressure = ? kPa

Use conversion factors from the equivalent pressure units to convert from mmHg to atm and from mmHg to kPa.
Step 2: Solve.

613 mmHg× 1 atm
760 mmHg
613 mmHg× 101.3 kPa
760 mmHg

= 0.807 atm

= 81.7 kPa

Step 3: Think about your result.
The air pressure is about 80% that of standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. For signiﬁcant ﬁgure purposes, the
standard pressure of 760 mmHg has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

13.5 Average Kinetic Energy

• Deﬁne kinetic energy.
• Describe how temperature inﬂuences kinetic energy of particles.
• Deﬁne aboslute zero.

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Any object that is moving possesses kinetic energy. Baseball involves a
great deal of kinetic energy. The pitcher throws a ball, imparting kinetic energy to the ball. When the batter swings,
the motion of swinging creates kinetic energy in the bat. The collision of the bat with the ball changes the direction
and speed of the ball, with the idea of kinetic energy being involved again.

Kinetic Energy and Temperature

As stated in the kinetic-molecular theory, the temperature of a substance is related to the average kinetic energy
of the particles of that substance. When a substance is heated, some of the absorbed energy is stored within the
particles, while some of the energy increases the motion of the particles. This is registered as an increase in the
temperature of the substance.

Average Kinetic Energy

Chapter 13. States of Matter

At any given temperature, not all of the particles of a sample of matter have the same kinetic energy. Instead, the
particles display a wide range of kinetic energies. Most of the particles have a kinetic energy near the middle of the
range. However, a small number of particles have kinetic energies a great deal lower or a great deal higher than the
average (see Figure 13.5).

FIGURE 13.5
A distribution of molecular kinetic ener-
gies as a function of temperature. The
blue curve is for a low temperature, while
the red curve is for a high temperature.

The blue curve in the ﬁgure above is for a sample of matter at a relatively low temperature, while the red curve is
for a sample at a relatively high temperature. In both cases, most of the particles have intermediate kinetic energies,
close to the average. Notice that as temperature increases, the range of kinetic energies increases and the distribution
curve “ﬂattens out.” At a given temperature, the particles of any substance have the same average kinetic energy.

Absolute Zero

As a sample of matter is continually cooled, the average kinetic energy of its particles decreases. Eventually, one
would expect the particles to stop moving completely. Absolute zero is the temperature at which the motion of
particles theoretically ceases. Absolute zero has never been attained in the laboratory, but temperatures on the order
of 1 × 10−10 K have been achieved. The Kelvin temperature scale is the scale that is based on molecular motion
and so absolute zero is also called 0 K. The Kelvin temperature of a substance is directly proportional to the average
kinetic energy of the particles of the substance. For example, the particles in a sample of hydrogen gas at 200 K have
twice the average kinetic energy as the particles in a hydrogen sample at 100 K.

Summary

• Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.
• At a given temperature, individual particles of a substance have a range of kinetic energies.
• The motion of particles theoretically ceases at absolute zero.

Forces

Carbon is an interesting and versatile element. There are over twenty million known compounds containing carbon,
encompassed in the growing ﬁeld of organic chemistry. The element itself can exist in two major forms. Diamond
is a form of carbon that is extremely hard and is one of the few materials that can scratch glass. The other form
of carbon is graphite, a very soft material that we ﬁnd in “lead” pencils. The two forms differ mainly in how the
carbon atoms are connected to one another. The differences in the arrangement of atoms affect the properties of the
material.

Physical Properties and Intermolecular Forces

The physical state and properties of a particular compound depend in large part on the type of chemical bonding it
displays. Molecular compounds, sometimes called covalent compounds, display a wide range of physical properties
due to the different types of intermolecular attractions such as different kinds of polar interactions. The melting and
boiling points of molecular compounds are generally quite low compared to those of ionic compounds. This is
because the energy required to disrupt the intermolecular forces between molecules is far less than the energy
required to break the ionic bonds in a crystalline ionic compound. Since molecular compounds are composed of
neutral molecules, their electrical conductivity is generally quite poor, whether in the solid or liquid state. Ionic
compounds do not conduct electricity in the solid state because of their rigid structure, but conduct well when either

molten or dissolved into a solution. The water solubility of molecular compounds is variable and depends primarily
on the type of intermolecular forces involved. Substances that exhibit hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole forces are
generally water soluble, whereas those that exhibit only London dispersion forces are generally insoluble. Most, but
not all, ionic compounds are quite soluble in water. Table 13.1 summarizes some of the differences between ionic
and molecular compounds.

One type of molecular compound behaves quite differently than that described so far. A covalent network solid is a
compound in which all of the atoms are connected to one another by covalent bonds. Diamond is composed entirely
of carbon atoms, each bonded to four other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral geometry. Melting a covalent network
solid is not accomplished by overcoming the relatively weak intermolecular forces. Rather, all of the covalent bonds
must be broken, a process that requires extremely high temperatures. Diamond, in fact, does not melt at all. Instead,
it vaporizes to a gas at temperatures above 3500°C.

How is this insect able to stand on water?

The next time you are by a still body of water, take a close look at what is scooting along on the surface. You may
see insects seemingly ﬂoating on top of the water. These creatures are known by a variety of names including water
skaters, water striders, pond skaters, and other equally descriptive names. They take advantage of a property called
surface tension to stay above the water and not sink. The force they exert downward is less than the forces exerted
among the water molecules on the surface of the pond, so the insect does not penetrate beneath the surface of the
water.

Surface Tension

Molecules within a liquid are pulled equally in all directions by intermolecular forces. However, molecules at the
surface are pulled downwards and sideways by other liquid molecules, but not upwards away from the surface. The
overall effect is that the surface molecules are pulled into the liquid, creating a surface that is tightened like a ﬁlm
(see A in Figure 13.7). The surface tension of a liquid is a measure of the elastic force in the liquid’s surface.
Liquids that have strong intermolecular forces, like the hydrogen bonding in water, exhibit the greatest surface
tension. Surface tension allows objects that are denser than water, such as the paper clip shown in B in Figure 13.7,
to nonetheless ﬂoat on its surface. It is also responsible for the beading up of water droplets on a freshly waxed car
because there are no attractions between the polar water molecules and the nonpolar wax.

Other liquids, such as diethyl ether, do not demonstrate strong surface tension interactions. The intermolecular forces
for the ether are the relatively weak dipole-dipole interactions that do not draw the molecules together as tightly as
hydrogen bonds would.

13.8 Evaporation

• Deﬁne evaporation.
• Deﬁne condensation.
• Describe the effect of temperature on the rate of evaporation.

On the roof of the house in the picture above is a device known as a “swamp cooler.” This piece of equipment traces
its origin back to the ancient Egyptians who hung wet blankets across the doors of their homes. As the warm air
passed through the blankets, water would evaporate and cool the air. The royalty went one step further and had
servants fan wet cloths over jugs of water to get more evaporation and cooling.
The origin of the term “swamp cooler” is not known – they certainly don’t work in a swamp. Best conditions for
cooling include a high temperature (over 80◦F) and a low humidity (preferably less than 30%). These coolers work
well in desert areas, but don’t provide any cooling in the humid areas of the country.

Evaporation

A puddle of water left undisturbed eventually disappears. The liquid molecules escape into the gas phase, becoming
water vapor. Vaporization is the process in which a liquid is converted to a gas. Evaporation is the conversion of a
liquid to its vapor below the boiling temperature of the liquid. If the water is instead kept in a closed container, the
water vapor molecules do not have a chance to escape into the surroundings and so the water level does not change.
As some water molecules become vapor, an equal number of water vapor molecules condense back into the liquid
state. Condensation is the change of state from a gas to a liquid.

605

13.8. Evaporation

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 13.8
Evaporation (A) and condensation (B).

In order for a liquid molecule to escape into the gas state, the molecule must have enough kinetic energy to overcome
the intermolecular attractive forces in the liquid. Recall that a given liquid sample will have molecules with a wide
range of kinetic energies. Liquid molecules that have this certain threshold kinetic energy escape the surface and
become vapor. As a result, the liquid molecules that remain now have a lower average kinetic energy. As evaporation
occurs, the temperature of the remaining liquid decreases. You have observed the effects of evaporative cooling. On
a hot day, the water molecules in your perspiration absorb body heat and evaporate from the surface of your skin.
The evaporating process leaves the remaining perspiration cooler, which in turn absorbs more heat from your body.
A given liquid will evaporate more quickly when it is heated. This is because the heating process results in a greater
fraction of the liquid’s molecules having the necessary kinetic energy to escape the surface of the liquid. The Figure
13.9 shows the kinetic energy distribution of liquid molecules at two temperatures. The numbers of molecules
that have the required kinetic energy to evaporate are shown in the shaded area under the curve at the right. The
higher temperature liquid (T2) has more molecules that are capable of escaping into the vapor phase than the lower
temperature liquid (T1).

The motion of the duck illustrates a physical principle called vapor pressure. As the vapor pressure changes, the
liquid in the duck moves up and down, causing the duck to move.

Vapor Pressure

When a partially ﬁlled container of liquid is sealed with a stopper, some liquid molecules at the surface evaporate
into the vapor phase. However, the vapor molecules cannot escape from the container and so after a certain amount
of time, the space above the liquid reaches a point where it cannot hold any more vapor molecules. Now some of the
vapor molecules condense back into a liquid. The system reaches the point where the rate of evaporation is equal
to the rate of condensation (see Figure 13.10). This is called a dynamic equilibrium between the liquid and vapor
phases.

FIGURE 13.10
Equilibrium between liquid phase and vapor phase.

A dynamic equilibrium can be illustrated by an equation with a double arrow, meaning that the reaction is occurring
in both directions and at the same rate.

The forward direction represents the evaporation process, while the reverse direction represents the condensation
process.
Because they cannot escape the container, the vapor molecules above the surface of the liquid exert a pressure on the
walls of the container. The vapor pressure is a measure of the presure (force per unit area) exerted by a gas above
a liquid in a sealed container. Vapor pressure is a property of a liquid based on the strength of its intermolecular
forces. A liquid with weak intermolecular forces evaporates more easily and has a high vapor pressure. A liquid
with stronger intermolecular forces does not evaporate easily and thus has a lower vapor pressure. For example,
diethyl ether is a nonpolar liquid with weak dispersion forces. Its vapor pressure at 20°C is 58.96 kPa. Water is a
polar liquid whose molecules are attracted to one another by relatively strong hydrogen bonding. The vapor pressure
of water at 20°C is only 2.33 kPa, far less than that of diethyl ether.

Vapor Pressure and Temperature

Vapor pressure is dependent upon temperature. When the liquid in a closed container is heated, more molecules
escape the liquid phase and evaporate. The greater number of vapor molecules strike the container walls more
frequently, resulting in an increase in pressure. The Table 13.2 shows the temperature dependence of the vapor
pressure of three liquids.

water increases by 46.73 kPa, while it increases by 53.99 kPa in only a span of twenty degrees from 80°C to 100°C.

Summary

• Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container.
• Strong intermolecular forces produce a lower rate of evaporation and a lower vapor pressure.
• Weak intermolecular forces produce a higher rate of evaporation and a higher vapor pressure.
• As the temperature increases, the vapor pressure increases.

13.10 Boiling Point

• Deﬁne boiling point.
• Describe the effect of altitude on boiling point.

At 29,029 feet (8,848 m), Mount Everest in the Himalayan range on the border between China and Nepal is the
highest point on the earth. Its altitude presents many practical problems to climbers. The oxygen content of the
air is much lower than at sea level, making it necessary to bring oxygen tanks along (although a few climbers have
reached the peak without oxygen). One other problem is that of boiling water for cooking food. Although water
boils at 100◦C at sea level, the boiling point on top of Mount Everest is only about 70◦C. This difference makes it
very difﬁcult to get a decent cup of tea (which deﬁnitely frustrated some of the British climbers).

Boiling Point

As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more
and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when
the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize. At this point the liquid begins to
boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure.
The Figure 13.11 illustrates the boiling of liquid.
In the picture on the left, the liquid is below its boiling point, yet some of the liquid evaporates. On the right, the
temperature has been increased until bubbles begin to form in the body of the liquid. When the vapor pressure inside
the bubble is equal to the external atmospheric pressure, the bubbles rise to the surface of liquid and burst. The
temperature at which this process occurs is the boiling point of the liquid.
The normal boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to standard pressure.
Because atmospheric pressure can change based on location, the boiling point of a liquid changes with the external

13.11 Vapor Pressure Curves

One of the ﬁrst lessons in cooking is how to boil water. Yes, it sounds simple, but there are a couple of hints that
speed things up. One hint is to put a lid on the pot. The picture above has water boiling uncovered with the steam
escaping to the atmosphere. If the lid is on the pot, less water will be boiled off and the water will boil faster. The
buildup of pressure inside the pot helps speed up the boiling process.

Vapor Pressure Curves

The boiling points of various liquids can be illustrated in a vapor pressure curve ( Figure 13.13). A vapor pressure
curve is a graph of vapor pressure as a function of temperature. To ﬁnd the normal boiling point of a liquid, a
horizontal line is drawn from the left at a pressure equal to standard pressure. At whatever temperature that line
intersects the vapor pressure curve of a liquid is the boiling point of that liquid.
The boiling points of liquid also correlate to the strength of the intermolecular forces. Recall that diethyl ether has
weak dispersion forces, which meant that the liquid has a high vapor pressure. The weak forces also mean that it
does not require a large an input of energy to make diethyl ether boil and so it has a relatively low normal boiling
point of 34.6°C. Water, with its much stronger hydrogen bonding, has a low vapor pressure and a higher normal
boiling point of 100°C.
As stated earlier, boiling points are affected by external pressure. At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is
lower. With less pressure pushing down on the surface of the liquid, it boils at a lower temperature. This can also be
seen from the vapor pressure curves. If one draws a horizontal line at a lower vapor pressure, it intersects each curve
at a lower temperature. The boiling point of water is 100°C at sea level, where the atmospheric pressure is standard.
In Denver, Colorado at 1600 m above sea level, the atmospheric pressure is about 640 mmHg and water boils at
about 95°C. On the summit of Mt. Everest the atmospheric pressure is about 255 mmHg and water boils at only

70°C. On the other hand, water boils at greater than 100°C if the external pressure is higher than standard. Pressure
cookers do not allow the vapor to escape and the vapor pressure increases. Since water now boils at a temperature
above 100°C, the food cooks more quickly.

The effect of decreased air pressure can be demonstrated by placing a beaker of water in a vacuum chamber. At a
low enough pressure, about 20 mmHg, water will boil at room temperature.

• Describe the process of particle movement in melting.
• Describe the forces that inﬂuence the melting point of a material.

In the winter, many people ﬁnd the snow and ice beautiful. They enjoy getting out to ski or ice-skate. Others don’t
ﬁnd that time of year to be so much fun. When the snow melts, the roads get very sloppy and messy. Those people
look forward to spring when all the ice and snow are gone and the weather is warmer.

Melting Point

Solids are similar to liquids in that both are condensed states, with particles that are far closer together than those
of a gas. However, while liquids are ﬂuid, solids are not. The particles of most solids are packed tightly together in
an orderly arrangement. The motion of individual atoms, ions, or molecules in a solid is restricted to vibrational
motion about a ﬁxed point. Solids are almost completely incompressible and are the densest of the three states of
matter.
As a solid is heated, its particles vibrate more rapidly as the solid absorbs kinetic energy. Eventually, the organization
of the particles within the solid structure begins to break down and the solid starts to melt. The melting point is the
temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid. At its melting point, the disruptive vibrations of the particles of
the solid overcome the attractive forces operating within the solid. As with boiling points, the melting point of a solid
is dependent on the strength of those attractive forces. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound that consists of

617

13.12. Melting Point

www.ck12.org

a multitude of strong ionic bonds. Sodium chloride melts at 801°C. Ice (solid H2O) is a molecular compound whose
molecules are held together by hydrogen bonds. Though hydrogen bonds are the strongest of the intermolecular
forces, the strength of hydrogen bonds is much less than that of ionic bonds. The melting point of ice is 0°C.
The melting point of a solid is the same as the freezing point of the liquid. At that temperature, the solid and liquid
states of the substance are in equilibrium. For water, this equilibrium occurs at 0°C.

H2O(s) (cid:29) H2O(l)

We tend to think of solids as those materials that are solid at room temperature. However, all materials have melting
points of some sort. Gases become solids at extremely low temperatures, and liquids will also become solid if the
temperature is low enough. The Table 13.3 gives the melting points of some common materials.

How did the early settlers do their laundry in the winter?
Of course, they could wash the clothes inside, but where to dry them? There were no dryers available, so the
clothes had to be hung up to dry. In the winter, you would expect that ice would form on the clothes, but that didn’t
happen. Even in freezing weather, the water might freeze initially, but would eventually go off as a vapor –from
solid ice directly to the gas stage. There are still families today who have to rely on this cumbersome process to get
their laundry done.

Sublimation

Vapor Pressure of a Solid

"Sublimation" reviews the vapor pressure of a liquid and its dependence upon temperature. Solids also have a vapor
pressure, though it is generally much less than that of a liquid. A snow bank will gradually disappear even if the
temperature stays below 0°C. The snow does not melt, but instead passes directly from the solid state to the vapor
state. Sublimation is the change of state from a solid to a gas without passing through the liquid state.
"Dry ice," or solid carbon dioxide, is a substance that sublimes at atmospheric pressures. Dry ice is very cold
(−78°C) and so is used as a coolant for goods such as ice cream that must remain frozen during shipment. Because
the dry ice sublimes rather than melting, there is no liquid mess associated with its change of state as the dry
ice warms. As you may have seen in demonstrations, dry ice merely transforms from a solid to a cold, steamy
looking gas. Ferrocene (an iron-containing compound) is usually puriﬁed by sublimation by gentle warming at

The development of modern lasers has opened many doors to both research and applications. A laser beam was used
to measure the distance from the Earth to the moon. Lasers are important components of CD players. As the image
above illustrates, lasers can provide precise focusing of beams to selectively destroy cancer cells in patients. The
ability of a laser to focus precisely is due to high-quality crystals that help give rise to the laser beam. A variety of
techniques are used to manufacture pure crystals for use in lasers.

Crystalline Solids

The majority of solids are crystalline in nature. A crystal is a substance in which the particles are arranged in an
orderly, repeating, three-dimensional pattern. Particles of a solid crystal may be ions, atoms, or molecules, depending
on the type of substance. The three-dimensional arrangement of a solid crystal is referred to as the crystal lattice.
Different arrangements of the particles within a crystal cause them to adopt several different shapes.

Crystals are classiﬁed into general categories based on their shapes. A crystal is deﬁned by its faces, which intersect
with one another at speciﬁc angles, which are characteristic of the given substance. The seven crystal systems are
shown below, along with an example of each. The edge lengths of a crystal are represented by the letters a, b, and
c. The angles at which the faces intersect are represented by the Greek letters α, β, and γ. Each of the seven crystal
systems differs in terms of the angles between the faces and in the number of edges of equal length on each face.

• Describe the three cubic crystal system unit cells.

We have many data tables available to us in chemistry. If we wanted to know the size of the lithium atom, we can
easily look it up and ﬁnd that this atom is 134 picometers across. If we remove the outer electron, the lithium ion is
now only 90 picometers in size. How do we know this? We don’t have a ruler small enough to measure these tiny
distances. But we can use a technique called x-ray diffraction to shine beams of x-rays through a crystal of a lithium
compound. By measuring how much the beams are bent after they come through the crystal, we can calculate the
size of the molecule. This technique works both for small materials like lithium compounds and equally well for
very large protein molecules.

Unit Cells

A unit cell is the smallest portion of a crystal lattice that shows the three-dimensional pattern of the entire crystal.
A crystal can be thought of as the same unit cell repeated over and over in three dimensions. The Figure 13.16
illustrates the relationship of a unit cell to the entire crystal lattice.
Unit cells occur in many different varieties. As one example, the cubic crystal system is composed of three different
types of unit cells: (1) simple cubic, (2) face-centered cubic, and (3) body-centered cubic. These are shown in
three different ways in the Figure 13.17.
Pay special attention to the last diagram for each type of cell. You will notice that the atoms or ions at the edges
of each face or at the corners are not complete spheres. In the simple cubic cell, each corner atom is shared by
8 differenent unit cells. The same situation exists for the edge or corner particles in the face-centered and body-
centered cubic forms. In addition, each of the particles in the center of the face-centered cubic cell is shared by 2

13.16 Classes of Crystalline Solids

• List the four types of crystalline solids.
• Describe the properties of each type.

We often take a lot of things for granted. We just assume that we will get electric power when we connect a plug to
an electrical outlet. The wire that comprises that outlet is almost always copper, a material that conducts electricity
well. The unique properties of the solid copper allow electrons to ﬂow freely through the wire and into whatever
device we connect it to. Then we can enjoy music, television, work on the computer, or whatever other activity we
want to undertake.

Classes of Crystalline Solids

Crystalline substances can be described by the types of particles in them and the types of chemical bonding that
takes place between the particles. There are four types of crystals: (1) ionic, (2) metallic, (3) covalent network, and
(4) molecular. Properties and several examples of each type are listed in the following table and are described in

1.
Ionic crystals – The ionic crystal structure consists of alternating positively-charged cations and negatively-
charged anions (see Figure 13.18). The ions may either be monatomic or polyatomic. Generally, ionic crystals form
from a combination of Group 1 or 2 metals and Group 16 or 17 nonmetals or nonmetallic polyatomic ions. Ionic
crystals are hard and brittle and have high melting points. Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity as solids, but
do conduct when molten or in aqueous solution.

FIGURE 13.18
NaCl crystal.

2. Metallic crystals – Metallic crystals consist of metal cations surrounded by a “sea” of mobile valence electrons
(see Figure 13.19). These electrons, also referred to as delocalized electrons, do not belong to any one atom, but are
capable of moving through the entire crystal. As a result, metals are good conductors of electricity. As seen in the
Table 13.5, the melting points of metallic crystals display a wide range.

metal atoms.

Chapter 13. States of Matter

3. Covalent network crystals – A covalent network crystal consists of atoms at the lattice points of the crystal,
with each atom being covalently bonded to its nearest neighbor atoms (see Figure 13.20). The covalently bonded
network is three-dimensional and contains a very large number of atoms. Network solids include diamond, quartz,
many metalloids, and oxides of transition metals and metalloids. Network solids are hard and brittle, with extremely
high melting and boiling points. Being composed of atoms rather than ions, they do not conduct electricity in any
state.

FIGURE 13.20
Diamond is a network solid and consists of carbon atoms covalently
bonded to one another in a repeating three-dimensional pattern. Each
carbon atom makes four single covalent bonds in a tetrahedral geometry.

4. Molecular crystals – Molecular crystals typically consist of molecules at the lattice points of the crystal, held
together by relatively weak intermolecular forces (see Figure 13.21). The intermolecular forces may be dispersion
forces in the case of nonpolar crystals, or dipole-dipole forces in the case of polar crystals. Some molecular crystals,
such as ice, have molecules held together by hydrogen bonds. When one of the noble gases is cooled and solidiﬁed,
the lattice points are individual atoms rather than molecules. In all cases, the intermolecular forces holding the
particles together are far weaker than either ionic or covalent bonds. As a result, the melting and boiling points of
molecular crystals are much lower. Lacking ions or free electrons, molecular crystals are poor electrical conductors.

• Metallic crystals consist of metal cations surrounded by a “sea” of mobile valence electrons.

13.17 Amorphous Solid

• Deﬁne amorphous solid.
• List properties of amorphous solids.

When a tire goes ﬂat, its shape changes. The tire might be ﬂat because of a slow leak in the tire valve. It could be
ﬂat because it ran over a nail or screw and ended up with a small hole where the air can leak out over a period of
time. Or it could go ﬂat when it hits a large rock or other object while travelling at high speeds (this one is for those
readers who enjoy detective movies or TV shows). What if a crystalline solid like LiBr were ever made into a tire
(now there’s a weird idea)? When it encountered a blow, the crystal would break into small pieces. Since rubber is
an amorphous solid, it has a very different set of physical properties.

Amorphous Solids

Unlike a crystalline solid, an amorphous solid is a solid that lacks an ordered internal structure. Some examples of
amorphous solids include rubber, plastic, and gels. Glass is a very important amorphous solid that is made by cooling
a mixture of materials in such a way that it does not crystallize. Glass is sometimes referred to as a supercooled
liquid rather than a solid. If you have ever watched a glassblower in action, you have noticed that he takes advantage
of the fact that amorphous solids do not have a distinct melting point like crystalline solids do. Instead, as glass is
heated, it slowly softens and can be shaped into all sorts of interesting forms. When a glass object shatters, it does
so in a very irregular way, unlike crystalline solids, which always break into fragments that have the same shape as
dictated by its crystal system.

633

13.17. Amorphous Solid

www.ck12.org

Properties of amorphous solids are different in many ways from those of crystalline solids. The intermolecular force
forces in amorphous solids are weaker than those in crystalline solids. Amorphous solids do not have a regular
external structure and they do not have sharp melting points. Unlike crystalline solids that have regular planes of
cleavage, the physical properties of amorphous solids are the same in all directions.
Plastics are used for many purposes because they are inexpensive to produce and do not shatters like glass or ceramic
materials. Since they are easily disposed of, the accumulation of plastic garbage has become a serious problem in
many parts of the world. Recycling programs that help reuse the plastics are growing in popularity.

13.18 Heating and Cooling Curves

• List the changes of state.
• Relate the change of state to a change in temperature.

During the time of Mark Twain (real name Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 1835-1910), the steamboat was a major
means of transportation on the rivers and lakes of the United States. Twain himself was a steamboat pilot on the
Mississippi River for a period of time and took his pen name from the measurement of water depth (twelve feet,
which was a safe depth for the boats). The boats got their power from steam –liquid water converted to a gas at high
temperatures. The steam would push the pistons of the engine, causing the paddle wheels to turn and propel the
boat.

Heating Curves

Imagine that you have a block of ice that is at a temperature of -30°C, well below its melting point. The ice is in
a closed container. As heat is steadily added to the ice block, the water molecules will begin to vibrate faster and
faster as they absorb kinetic energy. Eventually, when the ice has warmed to 0°C, the added energy will start to break
apart the hydrogen bonding that keeps the water molecules in place when it is in the solid form. As the ice melts,
its temperature does not rise. All of the energy that is being put into the ice goes into the melting process and not
into any increase in temperature. During the melting process, the two states –solid and liquid –are in equilibrium
with one another. If the system was isolated at that point and no energy was allowed to enter or leave, the ice-water
mixture at 0°C would remain. Temperature is always constant during a change of state.

636

www.ck12.org

Chapter 13. States of Matter

Continued heating of the water after the ice has completely melted will now increase the kinetic energy of the liquid
molecules and the temperature will rise. Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will
rise steadily until it reaches 100°C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to
vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100°C while the water molecules are
going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of
the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100°C.
The experiment described above can be summarized in a graph called a heating curve ( Figure 13.23):

FIGURE 13.23
In the heating curve of water, the temperature is shown as heat is continually added. Changes of state occur
during plateaus because the temperature is constant.

The change of state behavior of all substances can be represented with a heating curve of this type. The melting and
boiling points of the substance can be determined by the horizontal lines or plateaus on the curve. Other substances
would of course have melting and boiling points that are different from those of water. One exception to this exact
form for a heating would be for a substance such as carbon dioxide which sublimes rather than melts at standard
pressure. The heating curve for carbon dioxide would have only one plateau, at the sublimation temperature of
CO2.
The entire experiment could be run in reverse. Steam above 100°C could be steadily cooled down to 100°C, at which
point it would condense to liquid water. The water could then be cooled to 0°C, at which point continued cooling
would freeze the water to ice. The ice could then be cooled to some point below 0°C. This could be diagrammed in
a cooling curve that would be the reverse of the heating curve.

All of the changes of state that occur between solid, liquid and gas are summarized in the diagram in the ﬁgure

Evaporation occurs when a liquid turns to a gas. Condensation is the opposite of vaporization and both represent
the equilibrium between the liquid and gas states. Deposition is the opposite of sublimation and both represent the
equilibrium between the solid and gas states.

Summary

• A change of state can be brought about by putting heat into a system or removing it from the system.
• The temperature of a system will not change as long as the substance is undergoing a change from solid to

liquid or liquid to gas, as well as the reverse.

Many rockets use a combination of kerosene and liquid oxygen for their fuel. Oxygen can be reduced to the liquid
state either by cooling or by using high pressure. Since the oxygen is in a container essentially out in the open,
maintaining a temperature of -183°C (the boiling point of oxygen) is not real practical. But high pressure can be
used to force the oxygen into tanks and cause it to liquefy so it can then mix with the kerosene and provide a powerful
ignition to move the rocket.

Phase Diagrams

The relationships among the solid, liquid, and vapor (gas) states of a substance can be shown as a function of
temperature and pressure in single diagram. A phase diagram is graph showing the conditions of temperature and
pressure under which a substance exists in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Examine the general phase diagram
shown in the Figure 13.25. In each of the three colored regions of the diagram, the substance is in a single state (or
phase). The dark lines that act as the boundary between those regions represent the conditions under which the two
phases are in equilibrium.
Find the X on the pressure axis and presume that the value of X is standard pressure of 1 atm. As one moves left

Start right above point B on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles

that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the
liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than
the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment R− S
represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufﬁciently
low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist. The point labeled T P is called the triple point. The triple point is the
one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at
equilibrium.

• A phase diagram is a graph which the conditions of temperature and pressure under which a substance exists

13.20 Phase Diagram for Water

• Describe the phase diagram for water.
• Deﬁne critical temperature.
• Deﬁne critical pressure.

How is it possible to create snowballs?

You need a special snow to make the best snowballs. This snow needs to be a little wet so the particles will stick
together. Dry snow can be tightly pressed and will form snowballs because the higher pressure causes the snowﬂakes
to melt somewhat. However, when you release the pressure, the snow goes back to a more solid form and the ﬂakes
no longer stick together.

Phase Diagram for Water

Water is a unique substance in many ways. One of these special properties is the fact that solid water (ice) is less
dense than liquid water just above the freezing point. The phase diagram for water is shown in the Figure 13.26.
Notice one key difference between the general phase diagram and the phase diagram for water. In water’s diagram,
the slope of the line between the solid and liquid states is negative rather than positive. The reason is that water is
an unusual substance in that its solid state is less dense than the liquid state. Ice ﬂoats in liquid water. Therefore,
a pressure change has the opposite effect on those two phases. If ice is relatively near its melting point, it can be

changed into liquid water by the application of pressure. The water molecules are actually closer together in the
liquid phase than they are in the solid phase.
Refer again to water’s phase diagram ( Figure 13.26). Notice point E, labeled the critical point. What does that
mean? At 373.99°C, particles of water in the gas phase are moving very, very rapidly. At any temperature higher
than that, the gas phase cannot be made to liquefy, no matter how much pressure is applied to the gas. The critical
pressure (Pc) is the pressure that must be applied to the gas at the critical temperature in order to turn it into a liquid.
For water, the critical pressure is very high, 217.75 atm. The critical point is the intersection point of the critical
temperature and the critical pressure.

Summary

• Solid water is less dense than liquid water just above the freezing point.
• The critical temperature (Tc) of a substance is the highest temperature at which the substance can possibly

exist as a liquid.

• The critical pressure (Pc) is the pressure that must be applied to the gas at the critical temperature in order to

turn it into a liquid.

• The critical point is the intersection point of the critical temperature and the critical pressure.

Will it all ﬁt?
When we pack to go on vacation, there is always “one more” thing that we need to get in the suitcase. Maybe it’s
another bathing suit, pair of shoes, book –whatever the item, we need to get it in. Fortunately, we can squeeze things
together somewhat. There is a little space between the folds of clothing, we can rearrange the shoes, and somehow
we get that last thing in and close the suitcase.

Compressibility

Scuba diving is a form of underwater diving in which a diver carries his own breathing gas, usually in the form of
a tank of compressed air. The pressure in most commonly used scuba tanks ranges from 200 to 300 atmospheres.
Gases are unlike other states of matter in that a gas expands to ﬁll the shape and volume of its container. For this
reason, gases can also be compressed so that a relatively large amount of gas can be forced into a small container.
If the air in a typical scuba tank were transferred to a container at the standard pressure of 1 atm, the volume of that
container would need to be about 2500 liters.
Compressibility is the measure of how much a given volume of matter decreases when placed under pressure. If we
put pressure on a solid or a liquid, there is essentially no change in volume. The atoms, ions, or molecules that make
up the solid or liquid are very close together. There is no space between the individual particles, so they cannot pack
together.
The kinetic-molecular theory explains why gases are more compressible than either liquids or solids. Gases are
compressible because most of the volume of a gas is composed of the large amounts of empty space between the
gas particles. At room temperature and standard pressure, the average distance between gas molecules is about ten

times the diameter of the molecules themselves. When a gas is compressed, as when the scuba tank is being ﬁlled,
the gas particles are forced closer together.
Compressed gases are used in many situations. In hospitals, oxygen is often used for patients who have damaged
lungs to help them breathe better. If a patient is having a major operation, the anesthesia that is administered will
frequently be a compressed gas. Welding requires very hot ﬂames produced by compresses acetylene and oxygen
mixtures. Many summer barbeque grills are fueled by compressed propane.

• List factors that affect gas pressure.
• Explain these effects in terms of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases.

How high does a basketball bounce?
The pressure of the air in a basketball has to be adjusted so that the ball bounces to the correct height. Before a game,
the ofﬁcials check the ball by dropping it from shoulder height and seeing how far back up it bounces. What would
the ofﬁcial do if the ball did not bounce up as far as it is supposed to? What would he do if it bounced too high?
The pressure inside a container is dependent on the amount of gas inside the container. If the basketball does not
bounce high enough, the ofﬁcial could remedy the situation by using a hand pump and adding more air to the ball.
Conversely, if it bounces too high, he could let some air out of the ball.

Factors Affecting Gas Pressure

Recall from the kinetic-molecular theory that gas particles move randomly and in straight lines until they elastically
collide with either other gas particles or with one of the walls of the container. It is these collisions with the walls of
the container that deﬁnes the pressure of the gas. Four variables are used to describe the condition of a gas. They are
pressure (P), volume (V ), temperature (T ), and the amount of the gas as measured by the number moles (n). We
will examine separately how the volume, temperature, and amount of gas each affect the pressure of an enclosed gas
sample.

Amount of Gas

Chapter 14. The Behavior of Gases

The Figure 14.3 shows what happens when air is added to a rigid container. A rigid container is one that is
incapable of expanding or contracting. A steel canister is an example of a rigid container.

FIGURE 14.3
Increase in pressure with increase in
number of gas particles.

The canister on the left contains a gas at a certain pressure. The attached air pump is then used to double the
amount of gas in the canister. Since the canister cannot expand, the increased number of air molecules will strike the
inside walls of the canister twice as frequently as they did before. The result is that the pressure inside the canister
doubles. As you might imagine, if more and more air is continually added to a rigid container, it may eventually
burst. Reducing the number of molecules in a rigid container has the opposite effect and the pressure decreases.

Volume

Pressure is also affected by the volume of the container. If the volume of a container is decreased, the gas molecules
have less space in which to move around. As a result, they will strike the walls of the container more often and the
pressure increases.
Figure 14.4 shows a cylinder of gas whose volume is controlled by an adjustable piston. On the left, the piston is
pulled mostly out and the gauge reads a certain pressure. On the right, the piston has been pushed so that the volume
of the enclosed portion of the container where the gas is located has been cut in half. The pressure of the gas doubles.
Increasing the volume of the container would have the opposite effect and the pressure of the gas would decrease.

Temperature

It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campﬁre without venting the can. As the can heats up, it
may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic
energy by the heat coming from the campﬁre. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they
impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually
exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will
then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.

Shown in the Figure 14.5 is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the
cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules
increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result,
the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an
enclosed gas would decrease.

14.3. Boyle’s Law

www.ck12.org

14.3 Boyle’s Law

• State Boyle’s Law.
• Use Boyle’s Law to calculate volume-pressure relationships.

How important is it to check the weather?
Each day, hundreds of weather balloons are launched. Made of a synthetic rubber and carrying a box of instruments,
the helium-ﬁlled balloon rises up into the sky. As it gains altitude, the atmospheric pressure becomes less and the
balloon expands. At some point the balloon bursts due to the expansion, the instruments drop (aided by a parachute)
to be retrieved and studied for information about the weather.

Boyle’s Law

Robert Boyle (1627-1691), an English chemist, is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern
experimental science of chemistry. He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while
keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the
volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse
relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases.
Physically, what is happening? The gas molecules are moving and are a certain distance apart from one another.
An increase in pressure pushes the molecules closer together, reducing the volume. If the pressure is decreased, the
gases are free to move about in a larger volume.
Mathematically, Boyle’s law can be expressed by the equation:

656

Chapter 14. The Behavior of Gases

FIGURE 14.6
Robert Boyle.

P×V = k

The k is a constant for a given sample of gas and depends only on the mass of the gas and the temperature. The
Table 14.1 shows pressure and volume data for a set amount of gas at a constant temperature. The third column
represents the value of the constant (k) for this data and is always equal to the pressure multiplied by the volume.
As one of the variables changes, the other changes in such a way that the product of P×V always remains the same.
In this particular case, that constant is 500 atm · ml.

Sample Problem: Boyle’s Law

www.ck12.org

A sample of oxygen gas has a volume of 425 mL when the pressure is equal to 387 kPa. The gas is allowed to
expand into a 1.75 L container. Calculate the new pressure of the gas.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• P1 = 387 kPa
• V1 = 425 mL
• V2 = 1.75 L = 1750 mL

Unknown

• P2 =? kPa

Use Boyle’s Law to solve for the unknown pressure (P2).
expressed in the same units, so V2 has been converted to mL.
Step 2: Solve.
First, rearrange the equation algebraically to solve for P2.

It is important that the two volumes (V1 and V2) are

Now substitute the known quantities into the equation and solve.

P2 =

P1 ×V1

V2

P2 =

387 kPa× 425 mL

1750 mL

= 94.0 kPa

Step 3: Think about your result.
The volume has increased to slightly over 4 times its original value and so the pressure is decreased by about 1
4th.
The pressure is in kPa and the value has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Note that any pressure or volume units can be used
as long as they are consistent throughout the problem.

How do you bake bread?
Everybody enjoys the smell and taste of freshly-baked bread. It is light and ﬂuffy as a result of the action of yeast
on sugar. The yeast converts the sugar to carbon dioxide, which at high temperatures causes the dough to expand.
The end-result is an enjoyable treat, especially when covered with melted butter.

Charles’s Law

French physicist Jacques Charles (1746-1823) studied the effect of temperature on the volume of a gas at constant
pressure. Charles’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies directly with the absolute temperature
of the gas when pressure is kept constant. The absolute temperature is temperature measured with the Kelvin scale.
The Kelvin scale must be used because zero on the Kelvin scale corresponds to a complete stoppage of molecular
motion.
Mathematically, the direct relationship of Charles’s law can be represented by the following equation:

V
T = k

As with Boyle’s law, k is constant only for a given gas sample. The Table 14.2 shows temperature and volume data
for a set amount of gas at a constant pressure. The third column is the constant for this particular data set and is
always equal to the volume divided by the Kelvin temperature.

How much propane is in the tank?
Propane tanks are widely used with barbeque grills. But it’s not fun to ﬁnd out half-way through your grilling that
you’ve run out of gas. You can buy gauges that measure the pressure inside the tank to see how much is left. The
gauge measures pressure and will register a higher pressure on a hot day than it will on a cold day. So you need to
take the air temperature into account when you decide whether or not to reﬁll the tank before your next cook-out.

Gay-Lussac’s Law

When the temperature of a sample of gas in a rigid container is increased, the pressure of the gas increases as well.
The increase in kinetic energy results in the molecules of gas striking the walls of the container with more force,
resulting in a greater pressure. The French chemist Joseph Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) discovered the relationship
between the pressure of a gas and its absolute temperature. Gay-Lussac’s law states that the pressure of a given
mass of gas varies directly with the absolute temperature of the gas, when the volume is kept constant. Gay-Lussac’s
law is very similar to Charles’s law, with the only difference being the type of container. Whereas the container in a
Charles’s law experiment is ﬂexible, it is rigid in a Gay-Lussac’s law experiment.
The mathematical expressions for Gay-Lussac’s law are likewise similar to those of Charles’s law:

• State the combined gas law.
• Use the law to calculate parameters in general gas problems.

What keeps things cold?
The modern refrigerator takes advantage of the gas laws to remove heat from a system. Compressed gas in the coils
(see above) is allowed to expand. This expansion lowers the temperature of the gas and transfers heat energy from
the material in the refrigerator to the gas. As the gas is pumped through the coils, the pressure on the gas compresses
it and raises the gas temperature. This heat is then dissipated through the coils into the outside air. As the compressed
gas is pumped through the system again, the process repeats itself.

Combined Gas Law

To this point, we have examined the relationships between any two of the variables of P, V , and T , while the
third variable is held constant. However, situations arise where all three variables change. The combined gas law
expresses the relationship between the pressure, volume, and absolute temperature of a ﬁxed amount of gas. For a
combined gas law problem, only the amount of gas is held constant.

2.00 L of a gas at 35°C and 0.833 atm is brought to standard temperature and pressure (STP). What will be the new

Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• P1 = 0.833 atm
• V1 = 2.00 L
• T1 = 35◦C = 308 K
• P2 = 1.00 atm
• T2 = 0◦C = 273 K

Unknown

• V2 =? L

Use the combined gas law to solve for the unknown volume (V2). STP is 273 K and 1 atm. The temperatures have
been converted to Kelvin.
Step 2: Solve
First, rearrange the equation algebraically to solve for V2.

V2 =

P1 ×V1 × T2

P2 × T1

Now substitute the known quantities into the equation and solve.

V2 =

0.833 atm× 2.00 L× 273 K

1.00 atm× 308 K

= 1.48 L

Step 3: Think about your result.
Both the increase in pressure and the decrease in temperature cause the volume of the gas sample to decrease. Since
both changes are relatively small, the volume does not decrease dramatically.
It may seem challenging to remember all the different gas laws introduced so far. Fortunately, Boyle’s, Charles’s,
and Gay-Lussac’s laws can all be easily derived from the combined gas law. For example, consider a situation where
a change occurs in the volume and pressure of a gas while the temperature is being held constant. In that case, it can
be said that T1 = T2. Look at the combined gas law and cancel the T variable out from both sides of the equation.
What is left over is Boyle’s law:
P1 ×V1 = P2 ×V2. Likewise, if the pressure is constant, then P1 = P2 and canceling P out of the equation leaves
Charles’s law. If the volume is constant, then V1 = V2 and canceling V out of the equation leaves Gay-Lussac’s law.

14.7 Avogadro’s Law

• State Avogadro’s Law.
• Use this law to perform calculations involving quantities of gases.

How much air do you put into a tire?
A ﬂat tire is not very useful. It does not cushion the rim of the wheel and creates a very uncomfortable ride. When
air is added to the tire, the pressure increases as more molecules of gas are forced into the rigid tire. How much air
should be put into a tire depends on the pressure rating for that tire. Too little pressure and the tire will not hold its
shape. Too much pressure and the tire could burst.

Avogadro’s Law

You have learned about Avogadro’s hypothesis: equal volumes of any gas at the same temperature and pressure
contain the same number of molecules. It follows that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number
of moles of gas present in the sample. Avogadro’s law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to
the number of moles of gas when the temperature and pressure are held constant. The mathematical expression of
Avogadro’s law is

V = k× n

=

14.7. Avogadro’s Law

where n is the number of moles of gas and k is a constant. Avogadro’s law is in evidence whenever you blow up a
balloon. The volume of the balloon increases as you add moles of gas to the balloon by blowing it up.
If the container holding the gas is rigid rather than ﬂexible, pressure can be substituted for volume in Avogadro’s
law. Adding gas to a rigid container makes the pressure increase.

Sample Problem: Avogadro’s Law

A balloon has been ﬁlled to a volume of 1.90 L with 0.0920 mol of helium gas. If 0.0210 mol of additional helium
is added to the balloon while the temperature and pressure are held constant, what is the new volume of the balloon?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• V1 = 1.90 L
• n1 = 0.0920 mol
• n2 = 0.0920 + 0.0210 = 0.1130 mol

Unknown

• V2 =? L

Note that the ﬁnal number of moles has to be calculated by adding the original number of moles to the moles of
added helium. Use Avogadro’s law to solve for the ﬁnal volume.
Step 2: Solve.
First, rearrange the equation algebraically to solve for V2.

V2 =

V1 × n2

n1

Now substitute the known quantities into the equation and solve.

V2 =

1.90 L× 0.1130 mol

0.0920 mol

= 2.33 L

Step 3: Think about your result.
Since a relatively small amount of additional helium was added to the balloon, its volume increases slightly.

What chemical reactions require ammonia?
There are a number of chemical reactions that require ammonia. In order to carry out the reaction efﬁciently, we need
to know how much ammonia we have for stoichiometric purposes. Using gas laws, we can determine the number of
moles present in the tank if we know the volume, temperature, and pressure of the system.

Ideal Gas Law

The combined gas law shows that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to volume and directly proportional
to temperature. Avogadro’s law shows that volume or pressure is directly proportional to the number of moles of
gas. Putting these together leaves us with the following equation:

P1 ×V1
T1 × n1

P2 ×V2
T2 × n2

=

As with the other gas laws, we can also say that (P×V )
that the gas being described is considered to be ideal.
The ideal gas law is a single equation which relates the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of an
ideal gas. If we substitute in the variable R for the constant, the equation becomes:

(T×n) is equal to a constant. The constant can be evaluated provided

672

www.ck12.org

Chapter 14. The Behavior of Gases

The ideal gas law is conventionally rearranged to look this way, with the multiplication signs omitted:

P×V
T × n = R

PV = nRT

The variable R in the equation is called the ideal gas constant.

Evaluating the Ideal Gas Constant

The value of R, the ideal gas constant, depends on the units chosen for pressure, temperature, and volume in the
ideal gas equation. It is necessary to use Kelvin for the temperature and it is conventional to use the SI unit of liters
for the volume. However, pressure is commonly measured in one of three units: kPa, atm, or mmHg. Therefore, R
can have three different values.
We will demonstrate how R is calculated when the pressure is measured in kPa. Recall that the volume of 1.00 mol
of any gas at STP is measured to be 22.414 L. We can substitute 101.325 kPa for pressure, 22.414 L for volume, and
273.15 K for temperature into the ideal gas equation and solve for R.

R =

PV
nT =

101.325 kPa× 22.414 L
1.000 mol× 273.15 K

= 8.314 kPa· L/K· mol

This is the value of R that is to be used in the ideal gas equation when the pressure is given in kPa. The Table 14.3
shows a summary of this and the other possible values of R. It is important to choose the correct value of R to use
for a given problem.

Sample Problem: Ideal Gas Law

Step 2: Solve.

3.760 g× 1 mol O2

Step 3: Think about your result
The number of moles of oxygen is far less than one mole, so the volume should be fairly small compared to molar
volume (22.4 L/mol) since the pressure and temperature are reasonably close to standard. The result has three
signiﬁcant ﬁgures because of the values for T and P. Since a joule (J) = kPa • L, the units cancel correctly, leaving a
volume in liters.

14.9 Calculating the Molar Mass of a Gas

• Calculate the molar mass of a gas.
• Calculate the density of a gas.

What makes it ﬂoat?
Helium has long been used in balloons and blimps. Since it is much less dense than air, it will ﬂoat above the ground.
We can buy small balloons ﬁlled with helium at stores, but large ones (such as the balloon seen above) are much
more expensive and take up a lot more helium.

Calculating Molar Mass and Density of a Gas

A chemical reaction, which produces a gas, is performed. The produced gas is then collected and its mass and
volume are determined. The molar mass of the unknown gas can be found using the ideal gas law, provided the
temperature and pressure of the gas are also known.

Sample Problem: Molar Mass and the Ideal Gas Law

A certain reaction occurs, producing an oxide of nitrogen as a gas. The gas has a mass of 1.211 g and occupies a
volume of 677 mL. The temperature in the laboratory is 23°C and the air pressure is 0.987 atm. Calculate the molar
mass of the gas and deduce its formula. Assume the gas is ideal.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• mass = 1.211 g
• V = 677 ml = 0.677 L

675

14.9. Calculating the Molar Mass of a Gas

• T = 23◦C = 296 K
• P = 0.987 atm
• R = 0.08206 L· atm/K· mol

Unknown

• n =? mol
• molar mass =? g/mol

First the ideal gas law will be used to solve for the moles of unknown gas (n). Then the mass of the gas divided by
the moles will give the molar mass.
Step 2: Solve.

n =

PV
RT =

0.987 atm× 0.677 L

0.08206 L· atm/K· mol× 296 K

= 0.0275 mol

Now divide g by mol to get the molar mass.

molar mass =

1.211 g

0.0275 mol

= 44.0 g/mol

Since N has a molar mass of 14 g/mol and O has a molar mass of 16 g/mol, the formula N2O would produce the
correct molar mass.
Step 3: Think about your result
The R value that corresponds to a pressure in atm was chosen for this problem. The calculated molar mass gives a
reasonable formula for dinitrogen monoxide.

Calculating Density of a Gas

The ideal gas law can be used to ﬁnd the density of a gas at conditions that are not standard. For example, we will
determine the density of ammonia gas (NH3) at 0.913 atm and 20°C, assuming the ammonia is ideal. First, the molar
mass of ammonia is calculated to be 17.04 g/mol. Next, assume exactly 1 mol of ammonia (n = 1) and calculate the
volume that such an amount would occupy at the given temperature and pressure.

V =

nRT
P =

1.00 mol× 0.08206 L· atm/K· mol× 293 K

0.913 atm

= 26.3 L

Now the density can be calculated by dividing the mass of one mole of ammonia by the volume above.

density =

17.04 g
26.3 L

= 0.647 g/L

As a point of comparison, this density is slightly less than the density of ammonia at STP, which is equal to
(17.04 g/mol)
It makes sense that the density should be lower compared to that at STP since both
(22.4 L/mol)
the increase in temperature (from 0°C to 20°C) and the decrease in pressure (from 1 atm to 0.913 atm) would cause
the NH3 molecules to spread out a bit further from one another.

= 0.761 g/L.

• Use the ideal gas law to calculate stoichiometry problems for gases.

The Haber cycle reaction of gaseous nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia is a critical step in the production
of fertilizer from ammonia. It is important to have an excess of the starting materials so that a maximum yield of
ammonia can be achieved. By knowing how much ammonia is needed for manufacture of a batch of fertilizer, the

stoichiometry problems for reactions that occur at any temperature and pressure.

Sample Problem: Gas Stoichiometry and the Ideal Gas Law

What volume of carbon dioxide is produced by the combustion of 25.21 g of ethanol (C2H5OH) at 54°C and 728
mmHg? Assume the gas is ideal.

Chapter 14. The Behavior of Gases

Before using the ideal gas law, it is necessary to write and balance the chemical equation. Recall that most
combustion reactions, the given substance reacts with O2 to form CO2 and H2O. Here is the balanced equation
for the combustion of ethanol.

C2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l)

Step 1: List the known quantities and solve the problem.
Known

• mass C2H5OH = 25.21 g
• molar mass C2H5OH = 46.08 g/mol
• P = 728 mmHg
• T = 54◦C = 327 K

Unknown

• Volume CO2 =? L

The number of moles of carbon dioxide gas is ﬁrst calculated by stoichiometry. Then the ideal gas law is used to
calculate the volume of CO2 produced.
Step 2: Solve.

25.21 g C2H5OH× 1 mol C2H5OH
46.08 g C2H5OH

× 2 mol CO2

1 mol C2H5OH

= 1.094 mol C2H5OH

The moles of ethanol (n) is now substituted into PV = nRT to solve for the volume.

V =

nRT
P =

1.094 mol× 62.36 L· mmHg/K· mol× 327 K

728 mmHg

= 30.6 L

Step 3: Think about your result.
The mass of ethanol is slightly more than one half mole, meaning that the mole ratio results in slightly more than
one mole of carbon dioxide being produced. Because of the elevated temperature and reduced pressure compared to
STP, the resulting volume is larger than 22.4 L.

14.11 Real and Ideal Gases

• Deﬁne a real gas.
• Describe differences between real gases and ideal gases.

Location, Location, Location
The behavior of a molecule depends a lot on its structure. We can have two compounds with the same number of
atoms and yet they act very differently. Ethanol (C2H5OH) is a clear liquid that has a boiling point of about 79°C.
Dimethylether (CH3OCH3) has the same number of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens, but boils at a much lower
temperature (-25°C). The difference lies in the amount of intermolecular interaction (strong H-bonds for ethanol,
weak van der Waals force for the ether).

Real and Ideal Gases

An ideal gas is one that follows the gas laws at all conditions of temperature and pressure. To do so, the gas would
need to completely abide by the kinetic-molecular theory. The gas particles would need to occupy zero volume and
they would need to exhibit no attractive forces what so ever toward each other. Since neither of those conditions
can be true, there is no such thing as an ideal gas. A real gas is a gas that does not behave according to the
assumptions of the kinetic-molecular theory. Fortunately, at the conditions of temperature and pressure that are
normally encountered in a laboratory, real gases tend to behave very much like ideal gases.
Under what conditions then, do gases behave least ideally? When a gas is put under high pressure, its molecules are
forced closer together as the empty space between the particles is diminished. A decrease in the empty space means
that the assumption that the volume of the particles themselves is negligible is less valid. When a gas is cooled, the
decrease in kinetic energy of the particles causes them to slow down. If the particles are moving at slower speeds,
the attractive forces between them are more prominent. Another way to view it is that continued cooling the gas will
eventually turn it into a liquid and a liquid is certainly not an ideal gas anymore (see liquid nitrogen in the Figure
14.11). In summary, a real gas deviates most from an ideal gas at low temperatures and high pressures. Gases are
most ideal at high temperature and low pressure.
The Figure 14.12 shows a graph of PV
RT plotted against pressure for 1 mol of a gas at three different temperatures -
200 K, 500 K, and 1000 K. An ideal gas would have a value of 1 for that ratio at all temperatures and pressures and
the graph would simply be a horizontal line. As can be seen, deviations from an ideal gas occur. As the pressure
begins to rise, the attractive forces cause the volume of the gas to be less than expected and the value of PV
RT drops
under 1. Continued pressure increase results in the volume of the particles to become signiﬁcant and the value of PV
RT
rises to greater than 1. Notice, that the magnitude of the deviations from ideality is greatest for the gas at 200 K and
least for the gas at 1000 K.

FIGURE 14.12
Real gases deviate from ideal gases at
high pressures and at low temperatures.

The ideality of a gas also depends on the strength and type of intermolecular attractive forces that exist between
the particles. Gases whose attractive forces are weak are more ideal than those with strong attractive forces. At
the same temperature and pressure, neon is more ideal than water vapor because neon’s atoms are only attracted by
weak dispersion forces, while water vapor’s molecules are attracted by relatively stronger hydrogen bonds. Helium
is a more ideal gas than neon because its smaller number of electrons means that helium’s dispersion forces are even
weaker than those of neon.

• The properties of real gases and their deviations from ideality are described.

• Deﬁne partial pressure.
• State Dalton’s law of partial pressures.
• Use this law to calculate pressures of gas mixtures.

Is there oxygen available on Venus?

The atmosphere of Venus is markedly different from that of Earth. The gases in the Venusian atmosphere are 96.5%
carbon dioxide and 3% nitrogen. The atmospheric pressure on Venus is roughly 92 times that of Earth, so the amount
of nitrogen on Venus would contribute a pressure well over 2700 mm Hg. And there is no oxygen present, so we
couldn’t breathe there. Not that we would want to go to Venus –the surface temperature is usually over 460°C.

Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures

Gas pressure results from collisions between gas particles and the inside walls of their container. If more gas is
added to a rigid container, the gas pressure increases. The identities of the two gases do not matter. John Dalton,
the English chemist who proposed the atomic theory, also studied mixtures of gases. He found that each gas in a
mixture exerts a pressure independently of every other gas in the mixture. For example, our atmosphere is composed
of about 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with smaller amounts of several other gases making up the rest. Since
nitrogen makes up 78% of the gas particles in a given sample of air, it exerts 78% of the pressure. If the overall
atmospheric pressure is 1.00 atm, then the pressure of just the nitrogen in the air is 0.78 atm. The pressure of the
oxygen in the air is 0.21 atm.
The partial pressure of a gas is the contribution that gas makes to the total pressure when the gas is part of a
mixture. The partial pressure of a gas is indicated by a P with a subscript that is the symbol or formula of that
gas. The partial pressure of nitrogen is represented by PN2. Dalton’s law of partial pressures states that the total

684

Chapter 14. The Behavior of Gases

pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of all of the partial pressures of the component gases. Dalton’s
law can be expressed with the following equation:

Ptotal = P1 + P2 + P3 + . . .

The Figure 14.13 shows two gases that are in separate, equal-sized containers at the same temperature and pressure.
Each exerts a different pressure, P1 and P2, reﬂective of the number of particles in the container. On the right, the
two gases are combined into the same container, with no volume change. The total pressure of the gas mixture is
equal to the sum of the individual pressures. If P1 = 300 mmHg and P2 = 500 mmHg, then PTotal = 800 mmHg.

Dalton’s law says that the pressure of a

14.13 Mole Fraction

• Deﬁne mole fraction.
• Perform calculations involving mole fractions.

The mixed blessing of sulfur dioxide
Sulfur dioxide is a by-product of many processes, both natural and human-made. Massive amounts of this gas are
released during volcanic eruptions such as the one seen above on the Big Island (Hawaii). Humans produce sulfur
dioxide by burning coal. The gas has a cooling effect when in the atmosphere by reﬂecting sunlight back away
from the earth. However, sulfur dioxide is also a component of smog and acid rain, both of which are harmful to
the environment. Many efforts have been made to reduce SO2 levels to lower acid rain production. An unforeseen
complication: as we lower the concentration of this gas in the atmosphere, we lower its ability to cool and then we
have global warming concerns.

Mole Fraction

One way to express relative amounts of substances in a mixture is with the mole fraction. Mole fraction (X) is the
ratio of moles of one substance in a mixture to the total number of moles of all substances. For a mixture of two
substances, A and B, the mole fractions of each would be written as follows:

XA =

mol A

mol A + mol B

and XB =

mol B

mol A + mol B

If a mixture consists of 0.50 mol A and 1.00 mol B, then the mole fraction of A would be XA = 0.5
the mole fraction of B would be XB = 1.0

1.5 = 0.67.

1.5 = 0.33. Similarly,

687

14.13. Mole Fraction

www.ck12.org

Mole fraction is a useful quantity for analyzing gas mixtures in conjunction with Dalton’s law of partial pressures.
Consider the following situation: A 20.0 liter vessel contains 1.0 mol of hydrogen gas at a pressure of 600 mmHg.
Another 20.0 liter vessel contains 3.0 mol of helium at a pressure of 1800 mmHg. These two gases are mixed
together in an identical 20.0 liter vessel. Because each will exert its own pressure according to Dalton’s law, we can
express the partial pressures as follows:

PH2 = XH2 × PTotal

and PHe = XHe × PTotal

The partial pressure of a gas in a mixture is equal to its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure. For our
mixture of hydrogen and helium:

XH2 =

1.0 mol

1.0 mol + 3.0 mol

= 0.25

and XHe =

3.0 mol

1.0 mol + 3.0 mol

= 0.75

The total pressure according to Dalton’s law is 600 mmHg + 1800 mmHg = 2400 mmHg. So, each partial pressure
will be:

PH2 = 0.25× 2400 mmHg = 600 mmHg
PHe = 0.75× 2400 mmHg = 1800 mmHg

The partial pressures of each gas in the mixture don’t change since they were mixed into the same size vessel and
the temperature was not changed.

Sample Problem: Dalton’s Law

A ﬂask contains a mixture of 1.24 moles of hydrogen gas and 2.91 moles of oxygen gas. If the total pressure is 104
kPa, what is the partial pressure of each gas?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• 1.24 mol H2
• 2.91 mol O2
• PTotal = 104 kPa

Unknown

• PH2 =? kPa
• PO2 =? kPa

First, the mole fraction of each gas can be determined. Then, the partial pressure can be calculated by multiplying
the mole fraction by the total pressure.
Step 2: Solve.

1.24 mol

XH2 =
= 0.299
PH2 = 0.299× 104 kPa = 31.1 kPa

1.24 mol + 2.91 mol

2.91 mol

XO2 =
= 0.701
PO2 = 0.701× 104 kPa = 72.9 kPa

1.24 mol + 2.91 mol

Step 3: Think about your result.
The hydrogen is slightly less than one third of the mixture, so it exerts slightly less than one third of the total pressure.

14.14 Gas Collection by Water Displacement

• Calculate volumes of dry gases obtained after collecting over water.

What is the pressure?
You need to do a lab experiment where hydrogen gas is generated. In order to calculate the yield of gas, you have
to know the pressure inside the tube where the gas is collected. But how can you get a barometer in there? Very
simple: you don’t. All you need is the atmospheric pressure in the room. As the gas pushed out the water, it is
pushing against the atmosphere, so the pressure inside is equal to the pressure outside.

Gas Collection by Water Displacement

Gases that are produced in laboratory experiments are often collected by a technique called water displacement
(see Figure 14.14). A bottle is ﬁlled with water and placed upside-down in a pan of water. The reaction ﬂask is
ﬁtted with rubber tubing which is then fed under the bottle of water. As the gas is produced in the reaction ﬂask,
it exits through the rubber tubing and displaces the water in the bottle. When the bottle is full of the gas, it can be
sealed with a lid.
Because the gas is collected over water, it is not pure but is mixed with vapor from the evaporation of the water.
Dalton’s law can be used to calculate the amount of the desired gas by subtracting the contribution of the water
vapor.

Sample Problem: Gas Collected by Water Displacement

A certain experiment generates 2.58 L of hydrogen gas, which is collected over water. The temperature is 20°C and
the atmospheric pressure is 98.60 kPa. Find the volume that the dry hydrogen would occupy at STP.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• VTotal = 2.58 L
• T = 20◦C = 293 K
• PTotal = 98.60 kPa = 739.7 mmHg

Unknown

• VH2 at ST P =? L

The atmospheric pressure is converted from kPa to mmHg in order to match units with the table. The sum of the
pressures of the hydrogen and the water vapor is equal to the atmospheric pressure. The pressure of the hydrogen is
found by subtraction. Then, the volume of the gas at STP can be calculated by using the combined gas law.
Step 2: Solve.

PH2 = PTotal − PH2O = 739.7 mmHg− 17.54 mmHg = 722.2 mmHg

Now the combined gas law is used, solving for V2, the volume of hydrogen at STP.

V2 =

14.15 Diffusion and Effusion and Graham’s Law

• Deﬁne diffusion and effusion.
• State Graham’s law.
• Use Graham’s law to perform calculations involving movement of gases.

How do we know how fast a gas moves?
We usually cannot see gases, so we need ways to detect their movements indirectly. The relative rates of diffusion
of ammonia to hydrogen chloride can be observed in a simple experiment. Cotton balls are soaked with solutions
of ammonia and hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid) and attached to two different rubber stoppers. These are
simultaneously plugged into either end of a long glass tube. The vapors of each travel down the tube at different
rates. Where the vapors meet, they react to form ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), a white solid that appears in the glass
tube as a ring.

Graham’s Law

When a person opens a bottle of perfume in one corner of a large room, it doesn’t take very long for the scent
to spread throughout the entire room. Molecules of the perfume evaporate and the vapor spreads out to ﬁll the
entire space. Diffusion is the tendency of molecules to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low
concentration until the concentration is uniform. While gases diffuse rather quickly, liquids diffuse much more
slowly. Solids essentially do not diffuse.

A related process to diffusion is the effusion. Effusion is the process of a conﬁned gas escaping through a tiny hole
in its container. Effusion can be observed by the fact that a helium-ﬁlled balloon will stop ﬂoating and sink to the
ﬂoor after a day or so. This is because the helium gas effuses through tiny pores in the balloon. Both diffusion and
effusion are related to the speed at which various gas molecules move. Gases that have a lower molar mass effuse
and diffuse at a faster rate than gases that have a higher molar mass.
Scottish chemist Thomas Graham (1805-1869) studied the rates of effusion and diffusion of gases. Graham’s law
states that the rate of effusion or diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass of

693

14.15. Diffusion and Effusion and Graham’s Law

the gas. Graham’s law can be understood by comparing two gases (A and B) at the same temperature, meaning the
gases have the same kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of a moving object is given by the equation KE = 1
where m is mass and v is velocity. Setting the kinetic energies of the two gases equal to one another gives:

For the purposes of comparing the rates of effusion or diffusion of two gases at the same temperature, the molar
masses of each gas can be used in the equation for m.

Calculate the ratio of diffusion rates of ammonia gas (NH3) to hydrogen chloride (HCl) at the same temperature and
pressure.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.

• molar mass HCl = 36.46 g/mol

The rate of diffusion of ammonia is 1.46 times faster than the rate of diffusion of hydrogen chloride.
Step 3: Think about your result
Since ammonia has a smaller molar mass than hydrogen chloride, the velocity of its molecules is greater and the
velocity ratio is larger than 1.

• The processes of gas diffusion and effusion are described.
• Graham’s law relates the molecular mass of a gas to its rate of diffusion or effusion.

15.1 Structure of Water

• Describe the structure of a water molecule.
• Describe the polarity of a water molecule.

How much of the Earth’s surface is covered with water?
In his well-known poem “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” Samuel Coleridge wrote “Water, water everywhere,
Nor any drop to drink.” The narrator was talking about being out on the ocean, but not having any water because he
had killed an albatross (apparently bringing bad luck to everyone on the ship). About 75% of the Earth’s surface is
water. The major constituent of the human body (over 60%) is water. This simple molecule plays important roles
in all kinds of processes.

Structure of Water

Water is a simple molecule consisting of one oxygen atom bonded to two different hydrogen atoms. Because of
the higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom, the bonds are polar covalent ( polar bonds). The oxygen atom
attracts the shared electrons of the covalent bonds to a signiﬁcantly greater extent than the hydrogen atoms. As a
result, the oxygen atom acquires a partial negative charge (δ−), while the hydrogen atoms each acquire a partial
positive charge (δ+). The molecule adopts a bent structure because of the two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen
atom. The H-O-H bond angle is about 105°, slightly smaller than the ideal 109.5° of an sp3 hybridized atomic
orbital.
The bent shape of the water molecule is critical because the polar O-H bonds do not cancel one another and the
molecule as a whole is polar. Figure 15.2 illustrates the net polarity of the water molecule. The oxygen is the
negative end of the molecule, while the area between the hydrogen atoms is the positive end of the molecule.
Polar molecules attract one another by dipole-dipole forces as the positive end of one molecule is attracted to the
negative end of the nearby molecule. In the case of water, the highly polar O-H bonds results in very little electron

density around the hydrogen atoms. Each hydrogen atom is strongly attracted to the lone-pair electrons on an
adjacent oxygen atom. These are called hydrogen bonds and are stronger than conventional dipole-dipole forces.
Because each oxygen atom has two lone pairs, it can make hydrogen bonds to the hydrogen atoms of two separate
other molecules. The Figure 15.4 shows the result –an approximately tetrahedral geometry around each oxygen
atom consisting of two covalent bonds and two hydrogen bonds.

• Water is a molecular compound consisting of polar molecules that have a bent shape.
• The oxygen atom acquires a partial negative charge while the hydrogen atom acquires a partial positive charge.

15.2 Structure of Ice

• Describe the structure of ice.
• Explain why ice is less dense that liquid water.

Have you ever been ice skating?
Ice is an interesting and useful material. It can be used to cool food and keep it fresh. It can provide recreation, such
as ice-skating. Ice can do great damage when it freezes –roads can buckle, houses can be damaged, water pipes can
burst. All this happens because of a unique property of water and ice. When water freezes, it expands in volume
as ice is formed.

Structure of Ice

Liquid water is a ﬂuid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules
tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to
one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as
the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually
reaches its highest density at about 4°C.

0.9168

Between 4°C and 0°C, the density gradually decreases as the hydrogen bonds begin to form a network characterized
by a generally hexagonal structure with open spaces in the middle of the hexagons (see Figure 15.5).

FIGURE 15.5
The structure of liquid water (left) consists
of molecules connected by short-lived hy-
drogen bonds because water is a ﬂuid.
In ice (right),
the hydrogen bonds be-
come permanent, resulting in an intercon-
nected hexagonally-shaped framework of
molecules.

Ice is less dense than liquid water and so it ﬂoats. Ponds or lakes begin to freeze at the surface, closer to the cold
air. A layer of ice forms, but does not sink as it would if water did not have this unique structure dictated by its
shape, polarity, and hydrogen bonding. If the ice were to sink as it froze, entire lakes would freeze solid. Since the
ice does not sink, liquid water remains under the ice all winter long. This is important, as ﬁsh and other organisms
are capable of surviving through winter. Ice is one of only a very few solids that is less dense than its liquid form.

Summary

• Ice is less dense than liquid water.
• The intermolecular structure of ice has spaces that are not present in liquid water.

15.3 Physical Properties of Water

• Deﬁne surface tension.
• Deﬁne vapor pressure.
• Explain the phsyical properties of water in terms of hydrogen bonding.

What is this pan used for?
Water loss to the atmosphere is a signiﬁcant problem in many parts of the world. When water supplies are low,
anything that can be done to decrease water loss is important for farmers. An evaporation pan (seen above) can be
used to measure how fast water evaporates in a given location. This information can be used as part of projects to
develop ways to cut down on evaporation and increase the amount of usable water in a region.

Properties of Water

Compared to other molecular compounds of relatively low molar mass, ice melts at a very high temperature. A
great deal of energy is required to break apart the hydrogen-bonded network of ice and return it to the liquid
state. Likewise, the boiling point of water is very high. Most molecular compounds of similar molar mass are
gases at room temperature.

Surface Tension

Water has a high surface tension (attraction between molecules at the surface of a liquid) because of its hydrogen
bonding. Liquids that cannot hydrogen bond do not exhibit nearly as much surface tension. Surface tension can be
seen by the curved meniscus that forms when water is in a thin column such as a graduated cylinder or a buret.

Chapter 15. Water

FIGURE 15.6
The meniscus of water in a graduated cylinder forms because of water’s
hydrogen bonding.

Vapor Pressure

The vapor pressure of a liquid is the pressure of the vapor produced by evaporation of a liquid or solid above the
liquid or solid in a closed container. The hydrogen bonding between liquid water molecules explains why water has
an unusually low vapor pressure. Relatively few molecules of water are capable of escaping the surface of the liquid
and enter the vapor phase. Evaporation is slow and thus the vapor exerts a low pressure in a closed container. Low
vapor pressure is an important physical property of water, since lakes, oceans, and other large bodies of water would
all tend to evaporate much more quickly otherwise.
Vapor pressure is inﬂuenced by temperature. As the temperature increases, more molecules are released from the
surface of the liquid. This increases movement above the liquid surface, increasing the pressure in the vapor stage.
The image below illustrates the effect of temperature on vapor pressure.

Summary

• Water has high surface tension because of extensive hydrogen bonding.
• The vapor pressure of water is low due to hydrogen bonding.
• Vapor pressure increases as temperature increases.

Is snow an aqueous solution?
In the winter, the temperature often gets well below the freezing point of water. This condition can create problem
in car radiators. If the water freezes, water hoses will break, the engine block can crack, and signiﬁcant damage can
be done to the car.

Solute and Solvent

When one substance dissolves into another, a solution is formed. A solution is a homogeneous mixture consisting
of a solute dissolved into a solvent. The solute is the substance that is being dissolved, while the solvent is the
dissolving medium. Solutions can be formed with many different types and forms of solutes and solvents.
We know of many types of solutions. Check out a few examples in the Table 15.2.

We want to focus on solutions where the solvent is water. An aqueous solution is water that contains one or more
dissolved substances. The dissolved substances in an aqueous solution may be solids, gases, or other liquids. Some
examples are listed in the Table 15.2. Other examples include vinegar (acetic acid in water), alcoholic beverages
(ethanol in water), and liquid cough medicines (various drugs in water).

FIGURE 15.7
Typical solution –clear and stable.

In order to be a true solution, a mixture must be stable. When sugar is fully dissolved into water, it can stand for
an indeﬁnite amount of time and the sugar will not settle out of the solution. Further, if the sugar-water solution is
passed through a ﬁlter it will be unchanged. The dissolved sugar particles will pass through the ﬁlter along with the
water. This is because the dissolved particles in a solution are very small, usually less than 1 nm in diameter. Solute
particles can be atoms, ions, or molecules, depending on the type of substance that has been dissolved.

Summary

• A solution is a homogeneous mixture of a solute in a solvent.
• A solute is the material present in the smaller amount in the solution.
• A solvent is the material present in the larger amount in the solution.

How do you take your coffee?
Many people like to start their day with a cup of coffee (others need coffee all day long in order to get anything
done). The coffee you drink is a type of solution, often a very complex one. The coffee itself has been brewed
so that material from the coffee bean will dissolve in hot water. Some people add sugar, while others add milk or
cream.
In some areas of the country, lattés are popular; so one or more special ﬂavors might be added along with
the milk. Whatever the situation, the end-result is an enjoyable solution to drink.

The Dissolving Process

Water typically dissolves many ionic compounds and polar molecules. Nonpolar molecules such as those found in
grease or oil do not dissolve in water. We will ﬁrst examine the process that occurs when an ionic compound such
as table salt (sodium chloride) dissolves in water.
Water molecules move about continuously due to their kinetic energy. When a crystal of sodium chloride is placed
into water, the water’s molecules collide with the crystal lattice. Recall that the crystal lattice is composed of
alternating positive and negative ions. Water is attracted to the sodium chloride crystal because water is polar and
has both a positive and a negative end. The positively charged sodium ions in the crystal attract the oxygen end of
the water molecules because they are partially negative. The negatively charged chloride ions in the crystal attract
the hydrogen end of the water molecules because they are partially positive. The action of the polar water molecules
takes the crystal lattice apart (see image below).

710

www.ck12.org

Chapter 15. Water

After coming apart from the crystal, the individual ions are then surrounded by solvent particles in a process
called solvation. Note that the individual Na+ ions are surrounded by water molecules with the oxygen atom
oriented near the positive ion. Likewise, the chloride ions are surrounded by water molecules with the opposite
orientation. Hydration is the process of solute particles being surrounded by water molecules arranged in a speciﬁc
manner. Hydration helps to stabilize aqueous solutions by preventing the positive and negative ions from coming
back together and forming a precipitate.
Table sugar is sucrose (C12H22O11) and is an example of a molecular compound. Solid sugar consists of individual
sugar molecules held together by intermolecular attractive forces. When water dissolves sugar, it separates the
individual sugar molecules by disrupting the attractive forces, but does not break the covalent bonds between the
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Dissolved sugar molecules are also hydrated, but without as distinct an
orientation to the water molecules as in the case of the ions. The sugar molecule contains many -OH groups that can
form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules, helping form the sucrose solution.

Summary

• Motion of water molecules helps break up interactions between solid ions or molecules.
• Solvation involves surrounding ions with solvent particles.
• Ionic solute molecules are hydrated (surrounded by solvent molecules in a speciﬁc orientation).

15.6 Liquid-Liquid Solutions

• Describe solubility of non-polar compounds in water.

Does oil dissolve in water?
In 2010 a major oil spill occurred when an explosion on a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico released millions of
gallons of crude oil into the Gulf. Oil is primarily a mixture of hydrocarbons (organic compounds composed of
only carbon and hydrogen atoms). Because of its composition, oil does not dissolve in water. As a result, much of
the Gulf of Mexico was contaminated, as was a great deal of shoreline in the affected area.

Liquid-Liquid Solutions

Nonpolar compounds do not dissolve in water. The attractive forces that operate between the particles in a nonpolar
compound are weak dispersion forces. However, the nonpolar molecules are more attracted to themselves than they
are to the polar water molecules. When a nonpolar liquid such as oil is mixed with water, two separate layers form
because the liquids will not dissolve into each other ( Figure 15.8). When another polar liquid such as ethanol is
mixed with water, they completely blend and dissolve into one another. Liquids that dissolve in one another in all
proportions are said to be miscible. Liquids that do not dissolve in one another are called immiscible. The general
rule for deciding if one substance is capable of dissolving another is “like dissolves like.” A nonpolar solid such as
iodine will dissolve in nonpolar lighter ﬂuid, but will not dissolve in polar water.
For molecular compounds, the major factor that contributes to the material dissolving in water is the ability to form
hydrogen bonds with the water solvent. Small compounds such as methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, and acetone
have polar groups that can interact with the polar H of water. However, as the non-polar portion of the molecule

Water and oil form separate layers when they are mixed because the
nonpolar oil will not dissolve into the polar. The oil forms the top layer
because it is less dense than the water.

gets larger, solubility with water drops off. The non-polar portion of the molecule increasingly repels to water and
eventually overrides the interaction of the polar component with water.

• Non-polar molecules are usually insoluble in water.
• A nonionized molecule must be relatively polar to interact with water molecules.

Why do runners worry about losing electrolytes?
Millions of people in the world jog for exercise. For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay ﬁt. However,
problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be
life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deﬁciency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated,
individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many
sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body.

Electrolytes and Nonelectrolytes

An electrolyte is a compound that conducts an electric current when it is in an aqueous solution or melted. In order
to conduct a current, a substance must contain mobile ions that can move from one electrode to the other. All ionic
compounds are electrolytes. When ionic compounds dissolve, they break apart into ions which are then able to
conduct a current ( conductivity). Even insoluble ionic compounds such as CaCO3 are electrolytes because they
can conduct a current in the molten (melted) state.
A nonelectrolyte is a compound that does not conduct an electric current in either aqueous solution or in the
molten state. Many molecular compounds, such as sugar or ethanol, are nonelectrolytes. When these compounds
dissolve in water, they do not produce ions. The Figure 15.9 illustrates the difference between an electrolyte and a
nonelectrolyte.

Roles of Electrolytes in the Body

Several electrolytes play important roles in the body. Here are a few signiﬁcant electrolytes:

1. calcium –in bone and teeth. Also important for muscle contraction, blood clotting, and nerve function.
2. sodium –found outside the cell. Mainly involved in water balance as well as nerve signaling.
3. potassium –major cation inside the cell. Important for proper functioning of heart, muscles, kidneys, and

nerves.

4. magnesium –in bone and cells. Involved in muscle, bone, nervous system, and takes part in many biochemical

reactions.

dissolve and break up into the ions that make up the compound.

Dissociation

An ionic crystal lattice breaks apart when it is dissolved in water. Dissociation is the separation of ions that occurs
when a solid ionic compound dissolves. It is important to be able to write dissociation equations. Simply undo the
crisscross method that you learned when writing chemical formulas of ionic compounds. The subscripts for the ions
in the chemical formulas become the coefﬁcients of the respective ions on the product side of the equation. Shown
below are dissociation equations for NaCl, Ca(NO3)2, and (NH4)3PO4.

NaCl(s) → Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
Ca(NO3)2(aq) → Ca2+(aq) + 2NO3
(NH4)3PO4(s) → 3NH4
+(aq) + PO4

−(aq)
3−(aq)

The formula unit of sodium chloride dissociates into one sodium ion and one chloride ion. The calcium nitrate
formula unit dissociates into one calcium ion and two nitrate ions. This is because of the 2+ charge of the calcium

ion. Two nitrate ions, each with a 1− charge are required to make the equation balance electrically. The ammonium
phosphate formula unit dissociates into three ammonium ions and one phosphate ion. Note that the polyatomic ions
themselves do not dissociate further, but remain intact.
Do not confuse the subscripts of the atoms within the polyatomic ion for the subscripts that result from the crisscross-
ing of the charges that make the original compound neutral. The 3 subscript of the nitrate ion and the 4 subscript
of the ammonium ion are part of the polyatomic ion and simply remain as part of its formula after the compound
dissociates. Notice that the compounds are solids (s) which then become ions in aqueous solution (aq).

• Explain how to write equations for a weak electrolyte in solution.

Can car batteries be hazardous?
Car batteries, like the one shown above, are used around the world to provide the power to start car engines. One
essential component of car batteries is the strong electrolyte sulfuric acid.
In the battery, this material ionizes into
hydrogen ions and sulfate ions. As the battery is used, the concentrations of these ions decrease. Older batteries
had openings in the top where new sulfuric acid could be added to replenish the supply. Today, batteries are sealed
to prevent leakage of the hazardous sulfuric acid.

Strong and Weak Electrolytes

Some polar molecular compounds are nonelectrolytes when they are in their pure state, but become electrolytes
when they are dissolved in water. Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a gas in its pure molecular state and is a nonelec-
trolyte. However, when HCl is dissolved in water, it conducts a current well because the HCl molecule ionizes into
hydrogen and chloride ions.

HCl(g) → H+(aq) + Cl−(aq)

When HCl is dissolved into water, it is called hydrochloric acid. Ionic compounds and some polar compounds are
completely broken apart into ions and thus conduct a current very well. A strong electrolyte is a solution in which
a large fraction of the dissolved solute exists as ions.
Some other polar molecular compounds become electrolytes upon being dissolved into water, but do not ionize to
very great extent. Gaseous nitrous acid ionizes in solution into hydrogen ions and nitrite ions, but does so very
weakly. Aqueous nitrous acid is composed of only about 5% ions and 95% intact nitrous acid molecules. A weak
electrolyte is a solution in which only a small fraction of the dissolved solute exists as ions. The equation showing

15.10 Suspensions

• Deﬁne suspension.
• Describe the properties and behavior of some typical suspensions.

Why is the sea clear on some days, but not on others?
On a calm day, the Caribbean Sea is clear and smooth. You can see deep into the water, deep enough to see ﬁsh
and underwater plant life without obstruction. The situation changes markedly when a storm blows up. The sand
on the bottom of the sea is stirred up, the water becomes turbid, and you can’t see anything below the surface. The
sand forms a suspension in the water that slowly clears up again after the storm blows over.

Suspensions

Take a glass of water and throw in a handful of sand or dirt. Stir it and stir it and stir it. The water may become
turbid, or unclear. Have you made a solution? Sand and dirt do not dissolve in water and though it may look
homogeneous for a few moments, the sand or dirt gradually sinks to the bottom of the glass.

Chapter 15. Water

A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which some of the particles settle out of the mixture upon standing. The
particles in a suspension are far larger than those of a solution and thus gravity is able to pull them down out of the
dispersion medium (water). The typical diameter for the dispersed particles (the sand) of a suspension is about 1000
times greater than those of a solution (less than approximately two nanometers for particles in solution, compared
to greater than 1000 nanometers for particles in suspension). Unlike in a solution, the dispersed particles can be
separated from the dispersion medium by ﬁltering. Suspensions are heterogeneous because at least two different
substances in the mixture can be identiﬁed.

Some Typical Aqueous Suspensions

a. milk
Milk is a complex mixture of water, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and minerals. While the minerals and carbohy-
drates are water-soluble, the fats and some of the proteins do not dissolve but are held in suspension.
b. paint
Paint can either be water-based or use an organic solvent. For our discussion, we will limit ourselves to water-based
paints. The materials will contain binders (organic polymers that help hold the paint to the surface of the material
being painted). In addition, pigments are included to provide the desired color. Both the binders and the pigments
are not water-soluble, so the paint must be stirred every time it is used. Paint that is allowed to sit for a long period
of time will slowly begin to separate as the suspension of binders and pigments settles out.

Summary

• Suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures.
• Some of the material in a suspension will settle out on standing.
• Solid material in a suspension can be removed by ﬁltration.

What type of mixture is a smoke ﬂare?
Imagine you are sailing on a yacht. The engine suddenly breaks down and you are stranded in the middle of the
ocean. You call the Coast Guard on your radio, but cannot give them an exact location because your GPS isn’t
working. Fortunately, you have a smoke ﬂare, which you ﬁre off. The dense colored smoke shows the Coast Guard
where you are so they can rescue you.
In using the ﬂare, you are taking advantage of a type of mixture called a
colloid.

Colloids

A colloid is a heterogeneous mixture whose particle size is intermediate between those of a solution and a suspen-
sion. The dispersed particles are spread evenly throughout the dispersion medium, which can be a solid, liquid, or
gas. Because the dispersed particles of a colloid are not as large as those of a suspension, they do not settle out upon
standing. The Table 15.3 summarizes the properties and distinctions between solutions, colloids, and suspensions.

Colloids are unlike solutions because their dispersed particles are much larger than those of a solution. The dispersed
particles of a colloid cannot be separated by ﬁltration, but they scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect.

Tyndall Effect

When light is passed through a true solution, the dissolved particles are too small to deﬂect the light. However, the
dispersed particles of a colloid, being larger, do deﬂect light. The Tyndall effect is the scattering of visible light by
colloidal particles. You have undoubtedly “seen” a light beam as it passes through fog, smoke, or a scattering of
dust particles suspended in air. All three are examples of colloids. Suspensions may scatter light, but if the number
of suspended particles is sufﬁciently large, the suspension may simply be opaque and the light scattering will not
occur.

FIGURE 15.12
The Tyndall effect allows sunlight to be
seen as it passes through a ﬁne mist.

Examples of Colloids
The Table 15.4 lists examples of colloidal systems, most of which are very familiar. The dispersed phase describes
the particles, while the dispersion medium is the material in which the particles are distributed.

Another property of a colloidal system is the observed when the colloids are studied under a light microscope. The
colloids scintillate, reﬂecting brief ﬂashes of light because the colloidal particles move in a rapid and random
fashion. This phenomenon, called Brownian motion, is caused by collisions between the small colloidal particles
and the molecules of the dispersion medium.

Emulsions

Butter and mayonnaise are examples of a class of colloids called emulsions. An emulsion is a colloidal dispersion
of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid. A stable emulsion requires an emulsifying agent to be present. Mayonnaise
is made in part of oil and vinegar. Since oil is nonpolar and vinegar is an aqueous solution and polar, the two do not
mix and would quickly separate into layers. However, the addition of egg yolk causes the mixture to become stable
and not separate. Egg yolk is capable of interacting with both the polar vinegar and the nonpolar oil. The egg yolk
is called the emulsifying agent. Soap acts as an emulsifying agent between grease and water. Grease cannot be
simply rinsed off your hands or another surface because it is insoluble. However, the soap stabilizes a grease-water
mixture because one end of a soap molecule is polar and the other end is nonpolar. This allows the grease to be
removed from your hands or your clothing by washing with soapy water.

• A colloid is a heterogeneous mixture whose particle size is intermediate between those of a solution and a

suspension.

16.1 Solute-Solvent Combinations

• Describe different types of solutions and give an example of each.

Have you ever been in a band?

Dixieland music arose in New Orleans in the early 1900s. This driving style of music emphasized improvisation
on the basic musical theme. Much of the sound quality associated with this music is due to the brass instruments
(including the trumpet, trombone, and tuba). New Orleans is still the home of Dixieland, and the French Quarter
echoes nightly to the sounds of this exciting music.

Solute-Solvent Combinations

The focus of Water was on water’s role in the formation of aqueous solutions. We examined the primary characteris-
tics of a solution, how water is able to dissolve solid solutes, and we differentiated between a solution, a suspension,
and a colloid. There are many examples of solutions that do not involve water at all, or that involve solutes that are
not solids. The Table 16.1 summarizes the possible combinations of solute-solvent states, along with examples of
each.

Our air is a homogeneous mixture of many different gases and therefore qualiﬁes as a solution. Approximately 78%
of the atmosphere is nitrogen, making it the solvent for this solution. The next major constituent is oxygen (about
21%), followed by the inert gas argon (0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.03%) and trace amounts of neon, methane, helium,
and other gases.

Solid-Solid Solutions

Solid-solid solutions such as brass, bronze, and sterling silver are called alloys. Bronze (composed mainly of copper
with added tin) was widely used in making weapons in times past dating back to at least 2400 B.C. This metal alloy
was hard and tough, but was eventually replaced by iron.

Liquid-Solid Solutions

Perhaps the most familiar liquid-solid solution is dental amalgam, used to ﬁll teeth when there is a cavity. Approxi-
mately 50% of the amalgam material is liquid mercury to which a powdered alloy of silver, tin and copper is added.
Mercury is used because it binds well with the solid metal alloy. However, the use of mercury-based dental amalgam
has gone under question in recent years because of concerns regarding the toxicity of mercury.

Summary

• Solutions may be composed of a variety of solid, liquid, or gaseous materials.

Chapter 16. Solutions

16.2 Rate of Dissolving

• List and describe factors that affect the rate of dissolving.

How sweet do you like your tea?
Many people enjoy a cold glass of iced tea on a hot summer day. Some like it unsweetened, while others like to put
sugar in it. How fast the sugar dissolved depends on several factors: how much sugar was put in the tea and how
cold it is? You usually have to stir the tea for a while to get all the sugar dissolved.

Rate of Dissolving

We know that the dissolving of a solid by water depends upon the collisions that occur between the solvent molecules
and the particles in the solid crystal. Anything that can be done to increase the frequency of those collisions and/or
to give those collisions more energy will increase the rate of dissolving. Imagine that you were trying to dissolve
some sugar in a glassful of tea. A packet of granulated sugar would dissolve faster than a cube of sugar. The rate
of dissolving would be increased by stirring, or agitating the solution. Finally, the sugar would dissolve faster in hot
tea than it would in cold tea.

Surface Area

The rate at which a solute dissolves depends upon the size of the solute particles. Dissolving is a surface phenomenon
since it depends on solvent molecules colliding with the outer surface of the solute. A given quantity of solute
dissolves faster when it is ground into small particles than if it is in the form of a large chunk because more surface
area is exposed. The packet of granulated sugar exposes far more surface area to the solvent and dissolves more
quickly than the sugar cube.

733

16.2. Rate of Dissolving

Agitation of the Solution

www.ck12.org

Dissolving sugar in water will occur more quickly if the water is stirred. The stirring allows fresh solvent molecules
to continually be in contact with the solute. If it is not stirred, then the water right at the surface of the solute becomes
saturated with dissolved sugar molecules, meaning that it is more difﬁcult for additional solute to dissolve. The sugar
cube would eventually dissolve because random motions of the water molecules would bring enough fresh solvent
into contact with the sugar, but the process would take much longer. It is important to realize that neither stirring nor
breaking up a solute affect the overall amount of solute that dissolves. It only affects the rate of dissolving.

Temperature

Heating up the solvent gives the molecules more kinetic energy. The more rapid motion means that the solvent
molecules collide with the solute with greater frequency and the collisions occur with more force. Both factors
increase the rate at which the solute dissolves. As we will see in the next section, a temperature change not only
affects the rate of dissolving, but also affects the amount of solute that dissolves.

Summary

• The rate of dissolving is inﬂuenced by surface area, stirring, and temperature.

recrystallization can be used to remove these impurities. The crystals are dissolved in a hot solvent, forming a
solution. When the solvent is cooled the compound is no longer as soluble and will precipitate out of solution,
leaving other materials still dissolved.

Saturated and Unsaturated Solutions

Table salt (NaCl) readily dissolves in water. Suppose that you have a beaker of water to which you add some salt,
stirring until it dissolves. So you add more and that dissolves. You keep adding more and more salt, eventually
reaching a point that no more of the salt will dissolve no matter how long or how vigorously you stir it. Why? On
the molecular level, we know that action of the water causes the individual ions to break apart from the salt crystal
and enter the solution, where they remain hydrated by water molecules. What also happens is that some of the
dissolved ions collide back again with the crystal and remain there. Recrystallization is the process of dissolved
solute returning to the solid state. At some point the rate at which the solid salt is dissolving becomes equal to the
rate at which the dissolved solute is recrystallizing. When that point is reached, the total amount of dissolved salt
remains unchanged. Solution equilibrium is the physical state described by the opposing processes of dissolution
and recrystallization occurring at the same rate. The solution equilibrium for the dissolving of sodium chloride can
be represented by one of two equations.

While this shows the change of state back and forth between solid and aqueous solution, the preferred equation also
shows the dissociation that occurs as an ionic solid dissolves.

NaCl(s) (cid:29) Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq)

When the solution equilibrium point is reached and no more solute will dissolve, the solution is said to be saturated.
A saturated solution is a solution that contains the maximum amount of solute that is capable of being dissolved.
At 20°C, the maximum amount of NaCl that will dissolve in 100. g of water is 36.0 g. If any more NaCl is added
past that point, it will not dissolve because the solution is saturated. What if more water is added to the solution
instead? Now more NaCl would be capable of dissolving in the additional solvent. An unsaturated solution is
a solution that contains less than the maximum amount of solute that is capable of being dissolved. Figure 16.1
illustrates the above process and shows the distinction between unsaturated and saturated.

FIGURE 16.1
When 30.0 g of NaCl is added to 100 ml
of water, it all dissolves, forming an unsat-
urated solution. When 40.0 g is added,
36.0 g dissolves and 4.0 g remains undis-
solved, forming a saturated solution.

How can you tell if a solution is saturated or unsaturated? If more solute is added and it does not dissolve, then the
original solution was saturated. If the added solute dissolves, then the original solution was unsaturated. A solution
that has been allowed to reach equilibrium but which has extra undissolved solute at the bottom of the container
must be saturated.

Summary

• Saturated and unsaturated solutions are deﬁned.
• Solution equilibrium exists when the rate of dissolving equals the rate of recrystallization.

• Describe the inﬂuence of temperature on the solubility of solids in water.
• Describe the inﬂuence of temperature on the solubility of gases in water.

What happens to the ﬁsh in the water next to a nuclear power plant?
Nuclear power plants require large amounts of water to generate steam for the turbines and to cool the equipment.
They will usually be situated near bodies of water to use that water as a coolant, returning the warmer water back to
the lake or river. This increases the overall temperature of the water, which lowers the quantity of dissolved oxygen,
affecting the survival of ﬁsh and other organisms.

How Temperature Inﬂuences Solubility

The solubility of a substance is the amount of that substance that is required to form a saturated solution in a given
amount of solvent at a speciﬁed temperature. Solubility is often measured as the grams of solute per 100 g of
solvent. The solubility of sodium chloride in water is 36.0 g per 100 g water at 20◦C. The temperature must be
speciﬁed because solubility varies with temperature. For gases, the pressure must also be speciﬁed. Solubility is
speciﬁc for a particular solvent. We will consider solubility of material in water as solvent.
The solubility of the majority of solid substances increases as the temperature increases. However, the effect is
difﬁcult to predict and varies widely from one solute to another. The temperature dependence of solubility can be
visualized with the help of a solubility curve, a graph of the solubility vs. temperature (see Figure 16.2).
Notice how the temperature dependence of NaCl is fairly ﬂat, meaning that an increase in temperature has relatively
little effect on the solubility of NaCl. The curve for KNO3, on the other hand, is very steep and so an increase in
temperature dramatically increases the solubility of KNO3.

Chapter 16. Solutions

FIGURE 16.2
Solubility curves for several compounds.

Several substances – HCl, NH3, and SO2 – have solubility that decreases as temperature increases. They are all
gases at standard pressure. When a solvent with a gas dissolved in it is heated, the kinetic energy of both the solvent
and solute increases. As the kinetic energy of the gaseous solute increases, its molecules have a greater tendency to
escape the attraction of the solvent molecules and return to the gas phase. Therefore, the solubility of a gas decreases
as the temperature increases.
Solubility curves can be used to determine if a given solution is saturated or unsaturated. Suppose that 80 g of KNO3
is added to 100 g of water at 30◦C. According to the solubility curve, approximately 48 g of KNO3 will dissolve at
30◦C. This means that the solution will be saturated since 48 g is less than 80 g. We can also determine that there will
be 80 - 48 = 32 g of undissolved KNO3 remaining at the bottom of the container. Now suppose that this saturated
solution is heated to 60◦C. According to the curve, the solubility of KNO3 at 60◦C is about 107 g. Now the solution
is unsaturated since it contains only the original 80 g of dissolved solute. Now suppose the solution is cooled all the
way down to 0◦C. The solubility at 0◦C is about 14 g, meaning that 80 - 14 = 66 g of the KNO3 will recrystallize.

• Describe the process of supersaturation.

How does a hot or a cold pack work?
In the picture above, a thermal pack is applied to the back. Small packs can be used either for heating or cooling,
depending on the material used. A heat pack contains a supersaturated solution of material such as sodium acetate.
The solution is clear until a small metal trigger is activated. The sodium acetate then crystallizes out of solution and
generates heat in the process.

Some solutes, such as sodium acetate, do not recrystallize easily. Suppose an exactly saturated solution of sodium
acetate is prepared at 50°C. As it cools back to room temperature, no crystals appear in the solution, even though

the solubility of sodium acetate is lower at room temperature. A supersaturated solution is a solution that contains
more than the maximum amount of solute that is capable of being dissolved at a given temperature. The recrystal-
lization of the excess dissolved solute in a supersaturated solution can be initiated by the addition of a tiny crystal of
solute, called a seed crystal. The seed crystal provides a nucleation site on which the excess dissolved crystals can
begin to grow. Recrystallization from a supersaturated solution is typically very fast.

16.6 Henry’s Law

• State Henry’s Law.
• Perform calculations involving Henry’s Law.

How is sipping soda in outer space different then on Earth?
Having a soft drink in outer space poses some special problems. Under microgravity, the carbonation could quickly
dissipate if not kept under pressure. You can’t open the can or you will lose carbonation. So a special pressurized
container has been developed to get around the problem of gas loss at low gravity.

Henry’s Law

Pressure has very little effect on the solubility of solids or liquids, but has a signiﬁcant effect on the solubility of
gases. Gas solubility increases as the partial pressure of a gas above the liquid increases. Suppose a certain volume
of water is in a closed container with the space above it occupied by carbon dioxide gas at standard pressure. Some
of the CO2 molecules come into contact with the surface of the water and dissolve into the liquid. Now suppose that
more CO2 is added to the space above the container, causing a pressure increase. More CO2 molecules are now in
contact with the water and so more of them dissolve. Thus the solubility increases as the pressure increases. As with
a solid, the CO2 that is undissolved reaches an equilibrium with the dissolved CO2, represented by the following
equation.

CO2(g) (cid:29) CO2(aq)

743

16.6. Henry’s Law

www.ck12.org

At equilibrium, the rate of gaseous CO2 dissolving is equal to the rate of dissolved CO2 coming out of the solution.
When carbonated beverages are packaged, they are done so under high CO2 pressure so that a large amount of carbon
dioxide dissolves in the liquid. When the bottle is open, the equilibrium is disrupted because the CO2 pressure above
the liquid decreases. Immediately, bubbles of CO2 rapidly exit the solution and escape out of the top of the open
bottle. The amount of dissolve CO2 decreases. If the bottle is left open for an extended period of time, the beverage
becomes “ﬂat” as more and more CO2 comes out of the liquid.
The relationship of gas solubility to pressure is described by Henry’s law, named after English chemist William
Henry (1774-1836). Henry’s Law states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial
pressure of the gas above the liquid. Henry’s law can be written as follows:

S1
P1

=

S2
P2

S1 and P1 are the solubility and the pressure at an initial set of conditions; S2 and P2 are the solubility and pressure
at another changed set of conditions. Solubilities of gases are typically reported in g/L, as seen in sample problem
16.1.

Sample Problem:

The solubility of a certain gas in water is 0.745 g/L at standard pressure. What is its solubility when the pressure
above the solution is raised to 4.50 atm? The temperature is constant at 20°C.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• S1 = 0.745 g/L
• P1 = 1.00 atm
• P2 = 4.50 atm

Unknown

• S2 = ? g/L

Substitute into Henry’s law and solve for S2.
Step 2: Solve.

S2 =

S1 × P2

P1

=

0.745 g/L× 4.50 atm

1.00 atm

= 3.35 g/L

Step 3: Think about your result.
The solubility is increased to 4.5 times its original value according to the direct relationship.

Summary

• The pressure above a liquid affects the solubility of a gas in the liquid.

16.7 Percent Solutions

• Deﬁne concentration.
• Perform calculations involving mass percent and volume percent solutions.

How many is too much?
There are cultures that have no numbers above three. Anything greater than that is simply referred to as “much” or
“many”. We recognize how limited this form of calculation is, but we do some of the same thing. There are several
ways to express the amount of solute in a solution in a quantitative manner. The concentration of a solution is a
measure of the amount of solute that has been dissolved in a given amount of solvent or solution. A concentrated
solution is one that has a relatively large amount of dissolved solute. A dilute solution is one that has a relatively
small amount of dissolved solute. However, those terms are vague and we need to be able to express concentration
with numbers.

Percent Solutions

One way to describe the concentration of a solution is by the percent of a solute in the solvent. The percent can
further be determined in one of two ways: (1) the ratio of the mass of the solute divided by the mass of the solution
or (2) the ratio of the volume of the solute divided by the volume of the solution.

Mass Percent

When the solute in a solution is a solid, a convenient way to express the concentration is a mass percent(cid:0)mass

which is the grams of solute per 100 g of solution.

(cid:1),

mass

Percent by mass =

mass of solute
mass of solution

× 100%

Suppose that a solution was prepared by dissolving 25.0 g of sugar into 100 g of water. The percent by mass would
be calculated by:

Percent by mass =

25 g sugar

125 g solution

× 100% = 20% sugar

746

www.ck12.org

Chapter 16. Solutions

Sometimes you may want to make up a particular mass of solution of a given percent by mass and need to calculate
what mass of the solvent to use. For example, you need to make 3000 g of a 5% solution of sodium chloride. You
can rearrange and solve for the mass of solute.

mass of solute =

percent by mass

100%

× mass of solution =

5%
100%

× 3000 g = 150 g NaCl

You would need to weigh out 150 g of NaCl and add it to 2850 g of water. Notice that it was necessary to subtract
the mass of the NaCl (150 g) from the mass of solution (3000 g) to calculate the mass of the water that would need
to be added.

Volume Percent

(cid:16)volume

(cid:17)

The percentage of solute in a solution can more easily be determined by volume when the solute and solvent are
both liquids. The volume of the solute divided by the volume of solution expressed as a percent yields the percent by
volume
of the solution. If a solution is made by adding 40 mL of ethanol to 20 mL of water, the percent
by volume is:

volume

Percent by volume =

=

volume of solute
volume of solution
40 mL ethanol

Frequently, ingredient labels on food products and medicines have amounts listed as percentages (see Figure 16.3).

16.8 Molarity

• Deﬁne molarity.
• Perform calculations involving molarity.

How many molecules can be found in a reaction?
Chemists deal with amounts of molecules every day. Our reactions are described as so many molecules of compound
A reacting with so many molecules of compound B to form so many molecules of compound C. When we determine
how much reagent to use, we need to know the number of molecules in a given volume of the reagent. Percent
solutions only tell us the number of grams, not molecules. A 100 mL solution of 2% NaCl will have a very different
number of molecules than a 2% solution of CsCl. So we need another way to talk about numbers of molecules.

Molarity

Chemists primarily need the concentration of solutions to be expressed in a way that accounts for the number of
particles that react according to a particular chemical equation. Since percentage measurements are based on either
mass or volume, they are generally not useful for chemical reactions. A concentration unit based on moles is
preferable. The molarity (M) of a solution is the number of moles of solute dissolved in one liter of solution. To
calculate the molarity of a solution, you divide the moles of solute by the volume of the solution expressed in liters.

Molarity (M) =

moles of solute
liters of solution

=

mol
L

Note that the volume is in liters of solution and not liters of solvent. When a molarity is reported, the unit is the
symbol M and is read as “molar”. For example a solution labeled as 1.5 M NH3 is read as “1.5 molar ammonia
solution”.

Sample Problem: Calculating Molarity

A solution is prepared by dissolving 42.23 g of NH4Cl into enough water to make 500.0 mL of solution. Calculate
its molarity.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.

Known
mass = 42.23 g NH4Cl
molar mass NH4Cl = 53.50 g/mol
volume solution = 500.0 mL = 0.5000 L

Unknown
molarity = ? M

The mass of the ammonium chloride is ﬁrst converted to moles. Then the molarity is calculated by dividing by liters.
Note the given volume has been converted to liters.
Step 2: Solve.

42.23 g NH4Cl × 1 mol NH4Cl
0.7893 mol NH4Cl

53.50 g NH4Cl = 0.7893 mol NH4Cl

0.5000 L

= 1.579 M

Step 3: Think about your result.
The molarity is 1.579 M, meaning that a liter of the solution would contain 1.579 mol NH4Cl. Four signiﬁcant
ﬁgures are appropriate.
In a laboratory situation, a chemist must frequently prepare a given volume of solutions of a known molarity. The
task is to calculate the mass of the solute that is necessary. The molarity equation can be rearranged to solve for
moles, which can then be converted to grams. See sample problem 16.3.

Sample Problem:

A chemist needs to prepare 3.00 L of a 0.250 M solution of potassium permanganate (KMnO4). What mass of
KMnO4 does she need to make the solution?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.

• molarity = 0.250 M
• volume = 3.00 L
• molar mass KMnO4 = 158.04 g/mol

Unknown

• mass KMnO4 = ? g

Moles of solute is calculated by multiplying molarity by liters. Then, moles is converted to grams.
Step 2: Solve.

1 mol KMnO4

= 119 g KMnO4

Step 3: Think about your result.
When 119 g of potassium permanganate is dissolved into water to make 3.00 L of solution, the molarity is 0.250 M.

16.9 Preparing Solutions

• Describe the process for preparing solutions.

How much water do I add?
Back in the “good old days” (whenever that really was), many cooks didn’t bother with careful measurements. They
“just knew” how much ﬂour to use or how much water to add. Most of us need somewhat more precise ways to
measure when we cook. Chemists are very careful when they prepare solutions since the results of their experiments
need to be quantitative. “Just knowing” is not accurate enough for scientiﬁc purposes.

Preparing Solutions

If you are attempting to prepare 1.00 L of a 1.00 solution of NaCl, you would obtain 58.44 g of sodium chloride.
However you cannot simply add the sodium chloride to 1.00 L of water. After the solute dissolves, the volume of
the solution will be slightly greater than a liter because the hydrated sodium and chloride ions take up space in the
solution. Instead, a volumetric ﬂask needs to be used. Volumetric ﬂasks come in a variety of sizes (see image
below) and are designed to allow a chemist to prepare a solution only of one speciﬁc volume.

752

www.ck12.org

Chapter 16. Solutions

In other words, you cannot use a 1-liter volumetric ﬂask to make 500 ml of a solution. It can only be used to prepare
1 liter of a solution. The steps to follow when preparing a solution with a 1-liter volumetric ﬂask are outlined below
and shown in the Figure 16.4.

1. The appropriate mass of solute is weighed out and added to volumetric ﬂask that has been about half-ﬁlled

with distilled water.

2. The solution is swirled until all of the solute dissolves.
3. More distilled water is carefully added up to the line etched on the neck of the ﬂask.
4. The ﬂask is capped and inverted several times to completely mix.

16.10 Dilution

• Perform calculations involving dilutions.

How do you clean concrete?
Muriatic acid (another name for HCl) is widely used for cleaning concrete and masonry surfaces. The acid must be
diluted before use to get it down to a safer strength. Commercially available at concentrations of about 18%, this
compound can be used to remove scales and deposits (usually composed of basic materials).

Dilutions

When additional water is added to an aqueous solution, the concentration of that solution decreases. This is because
the number of moles of the solute does not change, while the volume of the solution increases. We can set up an
equality between the moles of the solute before the dilution (1) and the moles of the solute after the dilution (2).

Since the moles of solute in a solution is equal to the molarity multiplied by the liters, we can set those equal.

mol1 = mol2

M1 × L1 = M2 × L2

Finally, because the two sides of the equation are set equal to one another, the volume can be in any units we choose,
as long as that unit is the same on both sides. Our equation for calculating the molarity of a diluted solution becomes:

755

16.10. Dilution

www.ck12.org

M1 ×V1 = M2 ×V2

Suppose that you have 100. mL of a 2.0 M solution of HCl. You dilute the solution by adding enough water to make
the solution volume 500. mL. The new molarity can easily be calculated by using the above equation and solving
for M2.

M2 =

M1 ×V1

V2

=

2.0 M× 100. mL

500. mL

= 0.40 M HCl

The solution has been diluted by one-ﬁfth since the new volume is ﬁve times as great as the original volume.
Consequently, the molarity is one-ﬁfth of its original value.
Another common dilution problem involves deciding how much of a highly concentrated solution is requires to make
a desired quantity of solution of lesser concentration. The highly concentrated solution is typically referred to as the
stock solution.

Sample Problem: Dilution of a Stock Solution

Nitric acid (HNO3) is a powerful and corrosive acid. When ordered from a chemical supply company, its molarity
is 16 M. How much of the stock solution of nitric acid needs to be used to make 8.00 L of a 0.50 M solution?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• stock HNO3 = 16 M
• V2 = 8.00 L
• M2 = 0.50 M

Unknown

• volume stock HNO3 (V1) =? L

The unknown in the equation is V1, the volume of the concentrated stock solution.
Step 2: Solve.

V1 =

M2 ×V2

M1

=

0.50 M× 8.00 L

16 M

= 0.25 L = 250 mL

Step 3: Think about your result.
250 mL of the stock HNO3 needs to be diluted with water to a ﬁnal volume of 8.00 L. The dilution is by a factor of
32 to go from 16 M to 0.5 M.
Dilutions can be performed in the laboratory with various tools, depending on the volumes required and the desired
accuracy. The following images illustrate the use of two different types of pipettes. The images below illustrate

16.11 Molality

• Deﬁne molality.
• Perform calculations involving molality.

How do you measure physical parameters of solutions?
For many purposes, the use of molarity is very convenient. However, when we want to know the concentration
of solute present in situations where there are temperature changes, molarity won’t work. The volume of the
solution will change somewhat with temperature, enough to make accurate data observations and calculations in
error. Another parameter is needed, one not affected by the temperature of the material we are studying.

Molality

A ﬁnal way to express the concentration of a solution is by its molality. The molality (m) of a solution is the moles
of solute divided by the kilograms of solvent. A solution that contains 1.0 mol of NaCl dissolved into 1.0 kg of water
is a “one-molal” solution of sodium chloride. The symbol for molality is a lower-case m written in italics.

Molality (m) =

moles of solute

kilograms of solvent

=

kg

Molality differs from molarity only in the denominator. While molarity is based on the liters of solution, molality
is based on the kilograms of solvent. Concentrations expressed in molality are used when studying properties of
solutions related to vapor pressure and temperature changes. Molality is used because its value does not change with
changes in temperature. The volume of a solution, on the other hand, is slightly dependent upon temperature.

Sample Problem: Calculating Molality

Determine the molality of a solution prepared by dissolving 28.60 g of glucose (C6H12O6) into 250. g of water.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• mass solute= 28.60 g C6H12O6
• mass solvent = 250. g = 0.250 kg
• molar mass C6H12O6 = 180.18 g/mol

Unknown

• molality = ? m

Convert grams of glucose to moles and divide by the mass of the water in kilograms.
Step 2: Solve.

28.60 g C6H12O6 × 1 mol C6H12O6
180.18 g C6H12O6
0.1587 mol C6H12O6

0.250 kg H2O

= 0.1587 mol C6H12O6

= 0.635 m C6H12O6

Step 3: Think about your result.
The answer represents the moles of glucose per kilogram of water and has three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Molality and molarity are closely related in value for dilute aqueous solutions because the density of those solutions
is relatively close to 1.0 g/mL. This means that 1.0 L of solution has nearly a mass of 1.0 kg. As the solution
becomes more concentrated, its density will not be as close to 1.0 g/ml and the molality value will be different than
the molarity. For solutions with solvents other than water, the molality will be very different than the molarity. Make
sure that you are paying attention to which quantity is being used in a given problem.

16.12 Vapor Pressure Lowering

• Deﬁne colligative property.
• Deﬁne vapor pressure.
• Use vapor pressure to explain colligative properties of solutions.

What did Caesar say?
Latin is an interesting and useful language, even if you don’t want to read Julius Caesar’s writings. A knowledge of
Latin helps us understand our own language better. Take the word “colligative.” Where did that come from? If you
know a little Latin, you know that it comes from two Latin words meaning “to tie together.” This helps you better
understand some of the science terminology we use every day.

Vapor Pressure Lowering

A colligative property is a property of a solution that depends only on the number of solute particles dissolved
in the solution and not on their identity. Recall that the vapor pressure of a liquid is determined by how easily its
molecules are able to escape the surface of the liquid and enter the gaseous phase. When a liquid evaporates easily,
it will have a relatively large number of its molecules in the gas phase and thus will have a high vapor pressure.
Liquids that do not evaporate easily have a lower vapor pressure. The Figure 16.7 shows the surface of a pure
solvent compared to a solution. In the picture on the left, the surface is entirely occupied by liquid molecules, some
of which will evaporate and form a vapor pressure. On the right, a nonvolatile solute has been dissolved into the
solvent. Nonvolatile means that the solute itself has little tendency to evaporate. Because some of the surface is
now occupied by solute particles, there is less room for solvent molecules. This results in less solvent being able to
evaporate. The addition of a nonvolatile solute results in a lowering of the vapor pressure of the solvent.

760

www.ck12.org

Chapter 16. Solutions

FIGURE 16.7
The solution on the right
left has had
some of its solvent particles replaced by
solute particles. Since the solute particles
do not evaporate, the vapor pressure of
the solution is lower than that of the pure
solvent.

The lowering of the vapor pressure depends on the number of solute particles that have been dissolved. The chemical
nature of the solute is not important because the vapor pressure is merely a physical property of the solvent. The
only requirement is that the solute only dissolved and does not undergo a chemical reaction with the solvent.
While the chemical nature of the solute is not a factor, it is necessary to take into account whether the solute is an
electrolyte or a nonelectrolyte. Recall that ionic compounds are strong electrolytes and thus dissociate into ions
when they dissolve. This results in a larger number of dissolved particles. For example, consider two different
solutions of equal concentration. One is made from the ionic compound sodium chloride, while the other is made
from the molecular compound glucose. The following equations show what happens when these solutes dissolve.

NaCl(s) → Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
C6H12O6(s) → C6H12O6(aq)

2 dissolved particles
1 dissolved particle

The sodium chloride dissociates into two ions, while the glucose does not dissociate. Therefore, equal concentrations
of each solution will result in twice as many dissolved particles in the case of the sodium chloride. The vapor pressure
of the sodium chloride solution will be lowered twice the amount as the glucose solution.

Summary

• Addition of a nonvolatile solute to a solution lowers the vapor pressure of the solution.

16.13 Freezing Point Depression

• Deﬁne freezing point depression.
• Calculate the freezing point of a solution when given the molal freezing-point depression constant.

Why salt icy roads?
Colligative properties have practical applications, such as the salting of roads in cold-weather climates. By applying
salt to an icy road, the melting point of the ice is decreased, and the ice will melt more quickly, making driving
safer. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and either calcium chloride (CaCl2) or magnesium chloride (MgCl2) are used most
frequently, either alone or in a mixture. Sodium chloride is the least expensive option, but is less effective because it
only dissociates into two ions instead of three.

Freezing Point Depression

The Figure 16.8 shows the phase diagram for a pure solvent and how it changes when a solute is added to it. The
solute lowers the vapor pressure of the solvent resulting in a lowering of the freezing point of the solution compared
to the solvent. The freezing point depression is the difference in temperature between the freezing point of the pure
solvent and that of the solution. On the graph, the freezing point depression is represented by ∆Tf .
When a pure solvent freezes, its particles become more ordered as the intermolecular forces that operate between the
molecules become permanent. In the case of water, the hydrogen bonds make the hexagonally-shaped network of
molecules that characterizes the structure of ice. By dissolving a solute into the liquid solvent, this ordering process
is disrupted. As a result, more energy must be removed from the solution in order to freeze it, and the freezing point
of the solution is lower than that of the pure solvent.
The magnitude of the freezing point depression is directly proportional to the molality of the solution. The equation
is:

∆Tf = Kf × m

FIGURE 16.8
The vapor pressure of a solution (blue) is
lower than the vapor pressure of a pure
solvent (pink). As a result, the freezing

The proportionality constant, Kf , is called the molal freezing-point depression constant. It is a constant that is
equal to the change in the freezing point for a 1-molal solution of a nonvolatile molecular solute. For water, the
value of Kf is -1.86°C/ m. So the freezing temperature of a 1-molal aqueous solution of any nonvolatile molecular
solute is -1.86°C. Every solvent has a unique molal freezing-point depression constant. These are shown in Table

Does adding salt help water boil?
Salt is often added to boiling water when preparing spaghetti or other pasta. One reason is to add ﬂavor to the food.
Some people believe that the addition of salt increases the boiling point of the water. Technically, they are correct,
but the increase is rather small. You would need to add over 100 grams of NaCl to a liter of water to increase the
boiling point a couple of degrees, which is just not healthy.

Boiling Point Elevation

The Figure 16.9 shows the phase diagram of a solution and the effect that the lowered vapor pressure has on the
boiling point of the solution compared to the solvent. In this case, the solution has a higher boiling point than the
pure solvent. Since the vapor pressure of the solution is lower, more heat must be supplied to the solution to bring
its vapor pressure up to the pressure of the external atmosphere. The boiling point elevation is the difference in
temperature between the boiling point of the pure solvent and that of the solution. On the graph, the boiling point
elevation is represented by ∆Tb.
The magnitude of the boiling point elevation is also directly proportional to the molality of the solution. The equation

What effect do ions have?
The addition of ions creates signiﬁcant changes in properties of solutions. Water molecules surround the ions and

the same as those in the pure solvent.

Electrolytes and Colligative Properties

Ionic compounds are electrolytes and dissociate into two or more ions as they dissolve. This must be taken into
account when calculating the freezing and boiling points of electrolyte solutions. The sample problem below
demonstrates how to calculate the freezing point and boiling point of a solution of calcium chloride. Calcium
chloride dissociates into three ions according to the equation:

CaCl2(s) → Ca2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq)

The values of the freezing point depression and the boiling point elevation for a solution of CaCl2 will be three times
greater than they would be for an equal molality of a nonelectrolyte.

• Perform calculations for the determination of molar mass from changes in boiling or freezing points.

How much antifreeze is needed?
We know that we can put antifreeze into a radiator and keep an engine from freezing up. By knowing how cold it
will get and how much water is in the radiator, we can determine how much antifreeze to add to achieve our desired
freezing point depression. We can do this because we know what the antifreeze is. Can we switch things around and
get some information about the properties of the antifreeze (such as its molecular weight) from the freezing point
decrease? It turns out that we can do this fairly easily and accurately.

Calculating Molar Mass

In the laboratory, freezing point or boiling point data can be used to determine the molar mass of an unknown solute.
Since we know the relationship between a decrease in freezing point and the concentration of solute, if we dissolve
a known mass of our unknown solute into a known amount of solvent, we can calculate the molar mass of the solute.
The Kf or Kb of the solvent must be known. We also need to know if the solute is an electrolyte or a nonelectrolyte.
If the solvent is an electrolyte, you would need to know the number of ions is produced when it dissociates.

16.17 Molecular and Ionic Equations

• Deﬁne molecular and ionic equations.
• Give examples of molecular and ionic equations.

“Just a little rain...”
One of the unfortunate by-products of our industrialized society is acid rain. Sulfur dioxide from burning coal and
nitric oxides from vehicle emissions both form acids. When these acids react with limestone (calcium carbonate),
reactions occur that dissolve the limestone and release water and carbon dioxide. Over a period of time, serious
damage is caused to the structures.

Molecular and Ionic Equations

When ionic compounds are dissolved into water, the polar water molecules break apart the solid crystal lattice,
resulting in the hydrated ions being evenly distributed through the water. This process is called dissociation and is
the reason that all ionic compounds are strong electrolytes. When two different ionic compounds that have been
dissolved in water are mixed, a chemical reaction may occur between certain pairs of the hydrated ions.
Consider the double-replacement reaction that occurs when a solution of sodium chloride is mixed with a solution
of silver nitrate.

NaCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) → NaNO3(aq) + AgCl(s)

775

16.17. Molecular and Ionic Equations

The driving force behind this reaction is the formation of the silver chloride precipitate (see Figure 16.11).

FIGURE 16.11
The white silver chloride precipitate in-
stantly forms when a solution of silver
nitrate is added to a solution of sodium
chloride.

This is called a molecular equation. A molecular equation is an equation in which the formulas of the compounds
are written as though all substances exist as molecules. However, there is a better way to show what is happening
in this reaction. All of the aqueous compounds should be written as ions because they are present in the water as
separated ions because of their dissociation.

Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq) + Ag+(aq) + NO−

3 (aq) → Na+(aq) + NO−

3 (aq) + AgCl(s)

This equation is called an ionic equation, an equation in which dissolved ionic compounds are shown as free ions.

Some other double-replacement reactions do not produce a precipitate as one of the products. The production of a
gas and/or a molecular compound such as water may also drive the reaction. For example, consider the reaction of
a solution of sodium carbonate with a solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl). The products of the reaction are aqueous
sodium chloride, carbon dioxide, and water. The balanced molecular equation is:

Na2CO3(aq) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)

The ionic equation is:

2Na+(aq) + CO2−

3 (aq) + 2H+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) → 2Na+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)

A single-replacement reaction is one in which an element replaces another element in a compound. An element is
in either the solid, liquid, or gas state and is not an ion. The example below shows the reaction of solid magnesium
metal with aqueous silver nitrate to form aqueous magnesium nitrate and silver metal.

This type of single-replacement reaction is called a metal replacement. Other common categories of single-replacement
reactions are hydrogen replacement and halogen replacement.

Yes, we need the crowd.
At sports events around the world, we can see a small number of athletes ﬁercely competing on the ﬁeld. They
get tired, dirty, and sometimes hurt as they try to win the game. Surrounding them are thousands of spectators
watching and cheering. Would the game be different without the spectators? Yes, it deﬁnitely would. They provide
encouragement to the team and generate enthusiasm. The spectators are not really playing the game, but they are
certainly a part of the process.

Net Ionic Equations

We can write a molecular equation for the formation of silver chloride precipitate:
NaCl + AgNO3 → NaNO3 + AgCl
The corresponding ionic equation is:
Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq) + Ag+(aq) + NO−
If you look carefully at the ionic equation, you will notice that the sodium ion and the nitrate ion appear unchanged
− ions participate in
on both sides of the equation. When the two solutions are mixed, neither the Na+ nor the NO3
the reaction. They can be eliminated from the reaction.

3 (aq) → Na+(aq) + NO−

3 (aq) + AgCl(s)

A spectator ion is an ion that does not take part in the chemical reaction and is found in solution both before and
after the reaction. In the above reaction, the sodium ion and the nitrate ion are both spectator ions. The equation can
now be written without the spectator ions.

Ag+(aq) + Cl−(aq) → AgCl(s)

The net ionic equation is the chemical equation that shows only those elements, compounds, and ions that are
directly involved in the chemical reaction. Notice that in writing the net ionic equation, the positively-charged silver
cation was written ﬁrst on the reactant side, followed by the negatively-charged chloride anion. This is somewhat
customary because that is the order in which the ions must be written in the silver chloride product. However, it is
not absolutely necessary to order the reactants in this way.
Net ionic equations must be balanced by both mass and charge. Balancing by mass means making sure that there
are equal numbers of each element. Balancing by charge means making sure that the overall charge is the same on
both sides of the equation. In the above equation, the overall charge is zero, or neutral, on both sides of the equation.
As a general rule, if you balance the molecular equation properly, the net ionic equation will end up being balanced
by both mass and charge.

Sample Problem: Writing and Balancing Net Ionic Equations

When aqueous solutions of copper(II) chloride and potassium phosphate are mixed, a precipitate of copper(II)
phosphate is formed. Write a balanced net ionic equation for this reaction.
Step 1: Plan the problem.
Write and balance the molecular equation ﬁrst, making sure that all formulas are correct. Then write the ionic
equation, showing all aqueous substances as ions. Carry through any coefﬁcients. Finally, eliminate spectator ions
and write the net ionic equation.
Step 2: Solve.
Molecular equation:

3CuCl2(aq) + 2K3PO4(aq) → 6KCl(aq) + Cu3(PO4)2(s)

Ionic equation:

3Cu2+(aq) + 6Cl−(aq) + 6K+(aq) + 2PO3−

4 (aq) → 6K+(aq) + 6Cl−(aq) + Cu3(PO4)2(s)

Notice that the balancing is carried through when writing the dissociated ions. For example, there are six chloride
ions on the reactant side because the coefﬁcient of 3 is multiplied by the subscript of 2 in the copper(II) chloride
formula. The spectator ions are K+ and Cl− and can be eliminated.
Net ionic equation:

3Cu2+(aq) + 2PO3−

4 (aq) → Cu3(PO4)2(s)

Step 3: Think about your result
For a precipitation reaction, the net ionic equation always shows the two ions that come together to form the
precipitate. The equation is balanced by mass and charge.

16.19 Predicting Precipitates Using Solubility

Rules

• Use solubility rules to predict when a product will precipitate.

Will it rain?
Predicting the weather is tricky business. A thorough examination of a large amount of data is needed to make the
daily forecast. Wind patterns, historical data, barometric pressure –these and many other data are fed into computers
that then use a set of rules to predict what will happen based on past history.

Predicting Precipitates Using Solubility Rules

Some combinations of aqueous reactants result in the formation of a solid precipitate as a product. However, some
combinations will not produce such a product. If solutions of sodium nitrate and ammonium chloride are mixed, no
reaction occurs. One could write a molecular equation showing a double-replacement reaction, but both products,
sodium chloride and ammonium nitrate, are soluble and would remain in the solution as ions. Every ion is a spectator
ion and there is not net ionic equation at all.
It is useful to be able to predict when a precipitate will occur in a reaction. To do so, you can use a set of guidelines
called the solubility rules (see Table 16.3).

The potential precipitates from a double-replacement reaction are cesium nitrate and lead(II) bromide. According
to the solubility rules table, cesium nitrate is soluble because all compounds containing the nitrate ion, as well as all
compounds containing the alkali metal ions, are soluble. Most compounds containing the bromide ion are soluble,
but lead(II) is an exception. Therefore, the cesium and nitrate ions are spectator ions and the lead(II) bromide is a
precipitate. The balanced net ionic reaction is:

Pb2+(aq) + 2Br−(aq) → PbBr2(s)

17.1 Chemical Potential Energy

• Deﬁne chemical potential energy.
• Give examples of chemical potential energy.

Where did gunpowder come from?
Gun powder was originally developed by the Chinese in the ninth century AD, primarily for rockets. This material is
composed of charcoal, sulfur, and saltpeter (potassium nitrate). The reaction involves the conversion of the charcoal
to carbon dioxide with the potassium nitrate providing the extra oxygen needed for a rapid reaction. Sulfur was
included to stabilize the product, but gunpowder is still highly explosive.

Types of Energy

Two basic types of energy exist: potential energy and kinetic energy. Potential energy is stored energy. It has not yet
been released, but is ready to go. Kinetic energy is energy of motion. It causes work to be done through movement.

Chemical Potential Energy

Energy is the capacity for doing work or supplying heat. When you ﬁll your car with gasoline, you are providing it
with potential energy. Chemical potential energy is the energy stored in the chemical bonds of a substance. The
various chemicals that make up gasoline contain a large amount of chemical potential energy that is released when
the gasoline is burned in a controlled way in the engine of the car. The release of that energy does two things. Some
of the potential energy is transformed into work, which is used to move the car. At the same time, some of the

786

www.ck12.org

Chapter 17. Thermochemistry

potential energy is converted to heat, making the car’s engine very hot. The energy changes of a system occur as
either heat or work, or some combination of both.

FIGURE 17.1
A dragster is able to accelerate because
of the chemical potential energy of its fuel.
The burning of
the fuel also produces
large amounts of heat.

Dynamite is another example of chemical potential energy. The major component of dynamite is nitroglycerin, a
very unstable material. By mixing it with diatomaceous earth, the stability is increased and it is less likely to explode
if it receives a physical shock. When ignited, the nitroglycerin explodes rapidly, releasing large amounts of nitrogen
and other gases along with a massive amount of heat.

“Under the spreading chestnut tree ...” - The Village Blacksmith by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. 1807-1882
Blacksmiths, like the one mentioned in Longfellow’s poem, heat solid iron in order to shape it into a variety of
different objects. Iron is a rigid, solid metal. At room temperature, it is extremely difﬁcult to bend iron. However,
when heated to a high enough temperature, iron can be easily worked. The heat energy in the forge is transferred to
the metal, making the iron atoms vibrate more and move around more readily.

Heat

Heat is energy that is transferred from one object or substance to another because of a difference in temperature
between them. Heat always ﬂows from an object at a higher temperature to an object a lower temperature (see
Figure 17.3). The ﬂow of heat will continue until the two objects are at the same temperature.
Thermochemistry is the study of energy changes that occur during chemical reactions and during changes of
state. When chemical reactions occur, some chemical bonds are broken, while new chemical bonds form. As a
result of the rearrangement of atoms, the total chemical potential energy of the system either increases or decreases.

Summary

• Heat is transferred energy from a site of higher energy to a site of lower energy.

17.3 Exothermic and Endothermic Processes

• State the law of conservation of energy.
• Deﬁne and endothermic process.
• Deﬁne an exothermic process.
• Make conversions involving heat units.

How do you keep warm?
A camp ﬁre is an example of basic thermochemistry. The reaction is initiated by the application of heat from a
match. The reaction converting wood to carbon dioxide and water (among other things) continues, releasing heat
energy in the process. This heat energy can then be used to cook food, roast marshmallows, or just keep warm when
it’s cold outside.

Exothermic and Endothermic Processes

When physical or chemical changes occur, they are generally accompanied by a transfer of energy. The law of
conservation of energy states that in any physical or chemical process, energy is neither created nor destroyed. In
other words, the entire energy in the universe is conserved. In order to better understand the energy changes taking
place during a reaction, we need to deﬁne two parts of the universe, called the system and the surroundings. The
system is the speciﬁc portion of matter in a given space that is being studied during an experiment or an observation.
The surroundings is everything in the universe that is not part of the system. In practical terms for a laboratory
chemist, the system is the particular chemicals being reacted, while the surroundings is the immediate vicinity within
the room. During most processes, energy is exchanged between the system and the surroundings. If the system loses
a certain amount of energy, that same amount of energy is gained by the surroundings. If the system gains a certain
amount of energy, that energy is supplied by the surroundings.

791

17.3. Exothermic and Endothermic Processes

www.ck12.org

In the study of thermochemical processes, things are viewed from the point of view of the system. A chemical
reaction or physical change is endothermic if heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings. In the course
of an endothermic process, the system gains heat from the surroundings and so the temperature of the surroundings
decreases. The quantity of heat for a process is represented by the letter q. The sign of q for an endothermic process is
positive because the system is gaining heat. A chemical reaction or physical change is exothermic if heat is released
by the system into the surroundings. Because the surroundings is gaining heat from the system, the temperature of
the surroundings increases. The sign of q for an exothermic process is negative because the system is losing heat.

FIGURE 17.4
(A) Endothermic reaction. (B) Exothermic
reaction.

Units of Heat

Heat ﬂow is measured in one of two common units:
the calorie and the joule. The joule (J) is the SI unit of
energy. The calorie is familiar because it is commonly used when referring to the amount of energy contained
within food. A calorie (cal) is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C. For
example, raising the temperature of 100 g of water from 20°C to 22°C would require 100 × 2 = 200 cal.
Calories contained within food are actually kilocalories (kcal). In other words, if a certain snack contains 85 food
calories, it actually contains 85 kcal or 85,000 cal. In order to make the distinction, the dietary calorie is written with
a capital C.

1 kilocalorie = 1 Calorie = 1000 calories

To say that the snack “contains” 85 Calories means that 85 kcal of energy are released when that snack is processed
by your body.
Heat changes in chemical reactions are typically measured in joules rather than calories. The conversion between a
joule and a calorie is shown below.

1 J = 0.2390 cal or 1 cal = 4.184 J

We can calculate the amount of heat released in kilojoules when a 400. Calorie hamburger is digested.

400· Cal = 400· kcal× 4.184 kJ
1 kcal

= 1.67× 103 kJ

Which pool will warm up faster?
If a swimming pool and wading, both full of water at the same temperature were subjected to the same input of
heat energy, the wading pool would certainly rise in temperature more quickly than the swimming pool. The heat
capacity of an object depends both on its mass and its chemical composition. Because of its much larger mass, the
swimming pool of water has a larger heat capacity than the bucket of water.

Heat Capacity and Speciﬁc Heat

Different substances respond to heat in different ways. If a metal chair sits in the bright sun on a hot day, it may
become quite hot to the touch. An equal mass of water in the same sun will not become nearly as hot. We would say
that water has a high heat capacity (the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of an object by 1°C.) Water
is very resistant to changes in temperature, while metals in general are not. The speciﬁc heat of a substance is the
amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1°C. Table 17.1 lists the speciﬁc
heats of some common substances. The symbol for speciﬁc heat is cp, with the p subscript referring to the fact that
speciﬁc heats are measured at constant pressure. The units for speciﬁc heat can either be joules per gram per degree
(J/g°C) or calories per gram per degree (cal/g°C). This text will use J/g°C for speciﬁc heat.

Notice that water has a very high speciﬁc heat compared to most other substances. Water is commonly used as a
coolant for machinery because it is able to absorb large quantities of heat (see Table 17.1). Coastal climates are
much more moderate than inland climates because of the presence of the ocean. Water in lakes or oceans absorbs
heat from the air on hot days and releases it back into the air on cool days.

17.5 Speciﬁc Heat Calculations

• Perform speciﬁc heat calculations.

Does water have a high capacity for absorbing heat?
Yes. In a car radiator, it serves to keep the engine cooler than it would otherwise run. (In the picture above, the
radiator is the black object on the left.) As the water circulates through the engine, it absorbs heat from the engine
block. When it passes through the radiator, the cooling fan and the exposure to the outside environment allow the
water to cool somewhat before it makes another passage through the engine.

Speciﬁc Heat Calculations

The speciﬁc heat of a substance can be used to calculate the temperature change that a given substance will undergo
when it is either heated or cooled. The equation that relates heat (q) to speciﬁc heat (cp), mass (m), and temperature
change (∆T ) is shown below.

q = cp × m× ∆T

The heat that is either absorbed or released is measured in joules. The mass is measured in grams. The change in
temperature is given by ∆T = Tf − Ti, where Tf is the ﬁnal temperature and Ti is the initial temperature.

Sample Problem: Calculating Speciﬁc Heat

A 15.0 g piece of cadmium metal absorbs 134 J of heat while rising from 24.0°C to 62.7°C. Calculate the speciﬁc
heat of cadmium.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• heat = q = 134 J
• mass = m = 15.0 g
• ∆T = 62.7◦C− 24.0◦C = 38.7◦C

Unknown

• cp of cadmium =? J/g◦C

The speciﬁc heat equation can be rearranged to solve for the speciﬁc heat.
Step 2: Solve.

cp =

q

m× ∆T =

134 J

15.0 g× 38.7◦C

= 0.231 J/g◦C

Step 3: Think about your result.
The speciﬁc heat of cadmium, a metal, is fairly close to the speciﬁc heats of other metals. The result has three
signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Since most speciﬁc heats are known, they can be used to determine the ﬁnal temperature attained by a substance
when it is either heated or cooled. Suppose that a 60.0 g sample of water at 23.52°C was cooled by the removal of
813 J of heat. The change in temperature can be calculated using the speciﬁc heat equation.

∆T =

q

cp × m =

813 J

4.18 J/g◦C× 60.0 g

= 3.24◦C

Since the water was being cooled, the temperature decreases. The ﬁnal temperature is:

Tf = 23.52◦C− 3.24◦C = 20.28◦C

17.6 Enthalpy

• Deﬁne enthalpy.
• List factors that inﬂuence enthalpy.

Does the catalyst affect enthalpy?
The factors inﬂuencing a reaction are complicated and varied. Since a catalyst affects activation energy, we might
assume it would have some sort of impact on enthalpy, but it does not. The change in enthalpy of a reaction depends
solely on the chemical compositions of the reactants and products, not on the path taken to get from one to the other.

Enthalpy

Heat changes in chemical reactions are most often measured in the laboratory under conditions in which the reacting
system is open to the atmosphere. In that case, the system is at a constant pressure. Enthalpy (H) is the heat content
of a system at constant pressure. Chemists routinely measure changes in enthalpy of chemical systems as reactants
are converted into products. The heat that is absorbed or released by a reaction at constant pressure is the same as the
enthalpy change, and is given the symbol ∆H. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all reactions in this material are assumed
to take place at constant pressure.
The change in enthalpy of a reaction is a measure of the differences in enthalpy of the reactants and products. The
enthalpy of a system is determined by the energies needed to break chemical bonds and the energies needed to form
chemical bonds. Energy needs to be put into the system in order to break chemical bonds –they do not come apart
spontaneously in most cases. Bond formation to produce products will involve release of energy. The change in
enthalpy shows the trade-offs made in these two processes. Does it take more energy to break bonds that that needed

800

www.ck12.org

Chapter 17. Thermochemistry

to form bonds? If so, the reaction is endothermic and the enthalpy change is positive. If more energy is produced in
bond formation than that needed for bond breaking, the reaction is exothermic and the enthalpy is negative.
Several factors inﬂuence the enthalpy of a system. Enthalpy is an extensive property, determined in part by the
amount of material we work with. The state of reactants and products (solid, liquid, or gas) inﬂuences the enthalpy
value for a system. The direction of the reaction affects the enthalpy value. A reaction that takes place in the opposite
direction has the same numerical enthalpy value, but the opposite sign.

Summary

• Enthalpy is related to the heat of a reaction.
• Factors inﬂuencing entropy are described.

17.7 Calorimetry

• Deﬁne calorimetry.
• Perform calculations involving calorimetry relationships.

How many calories are in your food?
At one time, calories in foods were measured with a bomb calorimeter (see ﬁgure above). A weighed amount of
the food would be placed in the calorimeter and the system was then sealed and ﬁlled with oxygen. An electric
spark ignited the food-oxygen mixture. The amount of heat released when the food burned would give an idea of the
food calories present. Today calories are calculated from the protein, carbohydrate, and fat content of the food (all
determined by chemical analysis). No more bombs needed.

Calorimetry

Calorimetry is the measurement of the transfer of heat into or out of a system during a chemical reaction or physical
process. A calorimeter is an insulated container that is used to measure heat changes. The majority of reactions
that can be analyzed in a calorimetry experiment are either liquids or aqueous solutions. A frequently used and
inexpensive calorimeter is a set of nested foam cups ﬁtted with a lid to limit the heat exchange between the liquid in
the cup and the air in the surroundings (see Figure 17.6). In a typical calorimetry experiment, speciﬁc volumes of
the reactants are dispensed into separate containers and the temperature of each is measured. They are then mixed
into the calorimeter, which starts the reaction. The reactant mixture is stirred until the reaction is complete, while
the temperature of the reaction is continuously monitored.

Chapter 17. Thermochemistry

FIGURE 17.6
A simple constant-pressure calorimeter.

The key to all calorimetry experiments is the assumption that there is no heat exchange between the insulated
calorimeter and the room. Consider the case of a reaction taking place between aqueous reactants. The water in
which the solids have been dissolved is the surroundings, while the dissolved substances are the system. The tem-
perature change that is measured is the temperature change that is occurring in the surroundings. If the temperature
of the water increases as the reaction occurs, the reaction is exothermic. Heat was released by the system into the
surrounding water. An endothermic reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings, so the temperature of the water
decreases as heat leaves the surroundings to enter the system.
The temperature change of the water is measured in the experiment and the speciﬁc heat of water can be used to
calculate the heat absorbed by the surroundings (qsurr).

qsurr = m× cp × ∆T

In the equation, m is the mass of the water, cp is the speciﬁc heat of the water, and ∆T is Tf − Ti. The heat absorbed
by the surroundings is equal, but opposite in sign, to the heat released by the system. Because the heat change is
determined at constant pressure, the heat released by the system (qsys) is equal to the enthalpy change (∆H).

qsys = ∆H = −qsurr = −(m× cp × ∆T )

The sign of ∆H is positive for an endothermic reaction and negative for an exothermic reaction.

Sample Problem: Calorimetry and Enthalpy Changes

In an experiment, 25.0 mL of 1.00 M HCl at 25.0°C is added to 25.0 mL of 1.00 M NaOH at 25.0°C in a foam cup
calorimeter. A reaction occurs and the temperature rises to 32.0°C. Calculate the enthalpy change (∆H) in kJ for
this reaction. Assume the densities of the solutions are 1.00 g/mL and that their speciﬁc heat is the same as that of
water.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.

• Density = 1.00 g/mL

• ∆H =? kJ

The volume and density can be used to ﬁnd the mass of the solution after mixing. Then calculate the change in
enthalpy by using ∆H = qsys = −qsurr = −(m× cp× ∆T ).
Step 2: Solve.

m = 50.0 ml× 1.00 g

∆H = −(m× cp × ∆T ) = −(50.0 g× 4.18 J/g◦C× 7.0◦C) = −1463 J = −1.5 kJ

= 50.0 g

Step 3: Think about the result.
The enthalpy change is negative because the reaction releases heat to the surroundings, resulting in an increase in
temperature of the water.

• Deﬁne thermochemical equation.
• Deﬁne heat of reaction.

What is the best way to heat a house?
Heating a home is becoming more and more expensive. Do we use gas, oil, electricity, wood? Part of the decision
is based on which fuel will provide the highest amount of energy release when burned. Studies of thermochemistry
can be very useful in getting reliable information for making these important choices.

Thermochemical Equation

When methane gas is combusted, heat is released, making the reaction exothermic. Speciﬁcally, the combustion of
1 mol of methane releases 890.4 kilojoules of heat energy. This information can be shown as part of the balanced
equation.

CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) + 890.4 kJ

The equation tells us that 1 mol of methane combines with 2 mol of oxygen to produce 1 mol of carbon dioxide
and 2 mol of water.
In the process, 890.4 kJ is released and so it is written as a product of the reaction. A
thermochemical equation is a chemical equation that includes the enthalpy change of the reaction. The process in
the above thermochemical equation can be shown visually in the Figure 17.7.

FIGURE 17.7
(A) As reactants are converted to prod-
ucts in an exothermic reaction, enthalpy
is released into the surroundings. The
enthalpy change of the reaction is neg-
ative.
(B) As reactants are converted to
products in an endothermic reaction, en-
thalpy is absorbed from the surroundings.
The enthalpy change of the reaction is
positive.

In the combustion of methane example, the enthalpy change is negative because heat is being released by the system.
Therefore, the overall enthalpy of the system decreases. The heat of reaction is the enthalpy change for a chemical
reaction. In the case above, the heat of reaction is −890.4 kJ. The thermochemical reaction can also be written in
this way:

CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) ∆H = −890.4 kJ

Heats of reaction are typically measured in kilojoules. It is important to include the physical states of the reactants
and products in a thermochemical equation as the value of the ∆H depends on those states.
Endothermic reactions absorb energy from the surroundings as the reaction occurs. When 1 mol of calcium carbonate
decomposes into 1 mol of calcium oxide and 1 mol of carbon dioxide, 177.8 kJ of heat is absorbed. The process is
shown visually in Figure 17.7 (B). The thermochemical reaction is shown below.

CaCO3(s) + 177.8 kJ → CaO(s) + CO2(g)

Because the heat is absorbed by the system, the 177.8 kJ is written as a reactant. The heat of reaction is positive for
an endothermic reaction.

CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g) ∆H = 177.8 kJ

The way in which a reaction is written inﬂuences the value of the enthalpy change for the reaction. Many reactions
are reversible, meaning that the product(s) of the reaction are capable of combining and reforming the reactant(s). If
a reaction is written in the reverse direction, the sign of the ∆H changes. For example, we can write an equation for
the reaction of calcium oxide with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate.

CaO(s) + CO2(g) → CaCO3(s) + 177.8 kJ

The reaction is exothermic and thus the sign of the enthalpy change is negative.

CaO(s) + CO2(g) → CaCO3(s) ∆H = −177.8 kJ

What will it cost?
There is a growing concern about the damage to the environment from emissions from manufacturing plants. Many
companies are taking steps to reduce these harmful emissions by adding equipment that will trap the pollutants. In
order to know what equipment (and how many) to order, studies need to be done to measure the amount of product
currently produced. The since pollution is often both particulate and thermal, energy changes need to be determined
in addition to the amounts of products released.

Stoichiometric Calculations and Enthalpy Changes

Chemistry problems that involve enthalpy changes can be solved by techniques similar to stoichiometry prob-
lems. Refer again to the combustion reaction of methane. Since the reaction of 1 mol of methane released 890.4 kJ,
the reaction of 2 mol of methane would release 2× 890.4 kJ = 1781 kJ. The reaction of 0.5 mol of methane would
release 890.4 kJ
= 445.2 kJ. As with other stoichiometry problems, the moles of a reactant or product can be linked
to mass or volume.

conversion factor of

Step 2: Solve.

∆H = 58.0 g SO2 × 1 mol SO2

= −89.6 kJ

Step 3: Think about your result.
The mass of sulfur dioxide is slightly less than 1 mol. Since 198 kJ is released for every 2 mol of SO2 that reacts,
the heat released when about 1 mol reacts is one half of 198. The 89.6 kJ is slightly less than half of 198. The sign
of ∆H is negative because the reaction is exothermic.

17.10 Heats of Fusion and Solidiﬁcation

• Deﬁne heat of fusion.
• Deﬁne heat of solidiﬁcation.
• Perform calculations of energy changes during the transition from solid to liquid or liquid to solid.

What makes the ice melt?
Suppose you hold an ice cube in your hand. It feels cold because heat energy leaves your hand and enters the ice
cube. What happens to the ice cube? It melts. However, the temperature during a phase change remains constant. So
the heat that is being lost by your hand does not raise the temperature of the ice above its melting temperature of
0°C. Rather, all the heat goes into the change of state. Energy is absorbed during the process of changing ice into
water. The water that is produced also remains at 0°C until all of the ice is melted.

Heats of Fusion and Solidiﬁcation

All solids absorb heat as they melt to become liquids. The gain of heat in this endothermic process goes into
changing the state rather than changing the temperature. The molar heat of fusion (∆Hfus) of a substance is the heat
absorbed by one mole of that substance as it is converted from a solid to a liquid. Since the melting of any substance
absorbs heat, it follows that the freezing of any substance releases heat. The molar heat of solidiﬁcation (∆Hsolid)
of a substance is the heat released by one mole of that substance as it is converted from a liquid to a solid. Since
fusion and solidiﬁcation of a given substance are the exact opposite processes, the numerical value of the molar heat
of fusion is the same as the numerical value of the molar heat of solidiﬁcation, but opposite in sign. In other words,
∆Hfus = −∆Hsolid. The Figure 17.8 shows all of the possible changes of state along with the direction of heat ﬂow
during each process.
Every substance has a unique value for its molar heat of fusion, depending on the amount of energy required to
disrupt the intermolecular forces present in the solid. When 1 mol of ice at 0°C is converted to 1 mol of liquid water

17.11 Heats of Vaporization and Condensation

• Deﬁne heat of vaporization.
• Deﬁne heat of condensation.
• Perform calculations involving heats of vaporization and condensation.

How much energy is available?
Natural resources for power generation have traditionally been waterfalls or use of oil, coal, or nuclear power to gen-
erate electricity. Research is being carried out to look for other renewable sources to run the generators. Geothermal
sites (such as the geyser pictured above) are being considered because of the steam they produce. Capabilities can
be estimated by knowing how much steam is released in a given time at a particular site.

Heat of Vaporization and Condensation

Energy is absorbed in the process of converting a liquid at its boiling point into a gas. As with the melting of a solid,
the temperature of a boiling liquid remains constant and the input of energy goes into changing the state. The molar
heat of vaporization (∆Hvap) of a substance is the heat absorbed by one mole of that substance as it is converted
from a liquid to a gas. As a gas condenses to a liquid, heat is released. The molar heat of condensation (∆Hcond)
of a substance is the heat released by one mole of that substance as it is converted from a gas to a liquid. Since
vaporization and condensation of a given substance are the exact opposite processes, the numerical value of the
molar heat of vaporization is the same as the numerical value of the molar heat of condensation, but opposite in sign.
In other words, ∆Hvap = −∆Hcond.
When 1 mol of water at 100°C and 1 atm pressure is converted to 1 mol of water vapor at 100°C, 40.7 kJ of heat are
absorbed from the surroundings. When 1 mol of water vapor at 100°C condenses to liquid water at 100°C, 40.7 kJ
of heat are released into the surroundings.

∆Hfus = 40.7 kJ/mol
∆Hsolid = −40.7 kJ/mol

Other substances have different values for their molar heats of fusion and vaporization and these are summarized in
the Table 17.2.

Notice that for all substances, the heat of vaporization is substantially higher than the heat of fusion. Much more
energy is required to change the state from a liquid to a gas than from a solid to a liquid. This is because of the
large separation of the particles in the gas state. The values of the heats of fusion and vaporization are related to
the strength of the intermolecular forces. All of the substances in the Table 17.2, with the exception of oxygen, are
capable of hydrogen bonding. Consequently, the heats of fusion and vaporization of oxygen are far lower than the
others.

Sample Problem: Heat of Vaporization

What mass of methanol vapor condenses to a liquid as 20.0 kJ of heat are released?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.

• ∆Hcond = −35.3 kJ/mol
• molar mass CH3OH = 32.05 kJ/mol

• mass methanol = ? g

First the kJ of heat released in the condensation is multiplied by the conversion factor of
of methanol that condensed. Then, moles are converted to grams.

Step 3: Think about your result.
Condensation is an exothermic process, so the enthalpy change is negative. Slightly more than one-half mole of
methanol is condensed.

17.12 Multi-Step Problems with Changes of State

• Perform energy calculations involving multiple changes of state.

Which takes more heat –melting or boiling?
You have a cube of ice. Which process will take more energy –the melting of that ice cube or the conversion of the
water to steam? The short answer is that more energy is needed to convert the water to steam. The long answer is
really a question: how do you get from one point to the other? What is the temperature of the ice? What is the mass
of that ice cube? A lot goes into taking the material from the starting point to the end-point.

Multi-Step Problems with Changes of State

Heating curves show the phase changes that a substance undergoes as heat is continuously absorbed.

The speciﬁc heat of a substance allows us to calculate the heat absorbed or released as the temperature of the
substance changes. It is possible to combine that type of problem with a change of state to solve a problem involving
multiple steps. The Figure 17.9 shows ice at -30°C being converted in a ﬁve-step process to gaseous water (steam)

Sample Problem: Multi-Step Problems using a Heating Curve

Calculate the total amount of heat absorbed (in kJ) when 2.00 mol of ice at -30.0°C is converted to steam at 140.0°C.
The required speciﬁc heats can be found in the table in "Heat Capacity and Speciﬁc Heat".
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• 2.00 mol ice = 36.04 g ice
• cp(ice) = 2.06 J/g◦C
• cp(water) = 4.18 J/g◦C
• cp(steam) = 1.87 J/g◦C
• ∆Hfus = 6.01 kJ/mol
• ∆Hvap = 40.7 kJ/mol

Unknown

• ∆Htotal =? kJ

Follow the steps previously described. Note that the mass of the water is needed for the calculations that involve the
speciﬁc heat, while the moles of water is needed for the calculations that involve changes of state. All heat quantities
must be in kilojoules so that they can be added together to get a total for the ﬁve-step process.
Step 2: Solve.

1. ∆H1 = 2.06 J/g◦C× 36.04 g× 30◦C× 1 kJ
2. ∆H2 = 2.00 mol× 6.01 kJ
3. ∆H3 = 4.18 J/g◦C× 36.04 g× 100◦C× 1 kJ
4. ∆H4 = 2.00 mol× 40.7 kJ
5. ∆H5 = 1.87 J/g◦C× 36.04 g× 40◦C× 1 kJ

1 mol = 12.0 kJ

1 mol = 81.4 kJ

1000 J = 2.23 kJ

1000 J = 15.1 kJ

1000 J = 2.70 kJ

∆Htotal = ∆H1 + ∆H2 + ∆H3 + ∆H4 + ∆H5 = 113.4 kJ

Step 3: Think about your result.
The total heat absorbed as the ice at -30°C is heated to steam at 140°C is 113.4 kJ. The largest absorption of heat
comes during the vaporization of the liquid water.

17.13 Heat of Solution

• Deﬁne heat of solution.
• Perform heat of solution calculations.

How do you make solutions safely?
When preparing dilutions of concentrated sulfuric acid, the directions usually call for adding the acid slowly to water
with a lot of stirring. When this acid is mixed with water, a great deal of heat is released in the dissolving process. If
water were added to acid, the water would quickly heat and splatter, causing harm to the person making the solution.

Heat of Solution

Enthalpy changes also occur when a solute undergoes the physical process of dissolving into a solvent. Hot packs
and cold packs (see Figure 17.10) use this property. Many hot packs use calcium chloride, which releases heat when
it dissolves according to the equation below.

CaCl2(s) → Ca2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + 82.8 kJ

The molar heat of solution (∆Hsoln) of a substance is the heat absorbed or released when one mole of the substance
is dissolved in water. For calcium chloride, ∆Hsoln = −82.8 kJ/mol.
Many cold packs use ammonium nitrate, which absorbs heat from the surroundings when it dissolves.

Cold packs are typically used to treat muscle strains and sore joints. The cold pack is activated and applied to the
affected area. As the ammonium nitrate dissolves, it absorbs heat from the body and helps to limit swelling. For
ammonium nitrate, ∆Hsoln = 25.7 kJ/mol.

Sample Problem: Heat of Solution

The molar heat of solution, ∆Hsoln, of NaOH is -44.51 kJ/mol.
In a certain experiment, 50.0 g of NaOH is
completely dissolved in 1.000 L of 20.0◦C water in a foam cup calorimeter. Assuming no heat loss, calculate
the ﬁnal temperature of the water.

heat of solution; 3) the joules of heat released in the dissolving process is used with the speciﬁc heat equation and
the total mass of the solution to calculate the ∆T ; 4) the Tﬁnal is determined from ∆T .

• Deﬁne heat of combustion.
• Perform calculations involving heat of combustion.

What is gasohol?
In efforts to reduce gas consumption from oil, ethanol is often added to regular gasoline. It has a high octane rating
and burns more slowly than regular gas. This “gasohol” is widely used in many countries.
It produces somewhat
lower carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions, but does increase air pollution from other materials.

Molar Heat of Combustion

Many chemical reactions are combustion reactions.
It is often important to know the energy produced in such
a reaction so we can determine which fuel might be the most efﬁcient for a given purpose. The molar heat of
combustion (He) is the heat released when one mole of a substance is completely burned.
Typical combustion reactions involve the reaction of a carbon-containing material with oxygen to form carbon
dioxide and water as products. If methanol is burned in air, we have:
CH3OH + O2 → CO2 + 2H2O He = 890 kJ/mol
In this case, one mole of oxygen reacts with one mole of methanol to form one mole of carbon dioxide and two
moles of water.
It should be noted that inorganic substances can also undergo a form of combustion reaction:
2Mg + O2 → 2 MgO

822

www.ck12.org

Chapter 17. Thermochemistry

In this case there is no water and no carbon dioxide formed. These reactions are generally not what we would be
talking about when we discuss combustion reactions.
Sample Problem: Calculation of Heat of Combustion
Heats of combustion are usually determined by burning a known amount of the material in a bomb calorimeter with
an excess of oxygen. By measuring the temperature change, the heat of combustion can be determined.

17.15 Hess’s Law of Heat Summation

• Use Hess’s law of heat summation to add chemical reactions together in such a way as to produce a desired

ﬁnal equation.

• Calculate the enthalpy change for that ﬁnal reaction.

How much energy is involved in the operation of an acetylene torch?
Since there is a complex series of reactions taking place, simple methods for determining the heat of reaction will
not work. We need to develop new approaches to these calculations.

Adding Heats of Reaction

It is sometimes very difﬁcult or even impossible to measure the enthalpy change for a reaction directly in the
laboratory. Some reactions take place extremely slowly, making a direct measurement unfeasible. In other cases, a
given reaction may be an intermediate step in a series of reactions. Some reactions may be difﬁcult to isolate because
multiple side reactions may occur at the same time. Fortunately, it is possible to measure the enthalpy change for a
reaction by an indirect method. Hess’s law of heat summation states that if two or more thermochemical equations
can be added together to give a ﬁnal equation, then the heats of reaction can also be added to give a heat of reaction
for the ﬁnal equation.
An example will illustrate how Hess’s law can be used. Acetylene (C2H2) is a gas that burns at an extremely high
temperature (3300°C) and is used in welding (pictured in the opening image). On paper, acetylene gas can be
produced by the reaction of solid carbon (graphite) with hydrogen gas.

2C(s, graphite) + H2(g) → C2H2(g)

(cid:52)H =?

Unfortunately, this reaction would be virtually impossible to perform in the laboratory because carbon would react
with hydrogen to form many different hydrocarbon products simultaneously. There is no way to create conditions
under which only acetylene would be produced.
However, enthalpy changes for combustion reactions are relatively easy to measure. The heats of combustion for
carbon, hydrogen, and acetylene are shown below along with each balanced equation.

1. C(s, graphite) + O2(g) → CO2(g)
2. H2(g) + 1
3. C2H2(g) + 5

2O2(g) → H2O(l)

2O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + H2O(l)

(cid:52)H = −393.5 kJ
(cid:52)H = −285.8 kJ
(cid:52)H = −1301.1 kJ

To use Hess’s law, we need to determine how the three equations above can be manipulated so that they can be added
together to result in the desired equation (the formation of acetylene from carbon and hydrogen).
In order to do this, we will go through the desired equation, one substance at a time –choosing the combustion
reaction from the equations numbered 1-3 above that contains that substance. It may be necessary to either reverse a
combustion reaction or multiply it by some factor in order to make it “ﬁt” to the desired equation. The ﬁrst reactant
is carbon and the in the equation for the desired reaction, the coefﬁcient of the carbon is a 2. So, we will write the
ﬁrst combustion reaction, doubling all of the coefﬁcients and the (cid:52)H.

2C(s, graphite) + 2O2(g) → 2CO2(g)

(cid:52)H = 2(−393.5) = −787.0 kJ

The second reactant is hydrogen and its coefﬁcient is a 1, as it is in the second combustion reaction. Therefore, that
reaction will be used as written.

H2(g) +

1
2

O2(g) → H2O(l)

(cid:52)H = −285.8 kJ

The product of the reaction is C2H2 and its coefﬁcient is also a 1. In combustion reaction #3, the acetylene is a
reactant. Therefore, we will reverse reaction 3, changing the sign of the (cid:52)H.

2CO2(g) + H2O(l) → C2H2(g) +

5
2

O2(g)

(cid:52)H = 1301.1 kJ

Now, these three reactions can be summed together. Any substance that appears in equal quantities as a reactant in
one equation and a product in another equation cancels out algebraically. The values for the enthalpy changes are
likewise added.

(cid:52)H = 228.3 kJ

So the heat of reaction for the combination of carbon with hydrogen to produce acetylene is 228.3 kJ. When one
mole of acetylene is produced, 228.3 kJ of heat are absorbed, making the reaction endothermic.

Is the Hope diamond just a very expensive pencil?
The Hope diamond is a very expensive piece of jewelry, currently worth about $350 million. A pencil can be
purchased for less than a dollar. Both items contain carbon, but there is a big difference in how that carbon is
organized. The diamond was formed under very different reaction conditions than the graphite, so it has a different
heat of formation.

Standard Heat of Formation

A relatively straightforward chemical reaction is one in which elements are combined to form a compound. Sodium
and chlorine react to form sodium chloride (see video below). Hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water.
Like other reactions, these are accompanied by either the absorption or release of heat. The standard heat of
◦) is the enthalpy change associated with the formation of one mole of a compound from its
formation (∆H f
elements in their standard states. The standard conditions for thermochemistry are 25°C and 101.3 kPa. Therefore,
the standard state of an element is its state at 25°C and 101.3 kPa. For example, iron is a solid, bromine is a liquid,
and oxygen is a gas under those conditions. The standard heat of formation of an element in its standard state is by
◦ = 0 for the diatomic elements, H2(g), N2(g), O2(g), F2(g), Cl2(g), Br2(l), and
deﬁnition equal to zero. The ∆H f

17.17 Calculating Heat of Reaction from Heat of

Formation

• Calculate standard heat of reaction using standard heats of formation.

How are diamonds made?
Natural diamonds are mined from sites around the world. However, the price of natural diamonds is carefully
controlled, so other sources for diamonds are being explored. Several different methods for producing synthetic
diamonds are available, usually involving treating carbon at very high temperatures and pressures. The diamonds
produced are now of high quality, but are primarily used in industrial applications. Diamonds are one of the hardest
materials available and are widely used for cutting and grinding tools.

Calculating Heat of Reaction from Heat of Formation

An application of Hess’s law allows us to use standard heats of formation to indirectly calculate the heat of reaction
for any reaction that occurs at standard conditions. An enthalpy change that occurs speciﬁcally under standard
conditions is called the standard enthalpy (or heat) of reaction and is given the symbol ∆H◦. The standard heat
of reaction can be calculated by using the following equation.

∆H◦ = ∑n∆H◦

f (products)−∑n∆H◦

f (reactants)

The symbol Σ is the Greek letter sigma and means “the sum of”. The standard heat of reaction is equal to the sum
of all the standard heats of formation of the products minus the sum of all the standard heats of formation of the
reactants. The symbol “n” signiﬁes that each heat of formation must ﬁrst be multiplied by its coefﬁcient in the
balanced equation.

Sample Problem: Calculating Standard Heat of Reaction
Calculate the standard heat of reaction (∆H◦) for the reaction of nitrogen monoxide gas with oxygen to form nitrogen
dioxide gas.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• ∆H f
• ∆H f
• ∆H f

◦ for NO(g) = 90.4 kJ/mol
◦ for O2(g) = 0 (element)
◦ for NO2(g) = 33.85 kJ/mol

Unknown

• ∆H◦ =? kJ

First write the balanced equation for the reaction. Then apply the equation to calculate the standard heat of reaction
for the standard heats of formation.
Step 2: Solve.
The balanced equation is: 2NO(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)
Applying the equation form the text:

∆H◦ = [2 mol NO2(33.85 kJ/mol)]− [2 mol NO(90.4 kJ/mol) + 1 mol O2(0 kJ/mol)]

= −113 kJ

The standard heat of reaction is -113 kJ.
Step 3: Think about your result.

18.1 Chemical Reaction Rate

• Deﬁne reaction rate.
• Calculate reaction rate when given time and change in concentration.

Two for the price of one!
Drag racing is a sport where two cars start from a dead stop and drive as fast as they can down a quarter-mile
strip. At the end of the strip are timers that determine both elapsed time (how long did it take for them to cover the
quarter mile) and top speed (how fast were they going as they went through the timer chute). Both pieces of data are
important. One car may accelerate faster and get ahead that way, while the other care may be slower off the line, but
can get up to a higher top speed at the end of the run.

Chemical Reaction Rate

Chemical reactions vary widely in the speeds with which they occur. Some reactions occur very quickly. If a lighted
match is brought in contact with lighter ﬂuid or another ﬂammable liquid, it erupts into ﬂame instantly and burns
fast. Other reactions occur very slowly. A container of milk in the refrigerator will be good to drink for weeks
before it begins to turn sour. Millions of years were required for dead plants under Earth’s surface to accumulate and
eventually turn into fossil fuels such as coal and oil.
Chemists need to be concerned with the rates at which chemical reactions occur. Rate is another word for speed. If
a sprinter takes 11.0 s to run a 100 m dash, his rate or speed is given by the distance traveled divided by the time.

835

18.1. Chemical Reaction Rate

www.ck12.org

The sprinter’s average running rate for the race is 9.09 m/s. We say that it is his average rate because he did not run
at that speed for the entire race. At the very beginning of the race, while coming from a standstill, his rate must be
slower until he is able to get up to his top speed. His top speed must then be greater than 9.09 m/s so that taken over
the entire race, the average ends up at 9.09 m/s.

FIGURE 18.1
Runner.

Chemical reactions can’t be measured in units of meters per second, as that would not make any sense. A reaction
rate is the change in concentration of a reactant or product with time. Suppose that a simple reaction were to take
place in which a 1.00 M aqueous solution of substance A was converted to substance B.

A(aq) → B(aq)

Suppose that after 20.0 seconds, the concentration of A had dropped from 1.00 M to 0.72 M as A was slowly being
converted to B. We can express the rate of this reaction as the change in concentration of A divided by the time.

rate = −∆[A]

∆t = − [A]ﬁnal − [A]initial

∆t

A bracket around a symbol or formula means the concentration in molarity of that substance. The change in
concentration of A is its ﬁnal concentration minus its initial concentration. Because the concentration of A is
decreasing over time, the negative sign is used. Thus, the rate for the reaction is positive and the units are molarity
per second or M/s.

rate = −0.72 M− 1.00 M

20.0 s

= −−0.28 M

20.0 s

= 0.014 M/s

The molarity of A decreases by an average rate of 0.014 M every second. In summary, the rate of a chemical reaction
is measured by the change in concentration over time for a reactant or product. The unit of measurement for a
reaction rate is molarity per second (M/s).

Summary

• The reaction rate indicates how fast the reaction proceeds.

18.2 Collision Theory

• Deﬁne collision theory.

Oops!
Car damage can be very expensive, especially if the person hitting your car does not have insurance. Many people
have had the experience of backing up while parallel parking and hearing that “bump”. Fortunately, there is often no
damage because the cars were not going fast enough. But every once in a while there is a rearrangement of the body
parts of a car when it is hit with sufﬁcient speed. Then things need to be ﬁxed.

Collision Theory

The behavior of the atoms, molecules, or ions that comprise the reactants is responsible for the rates of a given
chemical reaction. Collision theory is a set of principles that states that the reacting particles can form products
when they collide with one another provided those collisions have enough kinetic energy and the correct orientation.
Particles that lack the necessary kinetic energy may collide, but the particles will simply bounce off one another
unchanged. The ﬁgure below illustrates the difference. In the ﬁrst collision, the particles bounce off one another and
no rearrangement of atoms has occurred. The second collision occurs with greater kinetic energy, and so the bond
between the two red atoms breaks. One red atom bonds with the other molecule as one product, while the single red
atom is the other product. The ﬁrst collision is called an ineffective collision, while the second collision is called an
effective collision.

Summary

• Collision theory explains how materials can collide and become new materials.

18.3 Activation Energy

• Deﬁne activation energy.

How do ﬁreworks light up the sky?
The sight of ﬁreworks exploding across the night sky is always exciting. These materials, invented hundreds of
years ago, can be dangerous if not handled properly. The chemicals do not react until the fuse burns down and heat
is applied to the system. Then the rocket is launched and explodes high in the sky.

Activation Energy

Why do some chemical reactions occur readily while others require input of heat in order to take place? If we
mix metallic sodium with water, a reaction occurs immediately, releasing a great deal of heat (enough to ignite the
hydrogen gas that is formed). Group II metals, such as calcium, react at a much slower rate. Unlike the extremely
vigorous reaction with sodium, the reaction with calcium is slow enough that we can trap the hydrogen gas released.
Supplying reactant particles with energy causes the bonds between the atoms to vibrate with a greater frequency.
This increase in vibrational energy makes a chemical bond more likely to break and a chemical reaction more likely
to occur when those particles collide with other particles. The activation energy for a reaction is the minimum
energy that colliding particles must have in order to undergo a reaction. Some reactions occur readily at room
temperature because the reacting particles already have the requisite activation energy at that temperature. Other
reactions only occur when heated because the particles do not have enough energy unless an external source of heat
provides the particles with more kinetic energy.

What was Sisyphus’s punishment?
Sisyphus was a mythological being who had been a very evil king. As a punishment, he was supposed to roll a
large stone up to the top of a long hill. A spell had been placed on the stone so that it would roll back down before
reaching the top, never to complete the task. Sisyphus was condemned to an eternity of trying to get to the top of the
hill, but never succeeding.

Potential Energy Diagrams

The energy changes that occur during a chemical reaction can be shown in a diagram called a potential energy
diagram, or sometimes called a reaction progress curve. A potential energy diagram shows the change in potential
energy of a system as reactants are converted into products. The Figure 18.4 shows basic potential energy diagrams
for an endothermic (A) and an exothermic (B) reaction. Recall that the enthalpy change (∆H) is positive for an
endothermic reaction and negative for an exothermic reaction. This can be seen in the potential energy diagrams.
The total potential energy of the system increases for the endothermic reaction as the system absorbs energy from the
surroundings. The total potential energy of the system decreases for the exothermic reaction as the system releases
energy to the surroundings.
The activation energy for a reaction is illustrated in the potential energy diagram by the height of the hill between
the reactants and the products. For this reason, the activation energy of a reaction is sometimes referred to as the
activation energy barrier. Reacting particles must have enough energy so that when they collide they can overcome
that barrier (see Figure 18.5).

Will it stick?
Velcro is a synthetic material that allows fabrics (among other things) to stick together. Another more unusual use
for Velcro is the sport (?) of “Velcro-jumping”. The participant wears clothing made of Velcro and jumps at a
Velcro-covered wall. Sometimes the collision with the wall will result in the person sticking to the wall. Other times
the person simply bounces off the wall and does not connect.

Activated Complex

Reactant particles sometimes collide with one other and yet remain unchanged by the collision. Other times, the
collision leads to the formation of products. The state of the particles that is in between the reactants and products is
called the activated complex. An activated complex is an unstable arrangement of atoms that exists momentarily
at the peak of the activation energy barrier. Because of its high energy, the activated complex exists for an extremely
short period of time (about 10−13s). There is equal likelihood that the activated complex either reforms the original
reactants or goes on to form products. The Figure 18.6 shows the formation of a possible activated complex between
colliding hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Because of their unstable nature and brief existence, very little is known
about the exact structures of many activated complexes.

18.6 Factors Affecting Reaction Rate

• List and describe factors that affect reaction rate.

What are the chances of a fender-bender on the highway?
Driving on a crowded freeway can get exciting. Lots of cars, drivers who aren’t paying attention, people who speed,
people who drive too slow –the chances of a collision are rather high. A lot of cars in a particular amount of space
equals a high car concentration and many opportunities for unwanted connections with other cars.

Factors Affecting Reaction Rates

By their nature, some reactions occur very quickly, while others are very slow. However, certain changes in the
reacting conditions can have an effect on the rate of a given chemical reaction. Collision theory can be utilized to
explain these rate effects.

Concentration

An increase in the concentration of one or more reacting substances results in an increase in the rate of reaction.
When more particles are present in a given amount of space, a greater number of collisions will naturally occur
between those particles. Since the rate of a reaction is dependent on the number of collisions occurring between
reactants, the rate increases as the concentration increases.

847

18.6. Factors Affecting Reaction Rate

www.ck12.org

Pressure

When the pressure of a gas is increased its particles are forced closer together, decreasing in the process the amount
of empty space between the particles. Therefore, an increase in the pressure of a gas is also an increase in the
concentration of the gas. For gaseous reactions, an increase in pressure increases the rate of reaction for the same
reasons as described for an increase in concentration. Higher gas pressure leads to a greater number of collisions
between reacting particles.

Surface Area

A large log placed in a ﬁre will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the ﬁre in the form
of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than
the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when
a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the
same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller
particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react
more quickly with other reactants.

Temperature

Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles
are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect
of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the
activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number
of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

Summary

• Factors affecting reaction rate are:

– concentration of reactants
– pressure (if gas)
– surface area
– temperature

18.7 Catalysts

• Deﬁne catalyst.
• Explain how catalysts inﬂuence the rate of a chemical reaction.

Where did the sun go?
Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen
reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete
combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help
form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and
be changed into less harmful products.

Catalysts

Sometimes a substance can be added to a chemical reaction and it will cause that reaction to undergo a dramatic
increase in rate. Hydrogen peroxide is used as a disinfectant for scrapes and cuts and is found in many medicine
cabinets as a 3% aqueous solution. Hydrogen peroxide naturally decomposes to produce water and oxygen gas,
but the reaction is very slow. A bottle of hydrogen peroxide will last for several years before it needs to be
replaced. However, the addition of just a small amount of manganese(IV) oxide to hydrogen peroxide will cause it
to decompose completely in just a matter of minutes. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical
reaction by lowering the activation energy without being used up in the reaction. After the reaction occurs, a catalyst
returns to its original state and so catalysts can be used over and over again. Because it is neither a reactant nor a
product, a catalyst is shown in a chemical equation by being written above the yield arrow.

Chapter 18. Kinetics

A catalyst works by changing the speciﬁc way in which the reaction occurs, called its mechanism. The important
outcome from the use of a catalyst is that the overall activation energy of the reaction is lowered (see Figure 18.7).
With a lower activation energy barrier, a greater percentage of reactant molecules are able to have effective collisions
and the reaction rate increases.

FIGURE 18.7
The addition of a catalyst to a reaction lowers the activation energy, increasing the rate of the reaction. The
activation energy of the uncatalyzed reaction is shown by Ea, while the catalyzed reaction is shown by Ea’. The
heat of reaction (∆H) is unchanged by the presence of the catalyst.

Catalysts are extremely important parts of many chemical reactions. Enzymes in your body act as nature’s catalysts,
allowing important biochemical reactions to occur at reasonable rates. Chemical companies constantly search for
new and better catalysts to make reactions go faster and thus make the company more proﬁtable.

18.8 Rate Law and Speciﬁc Rate Constant

• Deﬁne rate law.
• Deﬁne speciﬁc rate constant.

What are the migration patterns of the current population?
Where are people moving from and where are they moving to? How fast is the population changing in different
areas? These are important questions for people involved in deciding about where to build schools or hospitals or
where to open new businesses. If an area is growing rapidly, action needs to be taken soon to accommodate the
growth. How fast the growth is will determine how many schools to build. Rates of change affect a lot of decisions.

Rate Law and Speciﬁc Rate Constant

Consider a simple chemical reaction in which reactant A is converted into product B according to the equation below.

The rate of reaction is given by the change in concentration of A as a function of time. The rate of disappearance of
A is also proportional to the concentration of A.

A → B

−∆[A]
∆t

α [A]

Since the rate of a reaction generally depends upon collision frequency, it stands to reason that as the concentration
of A increases, the rate of reaction increases. Likewise, as the concentration of A decreases, the rate of reaction
decreases. The expression for the rate of the reaction can be shown as follows:

rate = −∆[A]
∆t

or

rate = k[A]

The proportionality between the rate and [A] becomes an equal sign by the insertion of a constant (k). A rate law is
an expression showing the relationship of the reaction rate to the concentrations of each reactant. The speciﬁc rate

853

18.8. Rate Law and Speciﬁc Rate Constant

www.ck12.org

constant (k) is the proportionality constant relating the rate of the reaction to the concentrations of reactants. The
rate law and the speciﬁc rate constant for any chemical reaction must be determined experimentally. The value of
the rate constant is temperature dependent. A large value of the rate constant means that the reaction is relatively
fast, while a small value of the rate constant means that the reaction is relatively slow.

18.9 Order of Reaction

• Describe the kinetic characteristics of a ﬁrst-order reaction.

How harmful are forest ﬁres?
Forest ﬁres cause extensive damage when they occur. Both plant and animal life are harmed during these events. The
severity of a forest ﬁre depends on how much plant life is available to burn –the more available dry plant material,
the more serious the ﬁre and the more rapidly it will spread.

Order of Reaction
In the reaction A → B, the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of A raised to the ﬁrst
power. That is to say, [A] = [A]1. A ﬁrst-order reaction is a reaction in which the rate is proportional to the
concentration of only one reactant. As a ﬁrst-order reaction proceeds, the rate of reaction decreases because the
concentration of the reactant decreases ( Figure 18.8). The graph of concentration versus time is curved. The
reaction rate
can be determined graphically by the slope of a tangent to the curve at any point. The rate of
the reaction at the time shown with the red triangle is given by:

(cid:16) ∆[A]

(cid:17)

∆t

rate = − [A]ﬁnal − [A]initial

∆t

= −0.35 M− 0.63 M
3.0 s− 1.0 s

= 0.14 M/s

The rates of some reactions depend on the concentrations of more than one reactant. Consider a reaction in which a
molecule of A collides with a molecule of B to form product C.

A + B → C

FIGURE 18.8
This graph shows how the concentration of a reactant changes as a reaction proceeds. The rate of the reaction
is determined at any point by measuring the slope of a tangent to the curve.

Doubling the concentration of A alone would double the reaction rate. Likewise, doubling the concentration of B
alone would also double the rate. The rate law must reﬂect the rate dependence on both reactants.

This reaction is said to be ﬁrst order with respect to A and ﬁrst order with respect to B. Overall, it is a second-order
reaction. The rate law and the order of a reaction must be determined experimentally.

18.10 Determining the Rate Law from Experimen-

tal Data

• Use experimental data to determine the rate law for a reaction.

How fast?
Determining the amount of time a process requires calls for a timer. These devices can be simple kitchen timers (not
very precise) or complex systems that can measure to a fraction of a second. Accurate time measurement is essential
in kinetics studies for assessing rates of chemical reactions.

Determining the Rate Law from Experimental Data

In order to experimentally determine a rate law, a series of experiments must be performed with various starting
concentrations of reactants. The initial rate law is then measured for each of the reactions. Consider the reaction
between nitrogen monoxide gas and hydrogen gas to form nitrogen gas and water vapor.

2NO(g) + 2H2(g) → N2(g) + 2H2O(g)

The following data were collected for this reaction at 1280°C ( Table 18.1).

Notice that the starting concentrations of NO and H2 were varied in a speciﬁc way. In order to compare the rates
of reaction and determine the order with respect to each reactant, the initial concentration of each reactant must be
changed while the other is held constant.
Comparing experiments 1 and 2: the concentration of NO was doubled, while the concentration of H2 was held
constant. The initial rate of the reaction quadrupled, since 5.00×10−5
1.25×10−5 = 4. Therefore, the order of the reaction with
respect to NO is 2. In other words, rate α [NO]2. Because 22 = 4, the doubling of [NO] results in a rate that is four
times greater.
Comparing experiments 2 and 3: the concentration of H2 was doubled while the concentration of NO was held
constant. The initial rate of the reaction doubled, since 1.00×10−4
5.00×10−5 = 2. Therefore, the order of the reaction with
respect to H2 is 1, or rate α [H2]1. Because 21 = 2, the doubling of H2 results in a rate that is twice as great.
The overall rate law then includes both of these results.

rate = k[NO]2[H2]

The sum of the exponents is 2 + 1 = 3, making the reaction third-order overall. Once the rate law for a reaction is
determined, the speciﬁc rate constant can be found by substituting the data for any of the experiments into the rate
law and solving for k.

Notice that the rate law for the reaction does not relate to the balanced equation for the overall reaction. The
coefﬁcients of NO and H2 are both 2, while the order of the reaction with respect to the H2 is only one. The units for
the speciﬁc rate constant vary with the order of the reaction. So far, we have seen reactions that are ﬁrst or second
order with respect to a given reactant. Occasionally, the rate of a reaction may not depend on the concentration of
one of the reactants at all. In this case, the reaction is said to be zero-order with respect to that reactant.

18.11 Reaction Mechanisms and the Elementary

Step

• Deﬁne reaction mechanism.
• Deﬁne elementary step.

Up in the air
What most people see of an airplane is the ﬁnal product. They do not see the long, complex assembly line that
begins with a few parts and gradually becomes the ﬁnished product. Assembly lines are intricate organizations that
go through a series of complicated steps to bring hundreds (maybe thousands) of parts together into the completed
aircraft.

Reaction Mechanisms and the Elementary Step

Chemical reactions rarely occur in one simple step. The overall balanced equation for a chemical reaction does
not always tell us how a reaction actually proceeds. In many cases, the overall reaction takes place in a series of
small steps. An elementary step (or elementary reaction) is one step in a series of simple reactions that show
the progress of a reaction at the molecular level. A reaction mechanism is the sequence of elementary steps that
together comprise an entire chemical reaction. As an analogy, consider the route that you might take while driving
to the grocery store. That route may consist of several turns, similar to the elementary steps. The overall reaction
speciﬁes only the beginning point (your house) and the ﬁnal destination (the store), with no information about the
speciﬁcs in between.

Ozone depletetion
Ozone (O3) depletion in the atmosphere is of signiﬁcant concern. This gas serves as a protection against the
ultraviolet rays of the sun. Ozone is naturally depleted in addition to the depletion caused by human-made chemicals.
The depletion reaction is a two-step process:

O3 + ultraviolet light → O2 + O·(free radical) slow reaction
O· + O3 → 2O2 fast reaction

The free radical is not a part of the overall equation, but can be detected in the lab.

Intermediate

Reaction mechanisms describe how the material in a chemical reaction gets from the initial reactants to the ﬁnal
products. One reaction that illustrates a reaction mechanism is the reaction between nitrogen monoxide and oxygen
to form nitrogen dioxide:

2NO(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)

863

18.12. Reaction Intermediate

www.ck12.org

It may seem as though this reaction would occur as the result of a collision between two NO molecules with one
O2 molecule. However, careful analysis of the reaction has detected the presence of N2O2 during the reaction. A
proposed mechanism for the reaction consists of two elementary steps:
Step 1: 2NO(g) → N2O2(g)
Step 2: N2O2(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)
In the ﬁrst step, two molecules of NO collide to form a molecule of N2O2. In the second step, that molecule of N2O2
collides with a molecule of O2 to produce two molecules of NO2. The overall chemical reaction is the sum of the
two elementary steps:

2NO(g) → 
N2O2(g)

N2O2(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)
2NO(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)

The N2O2 molecule is not part of the overall reaction. It was produced in the ﬁrst elementary step, then reacts in the
second elementary step. An intermediate is a species which appears in the mechanism of a reaction, but not in the
overall balanced equation. An intermediate is always formed in an early step in the mechanism and consumed in a
later step.

One piece at a time
Many people enjoy putting jigsaw puzzles together. Often these puzzles come in a box, so you have to spread all the
pieces out before you start. Nowadays you can also ﬁnd internet sites that have jigsaw puzzles. You can choose the
level of difﬁculty, the shape of the pieces –and you can time yourself to see how well you did compare to others that
tried the puzzle. The puzzle looks complicated with the ﬁnal product often numbering hundreds of pieces. However,
in assembling the puzzle, you have a series of elementary steps and the puzzle goes together one piece at a time.

Molecularity of a Reaction

The molecularity of a reaction is the number of molecules reacting in an elementary step. A unimolecular reaction
is one in which only one reacting molecule participates in the reaction. Two reactant molecules collide with one
another in a bimolecular reaction. A termolecular reaction involves three reacting molecules in one elementary
step. Termolecular reactions are relatively rare because they involve the simultaneous collision of three molecules
in the correct orientation, a rare event. When termolecular reactions do occur, they tend to be very slow.
If we have the reaction:

2NO(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)

We might guess that the reaction was termolecular since it appears that three molecules of reactants are involved. How-
ever, our deﬁnition of molecularity states that we need to look at an elementary step and not the overall reaction.
Data on the reaction mechanism shows us that the reaction occurs in two steps:

866

www.ck12.org

Chapter 18. Kinetics

Step 1: 2NO(g) → N2O2(g)
Step 2: N2O2(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)
So we see that each elementary step is bimolecular and not termolecular. Notice that the colliding molecules may be
the same (as in step 1 above) or different (as in step 2 above).
Another reaction involves the conversion of ozone (O3) to oxygen (O2) with ultraviolet light. The two elementary
steps are as follows:

O3 + ultraviolet light → O2 + O·(free radical) slow reaction
O· + O3 → 2O2 fast reaction

The ﬁrst step is unimolecular (one molecule of ozone reacts) and the second step is bimolecular (one ozone free
radical and one ozone molecule react together).

Waiting in line
Airline travel can be very frustrating. You usually have to get to the airport two hours before your ﬂight leaves.
You stand in line to check your baggage and get your boarding pass. Then you stand in line for your security
screen. Finally, you wait in line to board the plane. Since there are only so many ticket agents, not everybody can be
waited on immediately. The same with the security screen –only so many body scanners are available. And getting
on the plane involves going one-by-one down a very narrow aisle to get to your seat. All these limits to slow you
down.

Rate-Determining Step

The determination of a reaction mechanism can only be made in the laboratory. When a reaction occurs in a sequence
of elementary steps, the overall reaction rate is governed by whichever one of those steps is the slowest. The rate-
determining step is the slowest step in the sequence of steps in a reaction mechanism. To get an idea of how
one step is rate determining, imagine driving on a one-lane road where it is not possible to pass another vehicle.
The rate of ﬂow of trafﬁc on such a road would be dictated by whatever car is traveling at the lowest speed. The
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is discussed below and illustrates how reaction mechanisms can be determined
through experimental studies.

Decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide

Recall that a catalyst is a substance, which increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed. Cat-
alysts lower the overall activation energy for a reaction by providing an alternative mechanism for the reaction to
follow. One such catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is iodide ions (I−).

2H2O2(aq)

I−−→ 2H2O(l) + O2(g)

By experiment, the rate of reaction is found to be ﬁrst-order with respect to both H2O2 and I− and second-order
overall.

rate = k[H2O2][I−]

The reaction cannot occur in one step corresponding to the overall balanced equation. If it did, the reaction would
be second-order with respect to H2O2 since the coefﬁcient of the H2O2 in the balanced equation is a 2. A reaction
mechanism can be constructed which accounts for the rate law and for the detection of the IO− ion as an intermediate.
It consists of two bimolecular elementary steps.
Step 1: H2O2(aq) + I−(aq) → H2O(l) + IO−(aq)
Step 2: H2O2(aq) + IO−(aq) → H2O(l) + O2 + I−(aq)
If step 1 is the rate-determining step, then the rate law for that step will be the rate law for the overall reaction.

rate = k[H2O2][I−]

The rate law for the slow step of the proposed mechanism agrees with the overall experimentally determined rate
law. The IO− is present as an intermediate in the reaction. The iodide ion catalyst also appears in the mechanism.
It is consumed in the ﬁrst elementary step and then is regenerated in the second step. That is the requirement for a
catalyst –that is that it is not used up in the reaction.

Summary

• The rate-determining step in a reaction is deﬁned.
• The process for determining the rate-determining step is described.

Roller coasters-fun or frightful?
For many people, a roller coaster is the epitome of excitement, while for others it is a torture device to be avoided
at all costs (and some folks are in-between). For a roller coaster, the rate-limiting step is the climb up to the top at
the beginning of the ride, where the cars are hauled slowly to the peak of the ride. This peak must be the highest
because the potential energy at this point must be enough to cause the roller coaster to move through the smaller
peaks without stopping.

Potential Energy Diagrams

The potential energy diagram can illustrate the mechanism for a reaction by showing each elementary step of the
reaction with distinct activation energy (see Figure 18.10).
The reaction whose potential energy diagram is shown in the ﬁgure is a two-step reaction. The activation energy for
each step is labeled Ea1 and Ea2. Each elementary step has its own activated complex, labeled AC1 and AC2. Note
that the overall enthalpy change of the reaction (∆H) is unaffected by the individual steps, since it depends only on
the initial and ﬁnal states.
In this example, the rate-limiting step in the reaction is the ﬁrst step, leading to the formation of the activated complex
AC1. The activation energy is higher for this step than for step two, which has a considerably lower activation energy.
If the rate-limiting step were the second step, the peak labeled AC2 would be higher than the peak for AC1 and Ea2
would be greater than Ea1. The same approach can be taken for a potential energy diagram with more than two
peaks.

19.1 Reversible Reaction

• Deﬁne reversible reaction.
• Give examples of reversible reactions.

How do you change the color of a solution?
A solution of cobalt chloride in water is pink due to the presence of the solvated Co2+ ion. If sufﬁcient HCl is added,
2− ion forms. The reaction can be shifted back to the pink form if more water is
the solution turns blue as the CoCl4
added to the solution.

Reversible Reactions

Up until this point, we have written the equations for chemical reactions in a way that would seem to indicate
that all reactions proceed completely until all the reactants have been converted into products. In reality, a great
many chemical reactions do not proceed entirely to completion. A reversible reaction is a reaction in which the
conversion of reactants to products and the conversion of products to reactants occur simultaneously. One example
of a reversible reaction is the reaction of hydrogen gas and iodine vapor to from hydrogen iodide. The forward and
reverse reactions can be written as follows.

Forward reaction : H2(g) + I2(g) → 2HI(g)
2HI(g) → H2(g) + I2(g)
Reverse reaction :

In the forward reaction, hydrogen and iodine combine to form hydrogen iodide. In the reverse reaction, hydrogen
iodide decomposes back into hydrogen and iodine. The two reactions can be combined into one equation by the use
of a double arrow.

875

19.1. Reversible Reaction

www.ck12.org

H2(g) + I2(g) (cid:29) 2HI(g)

The double arrow is the indication that the reaction is reversible.
When hydrogen and iodine gases are mixed in a sealed container, they begin to react and form hydrogen iodide.
At ﬁrst, only the forward reaction occurs because no HI is present. As the forward reaction proceeds, it begins
to slow down as the concentrations of the H2 and the I2 decrease. As soon as some HI has formed, it begins to
decompose back into H2 and I2. The rate of the reverse reaction starts out slow because the concentration of HI is
low. Gradually, the rate of the forward reaction decreases while the rate of the reverse reaction increases. Eventually
the rate of combination of H2 and I2 to produce HI becomes equal to the rate of decomposition of HI into H2 and I2.
When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions have become equal to one another, the reaction has achieved a
state of balance.

Pull hard!
A tug of war involves two teams at the ends of a rope. The goal is to pull the other team over a line in the middle.
At ﬁrst, there is a great deal of tension on the rope, but no apparent movement. A bystander might think that there is
nothing happening. In reality, there is a great deal of tension on the rope as the two teams pull in opposite directions
at the same time.

Chemical Equilibrium

Hydrogen and iodine gases react to form hydrogen iodide according to the following reaction:

H2(g) + I2(g) (cid:29) 2HI(g)

Forward reaction: H2(g) + I2(g) → 2HI(g)
2HI(g) → H2(g) + I2(g)
Reverse reaction:

Initially, only the forward reaction occurs because no HI is present. As soon as some HI has formed, it begins to
decompose back into H2 and I2. Gradually, the rate of the forward reaction decreases while the rate of the reverse
reaction increases. Eventually the rate of combination of H2 and I2 to produce HI becomes equal to the rate of
decomposition of HI into H2 and I2. When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions have become equal to one
another, the reaction has achieved a state of balance. Chemical equilibrium is the state of a system in which the
rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction.

FIGURE 19.1
Equilibrium in reaction: H2(g) + I2(g) →
2HI(g).

Chemical equilibrium can be attained whether the reaction begins with all reactants and no products, all products and
no reactants, or some of both. The Figure 19.2 shows changes in concentration of H2, I2, and HI for two different
reactions. In the reaction depicted by the graph on the left (A), the reaction begins with only H2 and I2 present.
There is no HI initially. As the reaction proceeds towards equilibrium, the concentrations of the H2 and I2 gradually
decrease, while the concentration of the HI gradually increases. When the curve levels out and the concentrations
all become constant, equilibrium has been reached. At equilibrium, concentrations of all substances are constant.
In reaction B, the process begins with only HI and no H2 or I2. In this case, the concentration of HI gradually
decreases while the concentrations of H2 and I2 gradually increase until equilibrium is again reached. Notice that in
both cases, the relative position of equilibrium is the same, as shown by the relative concentrations of reactants and
products. The concentration of HI at equilibrium is signiﬁcantly higher than the concentrations of H2 and I2. This
is true whether the reaction began with all reactants or all products. The position of equilibrium is a property of the
particular reversible reaction and does not depend upon how equilibrium was achieved.

Conditions for Equilibrium

Chapter 19. Equilibrium

It may be tempting to think that once equilibrium has been reached, the reaction stops. Chemical equilibrium is
a dynamic process. The forward and reverse reactions continue to occur even after equilibrium has been reached.
However, because the rates of the reactions are the same, there is no change in the relative concentrations of reactants
and products for a reaction that is at equilibrium. The conditions and properties of a system at equilibrium are
summarized below.

1. The system must be closed, meaning no substances can enter or leave the system.
2. Equilibrium is a dynamic process. Even though we don’t necessarily see the reactions, both forward and

reverse are taking place.

3. The rates of the forward and reverse reactions must be equal.
4. The amount of reactants and products do not have to be equal. However, after equilibrium is attained, the

amounts of reactants and products will be constant.

The description of equilibrium in this concept refers primarily to equilibrium between reactants and products in
a chemical reaction. Other types of equilibrium include phase equilibrium and solution equilibrium. A phase
equilibrium occurs when a substance is in equilibrium between two states. For example, a stoppered ﬂask of
water attains equilibrium when the rate of evaporation is equal to the rate of condensation. A solution equilibrium
occurs when a solid substance is in a saturated solution. At this point, the rate of dissolution is equal to the rate of
recrystallization. Although these are all different types of transformations, most of the rules regarding equilibrium
apply to any situation in which a process occurs reversibly.

What is carbon monoxide poisoning?
Red blood cells transport oxygen to the tissues so they can function. In the absence of oxygen, cells cannot carry
out their biochemical responsibilities. Oxygen moves to the cells attached to hemoglobin, a protein found in the red
cells. In cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, CO binds much more strongly to the hemoglobin, blocking oxygen
attachment and lowering the amount of oxygen reaching the cells. Treatment involves the patient breathing pure
oxygen to displace the carbon monoxide. The equilibrium reaction shown below illustrates the shift toward the right
when excess oxygen is added to the system:

Chapter 19. Equilibrium

aA + bB (cid:29) cC + dD

As we have established, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are the same at equilibrium, and so the
concentrations of all of the substances are constant. Since that is the case, it stands to reason that a ratio of the
concentrations for any given reaction at equilibrium maintains a constant value. The equilibrium constant (Keq) is
the ratio of the mathematical product of the concentrations of the products of a reaction to the mathematical product
of the concentrations of the reactants of the reaction. Each concentration is raised to the power of its coefﬁcient in
the balanced chemical equation. For the general reaction above, the equilibrium constant expression is written as
follows:

Keq =

[C]c [D]d
[A]a [B]b

The concentrations of each substance, indicated by the square brackets around the formula, are measured in molarity
units (mol/L).
The value of the equilibrium constant for any reaction is only determined by experiment. As detailed in the above
section, the position of equilibrium for a given reaction does not depend on the starting concentrations and so the
value of the equilibrium constant is truly constant. It does, however, depend on the temperature of the reaction. This
is because equilibrium is deﬁned as a condition resulting from the rates of forward and reverse reactions being equal.
If the temperature changes, the corresponding change in those reaction rates will alter the equilibrium constant. For
any reaction in which a Keq is given, the temperature should be speciﬁed.

Iron-poor blood?
Iron is an important component of red cells. Patients who have low iron will usually be anemic and have a lower
than normal number of red blood cells. One way to assess serum iron concentration is with the use of Ferrozine,
a complex organic molecule. Ferrozine forms a product with Fe3+, producing a pink color. In order to determine
factors affecting the reaction, we need to measure the equilibrium constant. If the equilibrium does not lie far in the
direction of products, precautions need to be taken when using this material to measure iron in serum.

Calculations with Equilibrium Constants

The general value of the equilibrium constant gives us information about whether the reactants or the products
are favored at equilibrium. Since the product concentrations are in the numerator of the equilibrium expression, a
Keq > 1 means that the products are favored over the reactants. A Keq < 1 means that the reactants are favored over
the products.
Though it would often seem that the Keq value would have various units depending on the values of the exponents in
the expression, the general rule is that any units are dropped. All Keq values will be reported as having no units.

Sample Problem: Calculating an Equilibrium Constant

Equilibrium occurs when nitrogen monoxide gas reacts with oxygen gas to form nitrogen dioxide gas.

2NO(g) + O2(g) (cid:29) 2NO2(g)

At equilibrium at 230°C, the concentrations are measured to be [NO] = 0.0542 M, [O2] = 0.127 M, and [NO2] =
15.5 M. Calculate the equilibrium constant at this temperature.

882

www.ck12.org

Chapter 19. Equilibrium

Step 1: List the known values and plan the problem.
Known

• [NO] = 0.0542 M
• [O2] = 0.127 M
• [NO2] = 15.5 M

Unknown

• Keq value

The equilibrium expression is ﬁrst written according to the general form in the text. The equilibrium values are
substituted into the expression and the value calculated.
Step 2: Solve.

Keq =

[NO2]2
[NO]2 [O2]

Substituting in the concentrations at equilibrium:

Keq =

(15.5)2

(0.0542)2 (0.127)

= 6.44× 105

Step 3: Think about your result.
The equilibrium concentration of the product NO2 is signiﬁcantly higher than the concentrations of the reactants NO
and O2. As a result, the Keq value is much larger than 1, an indication that the product is favored at equilibrium.
The equilibrium expression only shows those substances whose concentrations are variable during the reaction. A
pure solid or a pure liquid does not have a concentration that will vary during a reaction. Therefore, an equilibrium
expression omits pure solids and liquids and only shows the concentrations of gases and aqueous solutions. The
decomposition of mercury(II) oxide can be shown by the following equation, followed by its equilibrium expression.

2HgO(s) (cid:29) 2Hg(l) + O2(g)

Keq = [O2]

The stoichiometry of an equation can also be used in a calculation of an equilibrium constant. At 40°C, solid
ammonium carbamate decomposes to ammonia and carbon dioxide gases.

NH4CO2NH2(s) (cid:29) 2NH3(g) + CO2(g)

At equilibrium, the [CO2] is found to be 4.71 × 10−3 M. Can the Keq value be calculated from just that information?
Because the ammonium carbamate is a solid, it is not present in the equilibrium expression.

Keq = [NH3]2[CO2]

883

19.4. Calculations with Equilibrium Constants

www.ck12.org

The stoichiometry of the chemical equation indicates that as the ammonium carbamate decomposes, 2 mol of
ammonia gas is produced for every 1 mol of carbon dioxide. Therefore, at equilibrium, the concentration of the
ammonia will be twice the concentration of carbon dioxide. So [NH3] = 2 × (4.71 × 10−3) = 9.42 × 10−3 M.
Substituting these values into the Keq expression:

Keq = (9.42× 10−3)2(4.71× 10−3) = 4.18× 10−7

Using Equilibrium Constants

The equilibrium constants are known for a great many reactions. Hydrogen and bromine gases combine to form
hydrogen bromide gas. At 730°C, the equation and Keq are given below.

H2(g) + Br2(g) (cid:29) 2HBr(g)

Keq = 2.18× 106

A certain reaction is begun with only HBr. When the reaction mixture reaches equilibrium at 730°C, the concentra-
tion of bromine gas is measured to be 0.00243 M. What is the concentration of the H2 and the HBr at equilibrium?
Since the reaction begins with only HBr and the mole ratio of H2 to Br2 is 1:1, the concentration of H2 at equilibrium
is also 0.00243 M. The equilibrium expression can be rearranged to solve for the concentration of HBr at equilibrium.

Keq =

[HBr] =

=

[HBr]2
[H2][Br2]

(cid:113)
(cid:113)

Keq[H2][Br2]
2.18× 106(0.00243)(0.00243) = 3.59 M

Since the value of the equilibrium constant is very high, the concentration of HBr is much greater than that of H2
and Br2 at equilibrium.

How far down?
There are people who enjoy going up in an airplane, strapping on a parachute, and diving out the door to free-fall
and then open the chute and drop to the ground. This stressful activity (so they say) relieves the stress of everyday
life. The release of adrenaline caused by this stressful behavior is said to promote a mood enhancement that helps
you deal better with other stresses in your daily life.

Le Châtelier’s Principle

Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936) and his description of how a
system responds to a stress to equilibrium has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle: When a chemical system
that is at equilibrium is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond in order to relieve the stress. Stresses to a
chemical system involve changes in the concentration of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the
system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. The change to
the equilibrium position in every case is either a favoring of the forward reaction or a favoring of the reverse reaction.
When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of products increases, while the concentrations of reactants
decreases. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of products decreases, while the concentrations
of reactants increases.

19.6 Effect of Concentration

• Describe the effects of concentration changes on the equilibrium of a reaction.

Phenolphthalein is one of those chemicals that has one structure in a high acid environment and another structure in
a low acid environment. If the hydrogen ion concentration is high, the compound is colorless, but turns red if the
hydrogen ion concentration is low. By adding hydrogen ions to the solution or removing them through a chemical
reaction, we can vary the color of the dye.

Effect of Concentration

A change in concentration of one of the substances in an equilibrium system typically involves either the addition or
the removal of one of the reactants or products. Consider the Haber-Bosch process for the industrial production of
ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gases.

N2(g) + 3H2(g) (cid:29) 2NH3(g)

If the concentration of one substance in a system is increased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that
removes that substance. When more N2 is added, the forward reaction will be favored because the forward reaction
uses up N2 and converts it to NH3. The forward reaction speeds up temporarily as a result of the addition of a
reactant. The position of equilibrium shifts as more NH3 is produced. The concentration of NH3 increases, while the
concentrations of N2 and H2 decrease. After some time passes, equilibrium is reestablished with new concentrations
of all three substances. As can be seen in the Figure 19.4, if more N2 is added, a new equilibrium is achieved
by the system. The new concentration of NH3 is higher because of the favoring of the forward reaction. The new
concentration of the H2 is lower. The concentration of N2 is higher than in the original equilibrium, but went down
slightly following the addition of the N2 that disturbed the original equilibrium. By responding in this way, the value
of the equilibrium constant for the reaction, Keq, does not change as a result of the stress to the system.
If more NH3 were added, the reverse reaction would be favored. This “favoring” of a reaction means temporarily
speeding up the reaction in that direction until equilibrium is reestablished. Recall that once equilibrium is reestab-
lished, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are again equal. The addition of NH3 would result in increased
formation of the reactants, N2 and H2.

FIGURE 19.4
The Haber-Bosch process is an equilib-
rium between reactant N2 and H2 and
product NH3.

An equilibrium can also be disrupted by the removal of one of the substances. If the concentration of a substance
is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-
Bosch process, NH3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward
reaction is favored so that more NH3 will be produced. The concentrations of N2 and H2 decrease. Continued
removal of NH3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either
N2 or H2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored and the concentration
of NH3 would decrease.
The effect of changes in concentration on an equilibrium system according to Le Châtelier’s Principle is summarized
in the Table 19.2.

19.7 Effect of Temperature

• Describe how temperature affects the direction of an equilibrium reaction.

Don’t inhale
We tend to think of carbon monoxide only as a hazardous gas produced from incomplete combustion of carbon
products. However, there is a large market for industrially-manufactured carbon monoxide that is used to synthesize
most of the acetic acid produced in the world. One reaction that leads to CO formation involves its formation
by passing air over excess carbon at high temperatures. The initial product (carbon dioxide) equilibrates with the
remaining hot carbon, forming carbon monoxide. At lower temperatures, CO2 formation is favored while CO is the
predominant product above 800°C.

Effect of Temperature

Increasing or decreasing the temperature of a system at equilibrium is also a stress to the system. The equation for
the Haber-Bosch process is written again below, as a thermochemical equation.

N2(g) + 3H2(g) (cid:29) 2NH3(g) + 91 kJ

The forward reaction is the exothermic direction: the formation of NH3 releases heat. The reverse reaction is the
endothermic direction: as NH3 decomposes to N2 and H2, heat is absorbed. An increase in the temperature of a
system favors the direction of the reaction that absorbs heat, the endothermic direction. Absorption of heat in this
case is a relief of the stress provided by the temperature increase. For the Haber-Bosch process, an increase in
temperature favors the reverse reaction. The concentration of NH3 in the system decreases, while the concentrations
of N2 and H2 increase.
A decrease in the temperature of a system favors the direction of the reaction that releases heat, the exothermic
direction. For the Haber-Bosch process, a decrease in temperature favors the forward reaction. The concentration of
NH3 in the system increases, while the concentrations of N2 and H2 decrease.

889

19.7. Effect of Temperature

www.ck12.org

For changes in concentration, the system responds in such a way that the value of the equilibrium constant, Keq, is
unchanged. However, a change in temperature shifts the equilibrium and the Keq value either increases or decreases.
As discussed in the previous section, values of Keq are dependent on the temperature. When the temperature of the
system for the Haber-Bosch process is increased, the resultant shift in equilibrium towards the reactants means that
the Keq value decreases. When the temperature is decreased, the shift in equilibrium towards the products means
that the Keq value increases.
Le Châtelier’s principle as related to temperature changes can be illustrated easily by the reaction in which nitrogen
tetroxide is in equilibrium with nitrogen dioxide.

N2O4(g) + heat (cid:29) 2NO2(g)

Dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) is colorless, while nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is dark brown in color. When N2O4 breaks
down into NO2, heat is absorbed according to the forward reaction above. Therefore, an increase in temperature of
the system will favor the forward reaction. Conversely, a decrease in temperature will favor the reverse reaction.
Watch a video demonstrating the effect of temperature on the equilibrium between NO2 and N2O4.

19.8 Effect of Pressure

• Describe the effect of pressure on an equilibrium reaction.

A dual purpose
The ammonia storage tank in the picture above does two things, One it stores ammonia at high pressure to minimize
the reverse reaction that would lead to less ammonia and more nitrogen and hydrogen. Secondly, it sends an
important message. Ammonia is used to make methamphetamine, a dangerous drug of abuse. Locks and other
safety mechanisms built into the tanks help stop the theft of ammonia to be used in this illicit activity.

Effect of Pressure

Changing the pressure of an equilibrium system in which gases are involved is also a stress to the system. A change
in the pressure on a liquid or a solid has a negligible effect. We will return again to the equilibrium for the Haber-
Bosch process. Imagine the gases are contained in a closed system in which the volume of the system is controlled
by an adjustable piston as shown in the Figure 19.5.
On the far left, the reaction system contains primarily N2 and H2, with only one molecule of NH3 present. As the
piston is pushed inwards, the pressure of the system increases according to Boyle’s Law. This is a stress to the
equilibrium. In the middle image, the same number of molecules is now conﬁned in a smaller space and so the
pressure has increased. According to LeChâtelier’s principle, the system responds in order to relieve the stress. In
the image on the right, the forward reaction has been favored, in which one molecule of N2 combines with three
molecules of H2 to form two molecules of NH3. The overall result is a decrease in the number of gas molecules
in the entire system. This in turn decreases the pressure and provides a relief to the original stress of a pressure
increase. An increase in pressure on an equilibrium system favors the reaction which produces fewer total moles of
gas. In this case, it is the forward reaction that is favored.

FIGURE 19.5
Effect of pressure on ammonia formation.

A decrease in pressure on the above system could be achieved by pulling the piston outward, increasing the container
volume. The equilibrium would respond by favoring the reverse reaction in which NH3 decomposes to N2 and H2.
This is because the overall number of gas molecules would increases and so would the pressure. A decrease in
pressure on an equilibrium system favors the reaction which produces more total moles of gas. This is summarized
in the Table 19.3.

Stress
pressure increase
pressure decrease

TABLE 19.3:

Response

Like changes in concentration, the Keq value for a given reaction is unchanged by a change in pressure.
It is important to remember when analyzing the effect of a pressure change on equilibrium that only gases are
affected. If a certain reaction involves liquids or solids, they should be ignored. Calcium carbonate decomposes
according to the equilibrium reaction:

CaCO3(s) (cid:29) CaO(s) + O2(g)

Oxygen is the only gas in the system. An increase in the pressure of the system slows the rate of decomposition
of CaCO3 because the reverse reaction is favored. When a system contains equal moles of gas on both sides of the
equation, pressure has no effect on the equilibrium position, as in the formation of HCl from H2 and Cl2.

H2(g) + Cl2(g) (cid:29) 2HCl(g)

Where’s the ﬁre?
Fires are a part of life. Some ﬁres clear the land and allow new growth. Other ﬁres provide warmth on a cold night.
Unfortunately, many ﬁres are destructive, leaving damage in their wake. All ﬁres leave the environment changed,
never to revert back to the original situation. The carbon dioxide and water generated by a ﬁre go off into the
atmosphere and do not return. The change is permanent and irreversible.

Going to Completion

When one of the products of a reaction is removed from the chemical equilibrium system as soon as it is produced,
the reverse reaction cannot establish itself and equilibrium is never reached. Reactions such as these are said to go to
completion. These processes are often referred to as non-reversible reactions. Reactions which go to completion
tend to produce one of three types of products: (1) an insoluble precipitate, (2) a gas, (3) a molecular compound
such as water. Examples of these reactions are shown below.

1. Formation of a precipitate

AgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → NaNO3(aq) + AgCl(s)

3. Formation of water

HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)

www.ck12.org

If we look at these reactions in more detail, we can see some things that are not apparent the way the equations are
written. Looking at the ﬁrst equation, we do not see a double arrow between reactants and products because the
reaction is considered essentially irreversible. However if we consider the net ionic equation Ag+ + Cl− → AgCl,
then the reverse reaction would be AgCl → Ag+ + Cl−. The Keq for the reverse reaction is 1.8 × 10−10. For all
practical purposes, the reaction goes to completion.
Formation of a gas in an open system is essentially irreversible since the gas escapes into the atmosphere. Looking
at the activity series we see that Mg is much higher in the series than hydrogen. So the reaction would be expected
to go strongly in the indicated direction.
The third reaction gets a little more complicated. In solution, the reactants HCl and NaOH will be ionize completely
as does the NaCl product. Water exists in an equilibrium with H+ and OH−, with the dissociation constant for
water being 1 × 10−14. So, in the solution resulting from the reaction given here, the [H+] is 1 × 10−7 M, a very
insigniﬁcant amount. For all practical purposes, this reaction can be said to go to completion.

LeChâtelier’s Principle and the Equilibrium Constant

Occasionally, when students apply LeChatelier’s principle to an equilibrium problem involving a change in concen-
tration, they assume that Keq must change. This seems logical since we talk about “shifting” the equilibrium in one
direction or the other. However, Keq is a constant, for a given equilibrium at a given temperature, so it must not
change. Here is an example of how this works. Consider the simpliﬁed equilibrium below:

Let’s say we have a 1.0 liter container. At equilibrium the following amounts are measured.

A (cid:29) B

A = 0.50 mol
B = 1.0 mol

895

19.10. LeChâtelier’s Principle and the Equilibrium Constant

www.ck12.org

The value of Keq is given by:

Keq =

[B]
[A]

=

1.0 M
0.50 M

= 2.0

Now we will disturb the equilibrium by adding 0.50 mole of A to the mixture. The equilibrium will shift towards
the right, forming more B. Immediately after the addition of A and before any response, we now have 1.0 mol of A
and 1.0 mol of B. The equilibrium then shifts in the forward direction. We will introduce a variable (x), which will
represent the change in concentrations as the reaction proceeds. Since the mole ratio of A : B is 1:1, as [A] decreases
by the amount x, the [B] increases by the amount x. We set up an analysis called ICE, which stands for Initial,
Change, and Equilibrium. The values in the table represent molar concentrations.

Initial
Change
Equilibrium

A
1.0
− x
1.0− x

B
1.0
+ x
1.0 + x

At the new equilibrium position, the values for A and B as a function of x can be set equal to the value of the Keq.
Then, one can solve for x.

Solving for x:

Keq = 2.0 =

[B]
[A]

=

1.0 + x
1.0− x

2.0(1.0− x) = 1.0 + x
2.0− 2.0x = 1.0 + x

3.0x = 1.0
x = 0.33

This value for x is now plugged back in to the Equilibrium line of the table and the ﬁnal concentrations of A and B
after the reaction is calculated.

[A] = 1.0− x = 0.67 M
[B] = 1.0 + x = 1.33 M

The value of Keq has been maintained since 1.33
0.67 = 2.0. This shows that even though a change in concentration of
one of the substances in equilibrium causes a shift in the equilibrium position, the value of the equilibrium constant
does not change.

No more weighing
At one time, a major analytical technique was gravimetric analysis. An ion would be precipitated out of solution,
puriﬁed, and weighed to determine the amount of that ion in the original material. As an example, measurement of
Ca2+ involved dissolving the sample in water, precipitating the calcium as calcium oxalate, purifying the precipitate,
drying it, and weighing the ﬁnal product. Although this approach can be very accurate (atomic weights for many
elements were determined this way), the process is slow, tedious, and prone to a number of errors in technique.
Newer methods are now available that measure minute amounts of calcium ions in solution without the long, involved
gravimetric approach.

Solubility Product Constant

Ionic compounds have widely differing solubilities. Sodium chloride has a solubility of about 360 g per liter of
water at 25°C. Salts of alkali metals tend to be quite soluble. On the other end of the spectrum, the solubility of zinc
hydroxide is only 4.2 × 10−4 g/L of water at the same temperature. Many ionic compounds containing hydroxide
are relatively insoluble.
Most ionic compounds that are considered to be insoluble will still dissolve to a small extent in water. These
“mostly insoluble” compounds are considered to be strong electrolytes because whatever portion of the compound
that dissolved also dissociates. As an example, silver chloride dissociates to a small extent into silver ions and
chloride ions upon being added to water.

www.ck12.org

Chapter 19. Equilibrium

The process is written as an equilibrium because the dissociation occurs only to a small extent. Therefore, an
equilibrium expression can be written for the process. Keep in mind that the solid silver chloride does not have a
variable concentration and so is not included in the expression.

Ksp = [Ag+][Cl−]

This equilibrium constant is called the solubility product constant, (Ksp) and is equal to the mathematical product
of the ions each raised to the power of the coefﬁcient of the ion in the dissociation equation.
The stoichiometry of the formula of the ionic compound dictates the form of the Ksp expression. For example the
formula of calcium phosphate is Ca3(PO4)2. The dissociation equation and Ksp expression are shown below:

• Deﬁne molar solubility.

How is baking soda made?
Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is prepared by bubbling carbon dioxide gas through a solution of ammonia and
sodium chloride. Ammonium carbonate is ﬁrst formed which then reacts with the NaCl to form sodium bicarbonate
and ammonium chloride. The sodium bicarbonate is less soluble than the other materials, so it will precipitate out
of solution.

Conversion of Solubility to

Solubility is normally expressed in g/L of saturated solution. However, solubility can also be expressed as the moles
per liter. Molar solubility is the number of moles of solute in one liter of saturated solution. In other words, the
molar solubility of a given compound represents the highest molarity solution that is possible for that compound.
The molar mass of a compound is the conversion factor between solubility and molar solubility. Given that the
solubility of Zn(OH)2 is 4.2 × 10−4 g/L, the molar solubility can be calculated as shown below:

The solubility of lead(II) ﬂuoride is found experimentally to be 0.533 g/L. Calculate the Ksp for lead(II) ﬂuoride.
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.

• solubility of PbF2 = 0.533 g/L
• molar mass = 245.20 g/mol

Unknown

• Ksp of PbF2 = ?

PbF2(s) (cid:29) Pb2+(aq) + 2F−(aq)

The steps above will be followed to calculate the Ksp for PbF2.
Step 2: Solve.

L

× 1 mol

= 2.17× 10−3 M

The dissociation equation shows that for every mole of PbF2 that dissociates, 1 mol of Pb2+ and 2 mol of F− are
produced. Therefore, at equilibrium the concentrations of the ions are:

[Pb2+] = 2.17× 10−3 M and [F−] = 2× 2.17× 10−3 = 4.35× 10−3 M

Substitute into the expression and solve for the Ksp.

Ksp = (2.17× 10−3)(4.35× 10−3)2 = 4.11× 10−8

Step 3: Think about your result.
The solubility product constant is signiﬁcantly less than 1 for a nearly insoluble compound such as PbF2.

How do you purify water?
Puriﬁcation of water for drinking and other uses is a complicated process. Heavy metals need to be removed, a
process accomplished by addition of carbonates and sulfates. Lead contamination can present major health problems,
especially for younger children. Lead sulfates and carbonates are very insoluble, so will precipitate out of solution
very easily.

Chapter 19. Equilibrium

The known Ksp values from the Table 19.5 can be used to calculate the solubility of a given compound by following
the steps listed below.

1. Set up an ICE problem (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) in order to use the Ksp value to calculate the concentra-

tion of each of the ions.

2. The concentration of the ions leads to the molar solubility of the compound.
3. Use the molar mass to convert from molar solubility to solubility.

The Ksp of calcium carbonate is 4.5 × 10−9. We begin by setting up an ICE table showing the dissociation of CaCO3
into calcium ions and carbonate ions. The variable s will be used to represent the molar solubility of CaCO3. In this
2− ion. Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations
case, each formula unit of CaCO3 yields one Ca2+ ion and one CO3
of each ion are equal to s.

The Ksp expression can be written in terms of s and then used to solve for s.

Ksp = [Ca2+][CO2−

s = (cid:112)Ksp =

(cid:112)

3 ] = (s)(s) = s2
4.5× 10−9 = 6.7× 10−5 M

The concentration of each of the ions at equilibrium is 6.7 × 10−5 M. We can use the molar mass to convert from
molar solubility to solubility.

6.7× 10−5 mol

L

× 100.09 g
1 mol

= 6.7× 10−3 g/L

So the maximum amount of calcium carbonate that is capable of dissolving in 1 liter of water at 25°C is 6.7 × 10−3 grams.
Note that in the case above, the 1:1 ratio of the ions upon dissociation led to the Ksp being equal to s2. This is referred
to as a formula of the type AB, where A is the cation and B is the anion. Now let’s consider a formula of the type
AB2, such as Fe(OH)2. In this case the setup of the ICE table would look like the following:

Initial (M)
Change (M)

0.00
+ 2s

+ s

When the Ksp expression is written in terms of s, we get the following result for the molar solubility.

Ksp = [Fe2+][OH−]2 = (s)(2s)2 = 4s3

19.14 Predicting Precipitates

• Predict solubility of a compound based on the comparison between the ion product and the Ksp.

What do you see?
The invention of the X-ray machine had radically improved medical diagnosis and treatment. For the ﬁrst time, it
was possible to see inside a person’s body to detect broken bones, tumors, obstructions, and other types of problems.
Barium sulfate is often used to examine patients with problems of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. This
insoluble compound coats the inside of the tissues and absorbs X-rays, allowing a clear picture of the interior
structure of these organs.

Predicting Precipitates

Knowledge of Ksp values will allow you to be able to predict whether or not a precipitate will form when two
solutions are mixed together. For example, suppose that a known solution of barium chloride is mixed with a known
solution of sodium sulfate. Barium sulfate is a mostly insoluble compound and so could potentially precipitate from
2−] for the solution. If the
the mixture. However, it is ﬁrst necessary to calculate the ion product, [Ba2+][SO4
value of the ion product is less than the value of the Ksp, then the solution will remain unsaturated. No precipitate
will form because the concentrations are not high enough to begin the precipitation process. If the value of the ion
product is greater than the value of the Ksp, then a precipitate will form. The formation of the precipitate lowers the
concentration of each of the ions until the ion product is exactly equal to the Ksp, at which point precipitation ceases.

Sample Problem: Predicting Precipitates

Will a precipitate of barium sulfate form when 10.0 mL of 0.0050 M BaCl2 is mixed with 20.0 mL of 0.0020 M
Na2SO4?

• concentration of BaCl2 = 0.0050 M
• volume of BaCl2 = 10.0 mL

The concentration and volume of each solution that is mixed together must be used to calculate the [Ba2+] and
2−]. Each individual solution is diluted when they are mixed together. The ion product is calculated and
the [SO4
compared to the Ksp to determine if a precipitate forms.
Step 2: Solve.
The moles of each ion from the original solutions are calculated by multiplying the molarity by the volume in liters.

mol Ba2+ = 0.0050 M× 0.010 L = 5.0× 10−5 mol Ba2+

Since the ion product is greater than the Ksp, a precipitate of barium sulfate will form.

Lithium carbonate is an essential component of lithium batteries, which tend to be longer-lasting than regular alkaline
batteries. The material is obtained from lithium ores by adding CO2 under high pressure to form the more soluble
LiHCO3. The mixture is then depressurized to remove the carbon dioxide and the lithium carbonate precipitates out
of solution.

to the left in order to relieve the stress of the added calcium ion. Additional calcium sulfate would precipitate out
of the solution until the ion product once again becomes equal to the Ksp. Note that in the new equilibrium the

concentrations of the calcium ion and the sulfate ion would no longer be equal to each other. The calcium ion
concentration would be larger than the sulfate ion concentration.
This situation describes the common ion effect. A common ion is an ion that is in common to both salts in a solution.
In the above example, the common ion is Ca2+. The common ion effect is a decrease in the solubility of an ionic
compound as a result of the addition of a common ion. Adding calcium ion to the saturated solution of calcium
sulfate causes additional CaSO4 to precipitate from the solution, lowering its solubility. The addition of a solution
containing sulfate ion, such as potassium sulfate, would result in the same common ion effect.

Sample Problem: The Common Ion Effect

What is the concentration of zinc ion in 1.00 L of a saturated solution of zinc hydroxide to which 0.040 mol of NaOH
has been added?
Step 1: List the known quantities and plan the problem.
Known

• Ksp = 3.0× 10−16 (from table in "Conversion of Ksp to Solubility")
• moles of added NaOH = 0.040 mol
• volumes of solution = 1.00 L

Unknown

• [Zn2+] = ? M

Express the concentrations of the two ions relative to the variable s. The concentration of the zinc ion will be equal
to s, while the concentration of the hydroxide ion will be equal to 0.040 + 2s.
Step 2: Solve.
The Ksp expression can be written in terms of the variable s.

Ksp = [Zn2+][OH−]2 = (s)(0.040 + 2s)2

Because the value of the Ksp is so small, we can make the assumption that the value of s will be very small compared
to 0.040. This simpliﬁes the mathematics involved in solving for s.

Ksp = (s)(0.040)2 = 0.0016 s = 3.0× 10−16

(cid:2)OH−(cid:3)2 =

Ksp

s =

3.0× 10−16

0.0016

= 1.9× 10−13 M

The concentration of the zinc ion is equal to s and so [Zn2+] = 1.9 × 10−13 M.
Step 3: Think about your result.
The relatively high concentration of the common ion, OH−, results in a very low concentration of zinc ion. The
molar solubility of the zinc hydroxide is less in the presence of the common ion than it would be in water.

• The common ion and common ion effect are described.

20.1 Entropy

• Deﬁne entropy.
• List factors that inﬂuence the entropy of a system.
• List situations that illustrate the concept of entropy.

What will it look like?
When the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle are dumped from the box, the pieces naturally hit the table in a very random
pattern. In order to put the puzzle together, a great deal of work must be done to overcome the natural disorder of the
pieces. The pieces need to be turned right-side up, then sorted by color or edge (some people like to put the border
together ﬁrst). Then comes the challenge of ﬁnding the exact spot of each piece of the puzzle in order to get the ﬁnal
organized picture.

Entropy

There is a tendency in nature for systems to proceed toward a state of greater disorder or randomness. Entropy
is a measure of the degree of randomness or disorder of a system. Entropy is an easy concept to understand when
thinking about everyday situations. The entropy of a room that has been recently cleaned and organized is low. As
time goes by, it likely will become more disordered and thus its entropy will increase (see Figure 20.1). The natural
tendency of a system is for its entropy to increase.
Chemical reactions also tend to proceed in such a way as to increase the total entropy of the system. How can you
tell if a certain reaction shows an increase or a decrease in entropy? The molecular state of the reactants and products
provide certain clues. The general cases below illustrate entropy at the molecular level.

1. For a given substance, the entropy of the liquid state is greater than the entropy of the solid state. Likewise,
the entropy of the gas is greater than the entropy of the liquid. Therefore, entropy increases in processes in

915

FIGURE 20.1

entropy than the highly ordered room on
the left.

which solid or liquid reactants form gaseous products. Entropy also increases when solid reactants form liquid
products.

2. Entropy increases when a substance is broken up into multiple parts. The process of dissolving increases

entropy because the solute particles become separated from one another when a solution is formed.

3. Entropy increases as temperature increases. An increase in temperature means that the particles of the
substance have greater kinetic energy. The faster moving particles have more disorder than particles that
are moving more slowly at a lower temperature.

4. Entropy generally increases in reactions in which the total number of product molecules is greater than the
total number of reactant molecules. An exception to this rule is when a gas is being produced from nongaseous
reactants.

The examples below will serve to illustrate how the entropy change in a reaction can be predicted.

Cl2(g) → Cl2(l)
The entropy is decreasing because a gas is becoming a liquid.
CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)
The entropy is increasing because a gas is being produced and the number of molecules is increasing.
N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g)
The entropy is decreasing because four total reactant molecules are forming two total product molecules. All
are gases.
AgNO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) → NaNO3(aq) + AgCl(s)
The entropy is decreasing because a solid is formed from aqueous reactants.
H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)
The entropy change is unknown (but likely not zero), because there are equal numbers of molecules on both
sides of the equation and all are gases.

How much energy is available?
As scientists explore energy supplies, geothermal sources look very appealing. The natural geysers that exist in some
parts of the world could possibly be harnessed to provide power for many purposes. The change in energy content
and the release of energy caused by steam condensing to liquid can help ﬁll some of our growing energy needs.

Standard Entropy

All molecular motion ceases at absolute zero (0 K). Therefore, the entropy of a pure crystalline substance at absolute
zero is deﬁned to be equal to zero. As the temperature of the substance increases, its entropy increases because of
an increase in molecular motion. The absolute or standard entropy of substances can be measured. The symbol for
entropy is S and the standard entropy of a substance is given by the symbol S◦, indicating that the standard entropy is
determined under standard conditions. The units for entropy are J/K • mol. Standard entropies for a few substances
are shown in the Table 20.1:

Chapter 20. Entropy and Free Energy

The knowledge of the absolute entropies of substances allows us to calculate the entropy change (∆S◦) for a reaction.
For example, the entropy change for the vaporization of water can be found as follows:

∆S◦ = S◦(H2O(g))− S◦(H2O(l))

= 188.7 J/K· mol− 69.9 J/K· mol = 118.8 J/K· mol

The entropy change for the vaporization of water is positive because the gas state has higher entropy than the liquid
state.
In general, the entropy change for a reaction can be determined if the standard entropies of each substance are
known. The equation below can be applied.

∆S◦ = ∑nS◦(products)−∑nS◦(reactants)

The standard entropy change is equal to the sum of all the standard entropies of the products minus the sum of all
the standard entropies of the reactants. The symbol “n” signiﬁes that each entropy must ﬁrst be multiplied by its
coefﬁcient in the balanced equation. The entropy change for the formation of liquid water from gaseous hydrogen
and oxygen can be calculated using this equation:

2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)
∆S◦ = 2(69.9)− [2(131.0) + 1(205.0)] = −327 J/K· mol

The entropy change for this reaction is highly negative because three gaseous molecules are being converted into
two liquid molecules. According to the drive towards higher entropy, the formation of water from hydrogen and
oxygen is an unfavorable reaction. In this case, the reaction is highly exothermic and the drive towards a decrease in
energy allows the reaction to occur.

Watch that nitro!
Nitroglycerin is tricky stuff. An active ingredient in dynamite (where it is stabilized), “raw” nitroglycerin is very
unstable. Physical shock will cause the material to explode. The reaction is shown below:

4C3H5(ONO2)3 → 12CO2 + 10H2O + 6N2 + O2

The explosion of nitroglycerin releases large volumes of gases and is very exothermic.

Spontaneous Reactions

Reactions are favorable when they result in a decrease in enthalpy and an increase in entropy of the system. When
both of these conditions are met, the reaction occurs naturally. A spontaneous reaction is a reaction that favors the
formation of products at the conditions under which the reaction is occurring. A roaring bonﬁre is an example of
a spontaneous reaction, since it is exothermic (there is a decrease in the energy of the system as energy is released
to the surroundings as heat). The products of a ﬁre are composed partly of gases such as carbon dioxide and water
vapor. The entropy of the system increases during a combustion reaction. The combination of energy decrease and
entropy increase dictates that combustion reactions are spontaneous reactions.
A nonspontaneous reaction is a reaction that does not favor the formation of products at the given set of conditions.
In order for a reaction to be nonspontaneous, it must be endothermic, accompanied by a decrease in entropy, or both.

Bonﬁre.

Our atmosphere is composed primarily of a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gases. One could write an equation
showing these gases undergoing a chemical reaction to form nitrogen monoxide.

N2(g) + O2(g) → 2NO(g)

Fortunately, this reaction is nonspontaneous at normal temperatures and pressures.
It is a highly endothermic
reaction with a slightly positive entropy change (∆S). Nitrogen monoxide is capable of being produced at very
high temperatures and has been observed to form as a result of lightning strikes.
One must be careful not to confuse the term spontaneous with the notion that a reaction occurs rapidly. A spon-
taneous reaction is one in which product formation is favored, even if the reaction is extremely slow. A piece of
paper will not suddenly burst into ﬂames, although its combustion is a spontaneous reaction. What is missing is the
required activation energy to get the reaction started. If the paper were to be heated to a high enough temperature, it
would begin to burn, at which point the reaction would proceed spontaneously until completion.
In a reversible reaction, one reaction direction may be favored over the other. Carbonic acid is present in carbonated
beverages. It decomposes spontaneously to carbon dioxide and water according to the following reaction.

H2CO3(aq) (cid:29) CO2(g) + H2O(l)

If you were to start with pure carbonic acid in water and allow the system to come to equilibrium, more than 99% of
the carbonic acid would be converted into carbon dioxide and water. The forward reaction is spontaneous because
the products of the forward reaction are favored at equilibrium. In the reverse reaction, carbon dioxide and water are
the reactants and carbonic acid is the product. When carbon dioxide is bubbled into water, less than 1% is converted
to carbonic acid when the reaction reaches equilibrium. The reverse reaction, as written above, is not spontaneous.

• Deﬁne free energy.
• Describe how changes in ∆H and ∆S affect ∆G.

All aboard!
The steam engine pictured above is slowly going out of style, but is still a picturesque part of the modern railroad.
The water in a boiler is heated by a ﬁre (usually fueled by coal) and turned to steam. This steam then pushes the
pistons that drive the wheels of the train. It is the pressure created by the steam which allows work to be done in
moving the train.

Free Energy

Many chemical reactions and physical processes release energy that can be used to do other things. When the fuel in
a car is burned, some of the released energy is used to power the vehicle. Free energy is energy that is available to do
work. Spontaneous reactions release free energy as they proceed. Recall that the determining factors for spontaneity
of a reaction are the enthalpy and entropy changes that occur for the system. The free energy change of a reaction is
a mathematical combination of the enthalpy change and the entropy change.

∆G◦ = ∆H◦ − T∆S◦

The symbol for free energy is G, in honor of American scientist Josiah Gibbs (1839-1903), who made many
contributions to thermodynamics. The change in Gibbs free energy is equal to the change in enthalpy minus the

924

www.ck12.org

Chapter 20. Entropy and Free Energy

mathematical product of the change in entropy multiplied by the Kelvin temperature. Each thermodynamic quantity
in the equation is for substances in their standard states. The usual units for ∆H is kJ/mol, while ∆S is often reported
in J/K • mol. It is necessary to change the units for ∆S to kJ/K • mol, so that the calculation of ∆G is in kJ/mol.
A spontaneous reaction is one that releases free energy, and so the sign of ∆G must be negative. Since both ∆H
and ∆S can be either positive or negative, depending on the characteristics of the particular reaction, there are four
different general outcomes for ∆G and these are outlined in the Table 20.2:

TABLE 20.2: Enthalpy, Entropy, and Free Energy Changes

∆H

+ value (endothermic)
− value (exothermic)
+ value (endothermic)

∆S
+ value (disordering)
+ value (disordering)
− value (ordering)
− value (ordering)

∆G
always negative
negative at higher temperatures
negative at lower temperatures
never negative

Keep in mind that the temperature in the Gibbs free energy equation is the Kelvin temperature and so can only be
positive. When ∆H is negative and ∆S is positive, the sign of ∆G will always be negative, and the reaction will be
spontaneous at all temperatures. This corresponds to both driving forces being in favor of product formation. When
∆H is positive and ∆S is negative, the sign of ∆G will always be positive, and the reaction can never be spontaneous.
This corresponds to both driving forces working against product formation.
When one driving force favors the reaction, but the other does not, it is the temperature that determines the sign of
∆G. Consider ﬁrst an endothermic reaction (positive ∆H) that also displays an increase in entropy (positive ∆S).
It is the entropy term that favors the reaction. Therefore, as the temperature increases, the T∆S term in the Gibbs
free energy equation will begin to predominate and ∆G will become negative. A common example of a process
which falls into this category is the melting of ice. At a relatively low temperature (below 273 K), the melting is not
spontaneous because the positive ∆H term “outweighs” the T∆S term. When the temperature rises above 273 K, the
process becomes spontaneous because the larger T value has tipped the sign of ∆G over to being negative.
When the reaction is exothermic (negative ∆H) but undergoes a decrease in entropy (negative ∆S), it is the enthalpy
term that favors the reaction. In this case, a spontaneous reaction is dependent upon the T∆S term being small
relative to the ∆H term, so that ∆G is negative. The freezing of water is an example of this type of process. It is
spontaneous only at a relatively low temperature. Above 273 K, the larger T∆S value causes the sign of ∆G to be
positive, and freezing does not occur.

• Free energy is deﬁned.
• Relationships between enthalpy, entropy, and free energy are described.

20.5 Calculating Free Energy Change (∆G◦)

• Perform free energy calculations using enthalpy, entropy, and temperature values.

Time for dessert!
When you are baking something, you heat the oven to the temperature indicated in the recipe. Then you mix all the
ingredients, put them in the proper baking dish, and place them in the oven for a speciﬁed amount of time. If you
had mixed the ingredients and left them out at room temperature, not much would change. The materials need to
be heated to a given temperature for a set time in order for the ingredients to react with one another and produce a
delicious ﬁnal product.

Calculating Free Energy

The free energy change of a reaction can be calculated using the following expression:

∆G◦ = ∆H◦ − T∆S◦

where ∆G = free energy change (kJ/mol)
∆H = change in enthalpy (kJ/mol)
∆S = change in entropy (J/K· mol)

927

20.5. Calculating Free Energy Change (∆G◦)

www.ck12.org

T = temperature (Kelvin)
Note that all values are for substances in their standard state. In performing calculations, it is necessary to change
the units for ∆S to kJ/K • mol, so that the calculation of ∆G is in kJ/mol.

Sample Problem: Gibbs Free Energy

Methane gas reacts with water vapor to produce a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen according to the
balanced equation below.

CH4(g) + H2O(g) → CO(g) + 3H2(g)

The ∆H◦ for the reaction is +206.1 kJ/mol, while the ∆S◦ is +215 J/K • mol. Calculate the ∆G◦ at 25°C and determine
if the reaction is spontaneous at that temperature.
Step 1: List the known values and plan the problem.
Known

• ∆H◦ = 206.1 kJ/mol
• ∆S◦ = 215 J/K· mol = 0.215 kJ/K· mol
• T = 25◦C = 298 K

Unknown

• ∆G◦ =? kJ/mol

Prior to substitution into the Gibbs free energy equation, the entropy change is converted to kJ/K • mol and the
temperature to Kelvins.
Step 2: Solve.

∆G◦ = ∆H◦ − T∆S◦ = 206.1 kJ/mol− 298 K(0.215 kJ/K· mol) = +142.0 kJ/mol

The resulting positive value of ∆G indicates that the reaction is not spontaneous at 25°C.
Step 3: Think about your result.
The unfavorable driving force of increasing enthalpy outweighed the favorable increase in entropy. The reaction will
be spontaneous only at some elevated temperature.
Available values for enthalpy and entropy changes are generally measured at the standard conditions of 25°C and
1 atm pressure. The values are slightly temperature dependent and so we must use caution when calculating
speciﬁc ∆G values at temperatures other than 25°C. However, since the values for ∆H and ∆S do not change a
great deal, the tabulated values can safely be used when making general predictions about the spontaneity of a
reaction at various temperatures.

How is steel produced?
Iron ore (Fe2O3) and coke (an impure form of carbon) are heated together to make iron and carbon dioxide. The

can then be treated with small amounts of other materials to make a variety of steel products.

Temperature and Free Energy

Consider the reversible reaction in which calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas.
The production of CaO (called quicklime) has been an important reaction for centuries.

CaCO3(s) (cid:29) CaO(s) + CO2(g)

The ∆H◦ for the reaction is 177.8 kJ/mol, while the ∆S◦ is 160.5 J/K • mol. The reaction is endothermic with an
increase in entropy due to the production of a gas. We can ﬁrst calculate the ∆G◦ at 25°C in order to determine if the
reaction is spontaneous at room temperature.

∆G◦ = ∆H◦ − T∆S◦ = 177.8 kJ/mol− 298 K(0.1605 kJ/K· mol) = 130.0 kJ/mol

Since the ∆G◦ is a large positive quantity, the reaction strongly favors the reactants and very little products would be
formed. In order to determine a temperature at which ∆G◦ will become negative, we can ﬁrst solve the equation for
the temperature when ∆G◦ is equal to zero.

Recall that the assumption that ∆H◦ and ∆S◦ are independent of temperature means that the temperature at which
the sign of ∆G◦ switches from being positive to negative (835°C) is an approximation. It is also important to point
out that one should not assume that absolutely no products are formed below 835°C and that at that temperature
decomposition suddenly begins. Rather, at lower temperatures, the amount of products formed is simply not great
enough to say that the products are favored. When this reaction is performed, the amount of products can be detected
by monitoring the pressure of the CO2 gas that is produced. Above about 700°C, measurable amounts of CO2 are
produced. The pressure of CO2 at equilibrium gradually increases with increasing temperature. Above 835°C, the
pressure of CO2 at equilibrium begins to exceed 1 atm, the standard-state pressure. This is an indication that the
products of the reaction are now favored above that temperature. When quicklime is manufactured, the CO2 is
constantly removed from the reaction mixture as it is produced. This causes the reaction to be driven towards the
products according to LeChâtelier’s principle.

20.7 Changes of State and Free Energy

• Describe how a change of state inﬂuences free energy.

How are energy and changes of state related?

Energy in a body of water can be gained or lost depending on conditions. When water is heated above a certain
temperature steam is generated. The increase in heat energy creates a higher level of disorder in the water molecules
as they boil off and leave the liquid.

Changes of State and Free Energy

At the temperature at which a change of state occurs, the two states are in equilibrium with one another. For an
ice-water system, equilibrium takes place at 0°C, so ∆G◦ is equal to 0 at that temperature. The heat of fusion of
water is known to be equal to 6.01 kJ/mol, and so the Gibbs free energy equation can be solved for the entropy
change that occurs during the melting of ice. The symbol ∆Sfus represents the entropy change during the melting
process, while Tf is the freezing point of water.

=

Tf

6.01 kJ/mol

273 K

= 0.0220 kJ/K· mol = 22.0 J/K· mol

The entropy change is positive as the solid state changes into the liquid state. If the transition went from the liquid
to the solid state, the numerical value for ∆S would be the same, but the sign would be reversed since we are going
from a less ordered to a more ordered situation.

933

20.7. Changes of State and Free Energy

www.ck12.org

A similar calculation can be performed for the vaporization of liquid to gas. In this case we would use the molar
heat of vaporization. This value would be 40.79 kJ/mol. The ∆Svap would then be as follows:

∆S =

40.79 kJ/mol

373 K

= 0.1094 kJ/K· mol = 109.4 J/K· mol

The value is positive, again reﬂecting the increase in disorder going from liquid to vapor. Condensation from vapor
to liquid would give a negative value for ∆S.

What are these formations called when they point down?
Formation of stalactites (pointing down) and stalagmites (pointing up) is a complex process. Solutions of minerals
drip down and absorb carbon dioxide as water ﬂows through the cave. Calcium carbonate dissolves in this liquid
and redeposits on the rock as the carbon dioxide is dissipated into the environment.

Equilibrium Constant and

At equilibrium the ∆G for a reversible reaction is equal to zero. Keq relates the concentrations of all substances in
the reaction at equilibrium. Therefore we can write (through a more advanced treatment of thermodynamics) the
following equation:

∆G◦ = −RT lnKeq

The variable R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/K • mol), T is the Kelvin temperature, and lnKeq is the natural
logarithm of the equilibrium constant.
When Keq is large, the products of the reaction are favored and the negative sign in the equation means that the ∆G◦
is negative. When Keq is small, the reactants of the reaction are favored. The natural logarithm of a number less than
one is negative and so the sign of ∆G◦ is positive. The Table 20.3 summarizes the relationship of ∆G◦ to Keq:

Knowledge of either the standard free energy change or the equilibrium constant for a reaction allows for the

The formation of nitrogen monoxide from nitrogen and oxygen gases is a reaction that strongly favors the reactants
at 25°C.

N2(g) + O2(g) (cid:29) 2NO(g)

The actual concentrations of each gas would be difﬁcult to measure, and so the Keq for the reaction can more easily
calculated from the ∆G◦, which is equal to 173.4 kJ/mol.
Step 1: List the known values and plan the problem.
Known

• ∆G◦ = +173.4 kJ/mol
• R = 8.314 J/K· mol
• T = 25◦C = 298 K

Unknown

• Keq =?

In order to make the units agree, the value of ∆G◦ will need to be converted to J/mol (173,400 J/mol). To solve for
Keq, the inverse of the natural logarithm, ex, will be used.
Step 2: Solve.

Keq = e

8.314 J/K·mol(298 K) = 4.0× 10−31

Step 3: Think about your result.
The large positive free energy change leads to a Keq value that is extremely small. Both lead to the conclusion that
the reactants are highly favored and very few product molecules are present at equilibrium.

21.1 Properties of Acids

• List characteristics of acids.

Is the coffee ready yet?
Many people enjoy drinking coffee. A cup ﬁrst thing in the morning helps start the day. But keeping the coffee maker
clean can be a problem. Lime deposits build up after a while and slow down the brewing process. The best cure for
this is to put vinegar (dilute acetic acid) in the pot and run it through the brewing cycle. The vinegar dissolves the
deposits and cleans the maker, which will speed up the brewing process back to its original rate. Just be sure to run
water through the brewing process after the vinegar, or you will get some really horrible coffee.

Acids

Acids are very common in some of the foods that we eat. Citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons contain citric acid
and ascorbic acid, which is better known as vitamin C. Carbonated sodas contain phosphoric acid. Vinegar contains
acetic acid. Your own stomach utilizes hydrochloric acid to digest food.
Acids are a distinct class of compounds because of the properties of their aqueous solutions. Those properties are
outlined below:

1. Aqueous solutions of acids are electrolytes, meaning that they conduct an electrical current. Some acids are
strong electrolytes because they ionize completely in water, yielding a great many ions. Other acids are weak
electrolytes that exist primarily in a non-ionized form when dissolved in water.

2. Acids have a sour taste. Lemons, vinegar, and sour candies all contain acids.
3. Acids change the color of certain acid-base indicators. Two common indicators are litmus and phenolph-

thalein. Blue litmus turns red in the presence of an acid, while phenolphthalein turns colorless.

4. Acids react with active metals to yield hydrogen gas. Recall that an activity series is a list of metals in
descending order of reactivity. Metals that are above hydrogen in the activity series will replace the hydrogen
from an acid in a single-replacement reaction, as shown below:

941

21.1. Properties of Acids

www.ck12.org

Zn(s) + H2SO4(aq) → ZnSO4(aq) + H2(g)

5. Acids react with bases to produce a salt compound and water. When equal moles of an acid and a base are
combined, the acid is neutralized by the base. The products of this reaction are an ionic compound, which is
labeled as a salt, and water.

21.2 Properties of Bases

• List the properties of bases.

Have you ever had acid indigestion?
Perhaps you have eaten too much pizza and felt very uncomfortable hours later. This feeling is due to excess stomach
acid being produced. The discomfort can be dealt with by taking an antacid. The base in the antacid will react with
the HCl in the stomach and neutralize it, taking care of that unpleasant feeling.

Bases

Bases have properties that mostly contrast with those of acids.

1. Aqueous solutions of bases are also electrolytes. Bases can be either strong or weak, just as acids can.
2. Bases often have a bitter taste and are found in foods less frequently than acids. Many bases, like soaps, are

slippery to the touch.

3. Bases also change the color of indicators. Litmus turns blue in the presence of a base while phenolphthalein

turns pink.

4. Bases do not react with metals in the way that acids do.
5. Bases react with acids to produce a salt and water.

Please note that tasting chemicals and touching them are NOT good lab practices and should be avoided –in other
words, don’t do this at home.
Bases are less common as foods, but they are nonetheless present in many household products. Many cleaners
contain ammonia, a base. Sodium hydroxide is found in drain cleaner. Antacids, which combat excess stomach
acid, are comprised of bases such as magnesium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate.

Don’t breathe too deeply.
Venus (pictured above) is the planet nearest to us, but has a very different and hostile environment. It has a surface
temperature that averages around 450°C. The atmosphere is composed of carbon dioxide, but clouds of sulfuric
acid move through the upper atmosphere, helping to create the extremely unfriendly conditions. Because of these
conditions, Venus is not a place you want to visit on vacation.

Arrhenius Acids

Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was the ﬁrst to propose a theory to explain the observed behavior
of acids and bases. Because of their ability to conduct a current, he knew that both acids and bases contained ions in
solution. An Arrhenius acid is a compound, which ionizes to yield hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution.
Acids are molecular compounds with ionizable hydrogen atoms. Only hydrogen atoms that are part of a highly polar
covalent bond are ionizable. Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a gas at room temperature and under normal pressure. The
H-Cl bond in hydrogen chloride is a polar bond. The hydrogen atom is electron deﬁcient because of the higher
electronegativity of the chlorine atom. Consequently, the hydrogen atom is attracted to the lone pair of electrons in a
water molecule when HCl is dissolved in water. The result is that the H-Cl bond breaks, with both bonding electrons
remaining with the Cl, forming a chloride ion. The H+ ion attaches to the water molecule, forming a polyatomic
ion called the hydronium ion. The hydronium ion (H3O+) can be thought of as a water molecule with an attached
hydrogen ion.

FIGURE 21.2
Formation of a hydronium ion.

Equations showing the ionization of an acid in water are frequently simpliﬁed by omitting the water molecule:

HCl(g) → H+(aq) + Cl−

This is merely a simpliﬁcation of the previous equation, but it is commonly used. Any hydrogen ions in an aqueous
solution will be attached to water molecules as hydronium ions.
Not all hydrogen atoms in molecular compounds are ionizable. In methane (CH4), the hydrogen atoms are covalently
bonded to carbon in bonds that are only slightly polar. The hydrogen atoms are not capable of ionizing and methane
has no acidic properties. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) belongs to a class of acids called organic acids. There are four
hydrogen atoms in the molecule, but only the one hydrogen that is bonded to an oxygen atom is ionizable.

FIGURE 21.3
The O-H bond can be ionized to yield the H+ ion and the acetate ion. The
other hydrogen atoms in this molecule are not acidic.

A monoprotic acid is an acid that contains only one ionizable hydrogen. Hydrochloric acid and acetic acid are
monoprotic acids. A polyprotic acid is an acid that contains multiple ionizable hydrogens. Most common polyprotic
acids are either diprotic (such as H2SO4) or triprotic (such as H3PO4).

What can this be used for?
Sodium hydroxide is a versatile chemical. It can be used for such mundane purposes as cleaning clogged drains.
Several commercial preparations contain sodium hydroxide for this purpose. It also has a number of applications in
the food processing ﬁeld. Ice cream is thickened using NaOH. If olives are soaked in a solution containing sodium
hydroxide and other chemicals, the olives will turn black. Soft pretzels are made chewy by the application of sodium
hydroxide to the food. This compound has been widely used in the synthesis of plastics, for etching aluminum, for
paint removal, and is employed in the dehorning of cattle (in case that is a need you have).

Arrhenius Bases
An Arrhenius base is a compound, which ionizes to yield hydroxide ions (OH−) in aqueous solution. The Table
21.2 lists several of the more common bases:

Sodium hydroxide is a very caustic substance also known as lye. Lye is used as a rigorous cleaner and is an ingredient
in the manufacture of soaps. Care must be taken with strong bases like sodium hydroxide, as exposure can lead to
severe burns (see Figure 21.4).

FIGURE 21.4
This foot has severe burns due to prolonged contact with a solution of
sodium hydroxide, also known as lye.

Sodium belongs to the group of elements called the alkali metals. An alkaline solution is another name for a
solution that is basic. All alkali metals react readily with water to produce the metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas.
The resulting solutions are basic.
2K(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H2(g)
Bases that consist of an alkali metal cation and the hydroxide anion are all very soluble in water. Compounds of the
Group 2 metals (the alkaline earth metals) are also basic. However, these compounds are generally not as soluble in
water. Therefore the dissociation reactions for these compounds are shown as equilibrium reactions.

These relatively insoluble hydroxides were some of the compounds discussed in the context of the solubility product
constant (Ksp). The solubility of magnesium hydroxide is 0.0084 g per liter of water at 25°C. Because of its low
solubility, magnesium hydroxide is not as dangerous as sodium hydroxide. In fact, magnesium hydroxide is the
active ingredient in a product called milk of magnesia, which is used as an antacid or a mild laxative.

A new theory
The Arrhenius concept of acids and bases was a signiﬁcant contribution to our understanding of acids and bases. It
replaced and expanded the original idea of Lavoisier that all acids contained oxygen. However, the Arrhenius theory
had its shortcomings also. It did not take into account the role of the solvent. In addition, this concept did not deal
with acid-base behavior in solvents such as benzene where there could be no ionization. So, a new theory needed to
be formed, which built on the ﬁndings of Arrhenius but also went beyond them.

Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases

The Arrhenius deﬁnition of acids and bases is somewhat limited. There are some compounds whose properties
suggest that they are either acidic or basic, but which do not qualify according to the Arrhenius deﬁnition. An
example is ammonia (NH3). Its aqueous solution turns litmus blue, it reacts with acids, and displays all the other
properties of a base. However, it does not contain the hydroxide ion. In 1923, a broader deﬁnition of acids and
bases was independently proposed by Danish chemist Johannes Brønsted (1879-1947) and English chemist Thomas
Lowry (1874-1936). A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a molecule or ion that donates a hydrogen ion in a reaction. A
Brønsted-Lowry base is a molecule or ion that accepts a hydrogen ion in a reaction. A hydrogen ion is commonly
referred to as a proton, and so acids and bases are proton donors and proton acceptors respectively according to the
Brønsted-Lowry deﬁnition. All substances that are categorized as acids and bases under the Arrhenius deﬁnition are
also deﬁned as such under the Brønsted-Lowry deﬁnition. The new deﬁnition, however, includes some substances
that are left out according to the Arrhenius deﬁnition.

951

21.5. Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases

www.ck12.org

What kind of molecule would qualify as a Brønsted-Lowry base? These molecules need to be able to accept a
hydrogen ion (or proton). Two possibilities come to mind: an anion that can form a neural compound with a proton,
or a molecule in which one or more atoms has lone-pair electrons. The most obvious anion is the Arrhenius base
OH−. This ion can form a water molecule with a proton by accepting the proton. The acetate anion CH3COO−
is another anion that can combine with a proton to form acetic acid. Lone-pair electron groups would include the
nitrogen atom (see Figure 21.5). The two electrons at the top of the nitrogen atom are not connected in any type of
bond, but they do interact readily with a bare proton.

FIGURE 21.5
Lone pair electrons on nitrogen.

Oxygen is another atom with lone pair electrons that can function as Brønsted-Lowry bases.

FIGURE 21.6
Electrons in an oxygen atom.

The two single electrons (to the left and bottom of the atom) can form single covalent bonds with other atoms while
the two pairs of double electrons (top and right) are available to interact with a hydrogen ion.

The Roman god Janus was considered the god of gates and doors, beginnings and endings. He is portrayed with two
faces, looking in two directions at once. Janus would have been in a good position to look at the acid-base reactions
we see in this concept, since they are equilibrium reactions involving two different forms of both acids and bases.

Brønsted-Lowry Acid-Base Reactions

An acid-base reaction according to the Brønsted-Lowry deﬁnition is a transfer of a proton from one molecule or ion
to another. When ammonia is dissolved in water, it undergoes the following reversible reaction.

4 (aq) + OH−(aq)
NH3(aq) + H2O(l) (cid:29) NH+
base
acid
base

acid

In this reaction, the water molecule is donating a proton to the ammonia molecule. The resulting products are the
ammonium ion and the hydroxide ion. The water is acting as a Brønsted-Lowry acid, while the ammonia is acting
as a Brønsted-Lowry base. The hydroxide ion that is produced causes the solution to be basic.
We can also consider the reverse reaction in the above equation. In that reaction, the ammonium ion donates a proton
to the hydroxide ion. The ammonium ion is a Brønsted-Lowry acid, while the hydroxide ion is a Brønsted-Lowry
base. Most Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reactions can be analyzed in this way. There is one acid and one base as
reactants, and one acid and one base as products.

954

In the above reaction, water acted as an acid, which may seem a bit unexpected. Water can also act as a base in a
Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reaction, as long as it reacts with a substance that is a better proton donor. Shown below

The big picture gets bigger
Ideas in science never stay static. One discovery builds on another. Our concepts of acids and bases have grown
from the fundamental ideas of Arrhenius to Brønsted-Lowry to Lewis. Each step adds to our understanding of the
world around us and makes the “big picture” even bigger.

Lewis Acids and Bases

Gilbert Lewis (1875-1946) proposed a third theory of acids and bases that is even more general than either the
Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry theories. A Lewis acid is a substance that accepts a pair of electrons to form a covalent
bond. A Lewis base is a substance that donates a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond. So, a Lewis acid-base
reaction is represented by the transfer of a pair of electrons from a base to an acid. A hydrogen ion, which lacks any
electrons, accepts a pair of electrons. It is an acid under both the Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis deﬁnitions. Ammonia
consists of a nitrogen atom as the central atom with a lone pair of electrons. The reaction between ammonia and the
hydrogen ion can be depicted as shown in the Figure 21.8.
The lone pair on the nitrogen atom is transferred to the hydrogen ion, making the NH3 a Lewis base while the H+ is
a Lewis acid.
Some reactions that do not qualify as acid-base reactions under the other deﬁnitions do so under only the Lewis
deﬁnition. An example is the reaction of ammonia with boron triﬂuoride.
Boron triﬂuoride is the Lewis acid, while ammonia is again the Lewis base. As there is no hydrogen ion involved in
this reaction, it qualiﬁes as an acid-base reaction only under the Lewis deﬁnition. The Table 21.3 summarizes the
three acid-base theories.

• Deﬁne acidic solution.
• Deﬁne basic solution.
• Use the constant to calculate [H+] or [OH−] when the other is known.

What’s inside?
At one time, you could take the little caps off the top of a car battery and check the condition of the sulfuric acid
inside. If it got low, you could add more acid. But, sulfuric acid is hazardous stuff, so the batteries are now sealed to
protect people. Beacuse of the acid’s dangerous nature, it is not a good idea to cut into a battery to see what it looks
like –you could get acid burns.

The Ion-Product of Water

The self-ionization of water (the process in which water ionizes to hydronium ions and hydroxide ions) occurs to
a very limited extent. When two molecules of water collide, there can be a transfer of a hydrogen ion from one
molecule to the other. The products are a positively charged hydronium ion and a negatively charged hydroxide ion.

H2O(l) + H2O(l) (cid:29) H3O+(aq) + OH−(aq)

We often use the simpliﬁed form of the reaction:

H2O(l) (cid:29) H+(aq) + OH−(aq)

959

21.8. Ion-Product of Water

www.ck12.org

The equilibrium constant for the self-ionization of water is referred to as the ion-product for water and is given the
symbol Kw.

Kw = [H+][OH−]

The ion-product of water (Kw) is the mathematical product of the concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxide
ions. Note that H2O is not included in the ion-product expression because it is a pure liquid. The value of Kw is very
small, in accordance with a reaction that favors the reactants. At 25°C, the experimentally determined value of Kw
in pure water is 1.0 × 10−14.

Kw = [H+][OH−] = 1.0× 10−14

In pure water, the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide ions are equal to one another. Pure water or any other
aqueous solution in which this ratio holds is said to be neutral. To ﬁnd the molarity of each ion, the square root of Kw
is taken.

[H+] = [OH−] = 1.0× 10−7 M

An acidic solution is a solution in which the concentration of hydrogen ions is greater than the concentration of
hydroxide ions. For example, hydrogen chloride ionizes to produce H+ and Cl− ions upon dissolving in water.

HCl(g) → H+(aq) + Cl−(aq)

This increases the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. According to LeChâtelier’s principle, the equilibrium
represented by H2O(l) (cid:29) H+(aq)+OH−(aq) is forced to the left, towards the reactant. As a result, the concentration
of the hydroxide ion decreases.
A basic solution is a solution in which the concentration of hydroxide ions is greater than the concentration of
hydrogen ions. Solid potassium hydroxide dissociates in water to yield potassium ions and hydroxide ions.

KOH(s) → K+(aq) + OH−(aq)

The increase in concentration of the OH− ions causes a decrease in the concentration of the H+ ions and the ion-
product of [H+][OH−] remains constant

Sample Problem: Use of
Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, meaning it is 100% ionized in solution. What is the [H+] and the [OH−]
in a solution of 2.0 × 103 M HCl?
Step 1: List the known values and plan the problem.
Known

• [HCl] = 2.0 × 10−3 M
• Kw = 1.0× 10−14

960

www.ck12.org

Unknown

• [H+] = ? M
• [OH−] = ? M

Chapter 21. Acids and Bases

Because HCl is 100% ionized, the concentration of H+ ions in solution will be equal to the original concentration of
HCl. Each HCl molecule that was originally present ionizes into one H+ ion and one Cl− ion. The concentration of
OH− can then be determined from the [H+] and Kw.
Step 2: Solve.

(cid:2)H+(cid:3) = 2.0× 10−3 M
Kw =(cid:2)H+(cid:3)(cid:2)OH−(cid:3) = 1.0× 10−14

Kw
[H+]

1.0× 10−14
2.0× 10−3 = 5.0× 10−12 M

Step 3: Think about your result.
The [H+] is much higher than the [OH−] because the solution is acidic. As with other equilibrium constants, the
unit for Kw is customarily omitted.

• The self-ionization of water is described and an ionization constant for the process is stated.

21.9 The pH Scale

• Deﬁne pH.
• List pH values of common materials.

Why is grapefruit juice acidic?
Grapefruit juice has a pH of somewhere between 2.9-3.3, depending on the speciﬁc product. Excessive exposure to
this juice can cause erosion of tooth enamel and can lead to tooth damage. The acids in grapefruit juice are carbon-
based, with citric acid being one of the major constituents. This compound has three ionizable hydrogens on each
molecule which contribute to the relatively low pH of the juice. Another component of grape juice is malic acid,
containing two ionizable hydrogens per molecule.

The pH Scale

Expressing the acidity of a solution by using the molarity of the hydrogen ion is cumbersome because the quantities
are generally very small. Danish scientist Søren Sørenson (1868-1939) proposed an easier system for indicating
the concentration of H+ called the pH scale. The letters pH stand for the power of the hydrogen ion. The pH of a
solution is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen-ion concentration.
pH = -log[H+]
In pure water or a neutral solution the [H+] = 1.0 × 10−7 M. Substituting into the pH expression:
pH = -log[1.0 × 10−7] = -(-7.00) = 7.00
The pH of pure water or any neutral solution is thus 7.00. For recording purposes, the numbers to the right of the
decimal point in the pH value are the signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Since 1.0 × 10−7 has two signiﬁcant ﬁgures, the pH can be
reported as 7.00.

962

www.ck12.org

Chapter 21. Acids and Bases

A logarithmic scale condenses the range of acidity to numbers that are easy to use. Consider a solution with
[H+] = 1.0 × 10−4 M. That is a hydrogen-ion concentration that is 1000 times higher than the concentration in
pure water. The pH of such a solution is 4.00, a difference of just 3 pH units. Notice that when the [H+] is written in
scientiﬁc notation and the coefﬁcient is 1, the pH is simply the exponent with the sign changed. The pH of a solution
with the [H+] = 1 × 10−2 M is 2 and the pH of a solution with the [H+] = 1 × 10−10 M is 10.
As we saw earlier, a solution with the [H+] higher than 1.0 × 10−7 is acidic, while a solution with the [H+] lower
than 1.0 × 10−7 is basic. Consequently, solutions whose pH is less than 7 are acidic, while those with a pH higher
than 7 are basic. The Figure 21.10 illustrates this relationship, along with some examples of various solutions.

Raising tropical ﬁsh
Many people enjoy having tropical ﬁsh in their homes or businesses. These brightly-colored creatures are relaxing to
watch, but do require a certain amount of maintenance in order for them to survive. Tap water is usually too alkaline
when it comes out of the faucet, so some adjustments need to be made. The pH of the water will change over time
while it is in the tank, which means you need to test it every so often. Then you get to be a chemist for your ﬁsh.

Calculating pH of Acids and Bases
Calculation of pH is simple when there is a 1 × 10power problem. However, in real life that is rarely the situation.
If the coefﬁcient is not equal to 1, a calculator must be used to ﬁnd the pH. For example, the pH of a solution with
[H+] = 2.3 × 10−5 M can be found as shown below.
pH = -log[2.3 × 10−5] = 4.64
When the pH of a solution is known, the concentration of the hydrogen ion can be calculated. The inverse of the
logarithm (or antilog) is the 10x key on a calculator.
[H+] = 10−pH
For example, suppose that you have a solution with a pH of 9.14. To ﬁnd the [H+] use the 10x key.
[H+] = 10−pH = 10−9.14 = 7.24 × 10−10 M

Hydroxide Ion Concentration and pH

As we saw earlier, the hydroxide ion concentration of any aqueous solution is related to the hydrogen ion concentra-
tion through the value of Kw. We can use that relationship to calculate the pH of a solution of a base.

Sample Problem: The pH of a Base

Sodium hydroxide is a strong base. Find the pH of a solution prepared by dissolving 1.0 g of NaOH into enough
water to make 1.0 L of solution.
Step 1: List the known values and plan the problem.
Known

• mass NaOH = 1.0 g
• molar mass NaOH = 40.00 g/mol
• volume solution = 1.0 L
• Kw = 1.0× 10−14

Unknown

• pH of solution = ?

First, convert the mass of NaOH to moles. Second, calculate the molarity of the NaOH solution. Because NaOH is
a strong base and is soluble, the [OH−] will be equal to the concentration of the NaOH. Third, use Kw to calculate
the [H+] in the solution. Lastly, calculate the pH.
Step 2: Solve.

= 4.0× 10−13 M

Molarity =

1.00 L

(cid:2)OH−(cid:3) =

Kw

Step 3: Think about your result.
The solution is basic and so its pH is greater than 7. The reported pH is rounded to two decimal places because the
original mass and volume has two signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

21.11 The pOH Concept

• Deﬁne pOH.
• Perform calculations of pOH.

Can water have healing properties?

Soap Lake has a long history as a healing place. Indian tribes would put aside their rivalries when they came to the
lake to enjoy the high mineral content of the water. In the days before good antibiotics, thousands of visitors would
come and enjoy the soothing waters of the lake. Soap Lake is alkaline, with water quality thought to be similar to
that of the moons of the planet Jupiter.

The pOH Concept

As with the hydrogen-ion concentration, the concentration of the hydroxide ion can be expressed logarithmically by
the pOH. The pOH of a solution is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide-ion concentration.
pOH = -log[OH−]
The pH of a solution can be related to the pOH. Consider a solution with a pH = 4.0. The [H+] of the solution would
be 1.0 × 10−4 M. Dividing Kw by this yields a [OH−] of 1.0 × 10−10 M. Finally the pOH of the solution equals
-log(1.0 × 10−10) = 10. This example illustrates the following relationship.
pH + pOH = 14
The pOH scale is similar to the pH scale in that a pOH of 7 is indicative of a neutral solution. A basic solution has a
pOH of less than 7, while an acidic solution has a pOH of greater than 7. The pOH is convenient to use when ﬁnding
the hydroxide ion concentration from a solution with a known pH.

Sample Problem: Using pOH

Find the hydroxide concentration of a solution with a pH of 4.42.
Step 1: List the known values and plan the problem.
Known

• pH = 4.42
• pH + pOH = 14

Unknown [OH-] = ? M
First, the pOH is calculated, followed by the [OH−].
Step 2: Solve.

pOH = 14− pH = 14− 4.42 = 9.58

(cid:2)OH−(cid:3) = 10−pOH = 10−9.58 = 2.6× 10−10 M

Step 3: Think about your result.
The pH is that of an acidic solution, and the resulting hydroxide-ion concentration is less than 1 × 10−7 M. The
answer has two signiﬁcant ﬁgures because the given pH has two decimal places.
The diagram below shows all of the interrelationships between [H+], [OH−], pH, and pOH.

How do they etch glass?
Etching of glass is a slow process that can produce beautiful artwork. Traditionally, the glass has been treated with
dilute hydroﬂuoric acid which gradually dissolves the glass under it. Parts of the piece that should not be etched
are covered with wax or some other non-reactive material. In more recent times, compounds such as ammonium
biﬂuoride have been used. Whichever chemical is employed, the artist must be very careful not to get any on their
skin.

Strong and Weak Acids and Acid Ionization Constant

Acids are classiﬁed as either strong or weak, based on their ionization in water. A strong acid is an acid which
is completely ionized in an aqueous solution. Hydrogen chloride (HCl) ionizes completely into hydrogen ions and
chloride ions in water.

HCl(g) → H+(aq) + Cl−(aq)

971

21.12. Strong and Weak Acids and Acid Ionization Constant (Ka)

www.ck12.org

A weak acid is an acid that ionizes only slightly in an aqueous solution. Acetic acid (found in vinegar) is a very
common weak acid. Its ionization is shown below.

CH3COOH(aq) (cid:29) H+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq)

The ionization of acetic acid is incomplete, and so the equation is shown with a double arrow. The extent of ionization
of weak acids varies, but is generally less than 10%. A 0.10 M solution of acetic acid is only about 1.3% ionized,
meaning that the equilibrium strongly favors the reactants.
Weak acids, like strong acids, ionize to yield the H+ ion and a conjugate base. Because HCl is a strong acid, its
conjugate base (Cl−) is extremely weak. The chloride ion is incapable of accepting the H+ ion and becoming HCl
again. In general, the stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base. Likewise, the weaker the acid, the stronger its
conjugate base.

Strong acids are 100% ionized in solution. Weak acids are only slightly ionized. Phosphoric acid is stronger than
acetic acid and so is ionized to a greater extent. Acetic acid is stronger than carbonic acid, and so on.

The Acid Ionization Constant,

The ionization for a general weak acid, HA, can be written as follows:

HA(aq) → H+(aq) + A−(aq)

Because the acid is weak, an equilibrium expression can be written. An acid ionization constant (Ka) is the
equilibrium constant for the ionization of an acid.

Ka =

[H+][A−]

[HA]

The acid ionization represents the fraction of the original acid that has been ionized in solution. Therefore, the
numerical value of Ka is a reﬂection of the strength of the acid. Weak acids with relatively higher Ka values
are stronger than acids with relatively lower Ka values. Because strong acids are essentially 100% ionized, the
concentration of the acid in the denominator is nearly zero and the Ka value approaches inﬁnity. For this reason, Ka
values are generally reported for weak acids only.

Ammonia for what?
All the complex electronics and apparatus in a space shuttle generate heat, as do the astronauts. The shuttles have a
complex arrangement of systems to dissipate that heat into outer space. One of the components of this system is a
series of coils ﬁlled with ammonia that are located on the outside of the shuttle. Ammonia absorbs the heat and then
releases it into space as the gas circulates through the coils. This approach is both inexpensive and effective.

Strong and Weak Bases and Base Ionization Constant,

As with acids, bases can either be strong or weak, depending on their extent of ionization. A strong base is a
base, which ionizes completely in an aqueous solution. The most common strong bases are soluble metal hydroxide
compounds such as potassium hydroxide. Some metal hydroxides are not as strong simply because they are not as
soluble. Calcium hydroxide is only slightly soluble in water, but the portion that does dissolve also dissociates into
ions.
A weak base is a base that ionizes only slightly in an aqueous solution. Recall that a base can be deﬁned as a
substance, which accepts a hydrogen ion from another substance. When a weak base such as ammonia is dissolved in
water, it accepts an H+ ion from water, forming the hydroxide ion and the conjugate acid of the base, the ammonium
ion.

Chapter 21. Acids and Bases

The equilibrium greatly favors the reactants and the extent of ionization of the ammonia molecule is very small.
An equilibrium expression can be written for the reactions of weak bases with water. Because the concentration
of water is extremely large and virtually constant, the water is not included in the expression. A base ionization
constant (Kb) is the equilibrium constant for the ionization of a base. For ammonia the expression is:

Kb =

[NH+

4 ][OH−]
[NH3]

The numerical value of Kb is a reﬂection of the strength of the base. Weak bases with relatively higher Kb values

Who invented the pH meter?
The pH meter was invented because Florida orange growers needed a way to test the acidity of their fruit. The ﬁrst
meter was invented by Arnold Beckman, who went on to form Beckman Instruments. Beckman’s business was very
successful and he used much of his fortune to fund science education and research. The Beckman family donated
$40 million to build the Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois, shown above.

Calculating

The numerical value of Ka or Kb can be determined from an experiment. A solution of known concentration is
prepared and its pH is measured with an instrument called a pH meter.

Sample Problem: Calculation of an Acid Ionization Constant

A 0.500 M solution of formic acid is prepared and its pH is measured to be 2.04. Determine the Ka for formic acid.
Step 1: List the known values and plan the problem.
Known

• initial [HCOOH] = 0.500 M
• pH = 2.04

FIGURE 21.12

ments of the pH of solutions.

Unknown

• Ka = ?

First, the pH is used to calculate the [H+] at equilibrium. An ICE table is set up in order to determine the
concentrations of HCOOH and HCOO− at equilibrium. All concentrations are then substituted into the Ka expression
and the Ka value is calculated.
Step 2: Solve.

[H+] = 10−pH = 10−2.04 = 9.12× 10−3 M

Since each formic acid molecule that ionizes yields one H+ ion and one formate ion (HCOO−), the concentrations
of H+ and HCOO− are equal at equilibrium. We assume that the initial concentrations of each ion are zero, resulting
in the following ICE table.

Now substituting into the Ka expression gives:

=

(9.12× 10−3)(9.12× 10−3)

0.491

= 1.7× 10−4

Step 3: Think about your result.
The value of Ka is consistent with that of a weak acid. Two signiﬁcant ﬁgures are appropriate for the answer, since
there are two digits after the decimal point in the reported pH.
Similar steps can be taken to determine the Kb of a base. For example, a 0.750 M solution of the weak base
ethylamine (C2H5NH2) has a pH of 12.31.

C2H5NH2 + H2O (cid:29) C2H5NH+

978
Since one of the products of the ionization reaction is the hydroxide ion, we need to ﬁrst ﬁnd the [OH−] at

Ouch, that hurts!
Bees are beautiful creatures that help plants ﬂourish. They carry pollen from one plant to another to facilitate plant
growth and development. But, they can also be troublesome when they sting you. For people who are allergic to bee
venom, this can be a serious, life-threatening problem. For the rest of us, it can be a painful experience. When stung
by a bee, one ﬁrst-aid treatment is to apply a paste of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) to the stung area. This weak
base helps with the itching and swelling that accompanies the bee sting.

Calculating pH of Weak Acid and Base Solutions

The Ka and Kb values have been determined for a great many acids and bases, as shown in Tables 21.5 and 21.6.
These can be used to calculate the pH of any solution of a weak acid or base whose ionization constant is known.

Sample Problem: Calculating the pH of a Weak Acid
Calculate the pH of a 2.00 M solution of nitrous acid (HNO2). The Ka for nitrous acid is 4.5 × 10−4.

The quadratic equation is required to solve this equation for x. However, a simpliﬁcation can be made because of

"−x” in the denominator can be dropped.

Since the variable x represents the hydrogen-ion concentration, the pH of the solution can now be calculated.

pH = −log[H+] = −log[2.9× 10−2] = 1.54

Step 3: Think about your result.
The pH of a 2.00 M solution of a strong acid would be equal to −log(2.00) = −0.30. The higher pH of the 2.00 M
nitrous acid is consistent with it being a weak acid and therefore not as acidic as a strong acid would be.
The procedure for calculating the pH of a solution of a weak base is similar to that of the weak acid in the sample
problem. However, the variable x will represent the concentration of the hydroxide ion. The pH is found by taking
the negative logarithm to get the pOH, followed by subtracting from 14 to get the pH.

21.16 Neutralization Reaction and Net Ionic

Equations for Neutralization Reactions

• Deﬁne neutralizations reaction.
• Write balanced equations for neutralization reactions.
• Write net ionic equations for neutralization reactions.

Who cleans up afterwards?
Pouring concrete and working it are messy jobs. In the process, a lot of wastewater with an alkaline pH is generated.
Often, regulations require that this wastewater be cleaned up at the site. One practical way to neutralize the basic pH
is to bubble CO2 into the water. The carbon dioxide forms a weak acid (carbonic acid, H2CO3) in solution which
serves to bring the alkaline pH down to something closer to neutral.

Neutralization Reactions and Net Ionic Equations for Neutralization Reactions

A neutralization reaction is a reaction in which an acid and a base react in an aqueous solution to produce a salt
and water. The aqueous sodium chloride that is produced in the reaction is called a salt. A salt is an ionic compound
composed of a cation from a base and an anion from an acid. A salt is essentially any ionic compound that is neither
an acid nor a base.

Strong Acid-Strong Base Reactions

When equal amounts of a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid are mixed with a strong base such as sodium
hydroxide, the result is a neutral solution. The products of the reaction do not have the characteristics of either an
acid or a base. Here is the balanced molecular equation.

HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)

Chemical reactions occurring in aqueous solution are more accurately represented with a net ionic equation. The
full ionic equation for the neutralization of hydrochloric acid by sodium hydroxide is written as follows:

H+(aq) + Cl−(aq) + Na+(aq) + OH−(aq) → Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq) + H2O(l)

Since the acid and base are both strong, they are fully ionized and so are written as ions, as is the NaCl formed as
a product. The sodium and chloride ions are spectator ions in the reaction, leaving the following as the net ionic
reaction.

983

21.16. Neutralization Reaction and Net Ionic Equations for Neutralization Reactions

www.ck12.org

H+(aq) + OH−(aq) → H2O(l)

All neutralization reactions of a strong acid with a strong base simplify to the net ionic reaction of hydrogen ion
combining with hydroxide ion to produce water.
What if the acid is a diprotic acid such as sulfuric acid? The balanced molecular equation now involves a 1:2 ratio
between acid and base.

H2SO4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) → Na2SO4(aq) + 2H2O(l)

In order for the reaction to be a full neutralization, twice as many moles of NaOH must react with the H2SO4. The
sodium sulfate salt is soluble, and so the net ionic reaction is again the same. Different mole ratios occur for other
polyprotic acids or bases with multiple hydroxides such as Ca(OH)2.

Reactions Involving a Weak Acid or Weak Base

Reactions where at least one of the components is weak do not generally result in a neutral solution. The reaction
between weak nitrous acid and strong potassium hydroxide is shown below.

HNO2(aq) + KOH(aq) → KNO2(aq) + H2O(l)

In order to write the net ionic equation, the weak acid must be written as a molecule since it does not ionize to a
great extent in water. The base and the salt are fully dissociated.

HNO2(aq) + K+(aq) + OH−(aq) → K+(aq) + NO−

2 (aq) + H2O(l)

The only spectator ion is the potassium ion, resulting in the net ionic equation:

HNO2(aq) + OH−(aq) → NO−

2 (aq) + H2O(l)

The strong hydroxide ion essentially “forces” the weak nitrous acid to become ionized. The hydrogen ion from
the acid combines with the hydroxide ion to form water, leaving the nitrite ion as the other product. The resulting
solution is not neutral (pH = 7), but instead is slightly basic.
Reactions can also involve a weak base and strong acid, resulting in a solution that is slightly acidic. The molecular
and net ionic equations for the reaction of hydrochloric acid and ammonia are shown below.

HCl(aq) + NH3(aq) → NH4Cl(aq)
H+(aq) + NH3(aq) → NH+

4 (aq)

(Cl− is spectator ion)

Reactions between acids and bases that are both weak may result in solutions that are neutral, acidic, or basic.

Didn’t that used to be French fries?
A lot of research is going on these days involving the development of biodiesel fuels. Often this material can be
made from used vegetable oils. The vegetable oil is treated with lye to create the biofuel. In the oils is a variable
amount of acid that needs to be determined so the workers will know how much lye to add to make the ﬁnal fuel.
Before the lye is added, the native vegetable oil is titrated to ﬁnd out how much free acid is present. Then the amount
of lye added can be adjusted to take into account the amount needed to neutralize these free acids.

Titration Experiment

In the neutralization of hydrochloric acid by sodium hydroxide, the mole ratio of acid to base is 1:1.

HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)

One mole of HCl would be fully neutralized by one mole of NaOH. If instead the hydrochloric acid was reacted with
barium hydroxide, the mole ratio would be 2:1.

2HCl(aq) + Ba(OH)2(aq) → BaCl2(aq) + 2H2O(l)

Now two moles of HCl would be required to neutralize one mole of Ba(OH)2. The mole ratio insures that the number
of moles of H+ ions supplied by the acid is equal to the number of OH− ions supplied by the base. This must be the

case for neutralization to occur. The equivalence point is the point in a neutralization reaction where the number of
moles of hydrogen ions is equal to the number of moles of hydroxide ions.
In the laboratory, it is useful to have an experiment where the unknown concentration of an acid or a base can
be determined. This can be accomplished by performing a controlled neutralization reaction. A titration is an
experiment where a volume of a solution of known concentration is added to a volume of another solution in order
to determine its concentration. Many titrations are acid-base neutralization reactions, though other types of titrations
can also be performed.
In order to perform an acid-base titration, the chemist must have a way to visually detect that the neutralization
reaction has occurred. An indicator is a substance that has a distinctly different color when in an acidic or basic
solution. A commonly used indicator for strong acid-strong base titrations is phenolphthalein. Solutions in which a
few drops of phenolphthalein have been added turn from colorless to brilliant pink as the solution turns from acidic
to basic. The steps in a titration reaction are outlined below.

1. A measured volume of an acid of unknown concentration is added to an Erlenmeyer ﬂask.
2. Several drops of an indicator are added to the acid and mixed by swirling the ﬂask.
3. A buret is ﬁlled with the base solution of known molarity.
4. The stopcock of the buret is opened and base is slowly added to the acid while the ﬂask is constantly swirled

to insure mixing. The stopcock is closed at the exact point at which the indicator just changes color.

The standard solution is the solution in a titration whose concentration is known. In the titration described above
the base solution is the standard solution. It is very important in a titration to add the solution from the buret slowly
so that the point at which the indicator changes color can be found accurately. The end point of a titration is the
point at which the indicator changes color. When phenolphthalein is the indicator, the end point will be signiﬁed by
a faint pink color.

How is soap made?
The manufacture of soap requires a number of chemistry techniques. One necessary piece of information is the
saponiﬁcation number. This is the amount of base needed to hydrolyze a certain amount of fat to produce the free
fatty acids that are an essential part of the ﬁnal product. The fat is heated with a known amount of base (usually
NaOH or KOH). After hydrolysis is complete, the left-over base is titrated to determine how much was needed to
hydrolyze the fat sample.

Titration Calculations

At the equivalence point in a neutralization, the moles of acid are equal to the moles of base.

moles acid = moles base

Recall that the molarity (M) of a solution is deﬁned as the moles of the solute divided by the liters of solution (L).
So the moles of solute are therefore equal to the molarity of a solution multiplied by the volume in liters.

We can then set the moles of acid equal to the moles of base.

moles solute = M × L

989

21.18. Titration Calculations

www.ck12.org

MA ×VA = MB ×VB

MA is the molarity of the acid, while MB is the molarity of the base. VA and VB are the volumes of the acid and base,
respectively.
Suppose that a titration is performed and 20.70 mL of 0.500 M NaOH is required to reach the end point when titrated
against 15.00 mL of HCl of unknown concentration. The above equation can be used to solve for the molarity of the
acid.

MB ×VB

VA

=

0.500 M× 20.70 mL

15.00 mL

= 0.690 M

The higher molarity of the acid compared to the base in this case means that a smaller volume of the acid is required
to reach the equivalence point.
The above equation works only for neutralizations in which there is a 1:1 ratio between the acid and the base. The
sample problem below demonstrates the technique to solve a titration problem for a titration of sulfuric acid with
sodium hydroxide.

Sample Problem: Titration

In a titration of sulfuric acid against sodium hydroxide, 32.20 mL of 0.250 M NaOH is required to neutralize 26.60
mL of H2SO4. Calculate the molarity of the sulfuric acid.
Step 1: List the known values and plan the problem.

• molarity NaOH = 0.250 M
• volume NaOH = 32.20 mL
• volume H2SO4 = 26.60 mL

Unkonwn

• molarity H2SO4 = ?

equation

H2SO4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) → Na2SO4(aq) + 2H2O(l)

First determine the moles of NaOH in the reaction. From the mole ratio, calculate the moles of H2SO4 that reacted.
Finally, divide the moles H2SO4 by its volume to get the molarity.
Step 2: Solve.

mol NaOH = M × L = 0.250 M× 0.03220 L = 8.05× 10−3 mol NaOH
8.05× 10−3 mol NaOH× 1 mol H2SO4
2 mol NaOH
4.03× 10−3 mol H2SO4

= 4.03× 10−3 mol H2SO4

0.02660 L

= 0.151 M H2SO4

Step 3: Think about your result.
The volume of H2SO4 required is smaller than the volume of NaOH because of the two hydrogen ions contributed
by each molecule.

21.19 Titration Curves

• Describe titration curves of acid-base neutralization reactions.

Where did graphs come from?
The x−y plot that we know of as a graph was the brainchild of the French mathematician-philosopher Rene Descartes
(1596-1650). His studies in mathematics led him to develop what was known as “Cartesian geometry”, including
the idea of our current graphs. The coordinates are often referred to as Cartesian coordinates.

Titration Curves

As base is added to acid at the beginning of a titration, the pH rises very slowly. Nearer to the equivalence point, the
pH begins to rapidly increase. If the titration is a strong acid with a strong base, the pH at the equivalence point is
equal to 7. A bit past the equivalence point, the rate of change of the pH again slows down. A titration curve is a
graphical representation of the pH of a solution during a titration. The Figure below shows two different examples
of a strong acid-strong base titration curve. On the left is a titration in which the base is added to the acid and so the
pH progresses from low to high. On the right is a titration in which the acid is added to the base. In this case, the pH
starts out high and decreases during the titration. In both cases, the equivalence point is reached when the moles of
acid and base are equal and the pH is 7. This also corresponds to the color change of the indicator.
Titration curves can also be generated in the case of a weak acid-strong base titration or a strong base-weak acid
titration. The general shape of the titration curve is the same, but the pH at the equivalence point is different. In a
weak acid-strong base titration, the pH is greater than 7 at the equivalence point. In a strong acid-weak base titration,
the pH is less than 7 at the equivalence point.

Who would write a song about a cabbage?
There’s an old bluegrass song known as “Boil Them Cabbage Down” (check out a great performance at this link:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT9TTlh5jgA ). Many people enjoy the music, but chemistry students also enjoy
the product of the boiled cabbage. Extracting the anthocyanin dye from cabbage leaves with boiling water gives a
solution that is red when acidic, purple when neutral, and green to yellow when basic (pictured above).

Indicators

An acid-base indicator is a substance that displays different colors when in the presence of an acid or a base. How
does that work? An indicator is a weak acid that ionizes within a known pH range, usually about 2 pH units. We
can represent the protonated form of the indicator molecule as HIn and the deprotonated form as In−. The following
equilibrium exists for the indicator.

HIn(aq) (cid:29) H+(aq) + In−(aq)

According to LeChâtelier’s principle, the addition of H+ ions (as in a low pH solution) drives the equilibrium to
the left and the protonated HIn predominates. The addition of OH− (as in a high pH solution) decreases the H+
concentration and drives the equilibrium to the right and the deprotonated In− predominates. To be useful as an

995

21.20. Indicators

indicator, the two forms must be different colors. In the case of phenolphthalein, the protonated form is colorless,
while the deprotonated form is pink. The Figure 21.16 shows a variety of acid-base indicators that can be used in
titration experiments.

FIGURE 21.16
pH indicators.

Depending on the pH at the equivalence point, the appropriate indicator must be chosen. For example, bromphenol
blue has a yellow color below a pH of about 3 and a blue-violet color above a pH of about 4. Bromphenol blue would
not be a good choice as the indicator for a strong acid-strong base titration, because the pH is 7 at the equivalence
point. Instead, it could be used for a strong acid-weak base titration, where the pH at the equivalence point is lower.
Most indicators have two colored forms. Universal indicator displays the entire rainbow of colors from low pH
to high pH (see Figure 21.17). Universal indicator is used to make pH paper, which can be used to quickly test
solutions for their approximate pH.

Baking better biscuits
Baking seems easy with all the pre-mixed items available (“just add water and stir”). But there is a good amount
of chemistry involved in baking with ingredients that you measure out. One important ingredient is baking powder.
The ﬂufﬁness in the ﬁnal product of a non-yeast recipe is usually due to carbon dioxide formed from baking powder.
One popular brand uses a mix of sodium bicarbonate and sodium aluminum sulfate to produce the CO2. The reaction
is seen below:

3NaHCO3 + NaAl(SO4)2 → Al(OH)3 + 2Na2SO4 + 3CO2

If all goes well, the biscuits rise, the pancakes are ﬂuffy, and everybody is happy.

Hydrolysis of Salts: Equations

A salt is an ionic compound that is formed when an acid and a base neutralize each other. While it may seem that
salt solutions would always be neutral, they can frequently be either acidic or basic.

998

www.ck12.org

Chapter 21. Acids and Bases

Consider the salt formed when the weak acid hydroﬂuoric acid is neutralized by the strong base sodium hydroxide.
The molecular and net ionic equations are shown below.

HF(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaF(aq) + H2O(l)
HF(aq) + OH−(aq) → F−(aq) + H2O(l)

Since sodium ﬂuoride is soluble, the sodium ion is a spectator ion in the neutralization reaction. The ﬂuoride ion is
capable of reacting, to a small extent, with water, accepting a proton.

F−(aq) + H2O(l) (cid:29) HF(aq) + OH−(aq)

The ﬂuoride ion is acting as a weak Brønsted-Lowry base. The hydroxide ion that is produced as a result of the
above reaction makes the solution slightly basic. Salt hydrolysis is a reaction in which one of the ions from a salt
reacts with water, forming either an acidic or basic solution.

Salts That Form Basic Solutions

When solid sodium ﬂuoride is dissolved into water, it completely dissociates into sodium ions and ﬂuoride ions. The
sodium ions do not have any capability of hydrolyzing, but the ﬂuoride ions hydrolyze to produce a small amount of
hydroﬂuoric acid and hydroxide ion.

F−(aq) + H2O(l) (cid:29) HF(aq) + OH−(aq)

Salts that are derived from the neutralization of a weak acid (HF) by a strong base (NaOH) will always produce salt
solutions that are basic.

Salts That Form Acidic Solutions

Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is a salt that is formed when the strong acid HCl is neutralized by the weak base NH3.
Ammonium chloride is soluble in water. The chloride ion produced is incapable of hydrolyzing because it is the
conjugate base of the strong acid HCl. In other words, the Cl− ion cannot accept a proton from water to form HCl
and OH−, as the ﬂuoride ion did in the previous section. However, the ammonium ion is capable of reacting slightly
with water, donating a proton and so acting as an acid.

NH+

4 (aq) + H2O(l) (cid:29) H3O+(aq) + NH3(aq)

Salts That Form Neutral Solutions

A salt that is derived from the reaction of a strong acid with a strong base forms a solution that has a pH of 7. An
example is sodium chloride, formed from the neutralization of HCl by NaOH. A solution of NaCl in water has no
acidic or basic properties, since neither ion is capable of hydrolyzing. Other salts that form neutral solutions include
potassium nitrate (KNO3) and lithium bromide (LiBr). The T able 21.10 summarizes how to determine the acidity
or basicity of a salt solution.

21.22 Calculating pH of Salt Solutions

• Perform calculations to determine pH of salt solutions if Ka or Kb are known.

Keeping things safe and healthy
We all enjoy a cool dip in a swimming pool on a hot day, but we may not realize the work needed to keep that water
safe and healthy. The ideal pH for a swimming pool is around 7.2. The pH will change as a result of many factors.
Adjustment can be accomplished with different chemicals depending on the tested pH. High pH can be lowered with
liquid HCl (unsafe material) or sodium bisulfate. The bisulfate anion is a weak acid and can dissociate partially in
solution. To increase pH, use sodium carbonate. The carbonate anion forms an equilibrium with protons that results
in some formation of carbon dioxide.

Calculating pH of Salt Solutions

It is often helpful to be able to predict the effect a salt solution will have on the pH of a certain solution. Knowledge
of the relevant acidity or basicity constants allows us to carry out the necessary calculations.

Sample Problem: Salt Hydrolysis

If we dissolve NaF in water, we get the following equilibrium:

F−(aq) + H2O(l) (cid:29) HF(aq) + OH−(aq)

1001

21.22. Calculating pH of Salt Solutions

The pH of the resulting solution can be determined if the Kb of the ﬂuoride ion is known.
20.0 g of sodium ﬂuoride is dissolve in enough water to make 500.0 mL of solution. Calculate the pH of the solution.
The Kb of the ﬂuoride ion is 1.4 × 10−11.
Step 1: List the known values and plan the problem.
Known

• mass NaF = 20.0 g
• molar mass NaF = 41.99 g/mol
• volume solution = 0.500 L
• Kb of F− = 1.4 × 10−11

Unknown

• pH of solution = ?

The molarity of the F− solution can be calculated from the mass, molar mass, and solution volume. Since NaF
completely dissociates, the molarity of the NaF is equal to the molarity of the F− ion. An ICE Table (21.11) can be
used to calculate the concentration of OH− produced and then the pH of the solution.
Step 2: Solve.

Salts That Form Acidic Solutions

When the ammonium ion dissolves in water, the following equilibrium exists:

NH+

4 (aq) + H2O(l) (cid:29) H3O+(aq) + NH3(aq)

The production of hydronium ions causes the resulting solution to be acidic. The pH of a solution of ammonium
chloride can be found in a very similar way to the sodium ﬂuoride solution in Sample Problem 21.7. However, since
+, which is 5.6 × 10−10. We
the ammonium chloride is acting as an acid, it is necessary to know the Ka of NH4
will ﬁnd the pH of a 2.00 M solution of NH4Cl. Because the NH4Cl completely ionizes, the concentration of the
ammonium ion is 2.00 M.

NH4Cl(s) → NH+

4 (aq) + Cl−(aq)

Again, an ICE Table (21.12) is set up in order to solve for the concentration of the hydronium (or H+) ion produced.

A salt produced from a strong acid and a weak base yields a solution that is acidic.

21.23 Buffers

• Deﬁne buffer.
• Deﬁne buffer capacity.
• Describe how a buffer controls pH.
• List some common buffer systems.

How does insulin work?
Diabetes mellitus is a disorder of glucose metabolism in which insulin production by the pancreas is impaired. Since
insulin helps glucose enter the cells, a decrease of this hormone means that glucose cannot be used in its normal
fashion. When this happens, the body begins to break down fats, producing a decrease in blood pH. Chemical
systems in the body can balance this pH shift for a while, but excessive acid production can create serious problems
if not corrected by administering insulin to restore normal glucose use.

Buffers

If only 1.0 mL of 0.10 M hydrochloric acid is added to 1.0 L of pure water the pH drops drastically from 7.0 to 4.0.
This is a 1000-fold increase in the acidity of the solution. For many purposes, it is desirable to have a solution which
is capable of resisting such large changes in pH when relatively small amounts of acid or base are added to them.
Such a solution is called a buffer. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid or a base and its salt. Both components must
be present for the system to act as a buffer to resist changes in pH. Commercial buffer solutions, which have a wide
variety of pH values, can be obtained.
Some common buffer systems are listed in the Table 21.13:

One example of a buffer is a solution made of acetic acid (the weak acid) and sodium acetate (the salt). The pH of a
buffer consisting of 0.50 M CH3COOH and 0.50 M CH3COONa is 4.74. If 10.0 mL of 1.0 M HCl is added to 1.0
L of the buffer, the pH only decreases to 4.73. This ability to “soak up” the additional hydrogen ions from the HCl
that was added is due to the reaction below.

CH3COO−(aq) + H+(aq) → CH3COOH(aq)

Since both the acetate ion and the acetic acid were already present in the buffer, the only thing that changes is the
ratio of one to the other. Small changes in that ratio have only very minor effects on the pH.
If 10.0 mL of 1.0 M NaOH were added to another 1.0 L of the same buffer, the pH would only increase to 4.76. In
this case the buffer takes up the additional hydroxide ions.

CH3COOH(aq) + OH−(aq) → CH3COO−(aq) + H2O(l)

Again the ratio of acetate ion to acetic acid changes slightly, this time causing a very small increase in the pH.
It is possible to add so much acid or base to a buffer that its ability to resist a signiﬁcant change in pH is overwhelmed.
The buffer capacity is the amount of acid or base that can be added to a buffer solution before a large change in
pH occurs. The buffer capacity is exceeded when the number of moles of H+ or OH− that are added to the buffer
exceeds the number of moles of the buffer components.

Summary

• Buffer is deﬁned.
• Reactions showing how buffers regulate pH are described.

allows it to combine with oxygen from the air to form magnesium oxide (see video below).

2Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2MgO(s)

Compounds can also react with oxygen, possibly creating oxides of more than one element. When methane burns,
carbon dioxide and water are produced.

CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)

Carbon dioxide is an oxide of carbon, while water is an oxide of hydrogen. Early scientists viewed oxidation as a
process in which a substance was reacted with oxygen to produce one or more oxides. In the previous examples,
magnesium and methane are being oxidized.
Oxidation is also deﬁned as a loss of hydrogen atoms. In the following equation, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde
by the loss of two hydrogen atoms:

CH3CH2OH → CH3CHO + 2H atoms

Oxidation does not necessarily require heating. Iron that is exposed to air and water slowly oxidizes in a process
commonly known as rusting. Bleaches contain various compounds such as sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), which
release oxygen that oxidizes stains. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) releases oxygen as it spontaneously decomposes. It
acts as a bleach and an antiseptic that kills bacteria by oxidizing them.
The chemical reaction that is the opposite of oxidation is called reduction. Following from the notion that oxidation
was originally thought to mean only the addition of oxygen, reduction was thought to be only the removal of oxygen
from a substance. Many naturally occurring metal ores are present as oxides. The pure metals can be extracted by
reduction. Iron is obtained from iron(III) oxide by reacting with carbon at high temperatures.

2Fe2O3(s) + 3C(s) → 4Fe(s) + 3CO2(g)

The removal of oxygen from the Fe2O3 means that it is being reduced to Fe. Note that an oxidation process is
simultaneously occurring. The carbon reactant is being oxidized to CO2. This is an important concept. Oxidation
and reduction must happen together. Neither can happen alone in a reaction.
Reduction can also be considered as a gain of hydrogen. The reverse of the ethanol → acetaldehyde reaction shown
above is a reduction reaction:

CH3CHO + 2H atoms → CH3CH2OH

Summary

• Oxidation and reduction are deﬁned in terms of reactions with oxygen.
• Oxidation and reduction reactions must occur together.

How do you make nitric acid?
Nitric acid has many uses in the manufacture of fertilizers and explosives. Most nitric acid is manufactured from
ammonia using a three-step process. The ammonia is oxidized to HNO3 through the formation of several nitrogen
oxides, ﬁnally resulting in the acid.

Redox Reactions and Ionic Compounds

In the course of a chemical reaction between a metal and a nonmetal, electrons are transferred from the metal atoms
to the nonmetal atoms. For example, when zinc metal is mixed with sulfur and heated, the compound zinc sulﬁde is
produced. Two valence electrons from each zinc atom are transferred to each sulfur atom.

FIGURE 22.2

www.ck12.org

Chapter 22. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

Since the zinc is losing electrons in the reaction, it is being oxidized. The sulfur is gaining electrons and is thus being
reduced. An oxidation-reduction reaction is a reaction that involves the full or partial transfer of electrons from
one reactant to another. Oxidation is the full or partial loss of electrons or the gain of oxygen. Reduction is the
full or partial gain of electrons or the loss of oxygen. A redox reaction is another term for an oxidation-reduction
reaction.
Each of these processes can be shown in a separate equation called a half-reaction. A half-reaction is an equation
that shows either the oxidation or the reduction reaction that occurs during a redox reaction.

Oxidation: Zn → Zn2+ + 2e−
Reduction: S + 2e− → S2−

It is important to remember that the two half-reactions occur simultaneously. The resulting ions that are formed are
then attracted to one another in an ionic bond.
Another example of an oxidation-reduction reaction involving electron transfer is the well-known combination of
metallic sodium and chlorine gas to form sodium chloride:

The half-reactions are as follows:

2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl

Oxidation: Na → Na+ + e−
Reduction: Cl + e− → Cl−

We will concern ourselves with the balancing of these equations at another time.

Where do we get oxygen for breathing?
Life on planet Earth is a complicated and well-organized set of processes. Animals are designed to breathe oxygen
and plants are designed to produce oxygen. Photosynthesis is the means by which we get the oxygen we need for
life. Light striking a plant pigment known as chlorophyll initiates a complex series of reactions, many of which
involve redox processes complete with movement of electrons. In this series of reactions, water is converted to
oxygen gas, and we have something to sustain our lives.

22.3. Oxidizing and Reducing Agents

www.ck12.org

In the reaction above, the zinc is being oxidized by losing electrons. However, there must be another substance
present that gains those electrons and in this case that is the sulfur. In other words, the sulfur is causing the zinc to
be oxidized. Sulfur is called the oxidizing agent. The zinc causes the sulfur to gain electrons and become reduced
and so the zinc is called the reducing agent. The oxidizing agent is a substance that causes oxidation by accepting
electrons. The reducing agent is a substance that causes reduction by losing electrons. The simplest way to think
of this is that the oxidizing agent is the substance that is reduced, while the reducing agent is the substance that is
oxidized. The sample problem below shows how to analyze a redox reaction.

Sample Problem: Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

When chlorine gas is bubbled into a solution of sodium bromide, a reaction occurs which produces aqueous sodium
chloride and bromine. Determine what is being oxidized and what is being reduced. Identify the oxidizing and
reducing agents.

Cl2(g) + 2NaBr(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + Br2(l)

Step 1: Plan the problem.
Break the reaction down into a net ionic equation and then into half-reactions. The substance that loses electrons is
being oxidized and is the reducing agent. The substance that gains electrons is being reduced and is the oxidizing
agent.
Step 2: Solve.

2Na+(aq) + 2Br−(aq) → 

2Na+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + Br2(l)

Cl2(g) + 2Br−(aq) → 2Cl−(aq) + Br2(l)

(net ionic reaction)

Oxidation: Cl2(g) + 2e−(aq) → 2Cl−(aq)
Reduction:

2Br−(aq) → Br2(l) + 2e−

The Cl2 is being reduced and is the oxidizing agent. The Br− is being oxidized and is the reducing agent.

Cleaning your nails
Acetone is a versatile chemical used both in manufacture of plastics and as a solvent. It is a major constituent of
such products as nail polish remover, paints, and cleaning ﬂuids. The manufacture of acetone involves formation of
an intermediate peroxide compound by oxidation, followed by formation of the ﬁnal product.

Molecular Redox Reactions

The electron loss and gain is easy to see in a reaction in which ions are formed. However, in many reactions, no
such electron transfer occurs. In a molecular compound, electrons are shared between atoms in a type of bond called
a covalent bond. Yet it is still common for reactions involving molecular compounds to still be classiﬁed as redox
reactions.
When hydrogen gas is reacted with oxygen gas, water is formed as the product.

2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)

In the individual hydrogen molecules, a pair of bonding electrons is shared equally between the hydrogen atoms (a
nonpolar covalent bond). Likewise, the bonding electrons in the oxygen molecule are also shared equally between
the two oxygen atoms. However, when the atoms are rearranged to form the water molecule, the electron sharing is
no longer equal. In each hydrogen-oxygen bond in the water molecule, the bonding electrons are more attracted to
the oxygen atom than they are to the hydrogen atom. We know this because oxygen has a higher electronegativity
than hydrogen.

FIGURE 22.3
Bonding electrons in hydrogen, oxygen,
and water.

In the course of this reaction, electrons are shifted away from each hydrogen atom and towards the oxygen atom. The
hydrogen is oxidized because it undergoes a partial loss of electrons. Even though the loss is not complete enough to
form ions, the hydrogen atoms in water have less electron density near them than they did in the H2 molecule. The
oxygen is reduced because it undergoes a partial gain of electrons. The oxygen atom in water has greater electron
density near it than they did in the O2 molecule.
Another approach to this type of problem is to go back to our earlier deﬁnitions of oxidation being gain of oxygen
or loss of hydrogen and reduction being gain of hydrogen or loss of oxygen. This makes the decision about redox
reactions much easier. The hydrogen is oxidized because it added oxygen to form water. Conversely, the oxygen is
reduced because it added hydrogen to form water.

• Deﬁne corrosion.
• Give examples of corrosion processes.

Just rusting away
The tractor above was once a very useful piece of farm equipment. But it got old, probably broke down a lot, and
you eventually couldn’t get parts for it. You bought a new, more efﬁcient tractor with all the latest gadgets. There
is not much of a market for old tractors, so it sits parked out of the way, exposed to the weather, and quietly rusting
away.

Corrosion

Rust is a combination of several different oxides of iron. The equations below show the steps involved in one of the
many processes of rust formation.

2Fe(s) + O2(g) + 4H+(aq) → 2Fe2+(aq) + 2H2O(l)

4Fe2+(aq) + O2(g) + 6H2O(l) → 2Fe2O3 · H2O(s) + 8H+(aq)

Iron is ﬁrst oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine
with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many
example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous
amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs
the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or
prevent corrosion.

Corrosion Resistance

Chapter 22. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

Some metals, such as gold and platinum, do not corrode easily because they are very resistant to oxidation by
common substances. Some other metals begin to be oxidized, but are further protected from additional corrosion
by a coating formed on the surface. Aluminum reacts with oxygen to form aluminum oxide, which remains tightly
packed on the surface. The aluminum oxide prevents the interior of the aluminum from corroding. Not all corrosion
is a result of reaction with oxygen. Copper corrodes by reaction with carbon dioxide to form copper(II) carbonate.
This distinctive green compound is also called patina and prevents the copper underneath from further corrosion (see
Statue of Liberty in the Figure 22.4).

FIGURE 22.4
Statue of Liberty.

Conversely, the iron oxides that form during the corrosion of iron form a surface that ﬂakes off easily rather than
remaining tight to the surface. This allows the iron to corrode completely through until the iron object is destroyed.
One way to prevent corrosion is to protect the surface of the metal. Covering the surface of the metal object with
paint or oil will prevent corrosion by not allowing oxygen to contact it. Unfortunately, scratches in the paint or
wearing off of the oil will allow the corrosion to begin. Corrosion-sensitive metals can also be coated with another
metal that is resistant to corrosion. A “tin can” is actually made of iron coated with a thin layer of tin which protects
the iron.
Corrosion can also be controlled by connecting the object to be protected to another object made of a metal that is
corroded even more easily. When an iron nail is wrapped with a strip of zinc and exposed to water, the zinc (being
a more active metal than iron) is oxidized while the iron remains intact. This technique, called cathodic protection,
is commonly used to prevent the hulls of steel ships from rusting. Blocks of zinc are attached to the underside of
the hull (see Figure 22.5). The zinc blocks preferentially corrode, keeping the hull intact. The zinc blocks must be
periodically replaced to maintain the protection of the iron.

22.6 Assigning Oxidation Numbers

• List the rules for determining oxidation numbers.
• Use these rules to determine oxidation number in materials.

Iron what?
Once we move from the element iron to iron compounds, we need to be able to designate clearly the form of the iron
ion. An example of this is iron that has been oxidized to form iron oxide during the process of rusting. Although
Antoine Lavoisier ﬁrst began the idea off oxidation as a concept, it was Wendell Latimer (1893-1955) who gave us
the modern concept of oxidation numbers. His 1938 book The Oxidation States of the Elements and Their Potentials
in Aqueous Solution laid out the concept in detail. Latimer was a well-known chemist who later became a member
of the National Academy of Sciences. Not bad for a gentleman who started college planning on being a lawyer.

Assigning Oxidation Numbers

The oxidation number is a positive or negative number that is assigned to an atom to indicate its degree of oxidation
or reduction. In oxidation-reduction processes, the driving force for chemical change is in the exchange of electrons
between chemical species. A series of rules have been developed to help us:

1. For free elements (uncombined state), each atom has an oxidation number of zero. H2, Br2, Na, Be, K, O2,
P4, all have oxidation number of 0.
2. Monatomic ions have oxidation number equal to charge. Li+ = +1, Ba2+ = +2, Fe3+ = +3, I− = −1,
O2− = −2, etc. Alkali metal oxidation numbers = +1. Alkaline earth oxidation numbers = +2. Aluminum =

1025

22.6. Assigning Oxidation Numbers

www.ck12.org

+3 in all of its compounds. Oxygen’s oxidation number is -2 except when in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or a
peroxide ion (O2

2−) where it is -1.

3. Hydrogen’s oxidation number is +1, except for when bonded to metals as the hydride ion forming binary

compounds. In LiH, NaH, and CaH2, the oxidation number is -1.

4. Fluorine has an oxidation number of -1 in all of its compounds.
5. Halogens (Cl, Br, I) have negative oxidation numbers when they form halide compounds. When combined
−), the oxidation number of Cl +5, and the

with oxygen, they have positive numbers. In the chlorate ion (ClO3
oxidation number of O is -2.

6. In a neutral atom or molecule, the sum of the oxidation numbers must be 0. In a polyatomic ion, the sum of

the oxidation numbers of all the atoms in the ion must equal the charge on the ion.

Sample Problem: What is the oxidation number for Mn in the compound KMnO4?

The oxidation number for K is +1 (rule 2)
The oxidation number for O is -2 (rule 2)
Since this is a compound (there is no charge indicated on the molecule), the net charge on the molecule is zero (rule
6)
So we have

+1 + Mn + 4(−2) = 0
Mn− 7 = 0
Mn = +7

When dealing with oxidation numbers, we must always include the charge on the atom.
Another way to determine the oxidation number of Mn in this compound is to recall that the permanganate anion
(MnO4) has a charge of -1. In this case:

Mn + 4(−2) = −1
Mn− 8 = −1
Mn = +7

Sample Problem: What is the oxidation number for iron in Fe2O3?

O is− 2 (rule 2)
2Fe + 3(−2) = 0
2Fe = 6
Fe = 3.

If we have the compound FeO, then Fe + (−2) = 0 and Fe = 2. Iron is one of those materials that can have more
than one oxidation number.
The halogens (except for ﬂuorine) can also have more than one number. In the compound NaCl, we know that Na is
+1, so Cl must be -1. But what about NaClO3?

1026

www.ck12.org

Chapter 22. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

Na = 1
O = −2
1 +Cl + 3(−2) = 0
1 +Cl − 6 = 0.
Cl − 5 = 0

Cl = +5.

Not quite what we expected, but Cl, Br, and I will exhibit multiple oxidation numbers in compounds.

Where does the zinc in batteries come from?
Zinc is an important component of many kinds of batteries. This metal is mined as zinc compounds, one of which is
zinc carbonate. To obtain the pure metal, the ore must go through the following chemical processes:
1. High temperatures and hot air blasts are used to roast the ore:

ZnCO3(s) + (heat) → ZnO(s) + CO2(g)

2. Then the ZnO is treated with carbon:

ZnO(s) + C(s) + (heat) → Zn(g) + CO(g)
ZnO(s) + CO(g) + (heat) → Zn(g) + CO2(g)

The result is the pure metal which can then be fabricated into a variety of products.

Changes in Oxidation-Number in Redox Reactions

Consider the reaction below between elemental iron and copper sulfate:

1028

www.ck12.org

Chapter 22. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

Fe + CuSO4 → FeSO4 + Cu

In the course of the reaction, the oxidation number of Fe increases from zero to +2. The oxidation number of copper
decreases from +2 to 0. This result is in accordance with the activity series. Iron is above copper in the series, so
will be more likely to form Fe2+ while converting the Cu2+ to metallic copper (Cu0).
A loss of negatively-charged electrons corresponds to an increase in oxidation number, while a gain of electrons
corresponds to a decrease in oxidation number. Therefore, the element or ion that is oxidized undergoes an increase
in oxidation number. The element or ion that is reduced undergoes a decrease in oxidation number. The Table 22.1
summarizes the processes of oxidation and reduction.

Identifying Reaction Types

A redox reaction must involve a change in oxidation number for two of the elements involved in the reaction. The
oxidized element increases in oxidation number, while the reduced element decreases in oxidation number.
Single-replacement reactions are redox reactions because two different elements appear as free element (oxidation
number of zero) on one side of the equation and as part of a compound on the other side. Therefore, its oxidation
number must change.

Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl2 + H2

Zn is oxidized from Zn0 to Zn2+ and the H is reduced from H+ to H0
Combustion reactions are redox reactions because elemental oxygen (O2) acts as the oxidizing agent and is itself

Most combination and decomposition reactions are redox reactions since elements are usually transformed into
compounds and vice-versa. The thermite reaction involves ferric oxide and metallic aluminum:

Fe2O3 + 2Al → Al2O3 + 2Fe

redox reactions because ions are simply recombined without any transfer of electrons.

22.9 Balancing Redox Reactions: Oxidation

Number Change Method

• Use the oxidation number-change method to balance redox equations.

Sulfuric acid –useful but hazardous
Sulfuric acid is produced in extremely large quantities in the United States (about 40 million tons/year). This material
is manufactured by oxidizing sulfur to form sulfur trioxide. The SO3 is then dissolved in water to form the sulfuric
acid. Most of the sulfuric acid produced is used in fertilizers. This acid is also found in lead-acid car batteries.

Balancing Redox Reactions: Oxidation-Number-Change Method

One way to balance redox reactions is by keeping track of the electron transfer using the oxidation numbers of each
of the atoms. For the oxidation-number-change method, start with the unbalanced skeleton equation. The example
below is for the reaction of iron(III) oxide with carbon monoxide. This reaction is one that takes place in a blast
furnace during the processing of iron ore into metallic iron (see Figure 22.7):

Fe2O3(s) + CO(g) → Fe(s) + CO2(g)

Step 1: Assign oxidation numbers to each of the atoms in the equation and write the numbers above the atom.

Chapter 22. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

Step 2: Identify the atoms that are oxidized and those that are reduced. In the above equation, the carbon atom
is being oxidized since its oxidation increases from +2 to +4. The iron atom is being reduced since its oxidation
number decreases from +3 to 0.
Step 3: Use a line to connect the atoms that are undergoing a change in oxidation number. On the line, write the
oxidation-number change.

The carbon atom’s oxidation number increases by 2, while the iron atom’s oxidation number decreases by 3. As
written, the number of electrons lost does not equal the number of electrons gained. In a balanced redox equation,
these must be equal. So, the increase in oxidation number of one atom must be made equal to the decrease in
oxidation number of the other.
Step 4: Use coefﬁcients to make the total increase in oxidation number equal to the total decrease in oxidation
number.
In this case, the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. So the oxidation-number increase should be
multiplied by 3, while the oxidation-number decrease should be multiplied by 2. The coefﬁcient is also applied to
the formulas in the equation. So a 3 is placed in front of the CO and in front of the CO2. A 2 is placed in front of the
Fe on the right side of the equation. The Fe2O3 does not require a coefﬁcient because the subscript of 2 after the Fe
indicates that there are already two iron atoms.

Step 5: Check the balancing for both atoms and charge. Occasionally, a coefﬁcient may need to be placed in front
of a molecular formula that was not involved in the redox process. In the current example, the equation is now
balanced.

Fe2O3(s) + 3CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + 3CO2(g)

22.10 Balancing Redox Reactions: Half-Reaction

Method

• Balance redox equations using the half-reaction method.

What makes the paint color orange?
The picture above shows one of the two Thunder Dolphin amusement ride trains. This train has an orange stripe
while its companion train has a yellow stripe. Pigments of these colors are often made with a dichromate salt (usually
sodium or potassium dichromate). These brightly colored compounds serve as strong oxidizing agents in chemical
reactions.

Balancing Redox Equations: Half-Reaction Method

Another method for balancing redox reactions uses half-reactions. Recall that a half-reaction is either the oxidation
or reduction that occurs, treated separately. The half-reaction method works better than the oxidation-number
method when the substances in the reaction are in aqueous solution. The aqueous solution is typically either acidic
or basic, so hydrogen ions or hydroxide ions are present.
In general, the half-reactions are ﬁrst balanced by atoms separately. Electrons are included in the half-reactions.
These are then balanced so that the number of electrons lost is equal to the number of electrons gained. Finally, the
two half-reactions are added back together. The example is the oxidation of Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions by dichromate
(Cr2O7

2−) in acidic solution. The dichromate ions are reduced to Cr3+ ions.

Step 1: Write the unbalanced ionic equation.

Fe2+(aq) + Cr2O2−

7 (aq) → Fe3+(aq) + Cr3+(aq)

1037

22.10. Balancing Redox Reactions: Half-Reaction Method

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 22.8
Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7)

Notice that the equation is far from balanced, as there are no oxygen atoms on the right side. This will be resolved
by the balancing method.
Step 2: Write separate half-reactions for the oxidation and the reduction processes. Determine the oxidation
numbers ﬁrst, if necessary.

Oxidation: Fe2+(aq) → Fe3+(aq)

Reduction:

+6

Cr2 O2−

7 (aq) → Cr3+(aq)

Step 3: Balance the atoms in the half-reactions other than the hydrogen and oxygen. In the oxidation half-reaction
above, the iron atoms are already balanced. The reduction half-reaction needs to be balanced with the chromium
atoms.

Cr2O2−

7 (aq) → 2Cr3+(aq)

Step 4: Balance oxygen atoms by adding water molecules to the appropriate side of the equation. For the reduction
half-reaction above, seven H2O molecules will be added to the product side.

Cr2O2−

7 (aq) → 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)

Now the hydrogen atoms need to be balanced. In an acidic medium, add hydrogen ions to balance. In this example,
fourteen H+ ions will be added to the reactant side.

14H+(aq) + Cr2O2−

7 (aq) → 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)

Step 5: Balance the charges by adding electrons to each half-reaction. For the oxidation half-reaction, the electrons
will need to be added to the product side. For the reduction half-reaction, the electrons will be added to the reactant

1038

www.ck12.org

Chapter 22. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

side. By adding one electron to the product side of the oxidation half-reaction, there is a 2+ total charge on both
sides.

Fe2+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + e−

There is a total charge of 12+ on the reactant side of the reduction half-reaction (14 –2). The product side has a total
charge of 6+ due to the two chromium ions (2 × 3). To balance the charge, six electrons need to be added to the
reactant side.

6e− + 14H+(aq) + Cr2O2−

7 (aq) → 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)

Now equalize the electrons by multiplying everything in one or both equations by a coefﬁcient. In this example, the
oxidation half-reaction will be multiplied by six.

6Fe2+(aq) → 6Fe3+(aq) + 6e−

Step 6: Add the two half-reactions together. The electrons must cancel. Balance any remaining substances by
inspection. If necessary, cancel out H2O or H+ that appear on both sides.

6Fe2+(aq) → 6Fe3+(aq) +6e−

6e− + 14H+(aq) + Cr2O2−
14H+(aq) + 6Fe2+(aq) + Cr2O2−

7 (aq) → 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)
7 (aq) → 6Fe3+ + 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)

Step 7: Check the balancing. In the above equation, there are 14 H, 6 Fe, 2 Cr, and 7 O on both sides. The net
charge is 24+ on both sides. The equation is balanced.

How do you remove cyanide from water ?
Cyanide is a very toxic material. Generated mainly by industrial manufacturing processes, this anion can cause
neurological effects and damage to sensitive tissues such as the thyroid gland.
Treatment with chlorine gas in basic solution effectively destroys any cyanide present by converting it to harmless
nitrogen gas. The reaction is as follows:

2NaCN + 5Cl2 + 12NaOH → N2 + 2Na2CO3 + 10NaCl + 6H2O

Half-Reaction Method in Basic Solution

For reactions that occur in basic solution rather than acidic solution, the steps to balance the reaction are primarily
the same. However, after ﬁnishing step 6, add an equal number of OH− ions to both sides of the equation. Combine
the H+ and OH− to make H2O and cancel out any water molecules that appear on both sides. Using the example of
the oxidation of Fe2+ ions by dichromate (Cr2O7
1. Adding the hydroxide ions

2−), we would get the following three steps:

14OH−(aq) + 14H+(aq) + 6Fe2+(aq) + Cr2O2−

7 (aq) → 6Fe3+ + 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l) + 14OH−(aq)

7 (aq) → 6Fe3+ + 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l) + 14OH−(aq)

3. Canceling out seven water molecules from both sides to get the ﬁnal equation

7H2O(l) + 6Fe2+(aq) + Cr2O2−

7 (aq) → 6Fe3+ + 2Cr3+(aq) + 14OH−(aq)

The equation is still balanced by atoms and by charge, but the presence of hydroxide ions rather than hydrogen ions
means that the reaction takes place in basic solution. Typically, most redox reactions will actually only proceed in
2− does not occur in basic solution, and was only
one type of solution or the other. The oxidation of Fe2+ by Cr2O7
balanced this way to demonstrate the method.
In summary, the choice of which balancing method to use depends on the kind of reaction. The oxidation-number
method works best if the oxidized and reduced species appear only once on each side of the equation and if no
acids or bases are present. The half-reaction method is more versatile and works well for reactions involving ions in
aqueous solution.

How much for that necklace?
Gold and silver are widely used metals for making jewelry. One of the reasons these metals are employed for this
purpose is that they are very unreactive. They do not react in contact with most other metals, so they are more likely
to stay intact under challenging conditions. Who wants their favorite piece of jewelry to fall apart on them?

Direct Redox Reactions

When a strip of zinc metal is placed into a blue solution of copper(II) sulfate ( Figure 23.1), a reaction immediately
begins as the zinc strip begins to darken. If left in the solution for a longer period of time, the zinc will gradually
decay due to oxidation to zinc ions. At the same time, the copper(II) ions from the solution are reduced to copper
metal (see Figure 23.2), which causes the blue copper(II) sulfate solution to become colorless.
The process that occurs in this redox reaction is shown below as two separate half-reactions, which can then be
combined into the full redox reaction.

Why does this reaction occur spontaneously? The activity series is a listing of elements in descending order of

series in a single-replacement reaction. This series also lists elements in order of ease of oxidation. The elements at
the top are the easiest to oxidize, while those at the bottom are the most difﬁcult to oxidize. The Table 23.1 shows

Notice that zinc is listed above copper on the activity series, which means that zinc is more easily oxidized than
copper. That is why copper(II) ions can act as an oxidizing agent when put into contact with zinc metal. Ions of any
metal that is below zinc, such as lead or silver, would oxidize the zinc in a similar reaction. These types of reactions
are called direct redox reactions because the electrons ﬂow directly from the atoms of one metal to the cations of
the other metal. However, no reaction will occur if a strip of copper metal is placed into a solution of zinc ions,
because the zinc ions are not able to oxidize the copper. In other words, such a reaction is nonspontaneous.

What happened to that sculpture?
Metal exposed to the outside elements will usually corrode if not protected. The corrosion process is a series of
redox reactions involving the metal of the sculpture. In some situations, the metals are deliberately left unprotected
so that the surface will undergo changes that may enhance the esthetic value of the work.

Electrochemical Reactions

Chemical reactions either absorb or release energy, which can be in the form of electricity. Electrochemistry is a
branch of chemistry that deals with the interconversion of chemical energy and electrical energy. Electrochemistry
has many common applications in everyday life. All sorts of batteries, from those used to power a ﬂashlight to a
calculator to an automobile, rely on chemical reactions to generate electricity. Electricity is used to plate objects
with decorative metals like gold or chromium. Electrochemistry is important in the transmission of nerve impulses
in biological systems. Redox chemistry, the transfer of electrons, is behind all electrochemical processes.
The reaction of zinc metal with copper(II) ions is called a direct redox process or reaction. The electrons that are
transferred in the reaction go directly from the Zn atoms on the surface of the strip to the Cu2+ ions in the area
of the solution right next to the zinc strip. Electricity on the other hand, requires the passage of electrons through
a conducting medium, such as a wire, in order to do work. This work could be lighting a light bulb or powering
a refrigerator or heating a house. When the redox reaction is direct, those electrons cannot be made to do work.

Chapter 23. Electrochemistry

Instead, we must separate the oxidation process from the reduction process and force the electrons to move from one
place to another in between. That is the key to the structure of the electrochemical cell. An electrochemical cell is
any device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy or electrical energy into chemical energy.
There are three components that make up an electrochemical reaction. There must be a solution where redox
reactions can occur. These reactions generally take place in water to facilitate electron and ion movement. A
conductor must exist for electrons to be transferred. This conductor is usually some kind of wire so that electrons
can move from one site to another. Ions also must be able to move through some form of salt bridge that facilitates
ion migration.

23.3 Voltaic Cells

• Describe the structure and function of a voltaic cell.

What made it twitch?
Luigi Galvani (1737-1798) was an Italian physician and scientist who did research on nerve conduction in animals.
His accidental observation of the twitching of frog legs when they were in contact with an iron scalpel while the
legs hung on copper hooks led to studies on electrical conductivity in muscles and nerves. He believed that animal
tissues contained an “animal electricity” similar to the natural electricity that caused lightning to form.

Voltaic Cells

A voltaic cell is an electrochemical cell that uses a spontaneous redox reaction to produce electrical energy.
The voltaic cell (see Figure 23.3) consists of two separate compartments. A half-cell is one part of a voltaic cell
in which either the oxidation or reduction half-reaction takes place. The left half-cell is a strip of zinc metal in a
solution of zinc sulfate. The right half-cell is a strip of copper metal in a solution of copper(II) sulfate. The strips of
metal are called electrodes. An electrode is a conductor in a circuit that is used to carry electrons to a nonmetallic
part of the circuit. The nonmetallic part of the circuit is the electrolyte solutions in which the electrodes are placed. A
metal wire connects the two electrodes. A switch opens or closes the circuit. A porous membrane is placed between
the two half-cells to complete the circuit.
The various electrochemical processes that occur in a voltaic cell occur simultaneously. It is easiest to describe them
in the following steps, using the above zinc-copper cell as an example.
1. Zinc atoms from the zinc electrode are oxidized to zinc ions. This happens because zinc is higher than copper on
the activity series and so is more easily oxidized.

Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e−

The electrode at which oxidation occurs is called the anode. The zinc anode gradually diminishes as the cell operates
due to the loss of zinc metal. The zinc ion concentration in the half-cell increases. Because of the production of
electrons at the anode, it is labeled as the negative electrode.
2. The electrons that are generated at the zinc anode travel through the external wire and register a reading on the
voltmeter. They continue to the copper electrode.
3. Electrons enter the copper electrode where they combine with the copper(II) ions in the solution, reducing them
to copper metal.

Cu2+(aq) + 2e− → Cu(s)

The electrode at which reduction occurs is called the cathode. The cathode gradually increases in mass because of
the production of copper metal. The concentration of copper(II) ions in the half-cell solution decreases. The cathode
is the positive electrode.
4. Ions move through the membrane to maintain electrical neutrality in the cell. In the cell illustrated above, sulfate
ions will move from the copper side to the zinc side to compensate for the decrease in Cu2+ and the increase in
Zn2+.
The two half-reactions can again be summed to provide the overall redox reaction occurring in the voltaic cell.

Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)

23.4 Electrical Potential

• Deﬁne electrical potential.
• Deﬁne reduction potential.
• Deﬁne cell potential.

How many volts is that?
The voltmeter doesn’t measure volts directly; it measures electric current ﬂow. But don’t worry – current ﬂow
and voltage can be directly related to one another. The ﬁrst meters were called galvanometers and they used basic
laws of electricity to determine voltage. They were heavy and hard to work with, but got the job done. The ﬁrst
multimeters were developed in the 1920s, but true portability had to wait until printed circuits and transistors replaced
the cumbersome wires and vacuum tubes.

Electrical Potential

Electrical potential is a measurement of the ability of a voltaic cell to produce an electric current. Electrical
potential is typically measured in volts (V). The voltage that is produced by a given voltaic cell is the electrical
potential difference between the two half-cells. It is not possible to measure the electrical potential of an isolated
half-cell. For example, if only a zinc half-cell were constructed, no complete redox reaction can occur and so no
electrical potential can be measured. It is only when another half-cell is combined with the zinc half-cell that an
electrical potential difference, or voltage, can be measured.
The electrical potential of a cell results from a competition for electrons. In a zinc-copper voltaic cell, it is the
copper(II) ions that will be reduced to copper metal. That is because the Cu2+ ions have a greater attraction for
electrons than the Zn2+ ions in the other half-cell. Instead, the zinc metal is oxidized. The reduction potential is a
measure of the tendency of a given half-reaction to occur as a reduction in an electrochemical cell. In a given voltaic

1053

23.4. Electrical Potential

cell, the half-cell that has the greater reduction potential is the one in which reduction will occur. In the half-cell with
the lower reduction potential, oxidation will occur. The cell potential (Ecell) is the difference in reduction potential
between the two half-cells in an electrochemical cell.

23.5 Standard Hydrogen Electrode

• Describe the hydrogen electrode.
• Describe how this electrode is used in determining reduction potentials.

What is a standard?
We all compare ourselves to someone. Can I run faster than you? Am I taller than my dad? These are relative
comparisons that don’t give a lot of useful data. When we use a standard for our comparisons, everybody can tell
how one thing compares to another. One meter is the same distance everywhere in the world, so a 100 meter track
in one country is exactly the same distance as a 100 meter track in another country. We now have a universal basis
for comparison.

Standard Hydrogen Electrode

The activity series allows us to predict the relative reactivities of different materials when used in oxidation-reduction
processes. We also know we can create electric current by a combination of chemical processes. But how do we
predict the expected amount of current that will ﬂow through the system? We measure this ﬂow as voltage (an
electromotive force or potential difference).
In order to do this, we need some way of comparing the extent of electron ﬂow in the various chemical systems.
The best way to do this is to have a baseline that we use –a standard that everything can be measured against. For
determination of half-reaction current ﬂows and voltages, we use the standard hydrogen electrode. The Figure
23.4 illustrates this electrode. A platinum wire conducts the electricity through the circuit. The wire is immersed in
a 1.0 M strong acid solution and H2 gas is bubbled in at a pressure of one atmosphere and a temperature of 25°C.
The half-reaction at this electrode is H2 → 2H+ + 2e−.
Under these conditions, the potential for the hydrogen reduction is deﬁned as exactly zero. We call this E0, the
standard reduction potential.
We can then use this system to measure the potentials of other electrodes in the half-cell. A metal and one of its salts
(sulfate is often used) is in the second half-cell. We will use zinc as our example (see Figure 23.5).

Chapter 23. Electrochemistry

As we observe the reaction, we notice that the mass of solid zinc decreases during the course of the reaction. This
suggests that the reaction occurring in that half-cell is

So, we have the following process occurring in the cell:

Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e−

Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e− (anode− oxidation)
2H+ + 2e− → H2 (cathode− reduction)

and the measured cell voltage is 0.76 volts (abbreviated as v).
We deﬁne the standard emf (electromotive force) of the cell as:

cathode − E0

anode

cell = E0

E0
0.76 V = 0− E0
Zn cell = −0.76 volts

Zn cell

We can do the same determination with a copper cell ( Figure 23.6).

FIGURE 23.6
The standard hydrogen half-cell paired
with a copper half-cell.

As we run the reaction, we see that the mass of the copper increases, so we write the half-reaction:

This makes the copper electrode the cathode. We now have the two half-reactions:

Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu

1057

23.5. Standard Hydrogen Electrode

H2 → 2H+ + 2e− (anode)
Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu (cathode)

cathode − E0

anode

cell = E0
copper − 0 so copper potential = 0.34 V

and we determine the E0 for the system to be 0.34 v.
Again, E0
0.34 V = Eo
Now we want to build a system in which both zinc and copper are involved. We know from the activity series that
zinc will be oxidized and cooper reduced, so we can use the values at hand:
E0

cell = 0.34 V (copper)− (−0.76 V zinc) = 1.10 volts for the cell

• The structure of the standard hydrogen electrode is described.
• Examples of using this electrode to determine reduction potentials are given.

23.6 Calculating Standard Cell Potentials

• Perform calculations of standard cell potential.
• Describe abilities of materials to participate in redox reactions based on standard cell potential data.

Keeping rust away
When exposed to moisture, steel will begin to rust fairly quickly. This creates a signiﬁcant problem for items like
nails that are exposed to the atmosphere. The nails can be protected by coated them with zinc metal, making a
galvanized nail. The zinc is more likely to oxidize than the iron in the steel, so it prevents rust from developing on
the nail.

Calculating Standard Cell Potentials

In order to function, any electrochemical cell must consist of two half-cells. The Table 23.2 can be used to determine
the reactions that will occur and the standard cell potential for any combination of two half-cells without actually
constructing the cell. The half-cell with the higher reduction potential according to the table will undergo reduction
within the cell. The half-cell with the lower reduction potential will undergo oxidation within the cell. If those
speciﬁcations are followed, the overall cell potential will be a positive value. The cell potential must be positive in
order for redox reaction of the cell to be spontaneous. If a negative cell potential were to be calculated, that reaction
would be spontaneous in the reverse direction.

Sample Problem: Calculating Standard Cell Potentials

Calculate the standard cell potential of a voltaic cell that uses the Ag/Ag+ and Sn/Sn2+ half-cell reactions. Write
the balanced equation for the overall cell reaction that occurs. Identify the anode and the cathode.

Before adding the two reactions together, the number of electrons lost in the oxidation must equal the number of
electrons gained in the reduction. The silver half-cell reaction must be multiplied by two. After doing that and
adding to the tin half-cell reaction, the overall equation is obtained.

Step 3: Think about your result.
The standard cell potential is positive, so the reaction is spontaneous as written. Tin is oxidized at the anode, while
silver ion is reduced at the cathode. Note that the voltage for the silver ion reduction is not doubled even though the
reduction half-reaction had to be doubled to balance the overall redox equation.

Oxidizing and Reducing Agents

A substance which is capable of being reduced very easily is a strong oxidizing agent. Conversely, a substance
which is capable of being oxidized very easily is a strong reducing agent. According to the standard cell potential
table, ﬂuorine (F2) is the strongest oxidizing agent. It will oxidize any substance below on the table. For example,
ﬂuorine will oxidize gold metal according to the following reaction.

3F2(g) + 2Au(s) → 6F−(aq) + 2Au3+(aq)

Lithium metal (Li) is the strongest reducing agent. It is capable of reducing any substance above on the table. For
example, lithium will reduce water according to this reaction.

2Li(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2Li+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) + H2(g)

Using the Table 23.2 will allow you to predict whether reactions will occur or not. For example, nickel metal is
capable of reducing copper(II) ions, but is not capable of reducing zinc ions. This is because nickel (Ni) is below
Cu2+, but is above Zn2+ in the table.

Ouch, that hurts
Alessandro Volta developed the ﬁrst “voltaic cell” in 1800 (pictured above). This battery consisted of alternating
disks of zinc and silver with pieces of cardboard soaked in brine separating the disks. Since there were no voltmeters
at the time (and no idea that the electric current was due to electron ﬂow), Volta had to rely on another measure of
battery strength: the amount of shock produced (it’s never a good idea to test things on yourself). He found that the
intensity of the shock increased with the number of metal plates in the system. Devices with twenty plates produced
a shock that was quite painful. It’s a good thing we have voltmeters today to measure electric current instead of the
“stick your ﬁnger on this and tell me what you feel” method.

Batteries

Two variations on the basic voltaic cell are the dry cell and the lead storage battery.

Dry Cells

Many common batteries, such as those used in a ﬂashlight or remote control, are voltaic dry cells. These batteries
are called dry cells because the electrolyte is a paste. They are relatively inexpensive, but do not last a long time and
are not rechargeable.

FIGURE 23.7
A zinc-carbon dry cell.

−(aq) + 2e− → Mn2O3(s) + 2NH3(aq) + H2O(l)

In the zinc-carbon dry cell, the anode is a zinc container, while the cathode is a carbon rod through the center of the
cell. The paste is made of manganese(IV) oxide (MnO2), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), and zinc chloride (ZnCl2)
in water. The half-reactions for this dry cell are:
Anode (oxidation): Zn(s) → Zn2+ + 2e−
Cathode (reduction): 2MnO2(s) + 2NH4
The paste prevents the contents of the dry cell from freely mixing, so a salt bridge is not needed. The carbon rod is
a conductor only and does not undergo reduction. The voltage produced by a fresh dry cell is 1.5 V, but decreases
during use.
An alkaline battery is a variation on the zinc-carbon dry cell. The alkaline battery has no carbon rod and uses a paste
of zinc metal and potassium hydroxide instead of a solid metal anode. The cathode half-reaction is the same, but the
anode half-reaction is different.
Anode (oxidation): Zn(s) + 2OH−(aq) → Zn(OH)2(s) + 2e−
Advantages of the alkaline battery are that it has a longer shelf life and the voltage does not decrease during use.

Lead Storage Batteries

A battery is a group of electrochemical cells combined together as a source of direct electric current at a constant
voltage. Dry cells are not true batteries since they are only one cell. The lead storage battery is commonly used as
the power source in cars and other vehicles. It consists of six identical cells joined together, each of which has a lead
anode and a cathode made of lead(IV) oxide (PbO2) packed on a metal plate.
The cathode and anode are both immersed in an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, which acts as the electrolyte. The
cell reactions are:

2−(aq) + 2e− → PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(l)

2−(aq) → 2PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(l)

Each cell in a lead storage battery produces 2 V, so a total of 12 V is generated by the entire battery. This is used to
start a car or power other electrical systems.
Unlike a dry cell, the lead storage battery is rechargeable. Note that the forward redox reaction generates solid
lead(II) sulfate which slowly builds up on the plates. Additionally, the concentration of sulfuric acid decreases.
When the car is running normally, its generator recharges the battery by forcing the above reactions to run in the
opposite, or nonspontaneous direction.

2PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(l) → Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 4H+(aq) + 2SO4

2−(aq)

This reaction regenerates the lead, lead(IV) oxide, and sulfuric acid needed for the battery to function properly.
Theoretically, a lead storage battery should last forever. In practice, the recharging is not 100% efﬁcient because
some of the lead(II) sulfate falls from the electrodes and collects on the bottom of the cells.

Do we have heat yet?
In 1989, two scientists announced that they had achieved “cold fusion”, the process of fusing together elements at
essentially room temperature to achieve energy production. The hypothesis was that the fusion would produce more
energy than was required to cause the process to occur. Their process involved the electrolysis of heavy water (water
molecules containing some deuterium instead of normal hydrogen) on a palladium electrode. The experiments
could not be reproduced and their scientiﬁc reputations were pretty well shot. However, in more recent years, both
industry and government researchers are taking another look at this process. The device illustrated above is part of
a government project, and NASA is completing some studies on the topic as well. Cold fusion may not be so “cold”
after all.

Electrolytic Cells

A voltaic cell uses a spontaneous redox reaction to generate an electric current.
It is also possible to do the
opposite. When an external source of direct current is applied to an electrochemical cell, a reaction that is normally
nonspontaneous can be made to proceed. Electrolysis is the process in which electrical energy is used to cause a
nonspontaneous chemical reaction to occur. Electrolysis is responsible for the appearance of many everyday objects
such as gold-plated or silver-plated jewelry and chrome-plated car bumpers.

23.8. Electrolytic Cells

www.ck12.org

An electrolytic cell is the apparatus used for carrying out an electrolysis reaction. In an electrolytic cell, electric
current is applied to provide a source of electrons for driving the reaction in a nonspontaneous direction.
In a
voltaic cell, the reaction goes in a direction that releases electrons spontaneously. In an electrolytic cell, the input of
electrons from an external source forces the reaction to go in the opposite direction.

FIGURE 23.9
Zn/Cu cell.

The spontaneous direction for the reaction between Zn and Cu is for the Zn metal to be oxidized to Zn2+ ions,
while the Cu2+ ions are reduced to Cu metal. This makes the zinc electrode the anode and the copper electrode the
cathode. When the same half-cells are connected to a battery via the external wire, the reaction is forced to run in
the opposite direction. The zinc electrode is now the cathode and the copper electrode is the anode.

The standard cell potential is negative, indicating a nonspontaneous reaction. The battery must be capable of
delivering at least 1.10 V of direct current in order for the reaction to occur. Another difference between a voltaic
cell and an electrolytic cell is the signs of the electrodes. In a voltaic cell, the anode is negative and the cathode is
positive. In an electrolytic cell, the anode is positive because it is connected to the positive terminal of the battery.
The cathode is therefore negative. Electrons still ﬂow through the cell form the anode to the cathode.

More energy from the sun?
With fossil fuels becoming more expensive and less available, scientists are looking for other energy sources.
Hydrogen has long been considered an ideal source, since it does not pollute when it burns. The problem has
been ﬁnding ways to generate hydrogen economically. One new approach that is being studied is photoelectrolysis
–the generation of electricity using photovoltaic cells to split water molecules. This technique is still in the research
stage, but appears to be a very promising source of power in the future.

Electrolysis of Water

The electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen gases. The electrolytic cell consists of a pair of platinum
electrodes immersed in water to which a small amount of an electrolyte such as H2SO4 has been added. The
electrolyte is necessary because pure water will not carry enough charge due to the lack of ions. At the anode, water
is oxidized to oxygen gas and hydrogen ions. At the cathode, water is reduced to hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions.

23.10 Electrolysis of Molten Salts and Electroly-

sis of Brine

• Write reactions for the electrolysis of molten NaCl in a Down’s cell.
• Write reactions for the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride.

A big electric bill
Production of NaOH is an important industrial process. Three different methods are employed, all of which involve
the use of electricity. When calculating the price of sodium hydroxide a company has to charge in order to make a
proﬁt, the cost of electricity has to be factored in. To make a metric ton of NaOH, between 3300-5000 kWh (kilowatt
hours) are required. Compare that with the power needed to run an average house. You could power a home for 6-10
months with the same amount of electricity.

Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride

Molten (liquid) sodium chloride can be electrolyzed to produce sodium metal and chlorine gas. The electrolytic cell
used in the process is called a Down’s cell (see Figure 23.11).
In a Down’s cell, the liquid sodium ions are reduced at the cathode to liquid sodium metal. At the anode, liquid
chloride ions are oxidized to chlorine gas. The reactions and cell potentials are shown below:

2Cl−(l) → Cl2(g) + 2e−

oxidation (anode):
reduction (cathode): Na+(l) + e− → Na(l)
overall reaction:

2Na+(l) + 2Cl−(l) → 2Na(l) + Cl2(g)

E0 = −2.71 V

FIGURE 23.11

The battery must supply over 4 volts to carry out this electrolysis. This reaction is a major source of production of
chlorine gas and is the only way to obtain pure sodium metal. Chlorine gas is widely used in cleaning, disinfecting,
and in swimming pools.

Electrolysis of Aqueous Sodium Chloride

It may be logical to assume that the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride, called brine, would yield the same
result through the same reactions as the process in molten NaCl. However, the reduction reaction that occurs at the
cathode does not produce sodium metal because the water is reduced instead. This is because the reduction potential
for water is only -0.83 V compared to -2.71 V for the reduction of sodium ions. This makes the reduction of water
preferable because its reduction potential is less negative. Chlorine gas is still produced at the anode, just as in the
electrolysis of molten NaCl.

reduction (cathode): 2H2O(l) + 2e− → H2(g) + 2OH−

Since hydroxide ions are also a product of the net reaction, the important chemical sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is
obtained from evaporation of the aqueous solution at the end of the hydrolysis.

Electroplating

Many decorative objects like jewelry are manufactured with the aid of an electrolytic process. Electroplating is a
process in which a metal ion is reduced in an electrolytic cell and the solid metal is deposited onto a surface. The
Figure 23.12 shows a cell in which copper metal is to be plated onto a second metal.
The cell consists of a solution of copper sulfate and a strip of copper which acts as the anode. The metal (Me) is the
cathode. The anode is connected to the positive electrode of a battery, while the metal is connected to the negative
electrode.
When the circuit is closed, copper metal from the anode is oxidized, allowing copper ions to enter the solution.

anode : Cu0(s) → Cu2+(aq) + 2e−

Meanwhile copper ions from the solution are reduced to copper metal on the surface of the cathode (the second
metal):

FIGURE 23.12
Electroplating of second metal by copper.

cathode : Cu2+(aq) + 2e− → Cu0(s)

The concentration of copper ions in the solution is effectively constant. This is because the electroplating process
transfers metal from the anode to the cathode of the cell. Other metals commonly plated onto objects include
chromium, gold, silver, and platinum.

• Deﬁne radioactivity.

What does that sign mean?
If you visit the nuclear medicine department of a large hospital, you are very likely to see the symbol shown above.
The sign means that radioactive materials are present and special safety precautions need to be taken. These materials
are used for diagnosis and treatment of many diseases. The people using these materials are specially trained to
handle them safely. Radioactive materials can be dangerous and should be respected, but need not be feared.

Discovery of Radioactivity

John Dalton ﬁrst proposed his atomic theory in an 1804 lecture to the Royal Institution, a prestigious British
scientiﬁc society.
In this talk, he put forth the idea that all atoms of an element were identical and that atoms
were indestructible. In a little over 100 years, both of these ideas were shown to be incorrect.
In 1919, studies on atomic weights led Francis Aston (1877-1925) to the conclusion that some elements with different
atomic weights were actually the same element in different isotope forms. Aston used a mass spectrograph to
separate isotopes of different elements. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work in 1922.

Natural Radioactivity

In 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen produced great interest in what caused the phenomenon of x-rays. One researcher of this
phenomenon was Henri Becquerel. Becquerel studied the ﬂuorescent properties of uranium salts, believing they had
something to do with X-rays. He soon learned that uranium could expose a photographic plate without an external
input of energy (thought to be needed to produce uranium ﬂuorescence). Becquerel also showed that the uranium
salt emissions could be affected by a magnetic ﬁeld, which was not true for X-rays.

Pierre and Marie Curie studied the properties of uranium salts with the express purpose of identifying the details
of these emissions. They were the ﬁrst to coin the term “ radioactivity”, meaning the spontaneous emission of
radiation in the form of particles or high energy photons resulting from a nuclear reaction. The major contributions
to the work came from Marie who showed that the amount of radioactivity present was due to the amount of a
speciﬁc element and not due to some chemical reaction. She discovered the element polonium and named it after her
native Poland. Madame Curie shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre and Henri Becquerel.
She won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.

FIGURE 24.2
Pierre and Marie Curie in their lab.

Ernest Rutherford, a later researcher, was able to show there are three different types of radioactive emissions. These
emission types differed in terms of mass, charge, and their ability to penetrate materials. He designated them simply
as alpha (α) emissions, beta (β) emissions, and gamma (γ) emissions.

1082

www.ck12.org

Chapter 24. Nuclear Chemistry

Radioactivity involves the spontaneous emission of material and/or energy from the nucleus of an atom. The
most common radioactive atoms have high atomic numbers and contain a large excess of neutrons. Some typical
radioactive elements are technetium (atomic number 43), promethium (atomic number 61), and all elements atomic
number 84 (polonium) and higher. There are four primary types of emission, either involving the release of a
particle from the nucleus or the release of energy. In many instances, both energy and a particle are produced by the
radioactive event.
It should be noted that some elements considered to be stable do have radioactive isotopes. Carbon-14 is radioactive,
but this isotope is only a small fraction of the total amount of carbon in existence (about one part per trillion carbon
atoms). Hydrogen also has a radioactive isotope known as hydrogen-3 or tritium, again a very small fraction of the
total elemental hydrogen present.

You did what to my hamburger?
Food irradiation is a sensitive subject for many people. The practice involves exposing the food to ionizing radiation
in order to kill harmful bacteria (such as salmonella) that cause sickness. The food is essentially unchanged and
does not lose any nutritive value. Parasites and insect pests are easily destroyed by this process, while bacteria take
longer to kill. Viruses are not affected by the radiation treatment. But don’t worry – the food is not radioactive and
you will not glow in the dark if you eat it.

Nuclear Decay Processes

Radioactive decay involves the emission of a particle and/or energy as one atom changes into another. In most
instances, the atom changes its identity to become a new element. There are four different types of emissions that
occur.

Alpha Emission

Alpha (α) decay involves the release of helium ions from the nucleus of an atom. This ion consists of two protons
and two neutrons and has a 2+ charge. Release of an α-particle produces a new atom that has an atomic number two
less than the original atom and an atomic weight that is four less. A typical alpha decay reaction is the conversion of
uranium-238 to thorium:

1084

238

92U → 234

90Th + 4

2α+

www.ck12.org

Chapter 24. Nuclear Chemistry

We see a decrease of two in the atomic number (uranium to thorium) and a decrease of four in the atomic weight (238
to 234). Usually the emission is not written with atomic number and weight indicated since it is a common particle
whose properties should be memorized. Quite often the alpha emission is accompanied by gamma (γ) radiation, a
form of energy release. Many of the largest elements in the periodic table are alpha-emitters.

FIGURE 24.3
Emission of an alpha particle from the
nucleus.

Beta Emission

Beta (β) decay is a more complicated process. Unlike the α-emission, which simply expels a particle, the β-emission
involves the transformation of a neutron in the nucleus to a proton and an electron. The electron is then ejected from
the nucleus. In the process, the atomic number increases by one while the atomic weight stays the same. As is the
case with α-emissions, β-emissions are often accompanied by γ-radiation.

FIGURE 24.4
Beta emission.

A typical beta decay process involves carbon-14, often used in radioactive dating techniques. The reaction forms
nitrogen-14 and an electron:

6C → 14

7N + 0−1e

1085

24.2. Nuclear Decay Processes

www.ck12.org

Again, the beta emission is usually simply indicated by the Greek letter β; memorization of the process is necessary
in order to follow nuclear calculations in which the Greek letter β without further notation.

Gamma Emission

Gamma (γ) radiation is simply energy. It may be released by itself or more commonly in association with other
radiation events. There is no change of atomic number or atomic weight in a simple γ-emission. Often, an isotope
may produce γ-radiation as a result of a transition in a metastable isotope. This type of isotope may just “settle,” with
a shifting of particles in the nucleus. The composition of the atom is not altered, but the nucleus could be considered
more “comfortable” after the shift. This shift increases the stability of the isotope from the energetically unstable (or
“metastable”) isotope to a more stable form of the nucleus.

Positron Emission

A positron is a positive electron (a form of antimatter). This rare type of emission occurs when a proton is converted
to a neutron and a positron in the nucleus, with ejection of the positron. The atomic number will decrease by one
while the atomic weight does not change. A positron is often designated by β+.
Carbon-11 emits a positron to become boron-11:

6C → 11

5B + 0

Invest in uranium!

Uranium is going to be worth more on the open market after a steep decline in prices several years ago. So people
are out there looking for more uranium. But they are not waving Geiger counters around to ﬁnd this material. All
the surface uranium has been found. Instead, they must study geology, such as the rocks in the picture above. Deep
holes are drilled to explore the underground geology of a site and the rocks obtained are chemically analyzed. No
more clicking –just modern-day geology and chemistry.

Detection of Radioactivity

Radioactivity is determined by measuring the number of decay processes per unit time. Perhaps the easiest way is
simply to determine the number of counts/minute, with each count measuring a single decay process, such as the
emission of an α-particle. A particular isotope may have an activity of 5,000 counts/minute (cpm) while another
isotope might only have 250 cpm. The amount of activity gives a rough indication of the amount of the radioisotope
present –the higher the activity, the more radioactive isotope in the sample.

1087

24.3. Detection of Radioactivity

Units of measurement

www.ck12.org

The curie (Ci) is one measure of the rate of decay (named after Pierre and Marie Curie). One curie is equivalent
to 3.7 × 1010 disintegrations per second. Since this is obviously a large and unwieldy number, radiation is often
expressed in millicuries or microcuries (still very large numbers). Another measure is the becquerel (Bq), named
after Henri Becquerel. The becquerel is deﬁned as an activity of one disintegration/second. Both of these units
are concerned with the disintegration rate of the radioactive isotope and give no indication of dosage to the target
material.
Exposure gives an indication of the amount of radiation that travels through the air. Two factors inﬂuence the amount
of exposure a person may receive –time and intensity. Acute exposure indicates a large amount of radiation received
over a short period of time. Chronic exposure deals with lower levels of exposure over a longer period of time.
Dose equivalence combines the amount of radiation received and the medical effect of that radiation. Calculations
of exposure and dose equivalence are complicated and will not be pursued at this time.

Personal Dosimeters

Measurement of exposure to radioactivity is important for anyone who deals with radioactive materials on a regular
basis. Perhaps the simplest device is a personal dosimeter –a ﬁlm badge that will fog up when exposed to radiation.
The amount of fogging is proportional to the amount of radiation present. These devices are not very sensitive to low
levels of radiation. More sensitive systems use crystals that respond in some way to radioactivity by registering the
number of emissions in a given time. These systems tend to be more sensitive and more reliable than ﬁlm badges.

Geiger Counters

A Geiger counter provides a sensitive means of detecting radioactivity. A tube is ﬁlled with an inert gas, which will
conduct electricity when radiation enters it. When a charged particle comes into the tube, it changes the electrical
potential between the anode and the cathode. This change in potential in the tube produces a change in voltage in

the electrical circuit and registers as a count. Geiger counters are fairly inexpensive and reliable, so they are useful
in a wide range of applications. More complicated types of counters are also available, but are generally used in
sophisticated experiments.

24.4. Half-Life

24.4 Half-Life

• Deﬁne half-life.
• Calculate half-life when given decay data.

We’re putting it where?
Uranium isotopes produce plutonium-239 as a decay product. The plutonium can be used in nuclear weapons and is
a power source for nuclear reactors, which generate electricity. This isotope has a half-life of 24,100 years, causing
concern in regions where radioactive plutonium has accumulated and is stored. At some storage sites, the waste is
slowly leaking into the groundwater and contaminating nearby rivers. The 24,100 year half-life means that it will be
with us for a very long time.

Half-Life

Radioactive materials lose some of their activity each time a decay event occurs. This loss of activity can be estimated
by determining the half-life of an isotope. The half-life is deﬁned as that period of time needed for one-half of a
given quantity of a substance to undergo a change. For a radioisotope, every time a decay event occurs, a count is
detected on the Geiger counter or other measuring device. A speciﬁc isotope might have a total count of 30,000 cpm.
In one hour, the count could be 15,000 cpm (half the original count). So the half-life of that isotope is one hour.
Some isotopes have long half-lives –the half-life of U-234 is 245,000 years. Other isotopes have shorter half-lives.
I-131, used in thyroid scans, has a half-life of 8.02 days.

1090

www.ck12.org

Half-Life Calculations

Chapter 24. Nuclear Chemistry

Information on the half-life of an isotope can be used to calculate how much radioactivity of that isotope will be
present after a certain period of time. There is a formula that allows calculation at any time after the initial count, but
we are just going to look at loss of activity after different half-lives. The isotope I-125 is used in certain laboratory
procedures and has a half-life of 59.4 days. If the initial activity of a sample of I-125 is 32,000 cpm, how much
activity will be present in 178.2 days? We begin by determining how many half-lives are represented by 178.2 days:

Then we simply count activity:

178.2 days

59.4 days/half-life

= 3 half-lives

initial activity (t0) = 32,000 cpm
after one half-life = 16,000 cpm
after two half-lives = 8,000 cpm
after three half-lives = 4,000 cpm

Be sure to keep in mind that the initial count is at time zero (t0) and we subtract from that count at the ﬁrst half-life.
The second half-life has an activity of half the previous count (not the initial count).
For the more mathematically inclined, the following formula can be used to calculate the amount of radioactivity
remaining after a given time:

Nt = N0 × (0.5)number of half-lives

where Nt = activity at time t
N0 = initial activity at time = 0
If we have an initial activity of 42,000 cpm, what will the activity be after four half-lives?

Nt = N0(0.5)4

= (42,000)(0.5)(0.5)(0.5)(0.5)
= 2625 cpm

The graph above illustrates a typical decay curve for a radioactive material. The activity decreases by one-half during
each succeeding half-life.
Half-lives of different elements vary considerably, as shown in Table 24.1:

We have talked about the activity and decay of individual isotopes. In the real world, there is a decay chain that takes
place until a stable end-product is produced. For U-238, the chain is a long one, with a mix of isotopes having very
different half-lives. The end of the chain resides in lead, a stable element that does not decay further.

Easing Aches and Pains
Sitting in a hot bath or spa has always been a great prescription for dealing with sore muscles. People used
to believe that it was even more beneﬁcial to immerse themselves in radioactive hot springs and drink water
containing radioactive materials (some still do). In the early 1900s, people spent millions of dollars on treatments
and “radioactive water” with the belief that all of their ills would be taken care of. Radioactivity in the water was
usually due to radon gas that leaked up from deep underground, formed by decay of other radioisotopes. If you’re
feeling sore, ﬁnd a hot pool and sit back and relax.

Background Radiation

We are all exposed to a small amount of radiation in our daily lives. This background radiation comes from
naturally occurring sources and from human-produced radiation. Exposure to X-rays and nuclear medicine isotopes,
ground sources, and cosmic radiation account for almost half of the background exposure of the average American.
Radon gas, formed from the decay of uranium and thorium isotopes, is responsible for a little over half the total
amount of background radiation. See Table 24.2 for background sources.

The Problem of Radon

Small amounts of uranium and thorium are found in the soil of a large number of areas in the U.S. When radioactive
isotopes of these elements decay, radon is one of the products formed. Radon is a colorless, odorless gas and is
chemically inert, as it is one of the noble gases.
Radon is also radioactive and can easily be inhaled into the lungs. Over time, this internal radon exposure can lead
to the development of lung cancer. The incidence of lung cancer in smokers exposed to radon is much higher than
that in non-smokers exposed to radon since smoking has already produced some lung damage, and the radon simply
makes the damage worse. Radon exposure is highest in homes lacking good air circulation to move the gas out of
the residence. There are a number of inexpensive approaches to decreasing your exposure to radon. A good start is
to test your living area for radon with a radon test kit.

24.6 Nuclear Fission Processes

• Deﬁne nuclear ﬁssion.
• Give examples of nuclear ﬁssion processes.

An Unexpected Result
Nuclear ﬁssion was ﬁrst discovered by two German scientists, Fritz Strassman and Otto Hahn, in the 1930s. They
began their work by bombarding uranium with neutrons, hoping to create larger elements. Instead, they were very
surprised to ﬁnd Ba-141, a much smaller element. They immediately contacted a fellow scientist in the ﬁeld, Lise
Meitner, who carried out calculations to demonstrate that ﬁssion had taken place.

Nuclear Fission

Radioactive decay by the release of alpha or beta particles is not the only way new isotopes are formed. When a
neutron collides with a nucleus the nucleus splits into two isotopes, each of which is roughly half the mass of the
original atom. A small amount of mass is “left over” and released as energy, as predicted by Einstein’s famous
equation E = mc2, that relates mass and energy. This process is known as nuclear ﬁssion. The neutron must be a
“slow” neutron, traveling at a speed that is approximately that of the molecules of a gas at the same temperature in
the system producing the neutrons. High-speed (“fast”) neutrons will not result in nuclear ﬁssion.
The example above illustrates the basic nuclear ﬁssion process. A neutron (generally produced by some controlled
process, not usually a natural event) collides with an atom of U-235. Momentarily, a U-236 atom forms which
then splits into two smaller atoms (Kr-93 and Ba-141) in the diagram. This process results in the release of three
new neutrons, which can then initiate ﬁssion reactions with more atoms. We will see later how this propagation of
neutrons can be employed in a reactor for the generation of electricity.

1097

24.6. Nuclear Fission Processes

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 24.10
Fission of a uranium nucleus produced by
collision with a neutron.

An extended version of this process can be seen in the ﬁgure below. Not every collision of a neutron with U-235
results in a ﬁssion reaction. A neutron from the initial ﬁssion process may strike an atom of U-238, which does
not continue the process. Another neutron may not collide with a nucleus and is lost in the environment. However,
a third neutron produced from the initial collision can collide with more U-235 and continue the chain reaction to
produce more neutrons.
Typical nuclear ﬁssion reactions balance in terms of mass. The total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass
of the products:

235
92U + 1

0n → 92

36Kr + 142

56Ba + 21

0n + energy

There are a total of 236 mass units on the left of the equation and 236 mass units on the right. In the same manner,
we see 92 protons on the left and 92 on the right. The energy that is released is the binding energy that holds the
nucleus together.

24.7 Nuclear Power Generation

• List sources for electrical power in the United States.
• Describe how a nuclear power plant generates electricity.

When Things Go Awry

On Wednesday, March 28, 1979, the residents of Middleton, PA woke up to a very scary situation. A nuclear power
plant near the town had experienced a series of malfunctions that led to the release of some radioactive gases into
the atmosphere, along with a partial meltdown of the reactor core. Fortunately, follow-up studies have shown that
there were no health effects on workers or the general public. A thorough investigation was conducted that led to
signiﬁcant improvements in safety and operations of these power plants. One of the two reactors was shut down
completely, but the other one is still in operation and will be permanently deactivated in 2014.

Nuclear Power Generation

The generation of electricity is critical for operation of businesses, health care delivery, schools, homes, and other
areas requiring the use of electrical power. According to 2011 statistics, coal is used for 42% of the total power
generated, with natural gas being employed for another 25%. Nuclear power plants are employed in about 19% of
the cases, with renewable energy sources supplying the last 13%. All of these fuels are used to heat water to generate
steam. The steam then turns a turbine to generate electricity.
The diagram 24.12 shows the layout of a typical nuclear power plant. The radioactive rods are in the red container
along with water, which is heated to steam. The energy for this heat comes from ﬁssion reactions of uranium. The
steam passes through the turbine and causes the turbine to spin, generating electricity. As the steam condenses, it is

1101

24.7. Nuclear Power Generation

run through a cooling tower to lower its temperature. The water then recirculates through the reactor core to be used
again.
The control rods play an important role in the modulation of the nuclear chain reaction (usually a collision of a
neutron with uranium). Each collision produces more neutrons than were present initially. If left unsupervised, the
reaction would soon get out of control. Rods are commonly made of boron or a number of metals and metal alloys.
The purpose of the control rods is to absorb neutrons to regulate the rate of the chain reaction so that the water does
not overheat and destroy the reactor.

Schematic for a nuclear power plant.

Nuclear power is also used to propel ships. The turbine can be connected to a propeller system. The rotating turbine
shaft will turn the propeller to move the ship.

24.8 Nuclear Fusion

• Deﬁne nuclear fusion.
• Describe nuclear fusion reactions.

How are elements born?

A number of reactions take place in the sun that cannot be duplicated on Earth. Some of these reactions involve the
formation of large elements from smaller ones. So far, we have only been able to observe formation of very small
elements here on Earth. The reaction sequence observed appears to be the following: Hydrogen-1 atoms collide
to form the larger hydrogen isotopes, hydrogen-2 (deuterium) and hydrogen-3 (tritium). In the process, positrons
and gamma rays are formed. The positrons will collide with any available electrons and annihilate, producing more
gamma rays. In the process, tremendous amounts of energy are produced to keep us warm and continue supplying
reactions.

Nuclear Fusion

In contrast to nuclear ﬁssion, which results in smaller isotopes being formed from larger ones, the goal of nuclear
fusion is to produce larger materials from the collision of smaller atoms. The forcing of the smaller atoms together
results in tighter packing and the release of energy. As seen in Figure 24.14, energy is released in the formation
of the larger atom, helium (He) from the fusion of hydrogen-2 and hydrogen-3 as well as from the expulsion of a
neutron.

This release of energy is what drives research on fusion reactors today. If such a reaction could be accomplished
efﬁciently on Earth, it could provide a clean source of nuclear energy. Unlike ﬁssion reactions, nuclear fusion does
not produce radioactive products that represent hazards to living systems.
Nuclear fusion reactions in the laboratory have been extraordinarily difﬁcult to achieve. Extremely high temperatures
(in the millions of degrees) are required. Methods must be developed to force the atoms together and hold them
together long enough to react. The neutrons released during the fusion reactions can interact with atoms in the reactor
and convert them to radioactive materials. There has been some success in the ﬁeld of nuclear fusion reactions, but
the journey to feasible fusion power is still a long and uncertain one.

• Deﬁne penetrating ability.
• Describe the penetrating ability of different radioactive emissions.

What kind of pig?
The container pictured above stores a radioisotope that will be administered to a patient as part of a medical
treatment. The isotope is stored in a lead container that blocks the radiation from escaping and causing exposure to
people. This lead container is called a “pig”, a term long used for referring to castings of lead or other metals. The
origin of the term is not clear, but was probable ﬁrst applied to these containers by the people who made them.

Penetrating Ability of Emissions

The various emissions will differ considerably in their ability to go through matter, known as their penetrating
ability. The α-particle has the least penetrating power since it is the largest and slowest emission. It can be blocked
by a sheet of paper or a human hand. Beta particles are more penetrating than alpha particles, but can be stopped by
a thin sheet of aluminum. Of the three basic types of emissions, gamma particle are the most penetrating. A thick
lead shield is required to stop gamma emissions. Positrons represent a special case in that they annihilate when they
come in contact with electrons. The collision of a positron and an electron results in the formation of two gamma
emissions that go 180 degrees away from each other.
Blocking of alpha particles can easily be accomplished by as little as 10 mm plastic or paper. Beta emissions
represent a somewhat different situation. The negative charge on a beta particle has the potential for activating the
element being used to block the radiation. Lead and tungsten are large atoms with many protons and neutrons in
their nuclei. While the beta electron may be blocked, the target material could become irradiated in the process.
High-density materials are much more effective protection against gamma emissions than low-density ones. Gamma

• Describe the effects of ionizing radiation on humans.

That’s in our food?
Bacterial contamination in our food often makes the news. There are many bacteria present on raw food, especially
raw meat. Campylobacter (pictured above), salmonella, and other microorganisms can be found, even after cooking
if the meat has not been sufﬁciently exposed to the heat. Ionizing radiation can be used to disrupt the DNA-RNA-
protein synthesis cycle that allows the bacteria to reproduce. Cobalt-60 is a common radiation source, as is cesium-
137. But, just to be safe, order that burger well-done.

Effects of Radiation

In order to better understand how cellular radiation damage occurs, we need to take a quick review of how the cell
functions. DNA in the nucleus is responsible for protein synthesis and for regulation of many cellular functions. In
the process of protein synthesis, DNA partially unfolds to produce messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA leaves the
nucleus and interacts with ribosomes, transfer RNA, amino acids, and other cellular constituents in the cytoplasm.
Through a complex series of reactions, proteins are produced to carry out a number of specialized processes within
the organism. Anything that disturbs this ﬂow of reactions can produce damage to the cell.
The major effect of ionizing radiation on the cell is the disruption of the DNA strand. With the DNA structure
damaged, the cell cannot reproduce in its normal fashion. Protein synthesis is affected, as are a number of processes
necessary for proper cell function. One common effect is the generation of cancer cells. These cells have an

abnormal structure due to the damaged DNA. In addition, they usually grow rapidly since the normal control
processes regulating cell growth have been changed by the altered composition of the DNA. Tissue damage is
also common in people with severe exposure to radiation.

Effects of Radiation on Humans

We can see two general types of effects when humans are exposed to radiation. Low-level exposure can lead to
development of cancer. The regulatory processes regulating cell growth are disrupted, leading to uncontrolled growth
of abnormal cells. Acute exposure can produce nausea, weakness, skin burns, and internal tissue damage. Cancer
patients receiving radiation therapy experience these symptoms, but the radiation is targeted to a speciﬁc site in the
body so that the damage is primarily to the cancer cells and the patient is able to recover from the exposure.

• List radioisotopes that are used in medical diagnosis and/or treatment.

Why am I moving so slowly?
The molecule pictured above is thyroxine, a compound produced by the thyroid gland. This molecule regulates
how the body uses energy. In a condition known as hypothyroidism, the thyroid makes less thyroxine than normal.
A person with this disease feels tired all the time and often puts on weight. Treatment with thyroid hormone
supplements takes care of the problem.

Radioisotopes in Medical Diagnosis and Treatment

Radioisotopes are widely used to diagnose disease and as effective treatment tools. For diagnosis, the isotope is
administered and then located in the body using a scanner of some sort. The decay product (often gamma emission)
can be located and the intensity measured. The amount of isotope taken up by the body can then give information as
to the extent of the medical problem.
An isotope of iodine (I-131) is used in both the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. The thyroid will normally
absorb iodine to produce the iodine-containing thyroid hormones. An overactive thyroid gland will absorb the
radioactive material which can then destroy excess thyroid tissue or any cancer of the thyroid. The material is
sometimes used to image cancers in other parts of the body.
Technetium-99m is perhaps the most widely used radioisotope in diagnosis and treatment (the “m” stands for
metastable). This isotope decays to Tc-99 and a gamma emission of low intensity, making the radiation damage
fairly negligible. The half-life is about six hours, so it will remain in the body for some time. Tc-99m can be used
to look at cardiac damage. The isotope ﬂows in the blood stream; if there is less blood ﬂow in the heart, there will
be less isotope concentrated in the heart muscle. Similar information can be obtained for blood ﬂow in the brain.
Isotopes can be very useful in scans to locate cancer cells. This patient has multiple tumors that have spread
(metastasized) from the main tumor. A radioisotope has been attached to antibodies that bind to speciﬁc cancer
cells. The very dark spots in the armpits, neck, and groin represent areas where tumor cells exist.
Many other examples could be presented. There are presently over 25 different isotopes in use for diagnosis and
treatment. A very partial list can be seen in the Table 24.3.

24.12 PET Scans

• Describe the basic approach used in PET scans.
• Describe applications for PET scans.

Can you really feel emotions in your heart?
Does your heart beat faster when you are scared? Do you have a tender feeling in your heart for that “special
person”? Sorry to disappoint you, but that is actually simply a response generated by the brain. Scientists tell us
that the seat of emotions is in the brain. Using PET scans and other techniques, they are looking at speciﬁc areas of
the brain that process and store information dealing with strong emotions. They haven’t localized the love site, but
they’re working on it.

PET Scans

One of the more interesting and useful approaches to radioisotope use in medicine is positron emission tomography
(PET), often referred to as a PET scan. This technique is especially useful in studying the processes in the brain.
Many compounds do not enter the brain because of what is called the “ blood-brain barrier,” a ﬁltering system
to block material from being transported into brain tissue. This mechanism serves to protect the brain from a wide
variety of harmful substances.
In order to get a good picture of what is happening in the brain, radiolabels are attached to different compounds that
will enter the brain. Since the brain uses about 25% of the glucose found in the body, this molecule is often labeled
with a positron emitter such as F-18 (half-life of 109.8 minutes) to study brain function in general. Other labels are
attached to speciﬁc compounds that will localize in certain areas of the brain to look at speciﬁc structures.
The PET scanner detects gamma emissions from the collision of a positron with an electron (see Figure 24.18).
As the positron is released from the nucleus of the atom, it will collide with an electron. This meeting of matter
(electron) with antimatter (positron) results in annihilation of both particles and the release of two gamma emissions
that are 180° apart from one another. The apparatus detects these gamma rays and stores the data in a computer.
From this information, a detailed picture of the brain can be developed.
One useful application of PET scanning is in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. This debilitating memory loss
condition primarily occurs in elderly individuals. A protein known as beta-amyloid gradually forms deposits in the
brain called plaque. Memory loss and impaired movement are the result of the plaque growth.

sions.

The compound known as Pittsburgh compound B is often used to identify areas of plaque in the brain. The radiolabel
is C-11 (half-life is 20.38 minutes).

FIGURE 24.19
Pittsburgh compound B used in diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s disease.

The label attaches to plaque and can be observed using PET scans.
The computer translates the amount of isotope into a color scale, with red indicating a high level of radioactivity and
yellow indicating somewhat less activity. We can see from the scans that the cognitively healthy individual shows
the presence of very little plaque in the brain (see Figure 24.20). The individual with Alzheimer’s demonstrates high
concentrations of the beta-amyloid in numerous areas of the brain.
Other studies have been done looking at brain function in drug addicts. One of the theories about drug addiction
involves the amount of dopamine action in the brain (a chemical that is a part of the system to transport nerve
impulses). Studies of dopamine action have been helpful in understanding addictive processes.
The Figure 24.21 shows the binding of chemicals that attach to dopamine receptors. The non-addicted individuals
have large numbers of receptors for dopamine. The addicted persons show less binding to these receptors, indicating
that fewer receptors are present. Since dopamine is somehow linked with the sense of pleasure, these data may help
to bring a better understanding to the biochemical processes in drug addiction.

25.1 Organic Chemistry

• Deﬁne organic chemistry.
• List characteristics of organic molecules.

How many molecules are there?
How many carbon-containing molecules are there? The current estimate is around 20 million different organic
compounds that we know about. Why the uncertainty? Every day, scientists are coming up with new compounds.
Some of these materials are of interest for a research project, while others are destined to be developed for a
commercial market. As soon think we know how many organic compounds exist, more are discovered and our
number quickly becomes out of date.

Organic Chemistry

At one time in history, it was thought that only living things were capable of synthesizing the carbon-containing
compounds present in cells. For that reason, the term organic was applied to those compounds. Eventually it was
proved that carbon-containing compounds could be synthesized from inorganic substances, but the term organic
has remained. Currently, organic compounds are deﬁned as covalently bonded compounds containing carbon,
excluding carbonates and oxides. By this deﬁnition, compounds such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and sodium carbonate
(Na2CO3) are considered to be inorganic. Organic chemistry is the study of all organic compounds.
Organic chemistry is a very vast and complex subject. There are millions of known organic compounds, which
is far more than the number of inorganic compounds. The reason lies within the uniqueness of carbon’s structure
and bonding capabilities. Carbon has four valence electrons and therefore makes four separate covalent bonds in
compounds. Carbon has the ability to bond to itself repeatedly, making long chains of carbon atoms as well as

1121

25.1. Organic Chemistry

www.ck12.org

ringed structures. These bonds can be single, double, or triple covalent bonds. Carbon readily makes covalent bonds
with other elements, primarily hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, and several other nonmetals. The ﬁgure below
shows ball-and-stick models of two of the many organic compounds.

FIGURE 25.1
Stearic acid is composed of many carbon
(black) and hydrogen (white) atoms, along
with two oxygen (red) atoms.

FIGURE 25.2
Methionine is composed of carbon, hydro-
gen, oxygen, nitrogen (blue), and sulfur
(yellow) atoms.

The related ﬁeld of biochemistry overlaps to some extent with organic chemistry. Biochemistry is the study of the
chemistry of living systems. Many biochemical compounds are considered to be organic chemicals. Both of the
molecules shown above are biochemical materials in terms of their use in the body, but organic chemicals in terms
of their structure and chemical reactivity.

Rethinking Transportation

As our country looks at the prospect of oil shortages in the future, we are searching for alternative transportation
fuel sources. One very viable possibility is propane gas. Power and acceleration for propane-powered vehicles are
comparable to gasoline-powered vehicles and fuel efﬁciency is greater. Propane has a higher octane rating than
regular gasoline, leading to much longer engine life. When properly structured, propane engines can produce lower
amounts of air pollution. We are seeing a growing use of propane in buses, trucks, and police cars. Pictured above
is a prototype of a minibus that will run on propane fuel. Maybe your next car will burn propane.

Straight-Chain Alkanes

Hydrocarbons

A hydrocarbon is an organic compound that is made up of only carbon and hydrogen. A hydrocarbon is the simplest
kind of organic molecule and is the basis for all other more complex organic compounds. Hydrocarbons can be
divided into two broad categories. Aliphatic hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that do not contain the benzene group
or a benzene ring. Aromatic hydrocarbons contain one or more benzene rings. In this concept, we will discuss the
aliphatic hydrocarbons.

1124

Alkanes

Chapter 25. Organic Chemistry

An alkane is a hydrocarbon in which there are only single covalent bonds. The simplest alkane is methane, with the
molecular formula CH4. The carbon is the central atom and makes four single covalent bonds to hydrogen atoms.

FIGURE 25.3
Methane is the simplest hydrocarbon and
is shown with a structural
formula, a
ball-and-stick model, and a space-ﬁlling
model.

The next simplest alkane is called ethane (C2H6) and consists of two carbon atoms with a single covalent bond
between them. Each carbon is then able to bond to three hydrogen atoms. The alkane series progresses from there,
increasing the length of the carbon chain by one carbon at a time. Structural formulas for ethane, propane (C3H8),
and butane (C4H10) are shown below.

These alkanes are called straight-chain alkanes because the carbon atoms are connected in one continuous chain with
no branches. Naming and writing structural and molecular formulas for the straight-chain alkanes is straightforward.
The name of each alkane consists of a preﬁx that speciﬁes the number of carbon atoms and the ending –ane. The
molecular formula follows the pattern of CnH2n+2 where n is the number of carbons in the chain. The Table 25.1
lists the ﬁrst ten members of the alkane series.

Note that the table shows a variation of a structural formula called a condensed structural formula. In this formula,
the covalent bonds are understood to exist between each carbon and the hydrogens associated with it, as well as
between carbon atoms. This table also shows that the boiling points of the alkanes steadily increase as the length of
the carbon chain increases. This is due to an increase in the strength of the intermolecular attractive forces and is a
general feature of other organic molecules as well.

25.3 Branched Alkanes

• List the rules for naming branched alkanes.
• Use the rules to name branched alkane structures.

Who is my great-aunt?
Tracing your family tree can be both fun and exciting. But, it helps to know the exact names of your family members
in order to do this correctly. Just a ﬁrst name or middle name or last name is not enough. A traceable family tree
is one in which all relatives are carefully and precisely identiﬁed. After all, you would prefer that great-great-great-
uncle to be royalty and not a horse thief.

Branched Alkanes

Beginning with butane, there is an alternate structure possible that is not a straight chain. The structural formulas
below show a structure with a three-carbon chain that has a –CH3 group attached to the middle carbon.

The name of this molecule is 2-methylpropane. The molecular formula is still C4H10, which is the same formula
as butane. A structural isomer is one of multiple molecules that have the same molecular formula, but different
structural formulas. Butane and 2-methylpropane are structural isomers.

1127

25.3. Branched Alkanes

www.ck12.org

2-methylpropane is an example of a type of alkane called a branched alkane. The IUPAC system of nomenclature
for branched alkanes follows a set of steps which will be applied to the example molecule below.

1. Find the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule. This is called the parent chain. In the

example, the longest chain is eight carbon atoms and so the parent hydrocarbon is octane.

2. Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain. To do this, start at the end that will give the smallest numbers
possible to the carbon atoms where the branches originate. In the example above, the branches are on carbons
3 and 5 when the chain is numbered left-to-right. If it were to be numbered right-to-left, the branches would
be on carbons 4 and 6, so the left-to-right order is preferable.

3. The atoms attached to the parent chain are called substituents. A substituent that is a hydrocarbon is called
an alkyl group. The names of alkyl groups use the same preﬁxes as the alkanes, but with a –yl sufﬁx. So a
1-carbon alkyl group is a methyl group, a 2-carbon alkyl group is an ethyl group, and so on. The substituents
are named by placing the number from the parent carbon chain in front of the name of the substituent. In the
current example, we have 3-methyl and 4-ethyl substituents.

4. Use a preﬁx to indicate the appearance of more than one of the same substituent in the structural formula.
Two of the same group is tri-, three is tri-, four is tetra-, etc. For example, if methyl groups were attached to
both carbons 2 and 3, that part of the name would be 2, 3-dimethyl-. This rule does not apply to the current
structure above.

5. Multiple different substituents are listed in alphabetical order. Ignore any of the preﬁxes from rule 4. In the

current example, the 5-ethyl- comes before the 3-methyl.

6. Commas are used to separate multiple numbers. Hyphens come between the number and the name of a
substituent. The parent name comes immediately after the last substituent. There are no blank spaces in the
name.

The correct name for the above structure according to the IUPAC system is 5-ethyl-3-methyloctane.

Better Than A Hacksaw
One of the most effective ways to cut metal is with an oxy-acetylene torch. Very high temperatures are obtained when
acetylene burns in oxygen. Mixed 1:1 with oxygen, a temperature of over 3000°C can be achieved. The amount of
energy released is high –the net heat of combustion is 1300 kJ/mole. Safety precautions need to be observed since
the gas is very explosive. For welding and cutting, the oxy-acetylene torch is one of the best ways to go.

Alkenes and Alkynes

An alkene is a hydrocarbon with one or more carbon-carbon double covalent bonds. The simplest alkene is
composed of two carbon atoms and is called ethene (shown below). Each carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms
in addition to the double bond between them.

The hybridization of each carbon atom is sp2 with trigonal planar geometry. All the atoms of the molecule lay
in one plane. Like the alkane series, the names of alkenes are based on the number of atoms in the parent chain.

Chapter 25. Organic Chemistry

Naming follows the same rules as for alkanes, with the addition of using a number to indicate the location of the
double bond. Propene (C3H6) has three carbons total, while butene (C4H8) has four. The general formula for alkenes
with one double bond is CnH2n. Alkenes are called unsaturated hydrocarbons. An unsaturated hydrocarbon is a
hydrocarbon that contains less than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms that can possibly bond with the number
of carbon atoms present.
The location of the carbon-carbon double bond can vary. The 4-carbon alkene generic name is butene. Since the
double bond can be located in more than one place, we have 1-butene and 2-butene:

Molecules with multiple double bonds are also quite common. The formula below shows a four-carbon chain with
double bonds between carbons 1 and 2 and between carbons 3 and 4. This molecule is called 1,3-butadiene.

Alkynes

An alkyne is a hydrocarbon with one or more carbon-carbon triple covalent bonds. The simplest alkyne consists of
two carbon atoms and is called ethyne (common name: acetylene).

The ethyne molecule is linear, with sp hybridization for each carbon atom. The general formula of alkynes with one
triple bond is CnH2n−2. Alkynes are also unsaturated hydrocarbons. Other alkynes exist, such as 2-pentyne:

25.5 Isomers

• Deﬁne isomer.
• Deﬁne structural isomer and give examples.
• Deﬁne geometric isomer and give examples.

What difference does the isomer make?
As we get more into the complexities of organic chemistry, we will see how molecular shape affects reactions.
One common reaction for alkenes is the addition of hydrogen across the double bond to form the corresponding
alkane. Because of the geometry of the reaction, the different 2-butene shapes have different heats of reaction.
These differences are important both from a theoretical standpoint as well as from the point of view of industrial
applications. Greater energy requirements mean a higher cost and a more expensive product.

Isomers

One of the interesting aspects of organic chemistry is that it is three-dimensional. A molecule can have a shape
in space that may contribute to its properties. Molecules can differ in the way the atoms are arranged – the same
combination of atoms can be assembled in more than one way. These compounds are known as isomers. Isomers
are molecules with the same molecular formulas, but different arrangements of atoms. We will look at some isomer
possibilities for alkanes and alkenes.

Structural Isomers

A structural isomer is one in which two or more or organic compounds have the same molecular formulas but
different structures. The two pentane molecules below differ only in the location of the methyl group.

1133

25.5. Isomers

www.ck12.org

Alkenes can also demonstrate structural isomerism. In alkenes, there are multiple structural isomers based on where
in the chain the double bond occurs. The condensed structural formulas of 1-butene and 2-butene show this.

The number in the name of the alkene refers to the lowest numbered carbon in the chain that is part of the double
bond.

Geometric Isomers

With a molecule such as 2-butene, a different type of isomerism called geometric isomerism can be observed.
Geometric isomers are isomers in which the order of atom bonding is the same but the arrangement of atoms in
space is different. The double bond in an alkene is not free to rotate because of the nature of the pi bond. Therefore,
there are two different ways to construct the 2-butene molecule. The image below shows the two geometric isomers,
called cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene.

The cis isomer has the two single hydrogen atoms on the same side of the molecule, while the trans isomer has
them on opposite sides of the molecule. In both molecules, the bonding order of the atoms is the same. In order for
geometric isomers to exist, there must be a rigid structure in the molecule to prevent free rotation around a bond. If
the double bond in an alkene was capable of rotating, the two geometric isomers above would not exist. In addition,
the two carbon atoms must each have two different groups attached in order for there to be geometric isomers.
Propene has no geometric isomers because one of the carbon atoms has two single hydrogens bonded to it.

1134

www.ck12.org

Chapter 25. Organic Chemistry

Physical and chemical properties of geometric isomers are generally different. While cis-2-butene is a polar molecule,
trans-2-butene is nonpolar. Heat or irradiation with light can be used to bring about the conversion of one geometric
isomer to another. The input of energy must be large enough to break the pi bond between the two carbon atoms,
which is weaker than the sigma bond. At that point, the now single bond is free to rotate and the isomers can
interconvert.
As with alkenes, alkynes display structural isomerism beginning with 1-butyne and 2-butyne. However, there are no
geometric isomers with alkynes because there is only one other group bonded to the carbon atoms that are involved
in the triple bond.

• Structural and geometric isomers are deﬁned.
• Examples of alkane and alkene isomers are given.

25.6 Cyclic Hydrocarbons

• Deﬁne cyclic hydrocarbon.
• Deﬁne cycloalkane.
• Draw structures and name typical cyclic hydrocarbons.

From Benzene To Balloons
Although cyclohexane can be isolated from petroleum products, a major source of this chemical is the hydrogenation
of benzene. Much of the cyclohexane produced is used to manufacture intermediates for the production of nylon.
The nylon balloons pictured above no doubt had their start in a chemical plant where hydrogen gas and benzene were
reacted at high temperatures to form cyclohexane. This cycloalkane then undergoes nitration to begin the process of
forming the long strands of nylon that can be made into balloons, ropes, clothing, and many other useful products.

Cyclic Hydrocarbons

A cyclic hydrocarbon is a hydrocarbon in which the carbon chain joins to itself in a ring. A cycloalkane is a
cyclic hydrocarbon in which all of the carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds. Like other alkanes, cycloalkanes are
saturated compounds. Cycloalkanes have the general formula of CnH2n. The simplest cycloalkane is cyclopropane,
a three-carbon ring.
The structural formulas of cyclic hydrocarbons can be represented in multiple ways, two of which are shown above.
Each atom can be shown as in the structure on the left from the Figure 25.4. A convenient shorthand is to omit the

element symbols and only show the shape, as in the triangle on the right. Carbon atoms are understood to be the
vertices of the triangle.
The carbon atoms in cycloalkanes are still sp3 hybridized, with an ideal bond angle of 109.5°. However, an
examination of the cyclopropane structure shows that the triangular structure results in a C-C-C bond angle of
60°. This deviation from the ideal angle is called ring strain and makes cyclopropane a fairly unstable and reactive
molecule. Ring strain is decreased for cyclobutane, with a bond angle of 90°, but is still signiﬁcant. Cyclopentane
has a bond angle of about 108°C. This minimal ring strain for cyclopentane makes it a more stable compound.

Cyclohexane is a six-carbon cycloalkane shown below.

All three of the depictions of cyclohexane are somewhat misleading because the molecule is not planar. In order to
reduce the ring strain and attain a bond angle of approximately 109.5°, the molecule is puckered. The puckering of

1138

www.ck12.org

Chapter 25. Organic Chemistry

the ring means that every other carbon atom is above and below the plane. The Figure 25.5 shows two possibilities
for the puckered cyclohexane molecule. Each of the structures is called a conformation. The conformation on the
right is called the boat conformation, while the one on the left is called the chair conformation.

FIGURE 25.5
Chair (left) and boat (right) conformations
for cyclohexane.

Larger cycloalkanes also exist, but are less common. Cyclic hydrocarbons may also be unsaturated. A cycloalkene
is a cyclic hydrocarbon with at least one carbon-carbon double bond. A cycloalkyne is a cyclic hydrocarbon with
at least one carbon-carbon triple bond. Shown below are the simpliﬁed structural formulas for cyclohexene and
cyclooctyne.

25.7 Aromatic Hydrocarbons

• Describe the structure of the benzene ring.
• List the nomenclature rules for aromatic compounds.
• Use the rules to name aromatic compounds.

Can a dream affect reality?

Friedrich Kekulé was a German chemist in the 1800s. He supposedly was thinking about the structure of the benzene
ring as he fell asleep. While asleep, he dreamed of a snake eating the ring’s tail. He used this idea to propose the
cyclic structure for benzene. Whether or not he actually had this dream has been debated ever since. Whatever really
happened, the tale has persisted until today.

Aromatic Hydrocarbons

Benzene is the parent compound of the large family of organic compounds known as aromatic compounds. Unlike
cyclohexane, benzene only contains six hydrogen atoms, giving the impression that the ring is unsaturated and each
carbon atom participates in one double bond. Two different structures with alternating single and double bonds
around the ring can be written for benzene.

1141

25.7. Aromatic Hydrocarbons

www.ck12.org

In benzene, the true bonding between carbon atoms is neither a single nor a double bond. Rather, all of the bonds
are a hybrid of a single and double bond. In benzene, the pi bonding electrons are free to move completely around
the ring. Delocalized electrons are electrons that are not conﬁned to the bond between two atoms, but are instead
allowed to move between three or more. The delocalization of the electrons in benzene can best be shown by showing
benzene with a ring inside the hexagon, with the hydrogen atoms understood.

Delocalization of the electrons makes for a more stable molecule than a similar molecule that does not have
delocalized electrons. Benzene is a more stable and less reactive compound than straight-chain hexenes. The sp2
hybridization of the carbon atoms results in a planar molecule as opposed to the puckered structure of cyclohexane.
Benzene rings are common in a great number of natural substances and biomolecules. The ﬁgure below shows the
structural formulas for vanilla and naphthalene. Naphthalens is a chemical which is commonly used in mothballs.

Nomenclature of Aromatic Compounds

The simplest aromatic compounds are benzene rings with one substituent replacing one of the hydrogen atoms. If
this substituent is an alkyl group, it is named ﬁrst, followed in one word with “benzene”. The molecule shown below
is therefore called ethylbenzene.

Substituents can be groups other than alky groups. If a chlorine atom were substituted for a hydrogen, the name
becomes chlorobenzene. An –NH2 group is called an amino group, so the corresponding molecule is called
aminobenzene, often referred to as aniline. An –NO2 group is called a nitro group and so the third example below is
nitrobenzene.

If more than one substituent is present, their location relative to each other can be indicated by numbering the
positions on the benzene ring.

The number of the carbon location then precedes the name of the substituent in the overall name, with the numbers
separated by a comma. As with branched alkanes, the system requires that the numbers be the lowest possible

1143

25.7. Aromatic Hydrocarbons

www.ck12.org

and that preﬁxes be used for more than one of the same substituent. If there are different substituents, the ﬁrst in
alphabetical order is given the lower number and listed ﬁrst. The structures below are called 1,2-dimethylbenzene
and 1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene.

An alternate system for naming di-substituted benzene rings uses three different preﬁxes: ortho, meta, and para. If
two groups are in the ortho position, they are on adjacent carbon atoms. The meta positioning refers to being in a 1,
3 arrangement. The para positioning refers to being in a 1, 4 arrangement. Shown below are the three possibilities
for dimethylbenzene, also called xylene.

Lastly, a benzene ring missing one hydrogen atom (−C6H5) can itself be considered the substituent on a longer chain
of carbon atoms. That group is called a phenyl group and so the molecule below is called 2-phenylbutane.

Is the hole in the ozone getting bigger?
A class of simple alkyl halides called chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) was once very widely used in aerosol sprays and
as refrigerants. One such example is CCl3F, or trichloroﬂuoromethane. Unfortunately, CFCs are harmful to the
ozone layer of our upper atmosphere. Ozone is critical in limiting the amount of damaging ultraviolet radiation that
reaches the Earth. CFCs react with the ozone and damage it, leaving the earth less protected.
Beginning in the late 1970’s, ozone depletion was recognized as a signiﬁcant environmental issue. The most dramatic
decrease in ozone occurs seasonally over the continent of Antarctica. The size and duration of the ozone hole steadily
increased, with the largest hole recorded in 2006. Fortunately, most countries have recognized the danger of CFCs
and dramatically curtailed their use in recent years. It is hoped that ozone depletion will slow and that the ozone
layer may eventually be restored to its earlier levels.

Alkyl Halides

An alkyl halide is an organic compound in which one or more halogen atoms are substituted for one or more
hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon. The general formulas for organic molecules with functional groups use the letter
R to stand for the rest of the molecule outside of the functional group. Because there are four possible halogen
atoms (ﬂuorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) that can act as the functional group, we use the general formula R−X
to represent an alkyl halide. The rules for naming simple alkyl halides are listed below.

1. Name the parent compound by ﬁnding the longest continuous carbon atom chain that also contains the halogen.
Add a preﬁx for the particular halogen atom. The preﬁxes for each of the four halogens are ﬂuoro-, chloro-,
bromo-, and iodo-. If more than one kind of halogen atom is present, put them in alphabetical order. If there
is more than one of the same halogen on a given carbon atom, use the preﬁxes di-, tri-, or tetra- before the
preﬁx for the halogen.

2. As with hydrocarbons, number the carbon chain in a way that makes the sum of halogen numbers as low as
possible. If different halogens are in equivalent positions, give the lower number to the one that comes ﬁrst in
alphabetical order.

3. Add the numerical preﬁx into the name before the halogen preﬁx.

1146

www.ck12.org

Chapter 25. Organic Chemistry

4. Separate numbers with commas and separate numbers from names or preﬁxes with a hyphen. There are no

spaces in the name.

Listed below are some examples of names and structural formulas of a few alkyl halides.

Note that for the structure based on methane, no number needs to be used since there is only one carbon atom. In
the third example, the chloro is listed ﬁrst alphabetically and the chain is numbered so that the sum of the numbers
is as low as possible.

Uses of Alkyl Halides

Alkyl halides are often used as synthetic intermediates in the laboratory. Although these compounds were once
widely used as dry cleaning solvents, coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners, and propellants in hairsprays
and deodorants, increasing awareness of their toxicity has led to a wide-spread decrease in applications for these
materials. Some speciﬁc compounds are still used. Halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-triﬂuoroethane) is still used
in some situations as an inhalation anesthetic. The compound DDT is a very effective pesticide, but is only used
when nothing else works because of its harmful effects on the environment.

How cold can it get?
Water freezes at 0°C which creates problems for cars in the winter. The water in the engine would freeze and crack
the engine block. To prevent this, antifreeze is added to lower the freezing point of the liquid. The most common
antifreeze is an alcohol known as propylene glycol. It has largely replaced the much more toxic ethylene glycol.
Methanol can also be used as an antifreeze, mainly in windshield wiper ﬂuid.

Alcohols
An alcohol is an organic compound that contains one or more hydroxyl (−OH) groups. The general formula for
alcohols is R−OH. Do not confuse alcohols with inorganic bases that contain the hydroxide ion (OH−). The –OH
group in an alcohol is covalently bonded to a carbon atom and does not ionize in solution. The steps for naming
alcohols are listed below.

Following are three examples of alcohols and their IUPAC names.

Aliphatic alcohols can be classiﬁed according to the number of R groups attached to the carbon with the hydroxyl
group. If one R group is attached to that carbon, the alcohol is a primary alcohol. If two R groups are attached, the
alcohol is a secondary alcohol. If three R groups are attached, the alcohol is a tertiary alcohol. Shown below is an
example of each. The primary alcohol is 1-propanol, the secondary alcohol is 2-butanol, and the tertiary alcohol is
2-methy-2-propanol.

Properties of Alcohols

The smallest and lightest alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol) are completely soluble in water in all proportions. In
a solution, the hydroxyl groups of alcohol molecules and the water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other,
resulting in complete miscibility. However, as the length of the carbon chain increases, the solubility decreases. The
solubility of 1-butanol is 7.4 g per 100 g of water, while that of 1-pentanol is 2.7 g per 100 g water, and 1-octanol
is 0.06 g per 100 g water. The carbon chain portion of the larger alcohol molecule is nonpolar and leads to the
decreased solubility of the overall compound.
The presence of hydrogen bonds in alcohols also explains the relatively high boiling points of alcohols compared to
alkanes of similar molar mass (see Table 25.2).

Only weak London dispersion forces hold molecules of nonpolar alkanes together in the liquid phase. Consequently,
less energy is required to break these molecules away from the surface of the liquid and turn them into a vapor. The
stronger hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules means that more energy is required to convert the liquid to
vapor, and boiling points are therefore high.

• Describe uses for ethers.

Start Your Engines!
Race car drivers are always looking for that “edge” that will make them go faster (legally) than their competitors.
One way to get more speed is to burn the gasoline in the car engine more efﬁciently. Methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE)
has been used for this purpose, but is being discontinued due to concerns about contamination of drinking water by
leaking fuel tanks that contained this compound.

Ethers

An ether is an organic compound in which two hydrocarbon groups are bonded to the same atom of oxygen. An
ether is represented by the general formula R−O−R’. The R’ in the formula means that the hydrocarbon group can
be the same as R or it can be different. The steps for naming ethers are listed below.

1. The parent compound is given by the word ether, which appears at the end of the name.
2. The names of each alkyl group come before the word ether. If the two alkyl groups are the same, the preﬁx

–di is used. If the two alkyl groups are different, they are listed in alphabetical order.

3. Spaces are left between the names of the alkyl groups (if different) and before the word ether.

Shown below are two examples of ethers with their IUPAC names.

1151

25.10. Ethers

www.ck12.org

Properties of Ethers

Like alcohols, ethers are also quite soluble in water. The lone-pair electrons on the oxygen atom of the ether can form
a hydrogen bond with the hydrogen atoms of water molecules. As with alcohols, the solubility is greater for ethers
that have shorter length R groups. The boiling points of ethers are much lower than the boiling points of alcohols.
Ether molecules do not have hydrogen atoms that are covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom, and so
ether molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds with each other. The weaker intermolecular force acting between ether
molecules results in boiling points which are much closer to alkanes of similar molar mass than to alcohols.
The anesthetic effects of ethers were ﬁrst discovered in the 1840s. Diethyl ether was used as a general anesthetic for
patients undergoing surgery for many years. However, ethers are very ﬂammable and have undesirable side effects
such as nausea and vomiting. Safer alternatives to ethers are now used in anesthesia and the primary use of ethers
today is as a solvent for other organic compounds.

Can you resist the smell of a fresh baked cinnamon bun?

There’s nothing like the smell of a fresh cinnamon roll. The taste is even better. But what causes that delicious
taste? This ﬂavoring comes from the bark of a tree (actually, several different kinds of trees). One of the major
compounds responsible for the taste and odor of cinnamon is cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamon has been widely used
throughout the centuries to treat a number of different disorders. In ancient times, doctors believed it could cure
snakebite poisoning, freckles, and the common cold. Today there are several research studies being carried out on
the health beneﬁts of cinnamon. So, enjoy that cinnamon roll –it just might be good for you.

Aldehydes and Ketones

Aldehydes and ketones are two related categories of organic compounds that both contain the carbonyl group,
shown below.

The difference between aldehydes and ketones is the placement of the carbonyl group within the molecule. An
aldehyde is an organic compound in which the carbonyl group is attached to a carbon atom at the end of a carbon

chain. A ketone is an organic compound in which the carbonyl group is attached to a carbon atom within the carbon
chain. The general formulas for each are shown below.

For aldehydes, the R group may be a hydrogen atom or any length carbon chain. Aldehydes are named by ﬁnding
the longest continuous chain that contains the carbonyl group. Change the –e at the end of the name of the alkane to
–al.

For ketones, R and R’ must be carbon chains, of either the same or different lengths. The steps for naming ketones,
followed by two examples, are shown below.

1. Name the parent compound by ﬁnding the longest continuous chain that contains the carbonyl group. Change

the –e at the end of the name of the alkane to –one.

2. Number the carbon atoms in the chain in a way that the carbonyl group has the lowest possible number.
3. Add the numerical preﬁx into the name before the name of the ketone.
4. Use a hyphen between the number and the name of the ketone.

Properties of Aldehydes and Ketones

Aldehydes and ketones can work weak hydrogen bonds with water through the carbonyl oxygen atom. The lower
members of both series (3 carbons or fewer) are soluble in water in all proportions. As the length of the carbon
chain increases, water solubility decreases. Similar to ethers, neither aldehydes nor ketones can hydrogen bond
with themselves. As a result, their boiling points are generally lower than those of alcohols. Unlike alkanes
however, aldehydes and ketones are polar molecules due to the more electronegative oxygen atom. The dipole-
dipole interactions are stronger than the dispersion forces present in alkanes. The boiling points of aldehydes and
ketones are intermediate between those of alkanes and alcohols. For example, the boiling point of ethane is -89°C,
ethanal is 20°C, and ethanol is 78°C.

Methanal, commonly known as formaldehyde, was once commonly used as a biological preservative for dead
animals. In recent years formaldehyde has been shown to be a carcinogen and so has been replaced for this purpose
by safer alternatives. Aldehydes are currently used in the production of resins and plastics. The simplest ketone,
propanone, is commonly called acetone. Acetone is a common organic solvent that was once used in most nail polish
removers, but has largely been replaced by other solvents.

What can you do with vinegar?
Vinegar (dilute acetic acid) is available in every grocery store in the country. The large one-gallon jugs can be found
in households everywhere. One magazine published an article listing 150 ways to use vinegar, from cleaning dirt off
your computer to cleaning window blinds. A mixture of vinegar and baking soda is an excellent way to clean sink
drains. You can also clean your carpets and your piano keys. Not bad for something that you thought of only for
putting on food.

Carboxylic Acids

Organic acids such as acetic acid all contain a functional group called a carboxyl group.

1156

www.ck12.org

Chapter 25. Organic Chemistry

The carboxyl group contains the C=O of the carbonyl group, with the carbon atom also being bonded to a hydroxyl
(−OH) group. A carboxylic acid is an organic compound that contains the carboxyl functional group. The general
formula for a carboxylic acid can be abbreviated as –COOH. The carbon atom of the carboxyl group may be attached
to a hydrogen atom or to a carbon chain. The naming of a carboxylic acid is as follows: Name the parent compound
by ﬁnding the longest continuous chain that contains the carboxyl group. Change the –e at the end of the name of
the alkane to –oic acid.

Properties of Carboxylic Acids
Carboxylic acids are all weak acids. In aqueous solution, the O−H bond of the hydroxyl group can break, yielding
a negative carboxylate ion and the hydrogen ion.

FIGURE 25.7
Equilibrium between carboxyl group and
carboxylate anion.

The smaller members of the aliphatic carboxylic acid series are colorless, volatile liquids with strong odors. Ethanoic
acid is commonly known as acetic acid and common household vinegar is a 5% solution of acetic acid. Larger
carboxylic acids are solids with low melting points. There are a great many aromatic carboxylic acids, which are all
crystalline solids. Carboxylic acids can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and thus have relatively high melting
and boiling points compared to other organic compounds that cannot hydrogen bond. Carboxylic acids with shorter
carbon chains are very soluble in water, while those with longer carbon chains are less soluble.
Many carboxylic acids occur naturally in plants and animals. Citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons contain citric
acid.
Ethanoic and citric acids are frequently added to foods to give them a tart ﬂavor. Benzoic, propanoic, and sorbic acids
are used as food preservatives because of their ability to kill microorganisms that can lead to spoilage. Methanoic and
ethanoic acids are widely used in industry as starting points for the manufacture of paints, adhesives, and coatings.

What is that smell?
Perfumes contain ingredients from a number of sources. Musk is obtained from animals, but the vast majority of
perfume components are obtained from plants. Approximately 2,000 plant species have been used as sources for
perfume materials. The needed chemicals are extracted using solvent extraction or distillation. The oils are diluted
with ethanol to varying degrees, depending on the price of the ﬁnished product –the less ethanol present (meaning
there is a higher percentage of the active odor ingredients), the more expensive the perfume.

Esters

An ester is an organic compound that is a derivative of a carboxylic acid in which the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl
group has been replaced with an alkyl group. The structure is the product of a carboxylic acid (the R-portion) and
an alcohol (the R’-portion). The general formula for an ester is shown below.

The R group can either be a hydrogen atom or a carbon chain. The R’ group must be a carbon chain since a hydrogen
atom would make the molecule a carboxylic acid. The steps for naming esters along with two examples are shown

1159

25.13. Esters

below.

www.ck12.org

1. Identify and name the alkyl group (R’) that has replaced the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group. This is the ﬁrst

part of the ester name.

2. Name the carboxylic acid portion of the molecule (R-COO), but change the ending of the name from –oic acid

to –oate. This is the second part of the ester name.

3. Leave a space between the alkyl group name and the name of the carboxylic acid derivative.

Esters have lower boiling points than the carboxylic acids from which they were derived because they cannot form
hydrogen bonds with each other. This is because there are no hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms, as in the
acid. Esters with shorter carbon chains are soluble in water, while those with longer chains are less soluble.
Esters are very commonly found in plants and are responsible for many distinctive odors and ﬂavors. For example,
methyl salicylate has the odor and ﬂavor of oil of wintergreen, while propyl ethanoate has that of a pear.

• List the properties of amines.
• Describe uses for amines.

Sunshine and Sleep
What does sunshine have to do with sleep (other than the sun shining in your eyes and waking you up)? For
many people, sleeping problems have to do with an amine that the brain makes called melatonin. This compound
affects the sleep-wake cycle and is affected by sunlight. During the winter, the daily cycle of melatonin production
may be affected by less sunlight hours. If this cycle is changed, the person may have trouble sleeping. Melatonin
supplements are available in pharmacies and health food stores and may be of help for those with sleeping problems.

Amines

An amine is an organic compound that can be considered to be a derivative of ammonia (NH3). The general structure
of an amine can be abbreviated as R−NH2, where R is a carbon chain. However, similar to alcohols, amines can be
primary, secondary, or tertiary.

1162

www.ck12.org

Chapter 25. Organic Chemistry

The nitrogen atom of a primary amine is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and one carbon. The nitrogen atom of
a secondary amine is bonded to one hydrogen and two carbons. The nitrogen atom of a tertiary amine is bonded
to three carbon atoms. Amines are typically named by a common system rather than by IUPAC guidelines. The
common system for naming amines along with several examples is shown below.

1. Name the alkyl groups that are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amine. If there is more than one different
alkyl group, put them in alphabetical order. If there are two or three of the same alkyl group, use the di− or
tri− preﬁx.

2. Follow the alkyl group name with the sufﬁx –amine, with no spaces.

Properties of Amines

Amines are weak bases due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. This lone pair can attract
the hydrogen atom from a water molecule, causing the bond between it and the oxygen atom to break. The resultant
products are the conjugate acid of the amine and the hydroxide ion.

Amines are capable of hydrogen bonding though their boiling points are generally a bit lower than the corresponding
alcohol. Methylamine and ethylamine are gases at room temperature, while larger amines are liquids. As with other
organic compounds that form hydrogen bonds, water solubility is reﬂected in the length of the carbon chains. Smaller
amines are soluble, while larger ones are less soluble.
Amines generally have rather pungent or noxious odors. Ammonia can be considered the simplest amine and has
a very distinctive odor. Methylamine has an unpleasant odor associated with dead ﬁsh. Amines are often formed
biologically during the breakdown of proteins in animal cells, and so many have the smell of death and decay.
Putrescine and cadaverine are two such amines and are aptly named for their foul odors. The toxins which many
animals use as a form of defense are frequently amines. Amines are used industrially as dyes and in many drugs.

Just Breathe Deeply
Organic compounds can be used for a wide variety of applications. One organic compound is halothane, an alkyl
halide. This material is used as a general anesthetic for surgical procedures. When it was ﬁrst developed in 1956,
it was very popular, but has had limited use more recently because of toxicity issues, especially liver damage.
Halothane is now used mainly as an anesthetic for children since the risk of harm is much less in these patients.

Substitution Reactions

A substitution reaction is a reaction in which one or more atoms replace another atom or group of atoms in a
molecule. Alkyl halides are formed by the substitution of a halogen atom for a hydrogen atom. When methane
reacts with chlorine gas, ultraviolet light can act as a catalyst for the reaction.

CH4(g) + Cl2(g)

UV light
−−−−−→ CH3Cl(g) + HCl(g)

The reaction produces chloromethane and hydrogen chloride. When the mixture is allowed to react for longer periods
of time further substitution reactions may occur.

CH3Cl(g) + Cl2(g)

UV light
−−−−−→ CH2Cl2(g) + HCl(g)

The product above is dichloromethane. Further substitution produces trichloromethane and tetrachloromethane,
commonly called carbon tetrachloride. A mixture of products occurs in the reaction, with the relative amounts
dependent upon the time that the reaction is allowed to proceed. Chloroﬂuorocarbons are produced by reacting
chloroalkanes with hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) because the ﬂuorine atom bonds preferentially to the carbon.

CCl4(g) + HF(g)

SbF5−−→ CCl3F(g) + HCl(g)

The ﬂuorine atom substitutes for a chlorine atom in the reaction.
Benzene is a fairly stable and unreactive molecule due to the electron delocalization around the six-membered ring.
The treatment of benzene with a halogen in the presence of an iron catalyst causes the substitution of a halogen atom
for a hydrogen atom. The resulting molecule is called an aryl halide.

C6H6(l) + Br2(l)

FeBr3−−−→ C6H5Br(l) + HBr(g)

Alkyl groups can be introduced onto a benzene ring by the reaction of benzene with an alkyl halide, using aluminum
chloride as the catalyst. In the reaction below, benzene reacts with chloroethane to produce ethylbenzene.

C6H6(l) + CH3CH2Cl(g)

AlCl3−−−→ C6H5CH2CH3(l) + HCl(g)

The reaction of an alkyl halide with an inorganic hydroxide base at elevated temperature produces an alcohol. The
molecular reaction to produce methanol from iodomethane and sodium hydroxide is shown below.

What is this yellow stuff?
There is big debate these days about using butter or margarine on your toast (or pancakes or mufﬁn). Margarine is
less expensive than butter and is lower in fat and cholesterol. Margarine is made from animal or vegetable fats using
hydrogenation to reduce the double bonds in the fatty acids. Hydrogen gas is bubbled through the liquid oil and
reacts with the carbon-carbon double bonds present in the long-chain fatty acids. The product is less likely to spoil
than butter.

Addition Reactions

An addition reaction is a reaction in which an atom or molecule is added to an unsaturated molecule, making a
single product. An addition reaction can be thought of as adding a molecule across the double or triple bond of an
alkene or alkyne. Addition reactions are useful ways to introduce a new functional group into an organic molecule.
One type of addition reaction is called hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is a reaction that occurs when molecular
hydrogen is added to an alkene to produce an alkane. The reaction is typically performed with the use of a platinum
catalyst. Ethene reacts with hydrogen to form ethane.

CH2=CH2(g) + H2(g)

Pt−→ CH3CH3(g)

Alkyl halides can be produced from an alkene by the addition of either the elemental halogen or the hydrogen halide.
When the reactant is the halogen, the product is a disubstituted alkyl halide as in the addition of bromine to ethene.

Chapter 25. Organic Chemistry

CH2=CH2(g) + Br2(l) → CH2BrCH2Br(g)
1,2-dibromoethane

The addition of bromine to an unknown organic compound is indeed a test for saturation in the compound. Bromine
has a distinctive brownish-orange color, while most bromoalkanes are colorless. When bromine is slowly added to
the compound, the orange color will fade if it undergoes the addition reaction to the hydrocarbon. If the orange color
remains, then the original compound was already saturated and no reaction occurred.
A monosubstituted alkyl halide can be produced by the addition of a hydrogen halide to an alkene. Shown below is
the formation of chloroethane.

CH2=CH2(g) + HCl(g) → CH3CH2Cl(g)

A hydration reaction is a reaction in which water is added to an alkene. Hydration reactions can take place when
the alkene and water are heated to near 100◦C in the presence of a strong acid, which acts as a catalyst. Shown below
is the hydration of ethene to produce ethanol.

CH2=CH2 + H2O → CH3CH2OH

Under modest reaction conditions, benzene resists addition reactions because adding a molecule across a double
bond in a benzene ring disrupts the ring of delocalized electrons. This greatly destabilizes the molecule. However,
under conditions of high temperature and pressure, and with an appropriate catalyst, benzene will slowly react with
three molecules of hydrogen to produce cyclohexane.

Keeping Food Safe
Benzoic acid crystals in polarized light are pictured above. Benzoic acid is widely used as a food preservative, either
as the carboxylic acid or as the sodium benzoate salt. This compound is most effective when added to acidic foods
such as fruit juices and soft drinks. The major industrial source of benzoic acid is the partial oxidation of toluene
with oxygen. The process is inexpensive and environmentally benign.

Oxidation Reactions

Oxidation can be deﬁned as the addition of oxygen to a molecule or the removal of hydrogen from a molecule. When
an alkane is heated in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, it can be oxidized to the corresponding alkene in a
reaction called a dehydrogenation reaction. Two hydrogen atoms are removed in the process. The alkene can be
further oxidized to an alkyne by the removal of two more hydrogen atoms.

The alkane is the most reduced form of a hydrocarbon, while the alkyne is the most oxidized form.
Oxidation reactions in organic chemistry often involve the addition of oxygen to a compound, which changes the
particular functional group of that compound. The following sequence shows how methane can be oxidized ﬁrst to
methanol, then to methanal, then to methanoic acid, and ﬁnally to carbon dioxide.

Each step in the process is either a gain of oxygen or a loss of hydrogen. Each step also releases energy, which
explains why the complete combustion of alkanes to carbon dioxide is an extremely exothermic reaction.
The oxidation of an alcohol can produce either an aldehyde or a ketone. Ethanol can be oxidized in the laboratory
through a heating process combined with the addition of an oxidizing agent such as the dichromate ion, which
catalyzes the reaction in an acidic solution. The reaction produces the aldehyde ethanal (acetaldehyde).

CH3CH2OH

When the alcohol to be oxidized is a secondary alcohol, the oxidation product is a ketone rather than an aldehyde.

Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized in this way because the carbon to which the hydroxyl group is attached does
not have another hydrogen atom attached to it.
When a primary alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde, the reaction is difﬁcult to stop because the aldehyde is easily
oxidized further to the corresponding carboxylic acid. The oxidation of ethanal produces ethanoic (acetic) acid.

Ethanol-containing beverages such as wine are susceptible to such oxidation if kept for long periods of time after
having been opened and exposed to the air. Wine that has become oxidized will have an unpleasant vinegary taste
due to the production of acetic acid.
Unlike aldehydes, ketones are resistant to further oxidation because the carbonyl group is in the middle of the carbon
chain and so the ketone cannot be converted to a carboxylic acid.

A New Way to Lubricate Machinery
Vegetable oils are being explored for a variety of uses in which they could replace petroleum products. One such
application is in the ﬁeld of lubricants. Every moving part in machinery (such as engine pistons) needs lubrication
to decrease friction and prolong the life of the equipment. Petroleum products serve this purpose now, but are not
good for the environment. New techniques for making specialized esters from vegetable oil are being explored that
will make the compounds more stable and more useful as lubricants.

Condensation Reactions

A condensation reaction is a reaction in which two molecules combine to form a single molecule. A small molecule,
often water, is usually removed during a condensation reaction. Amino acids are important biological molecules that
have an amine functional group on one end of the molecule and a carboxylic acid functional group on the other end.
When two amino acids combine in a condensation reaction, a covalent bond forms between the amine nitrogen of
one amino acid and the carboxyl carbon of the second amino acid. A molecule of water is then removed as a second
product.
This reaction forms a molecule called a dipeptide and the carbon-nitrogen covalent bond is called a peptide bond.
When repeated numerous times, a lengthy molecule called a protein is eventually produced.

Amino acids join together to form a molecule called a dipeptide. The –OH from the carboxyl group of one amino
acid combines with a hydrogen atom from the amino group of the other amino acid to produce water (blue).

Esteriﬁcation

An esteriﬁcation is a condensation reaction in which an ester is formed from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid.
Esteriﬁcation is a subcategory of condensation reactions because a water molecule is produced in the reaction. The
reaction is catalyzed by a strong acid, usually sulfuric acid. When the carboxylic acid butanoic acid is heated with
an excess of methanol and a few drops of sulfuric acid, the ester methyl butanoate is produced. Methyl butanoate
has the scent of pineapples. The reaction is shown below with both molecular and structural formulas.

The esteriﬁcation reaction is reversible. When an ester is heated in the presence of a strong base such as sodium
hydroxide, the ester breaks down. The products are an alcohol and the conjugate base of the carboxylic acid as a
salt.

CH3COOCH2CH3 + NaOH → CH3COO−Na+ + CH3CH2OH
ethanol
ethyl ethanoate

sodium acetate

The sodium hydroxide is not acting as a catalyst, but is consumed in the reaction.

Saponiﬁcation describes the alkaline hydrolysis reaction of an ester. The term saponiﬁcation originally described
the hydrolysis of long-chain esters called fatty acid esters to produce soap molecules, which are the salts of fatty
acids. One such soap molecule is sodium stearate, formed from the hydrolysis of ethyl stearate.

Will it ever go away?
We enjoy the beneﬁts of Styrofoam® containers, but don’t often think about where they end up. Styrofoam®
materials do not break down quickly under exposure to the elements. When buried in a landﬁll, styrofoam will
remain intact for a long time. The good news is that there is not a lot of this pollutant found in landﬁlls (maybe about
0.5% by weight of the total mass of garbage). There is no good way to recycle Styrofoam® at present, but someday
a creative scientist may come up with one.

Polymerization –Addition Polymers

Polymers are very different from the other kinds of organic molecules that you have seen so far. Whereas other
compounds are of relatively low molar mass, polymers are giant molecules of very high molar mass. Polymers are
the primary components of all sorts of plastics and related compounds. A polymer is a large molecule formed of
many smaller molecules covalently bonded in a repeating pattern. The small molecules which make up the polymer
are called monomers. Polymers generally form either from an addition reaction or a condensation reaction.

Addition Polymers

An addition polymer is a polymer formed by chain addition reactions between monomers that contain a double
bond. Molecules of ethene can polymerize with each other under the right conditions to form the polymer called
polyethylene.

1177

25.19. Polymerization – Addition Polymers

www.ck12.org

The letter n stands for the number of monomers that are joined in repeated fashion to make the polymer and can
have a value in the hundreds or even thousands.

FIGURE 25.12
Polyethylene synthesis.

The reactions above show the basic steps to form an addition polymer:

1. Initiation - a free radical initiator (X∗) attacks the carbon-carbon double bond (ﬁrst step above). The initiator
can be something like hydrogen peroxide. This material can easily split to form two species with a free
electron attached to each: H-O-O-H → 2 H-O•. This free radical attacks a carbon-carbon double bond. One
of the pi electrons forms a single bond with the initiator while the other pi electron forms a new free radical
on the carbon atom.

2. Propagation - the new free radical compound interacts with another alkene, continuing the process of chain

growth (second step above).

3. Termination occurs whenever two free radicals come in contact with one another (not shown). The two free

electrons form a covalent bond and the free radical on each molecule no longer exists.

Polyethylene can have different properties depending on the length of the polymer chains and on how efﬁciently they
pack together. Some common products made from different forms of polyethylene include plastic bottles, plastic
bags, and harder plastic objects such as milk crates.

Several other kinds of unsaturated monomers can be polymerized and are components in common household
products. Polypropylene is stiffer than polyethylene is in plastic utensils and some other types of containers.

A Different Sound and Feel
Animal gut and silk were used for all guitar strings for centuries until modern technology and changes in musical
taste brought about signiﬁcant changes. There are two major types of guitar strings in use today. Steel strings (ﬁrst
developed around 1900) are found on acoustic and electric guitars. They have a bright, crisp sound that lends itself
well to diverse music as jazz, rock and roll, and bluegrass. Nylon strings are a more recent development. During
World War II, the silk and animal products needed to manufacture steel guitar strings were not available. Nylon
quickly proved to be a more than adequate substitute. Now nylon strings are found on all classical guitars. Their
sound is somewhat softer than the steel strings and the tone quality suits that genre of music better.

Polymerization - Condensation Polymers

A condensation polymer is a polymer formed by condensation reactions. Monomers of condensation polymers
must contain two functional groups so that each monomer can link up with two other monomers. One type of
condensation polymer is called a polyamide. An amide is characterized by the functional group shown below
wherein the carbon of a carbonyl group is bonded to the nitrogen of an amine.
One pair of monomers that can form a polyamide is adipic acid and hexanediamine. Adipic acid is a carboxylic
acid with two carboxyl groups on either end of the molecule. Hexanediamine has amino groups on either end of a

six-carbon chain. When these molecules react with each other, a molecule of water is eliminated, classifying it as a
condensation reaction ( Figure 25.18).

FIGURE 25.18
Nylon synthesis

The polymer that results from the repetition of the condensation reaction is a polyamide called nylon-66. Nylon-66
was ﬁrst invented in 1935 and has been used in all sorts of products. It and other polyamides are commonly found
in ﬁbers and clothing, cooking utensils, ﬁshing line, and carpeting, among many other applications.

Polyester is another common type of condensation polymer. Recall that esters are formed from the reaction of an
alcohol with a carboxylic acid. When both the acid and alcohol have two functional groups, the ester is capable of

being polymerized. One such polyester is called polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and is formed from the reaction
of ethylene glycol with terephthalic acid. The structure of PET is shown below.

PET is used in tires, photographic ﬁlm, food packaging, and clothing. Polyester fabric is used in permanent-press
clothing. Its resistance to wrinkling comes from the cross-linking of the polymer strands.

• Give structures for important monosaccharides.

What’s on your mind?
The brain is a marvelous organ. And it’s a hungry one, too. The major fuel for the brain is the carbohydrate
glucose. The average adult brain represents about 2% of our body’s weight, but uses 25% of the glucose in the body.
Moreover, speciﬁc areas of the brain use glucose at different rates. If you are concentrating hard, (taking a test, for
example) certain parts of the brain need a lot of extra glucose while other parts of the brain only use their normal
amount. Something to think about.

Monosaccharides

Some foods that are high in carbohydrates include bread, pasta, and potatoes. Because carbohydrates are easily
digested, athletes often rely on carbohydrate rich foods to enable a high level of performance.
The term carbohydrate comes from the fact that the majority contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a ratio of
1:2:1, making for an empirical formula of CH2O. This is somewhat misleading because the molecules are not
actually hydrates of carbon at all. Carbohydrates are monomers and polymers of aldehydes and ketones that have
multiple hydroxyl groups attached.
Carbohydrates are the most abundant source of energy found in most foods. The simplest carbohydrates, also called
simple sugars, are plentiful in fruits. A monosaccharide is a carbohydrate consisting of one sugar unit. Common
examples of simple sugars or monosaccharides are glucose and fructose. Both of these monosaccharides are referred

to as hexoses since they have six carbons. Glucose is abundant in many plant sources and makes up sweetners such
as corn sugar or grape sugar. Fructose occurs in a great many fruits and is also found in honey. These sugars
are structural isomers of one another, with the difference being that glucose contains an aldehyde functional group
whereas fructose contains a ketone functional group.

FIGURE 26.2
Glucose and fructose are monosaccha-
rides, or simple sugars.

Glucose and fructose are both very soluble in water. In aqueous solution, the predominant forms are not the straight-
chain structure shown above. Rather, they adopt a cyclic structure (see Figure 26.3). Glucose is a six-membered
ring, while fructose is a ﬁve-membered ring. Both rings contain an oxygen atom.

FIGURE 26.3
The cyclic form of sugars is the favored
form in aqueous solution.

Another important group of monosaccharides are the pentoses, containing ﬁve carbons in the chain. Ribose and
deoxyribose are two pentoses that are components of the structures of DNA and RNA.

Got milk?
Milk is one of the basic foods needed for good nutrition, especially for growing children. It contains vitamins and
minerals necessary for healthy development. Unfortunately, milk and other dairy products also contains lactose,
a carbohydrate that can make some people very ill. Lactose intolerance is a condition in which the lactose in
milk cannot be digested well in the small intestine. The undigested lactose then moves into the large intestine
where bacteria attack it, forming large amounts of gas. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, cramps,
nausea, and vomiting. Often, the individual will outgrow this problem. Avoidance of foods containing lactose
is recommended for people who show signs of lactose intolerance. Since dairy products can provide many vital
nutrients, tablets can be taken that provide the needed digestive materials in the small intestine. Lactose-free milk is
also readily available.

Disaccharides

The simple sugars form the foundation of more complex carbohydrates. The cyclic forms of two sugars can be
linked together by means of a condensation reaction. The ﬁgure below shows how a glucose molecule and a fructose
molecule combine to form a sucrose molecule. A hydrogen atom from one molecule and a hydroxyl group from the
other molecule are eliminated as water, with a resulting covalent bond linking the two sugars together at that point.

Sucrose, commonly known as table sugar, is an example of a disaccharide. A disaccharide is a carbohydrate
formed by the joining of two monosaccharides. Other common disaccharides include lactose and maltose. Lactose,
a component of milk, is formed from glucose and galactose, while maltose formed from two glucose molecules.
During digestion, these disaccharides are hydrolyzed in the small intestine to form the component monosaccharides,
which are then absorbed across the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream to be transported to the cells.

Are we there yet?
As the weather warms up, the runners come out. Not just the casual joggers, but those really serious ones who
actually enjoy running all 26.2 miles of a marathon. Prior to these races (and a lot of shorter ones), you hear a lot
about carbo-loading. This practice involves eating a lot of starch in the days prior to the race. The starch is converted
to glucose, which is normally used for biochemical energy. Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in liver and muscle
tissue to be used when needed. If there is a lot of glycogen available, the muscles will have more biochemical energy
to draw on when needed for the long run. The rest of us will just sit at the sidewalk restaurant eating our spaghetti
and enjoying watching other people work hard.

Polysaccharides

Many simple sugars can combine by repeated condensation reactions until a very large molecule is formed. A
polysaccharide is a complex carbohydrate polymer formed from the linkage of many monosaccharide monomers.
One of the best known polysaccharides is starch, the main form of energy storage in plants. Starch is a staple in most
human diets. Foods such as corn, potatoes, rice, and wheat have high starch contents. Starch is made of glucose
monomers and occurs in both straight-chain and branched forms. Amylose is the straight-chain form and consists
of hundreds of linked glucose molecules. The branched form of starch is called amylopectin. In the small intestine,
starch is hydrolyzed to form glucose. The glucose can then be converted to biochemical energy or stored for later
use.

FIGURE 26.8
Amylose and amylopectin are the two
most common components of naturally
occurring starch. Both consist of many
glucose monomers connected into a poly-
mer. Starch serves as energy storage in
plants.

Glycogen is an even more highly branched polysaccharide of glucose monomers that serves a function of energy
storage in animals. Glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and muscles.

FIGURE 26.9
Glycogen is a branched polymer of glu-
cose and serves as energy storage in
animals.

Cellulose is another polymer of glucose, consisting of anywhere from hundreds to over ten thousand monomers. It
is the structural component of the cell walls of green plants and is the single most common organic molecule on
Earth. Roughly 33% of all plant matter is cellulose. The linkage structure in cellulose is different than that of starch,
and cellulose is indigestible except by a few microorganisms that live in the digestive tracts of cattle and termites.
The ﬁgure below shows a triple strand of cellulose. There is no branching and the ﬁbers adopt a very stiff rod-like
structure with numerous hydrogen bonds between the ﬁbers adding to its strength. Cellulose is the main component
of paper, cardboard, and textiles made from cotton, linen, and other plant ﬁbers.

Will supplements really help?
Athletics are very competitive these days at all levels, from school sports to the pros. Everybody is looking for that
edge that will make them faster, stronger, more physically ﬁt. One approach taken by many athletes is the use of
amino acid supplements. The theory is that the increase in amino acids in the diet will lead to increased protein for
muscles. However, the only real beneﬁt comes to the people who make and sell the pills. Studies have not showed
any advantage obtained by the athletes themselves. You’re much better off just maintaining a healthy diet.

Amino Acids
An amino acid is a compound that contains both an amino group (−NH2) and a carboxyl group (−COOH) in the
same molecule. While any number of amino acids can possibly be imagined, biochemists generally reserve the term
for a group of 20 amino acids which are formed and used by living organisms. The Figure 26.11 shows the general
structure of an amino acid.
The amino and carboxyl groups of an amino acid are both covalently bonded to a central carbon atom. That carbon
atom is also bonded to a hydrogen atom and an R group. It is this R group which varies from one amino acid to
another and is called the amino acid side chain.
The nature of the side chains accounts for the variability in physical and chemical properties of the different amino
acids. Some side chains consist of nonpolar aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons. Other side chains are polar, while
some are acidic or basic.

• Deﬁne peptide.
• Describe the formation of the peptide bond.

Are your cells smarter than you?
Cells in our bodies have an intricate mechanism for the manufacture of proteins. Humans have to use other
techniques in order to synthesize the same proteins in a lab. The chemistry of peptide synthesis is complicated.
Both active groups on an amino acid can react and the amino acid sequence must be a speciﬁc one in order for the
protein to function. Robert Merriﬁeld developed the ﬁrst synthetic approach for making proteins in the lab, a manual
approach which was lengthy and tedious (and, he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1984 for his work). Today
however, automated systems can crank out a peptide in a very short period of time.

Peptides

A peptide is a combination of amino acids in which the amino group of one amino acid has undergone a reaction
with the carboxyl group of another amino acid. The reaction is a condensation reaction, forming an amide group
(CO−N), shown below.
A peptide bond is the amide bond that occurs between the amino nitrogen of one amino acid and the carboxyl
carbon of another amino acid. The resulting molecule is called a dipeptide. Notice that the particular side chains of
each amino acid are irrelevant since the R groups are not involved in the peptide bond.
The dipeptide has a free amino group on one end of the molecule and a free carboxyl group on the other end. Each
is capable of extending the chain through the formation of another peptide bond. The particular sequence of amino
acids in a longer chain is called an amino acid sequence. By convention, the amino acid sequence is listed in the
order such that the free amino group is on the left end of the molecule and the free carboxyl group is on the right

end of the molecule. For example, suppose that a sequence of the amino acids glycine, tryptophan, and alanine is
formed with the free amino group as part of the glycine and the free carboxyl group as part of the alanine. The
amino acid sequence can be easily written using the abbreviations as Gly-Trp-Ala. This is a different sequence from
Ala-Trp-Gly because the free amino and carboxyl groups would be on different amino acids in that case.

A Serious Shift
Hemoglobin is a complex protein which has a quaternary structure and contains iron. There are four subunits in
the hemoglobin molecule – two alpha subunits and two beta subunits. Each subunit contains one iron ion, whose
oxidation state changes from +2 to +3 and back again, depending upon the environment around the iron. When the
oxygen binds to the iron, the three-dimensional shape of the molecule changes. Upon release of the oxygen to the
cells, the shape changes again.
With hemoglobin of normal structure, this shift in conformation does not present any problems. However, individuals
with hemoglobin S do experience serious complications. This hemoglobin has one amino acid in the two beta chains
that is different from the amino acid at that point in the primary structure of normal hemoglobin. The result of
this one structural change is aggregation of the individual protein molecules when oxygen is released. Adjacent
hemoglobin molecules come in contact with one another and clump up, causing the red cells to deform and break.
This abnormality, known as sickle cell, is genetic in nature. A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have
sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening. Inheriting the
gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, a very serious condition.

Proteins

A polypeptide is a sequence of amino acids between ten and one hundred in length. A protein is a peptide that is
greater than one hundred amino acids in length. Proteins are very prevalent in living organisms. Hair, skin, nails,
muscles, and the hemoglobin in red blood cells are some of the important parts of your body that are made of
different proteins. The wide array of chemical and physiological properties of proteins is a function of their amino
acid sequences. Since proteins generally consist of one hundred or more amino acids, the number of amino acid
sequences that are possible is virtually limitless.
The three-dimensional structure of a protein is very critical to its function. This structure can be broken down into
four levels. The primary structure is the amino acid sequence of the protein. The amino acid sequence of a given
protein is unique and deﬁnes the function of that protein. The secondary structure is a highly regular sub-structure

1203

26.6. Proteins

www.ck12.org

of the protein. The two most common types of protein secondary structure are the alpha helix and the beta sheet. An
alpha helix consists of amino acids that adopt a spiral shape. A beta sheet is alternating rows of amino acids that line
up in a side-by-side fashion. In both cases, the secondary structures are stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding
between the side chains. The interaction of the various side chains in the amino acid, speciﬁcally the hydrogen
bonding, leads to the adoption of a particular secondary structure.

FIGURE 26.14
Secondary structure: alpha helix and beta
sheet.

The tertiary structure is the overall three-dimensional structure of the protein. A typical protein consists of several
sections of a speciﬁc secondary structure (alpha helix or beta sheet) along with other areas in which a more random
structure occurs. These areas combine to produce the tertiary structure.
Some protein molecules consist of multiple protein subunits. The quaternary structure of a protein refers to the
speciﬁc interaction and orientation of the subunits of that protein Hemoglobin is a very large protein found in red
blood cells and whose function is to bind and carry oxygen throughout the bloodstream. Hemoglobin consists of
four subunits – two α subunits (yellow) and two β subunits (gray) – which then come together in a speciﬁc and
deﬁned way through interactions of the side chains (see Figure 26.15). Hemoglobin also contains four iron atoms,
located in the middle of each of the four subunits. The iron atoms are part of a structure called a porphyrin, shown
in red in the ﬁgure.

What did he discover?
The ﬁrst enzyme to be isolated was discovered in 1926 by American chemist James Sumner, who crystallized the
protein. The enzyme was urease, which catalyzes the hydrolytic decomposition of urea, a component of urine, into
ammonia and carbon dioxide.

H2NCONH2(aq) + H2O(l)

urease−−−→ 2NH3(g) + CO2(g)

His discovery was ridiculed at ﬁrst because nobody believed that enzymes would behave the same way that other
chemicals did. Sumner was eventually proven right and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946.

Enzymes

An enzyme is a protein that acts as a biological catalyst. Recall that a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate
of a chemical reaction without itself being consumed in the reaction. Cellular processes consist of many chemical

1207

26.7. Enzymes

www.ck12.org

reactions that must occur quickly in order for the cell to function properly. Enzymes catalyze most of the chemical
reactions that occur in a cell. A substrate is the molecule or molecules on which the enzyme acts. In the urease
catalyzed reaction above, urea is the substrate. The Figure 26.17 diagrams a typical enzymatic reaction.

FIGURE 26.17
The sequence of steps for a substrate
binding to an enzyme in its active site, re-
acting, then being released as products.

The ﬁrst step in the reaction is that the substrate binds to a speciﬁc part of the enzyme molecule. The binding of the
substrate is dictated by the shape of each molecule. Side chains on the enzyme interact with the substrate in a speciﬁc
way, resulting in the making and breaking of bonds. The active site is the place on an enzyme where the substrate
binds. An enzyme folds in such a way that it typically has one active site, usually a pocket or crevice formed by
the folding pattern of the protein. Because the active site of an enzyme has such a unique shape, only one particular
substrate is capable of binding to that enzyme. In other words, each enzyme catalyzes only one chemical reaction
with only one substrate. Once the enzyme/substrate complex is formed, the reaction occurs and the substrate is
transformed into products. Finally, the product molecule or molecules are released from the active site. Note that the
enzyme is left unaffected by the reaction and is now capable of catalyzing the reaction of another substrate molecule.

Inhibitors

An inhibitor is a molecule which interferes with the function of an enzyme, either by slowing or stopping the
chemical reaction. Inhibitors can work in a variety of ways, but one of the most common is illustrated in the Figure
26.18.

FIGURE 26.18
A competitive inhibitor is a molecule that
binds to the active site of an enzyme with-
out reacting, thus preventing the substrate
from binding.

1208

www.ck12.org

Chapter 26. Biochemistry

The inhibitor binds competitively at the active site and blocks the substrate from binding. Since no reaction occurs
with the inhibitor, the enzyme is prevented from catalyzing the reaction. Cyanide is a potent poison which acts
as a competitive inhibitor. It binds to the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and interrupts cellular
respiration. The binding of the cyanide to the enzyme is irreversible and the affected organism dies quickly.

Non-competitive Inhibition

A non-competitive inhibitor does not bind at the active site. It attaches at some other site on the enzyme and changes
the shape of the protein. This shift in three-dimensional structure alters the shape of the active site so that the
substrate will no longer ﬁt in the site properly (see Figure 26.19).

FIGURE 26.19
Non-competitive inhibition

Cofactors

Some enzymes require the presence of a non-protein molecule called a cofactor in order to function properly.
Cofactors can be inorganic metal ions or small organic molecules. Many vitamins, such as B vitamins, act as
cofactors. Some metal ions which function as cofactors for various enzymes include zinc, magnesium, potassium,
and iron.

26.8 Triglycerides

• Describe the structure of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.
• Describe the structure of a triglyceride.
• Describe the role of triglycerides in diet.

Eat right or take a supplement?
There is a lot of interest these days on healthy diets and as well as concerns about heart problems. There is also a
strong market for the sales of omega-3 fatty acids, which are said to help lower fat levels in blood. But too many
people rely on the supplements to help their hearts and don’t understand the chemistry behind it all. Yes, taking
omega-3 fatty acids will give you some of the fatty acids your body requires. No, this is not a substitute for eating
a healthy diet and exercising. You can’t sit in front of the TV set, eating your large pizza, and expect these pills to
keep you healthy. You’ve got to do things the hard way –eat your vegetables and get some exercise. Yes, mother.

Triglycerides

A lipid is a member of a class of water-insoluble compounds that includes oils, fats, and waxes. Oils and fats are
based on the same general structure, but fats are solids at room temperature, while oils are liquids. Butter is an
example of a fat and is derived from animals. Some oils include olive oil and canola oil, which are obtained from
plants. Lipids are an essential part of a healthy diet, though excess dietary fat can be harmful. Lipids store energy in
the body and are also needed to keep cell membranes healthy.
One type of lipid is called a triglyceride, an ester derived from glycerol combined with three fatty acid molecules.
Glycerol is a triol, an alcohol which contains three hydroxyl functional groups. A fatty acid is a long carbon chain,
generally from 12 to 24 carbons in length, with an attached carboxyl group. Each of the three fatty acid molecules
undergoes an esteriﬁcation with one of the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol molecule. The result is a large triester
molecule referred to as a triglyceride.

1211

26.8. Triglycerides

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 26.20
Triglyceride components

Triglycerides function as a long-term storage form of energy in the human body. Because of the long carbon chains,
triglycerides are nearly nonpolar molecules and thus do not dissolve readily in polar solvents such as water. Instead,
oils and fats are soluble in nonpolar organic solvents such as hexane and ethers.
Fats may be either saturated or unsaturated. A saturated fat is a fat that consists of triglycerides whose carbon
chains consist entirely of carbon-carbon single bonds. Therefore, the carbon chains are saturated with the maximum
number of hydrogen atoms possible. An unsaturated fat is a fat that consists of triglycerides whose carbon chains
contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds. A fat with one double bond is called monounsaturated, while a
fat with multiple double bonds is called polyunsaturated (see Figure 26.21).

FIGURE 26.21
Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids

Unsaturated fat is generally considered to be healthier because it contains fewer calories than an equivalent amount
of saturated fat. Additionally, high consumption of saturated fats is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease. Some examples of foods with high concentrations of saturated fats include butter, cheese, lard, and some
fatty meats. Foods with higher concentrations of unsaturated fats include nuts, avocado, and vegetable oils such as
canola oil and olive oil. The Figure 26.22 shows the percentages of fat types in some common foods.

Do you feel anything now?
When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an
anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the
movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in
how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you
will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off.

Phospholipids

A phospholipid is a lipid that contains a phosphate group and is a major component of cell membranes. A
phospholipid consists of a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail (see Figure 26.23).
The phospholipid is essentially a triglyceride in which a fatty acid has been replaced by a phosphate group of some
sort.
Following the rule of “like dissolves like”, the hydrophilic head of the phospholipid molecule dissolves readily in
water. The long fatty acid chains of a phospholipid are nonpolar and thus avoid water because of their insolubility.
In water, phospholipids spontaneously form a double layer called a lipid bilayer in which the hydrophobic tails of
phospholipid molecules are sandwiched between two layers of hydrophilic heads (see Figure 26.24). In this way,
only the heads of the molecules are exposed to the water, while the hydrophobic tails interact only with each other.
Phospholipid bilayers are critical components of cell membranes. The lipid bilayer acts as a barrier to the passage
of molecules and ions into and out of the cell. However, an important function of the cell membrane is to allow
selective passage of certain substances into and out of cells. This is accomplished by the embedding of various
protein molecules in and through the lipid bilayer (see Figure 26.25). These proteins form channels through which
certain speciﬁc ions and molecules are able to move. Many membrane proteins also contain attached carbohydrates
on the outside of the lipid bilayer, allowing it to form hydrogen bonds with water.

fatty acids, which are hydrophobic and do
not dissolve in water.

Thar she blows!
From the 1700s up to the late 1900s, whalers searched the ocean for the sperm whale. Whaling was a dangerous
occupation – the prey averaged about ﬁfty feet in length. But when successful, the search was worth it. One
large whale could produce up to 500 gallons of oil, valuable for making candles, ointments, cosmetic creams, and
industrial lubricants. In 1988, sperm whales (and other whale species) were placed under international protection
because their numbers were diminishing rapidly. Today, various vegetable oils are used in place of whale oils.

Waxes

Another category of lipid molecule is waxes. Waxes are esters of long-chain fatty acids and long-chain alco-
hols. Waxes are soft solids with generally low melting points and are insoluble in water. The Figure 26.26 shows
the structure of cetyl palmitate, a natural wax present in sperm whales.
One of the best known natural waxes is beeswax, though many other animals and plants synthesize waxes natu-
rally. Waxes can be found on leaves of plants and on the skin, hair, or feathers of animals, where they function
to keep these structures pliable and waterproof. Humans take advantage of the protective properties of natural and
synthetic waxes in such applications as ﬂoor polish and car wax. Other common waxes include jojoba, carnauba,
and wool wax, which is also known as lanolin.

Treating Cancer with Chemistry
Cancer treatment is a complex and challenging effort. Cancer cells grow without the usual controls that act on
normal cells . One approach to treating cancer is to alter the structure of the DNA in order to slow down or stop the
growth of the abnormal cells. Compounds that structurally resemble the normal building blocks of DNA have been
shown to be very effective in stopping some forms of cancer from spreading throughout the body.

Nucleic Acids

The Swiss biochemist Friedrich Miescher ﬁrst discovered nitrogen-containing compounds in the nuclei of cells
in 1869. The term nucleic acid was used to describe these molecules because of their discovery within the cell
nucleus and because of the presence of phosphate groups and their relationship to phosphoric acid. A nucleic
acid is a large biopolymer consisting of many nucleotides. The two primary nucleic acids which are found in
cells are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA is the carrier of genetic information and
is ultimately responsible for how cells produce proteins in order to carry out all the functions necessary for life.
RNA is a related molecule that is involved in the mechanism by which the information stored in DNA is eventually
converted into protein molecules.
The basic components of nucleic acids are nucleotides. A nucleotide is a molecule that contains a ﬁve-carbon sugar,
a phosphate group, and a nitrogen containing base. The ﬁve-carbon sugar is either ribose, in the case of RNA, or
deoxyribose, in the case of DNA. The only difference between the two molecules is the presence of a hydroxyl group
attached to one member of the carbon ring in RNA. In DNA, that same carbon atom is attached only to a hydrogen

atom (see Figure 26.27). Note that in drawing the structure of organic molecules, the single hydrogen atoms are not
shown in the structure but are understood to be attached at each carbon point unless another molecule is shown.

FIGURE 26.27
The sugars ribose and deoxyribose are
components of RNA and DNA respec-
tively.

The nucleotides form the backbone of RNA and DNA. Each nucleotide consists of a base, a pentose (either ribose or
deoxyribose) and phosphate groups (see Figure 26.28). Three of the bases in RNA and DNA are identical (adenine,
cytosine, and guanine). Thymine is found in DNA while uracil is found in RNA.

You can’t win them all.
Linus Pauling was one of the greatest scientists of the twentieth century. A two-time Nobel Prize winner (in
chemistry in 1954 and the peace prize in 1962). However, he didn’t always come in ﬁrst. In the 1950s, there was
a great deal of interest in the structure of DNA. Pauling spent some time on this puzzle, although he was primarily
interested in proteins. The inadequate amount of information he had led him to propose a DNA structure where the
bases were on the outside and the phosphate groups were on the inside. It turns out that he was in error about this
idea, but it certainly did not take away from his outstanding scientiﬁc reputation.

DNA and RNA

The three parts of a DNA nucleotide are assembled as shown in the Figure 26.29.
Every DNA and RNA polymer consists of multiple nucleotides strung together into extremely long chains. The
only variation in each nucleotide is the identity of the nitrogenous base. The ﬁgure above shows one example of a
nitrogenous base, called adenine. There are only ﬁve different nitrogenous bases found in all nucleic acids. The four
bases of DNA are adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine, abbreviated A, T, C, and G respectively. In RNA, the
base thymine is not found and is instead replaced by a different base called uracil, abbreviated U. The other three
bases are present in both DNA and RNA.

The speciﬁc structure of DNA proved elusive to scientists for many years. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick
proposed that the structure of DNA consists of two side-by-side polynucleotide chains wrapped into the shape of a
double helix. One aspect of this structure is that each nitrogenous base on one of the DNA strands must be paired
up with another base on the opposite strand. The Figure 26.30 illustrates the base pairing. Each adenine base is
always paired with a thymine, while each cytosine is paired with a guanine. The bases ﬁt together perfectly from
one strand to the other and are also held together by hydrogen bonds. The A-T pairing contains two hydrogen bonds,
while the C-G pairing contains three hydrogen bonds. The ends of each strand are labeled either 3’ or 5’ based on a
numbering of the deoxyribose sugar ring.
The double helical structure of DNA is shown in the Figure 26.31.

26.13 Genetic Code

• Deﬁne gene.
• Describe the DNA triplet codes for amino acids.

Still Working On It
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 with the lofty goal of sequencing the complete set of human DNA.
This project was completed in April 2003, ahead of schedule and under the budget set for it (a rare occurrence for a
government project). With this knowledge, we can now identify genetic disorders quickly and personalize treatment
for many diseases. However, much work still remains to fully understand the connections between speciﬁc DNA
sequences and speciﬁc diseases.

The Genetic Code

Each particular organism contains many protein molecules that are speciﬁc to that organism. The particular base
sequence of DNA is responsible for the production of all of the different proteins that are present in each and
every living thing that has ever inhabited the Earth. How does that work? Cells use the unique sequence of DNA
bases to decide which proteins to synthesize. A gene is a segment of DNA that carries a code for making a speciﬁc
polypeptide chain. The cell essentially decodes the DNA in order to make whatever peptides and proteins are needed
by that organism.
The genetic code works as a series of three-letter codes. Each sequence of three letters, called a triplet, corresponds
to one of the twenty common amino acids. The triplets are read by the cell, one after the other, in the process
of protein synthesis. The Table 26.2 shows all of the possible triplets and the amino acids that result from each
three-letter code.

The DNA code word GCA corresponds to the amino acid arginine, while the DNA code word TCG corresponds to
the amino acid serine. Most amino acids are represented by more than one possible triplet code, but each triplet code
yields only one particular amino acid. Three of the DNA code words (TAA, TAG, and TGA) are stop or termination
code words. The translation of a DNA base sequence begins with a start code word and runs until a stop code word
is reached.
Even with only four different bases, the number of possible nucleotide sequences in a DNA chain is virtually limit-
less. The particular DNA sequence of a particular organism constitutes the genetic blueprint for that organism. This
genetic blueprint is found in the nucleus of each cell of the organism and is passed on from parents to offspring. The
incredible diversity of life on Earth stems from the differences in the genetic code of every living thing.

26.14 Protein Synthesis

• Describe the sequence of processes that take place in protein synthesis.

A Very Organized Process
The assembly line is an American invention that was developed around 1901 to mass-produce cars. Prior to that
time, teams of workers would build a car together. With the advent of the assembly line, cars could be produced
much more quickly and at lower cost. The assembly line idea quickly spread to other products, like the light bulbs
shown above. Being able to line up parts in order and have a smooth process for putting those parts together means
that an item can be produced quickly and reproducibly, coming out the same way every time.

Protein Synthesis

The process of protein synthesis is summarized in the diagram below. DNA produces an RNA template which
then directs the amino acids to be introduced into the growing protein chain in the proper sequence. A speciﬁc
transfer-RNA (tRNA) attaches to each speciﬁc amino acid and brings the amion acid to the RNA for incorporation.
The ﬁrst step in the process is transcription - the unfolding of DNA and the production of a messenger-RNA
(mRNA) strand. This step takes place in the nucleus of the cell.
The DNA uncoils and provides the pattern for the formation of a single strand of mRNA. After production of the
RNA, the DNA refolds into the original double helix. The mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm (outside the nucleus)
for further processing.
Amino acids will link with speciﬁc tRNA molecules for proper placement in the protein chain. The tRNA is a small
coiled molecule that accepts an amino acid on one end and matches up to a speciﬁc three-base portion of the mRNA
on the other end. The tRNA interacts with the mRNA so as to put the amino acid in the proper sequence for the
developing protein. After adding the amino acid to the sequence, the tRNA is then cleaved from the amino acid and
recycled for further use in the process.

Chapter 26. Biochemistry

The process of amino acid assembly takes place in the ribosome. This structure consists of two subunits containing
ribosomal RNA that enclose the mRNA and catalyze the formation of the amide linkages in the growing protein in
a process known as translation. When protein synthesis is complete, the two subunits dissociate and release the
completed protein chain.
The process of protein synthesis is fairly fast. Amino acids are added to the growing peptide chain at a rate of about
3-5 amino acids per second. A small protein (100-200 amino acids) can be produced in a minute or less.
