Introduction 	  What does it mean to be alive? Scientifically, there is an actual definition of living. Living organisms must have certain characteristics. If they do not have these characteristics, are they living? This butterfly, like all other insects, animals, plants, and every other living organism, shares common characteristics with all life. What exactly does it mean to be alive? This chapter will answer this question. These concepts will serve as an introduction to life science, discussing the basics of studying the life sciences and addressing the question, "What is a living organism?" 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  • Describe the role of a scientist. • Describe what is meant by "thinking like a scientist." What was that noise? If you let your emotions rule your thinking, you might think a thumping noise was a ghost. If you think like a scientist, however, you ask questions and make observations. You’d observe the shutters are loose and blowing in the wind. 
Scientific  Ways of  Thinking 	  Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world, based on observable evidence, reasoning, and repeated testing. That means scientists explain the world based on their own observations. If they develop new ideas about the way the world works, they set up a way to test these new ideas. 
Thinking  Like a  Scientist 	  A scientist is always trying to find the truth and discover new truths. How can you think like a scientist? Thinking like a scientist is based on asking and answering questions. Though you may not know it, you do this all day long. Scientists ask questions, and then make detailed observations to try to ask more specific questions and develop a hypothesis. They may design and perform an experiment to try to answer their question and test their hypothesis. From the results of their experiment, scientists draw conclusions. A conclusion describes what the evidence tells the scientist. • Scientists ask questions: The key to being a great scientist is to ask questions. Imagine you are a scientist in the African Congo. While in the field, you observe one group of healthy chimpanzees on the north side of the jungle. On the other side of the jungle, you find a group of chimpanzees that are mysteriously dying. What questions might you ask? A good scientist might ask the following two questions: • • Scientists make detailed observations: To observe means to watch and study attentively. A person untrained in the sciences may only observe, "The chimps on one side of the jungle are dying, while chimps on the other side of the jungle are healthy." A scientist, however, will make more detailed observations. Can you think of ways to make this observation more detailed? What about the number of chimps? Are they male or female? Young or old? What do they eat? A good scientist may observe, "While all seven adult females and three adult males on the north side of the jungle are healthy and show normal behavior, four female and five male chimps under the age of five on the south side have died." Detailed observations can ultimately help scientists design their experiments and answer their questions. From these observations, a scientist will develop a hypothesis to explain the observations. A hypothesis is the scientist’s proposed explanation for his observations. The scientist’s hypothesis may be that "Young chimps on the south side die due to a lack of nutrients in their diet." 
An adult and infant chimpanzee ( Pan 	  troglodytes). • Scientists find answers using tests: When scientists want to answer a question, they search for evidence using experiments. An experiment is a test to see if their explanation is right or wrong. Evidence is made up of the observations a scientist makes during an experiment. To study the cause of death in the chimpanzees, scientists may give the chimps nutrients in the form of nuts, berries, and vitamins to see if they are dying from a lack of food. This test is the experiment. If fewer chimps die, then the experiment shows that the chimps may have died from not having enough food. This is the evidence. • Scientists question the answers: Good scientists are skeptical. Scientists never use only one piece of evidence to form a conclusion. For example, the chimpanzees in the experiment may have died from a lack of food, but can you think of another explanation for their death? They may have died from a virus, or from another less obvious cause. More experiments need to be completed before scientists can be sure. Science is about finding the truth, no matter what. So good scientists constantly question their own conclusions. They also find other scientists to confirm or disagree with their evidence.

What kind of scientist studies dolphins? Dolphins are living organisms, so studying them is part of the life sciences. The life sciences, however, are broken down into many fields. Scientists that study dolphins and other life in the ocean are called marine biologists. 
Fields in the  Life  Sciences 	  The life sciences are the study of living organisms. They deal with every aspect of living organisms, from the biology of cells, to the biology of individual organisms, to how these organisms interact with other organisms and their environment. The life sciences are so complex that most scientists focus on just one or two subspecialties. If you want to study insects, what would you be called? An entomologist. If you want to study the tiny things that give us the flu, then you need to enter the field of virology, the study of viruses. If you want to study the nervous system, which life science field is right for you ( Table 1.1, Table 1.2, and Table 1.3)?

Cell biology is the study of cellular structure and function ( next. Molecular biology is the study of molecules, such as DNA and proteins. Ecologists study ecosystems, which are made of both living and nonliving parts of the environment. A botanist may work in a botanical garden, where plant life can be studied. What will you study with the other subspecialties? This illustration shows a virus among red blood cells. Which fields study red blood cells and viruses? (Keep in mind that viruses are actually much smaller than cells.) 
Other life science subspecialties include biogeography, which is the study 	  of where organisms live and at what abundance. 
Summary 	  • There are several subspecialties within the life sciences that focus on one type of organism, such as virology and bacteriology. • There are several fields of the life sciences that examine interactions between organisms and their environments, such as ecology.

Introduction to  Life  Science 	  • Explain the concepts of a hypothesis and scientific evidence. • Distinguish between a scientific theory and a scientific law. What causes disease? Today most people realize that microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, are the cause of disease. This concept is known as the germ theory of disease, one of the few scientific theories in the field of the life sciences. Although it seems obvious now, people did not always understand the cause of disease. How does a theory such as this become established? 
Scientific  Evidence and  Theories 	  One goal of a scientist is to find answers to scientific questions. To do this, scientists first develop a hypothesis, which is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation. To collect evidence to support (or disprove) their hypothesis, scientists must do experiments. Evidence is: For example, an apple falling to the ground is evidence in support of the law of gravity. A bear skeleton in the woods would be evidence of the presence of bears. 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  Looking at the image below might be confusing at first because this evidence seems to defy the law of gravity ( law, which is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions in nature. Scientific laws are developed from lots of collected information. Water going upward against gravity. If many experiments are performed, and lots of evidence is collected in support of a general hypothesis, a scientific theory can be developed. Scientific theories are well established explanations of evidence, usually tested and confirmed by many different people. Scientific theories usually have a lot of evidence in support of the theory, and no evidence disproving the theory. Scientific theories produce information that helps us understand our world. For example, the idea that matter is made up of atoms is a scientific theory. Scientists accept this theory as a fundamental principle of basic science. A scientific theory must stand up to all scientific testing. Thus, when scientists find new evidence, they can change their theories. In addition to the germ theory of disease, other scientific theories are the cell theory and the theory of evolution.

Introduction to  Life  Science 	  • Define and describe the scientific method. • Summarize the characteristics of a scientific hypothesis. • Develop a scientific hypothesis. • Explain the importance of communicating results. How do scientists obtain new knowledge? All the information in textbooks had to come from somewhere. In the sciences, new information about the natural world is a result of scientific investigations. These investigations are shaped by the scientific method. 
Scientific  Method 	  The scientific method is a process used to investigate the unknown ( Figure 1.5). It is the general process of a scientific investigation. This process uses evidence and testing. Scientists use the scientific method so they can find information. A common method allows all scientists to answer questions in a similar way. Scientists who use this method can reproduce another scientist’s experiments. Almost all versions of the scientific method include the following steps, although some scientists do use slight variations. 
Steps of a  Scientific  Investigation.  A scientific investigation typically has 	  these steps. 
Making  Observations 	  Imagine that you are a scientist. While collecting water samples at a local pond, you notice a frog with five legs instead of four ( Figure 1.6). As you start to look around, you discover that many of the frogs have extra limbs, extra eyes, or no eyes. One frog even has limbs coming out of its mouth. These are your observations, or things you notice about an environment using your five senses. A frog with an extra leg. 
Identify a  Question  Based on  Your  Observations 	  The next step is to ask a question about the frogs. You may ask, "Why are so many frogs deformed?" Or, "Is there something in their environment causing these defects, like water pollution?" Yet, you do not know if this large number of deformities is "normal" for frogs. What if many of the frogs found in ponds and lakes all over the world have similar deformities? Before you look for causes, you need to find out if the number and kind of deformities is unusual. So besides finding out why the frogs are deformed, you should also ask: "Is the percentage of deformed frogs in this pond greater than the percentage of deformed frogs in other places?" 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  A pond with frogs. 
Research  Existing  Knowledge  About the  Topic 	  No matter what you observe, you need to find out what is already known about your questions. For example, is anyone else doing research on deformed frogs? If yes, what did they find out? Do you think that you should repeat their research to see if it can be duplicated? During your research, you might learn something that convinces you to change or refine your question. From this, you will construct your hypothesis. 
Construct a  Hypothesis 	  A hypothesis is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation. A good hypothesis allows you to make more predictions. For example, you might hypothesize that a pesticide from a nearby farm is running into the pond and causing frogs to have extra legs. If that’s true, then you can predict that the water in a pond of non-deformed frogs will have lower levels of that pesticide. That’s a prediction you can test by measuring pesticide levels in two sets of ponds, those with deformed frogs and those with nothing but healthy frogs. Every hypothesis needs to be written in a way that it can: For example, do you think the following hypothesis meets the four criteria above? Let’s see. Hypothesis: "The number of deformed frogs in five ponds that are polluted with chemical X is higher than the number of deformed frogs in five ponds without chemical X." Of course, next you will have to test your hypothesis. 
Test  Your  Hypothesis 	  To test the hypothesis, an experiment will be done. You would count the healthy and deformed frogs and measure the amount of chemical X in all of the ponds. The hypothesis will be either true or false. Doing an experiment will test most hypotheses. The experiment may generate evidence in support of the hypothesis. The experiment may also generate evidence proving the hypothesis false. Once you collect your data, it will need to be analyzed. 
Analyze  Data and  Draw a  Conclusion 	  If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed, the experiment will produce results that you can measure, collect, and analyze. The analysis should tell you if the hypothesis is true or false. Refer to the table for the experimental results ( Table 1.4). 
Polluted  Pond 	  Average: 
Non- Polluted  Pond 	  Average: 
Frogs 	  Your results show that pesticide levels in the two sets of ponds are different, but the average number of deformed frogs is almost the same. Your results demonstrate that your hypothesis is false. The situation may be more complicated than you thought. This gives you new information that will help you decide what to do next. Even if the results supported your hypothesis, you would probably ask a new question to try to better understand what is happening to the frogs and why. 
Drawing  Conclusions and  Communicating  Results 	  If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed, the results will indicate whether your hypothesis is true or false. If a hypothesis is true, scientists will often continue testing the hypothesis in new ways to learn more. If a hypothesis is false, the results may be used to come up with and test a new hypothesis. A scientist will then communicate the results to the scientific community. This will allow others to review the information and extend the studies. The scientific community can also use the information for related studies. Scientists communicate their results in a number of ways. For example, they may talk to small groups of scientists and give talks at large scientific meetings. They will also write articles for scientific journals. Their findings may also be communicated to journalists. If you conclude that frogs are deformed due to a pesticide not previously measured, you would publish an article and give talks about your research. Your conclusion could eventually help find solutions to this problem.

Summary 	  • To study new problems, scientists use the scientific method; this includes making observations, forming a hypothesis, designing an experiment, and drawing conclusions. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  • Control Variables at URL (7:05) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Define basic science and applied science. • Distinguish between basic science and applied science. Why should we study the rainforest? Some scientists study problems that seem to have very little impact on our lives. For example, scientists are working to describe every type of plant and animal in the rainforest. What is the purpose? Many of our medicines come from plants and animals of the rainforest. So what medicines have not yet been discovered? There might be new cures to diseases yet to be identified. This is an example of how science can be applied to our lives. 
Basic and  Applied  Science 	  Science can be "basic" or "applied." The goal of basic science is to understand how things work—whether it is a single cell, an organism made of trillions of cells, or a whole ecosystem. Scientists working on basic science questions are simply looking to increase human knowledge of nature and the world around us. The knowledge obtained through the study of the subspecialties of the life sciences is mostly basic science. Basic science is the source of most scientific theories. For example, a scientist that tries to figure out how the body makes cholesterol, or what causes a particular disease, is performing basic science. This is also known as basic research. Additional examples of basic research would be investigating how glucose is turned into cellular energy or determining how elevated blood glucose levels can be harmful. The study of the cell (cell biology), the study of inheritance (genetics), the study of molecules (molecular biology), the study of microorganisms and viruses (microbiology and virology), the study of tissues and organs (physiology) are all types of basic research, and have all generated lots of information that is applied to humans and human health. 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  Applied science is using scientific discoveries, such as those from basic research, to solve practical problems. For example, medicine, and all that is known about how to treat patients, is applied science based on basic research ( science also creates new technologies based on basic science. For example, designing windmills to capture wind energy is applied science ( Figure 1.9). This technology relies, however, on basic science. Studies of wind patterns and bird migration routes help determine the best placement for the windmills. Surgeons operating on a person, an example of applied science. Windmills capturing energy, an example of applied science. 
Summary 	  • Basic science, such as understanding how cells work, is research aimed at understanding fundamental problems. • Applied science, such as the medical field, is the application of basic scientific knowledge to solve practical problems. • Applied science uses and applies information obtained through basic science.

Introduction to  Life  Science 	  • Describe how microscopes are used in the life sciences. • Identify how cells were first identified. How can we see the details of bacteria? With the naked eye, bacteria just look like a slimy smear on a petri dish. How can we study them in more detail? The invention of the microscope has allowed us to see bacteria, cells, and other things too small to be seen with the naked eye. 
The  Microscope 	  Microscopes, tools that you may get to use in your class, are some of the most important tools in biology ( Figure Microscopy is the study of small objects using microscopes. Look at your fingertips. Before microscopes were invented in 1595, the smallest things you could see on yourself were the tiny lines in your skin. But what else is hidden in your skin? 
Invention of the  Microscope 	  Over four hundred years ago, two Dutch spectacle makers, Zaccharias Janssen and his son Hans, were experimenting with several lenses in a tube. They discovered that nearby objects appeared greatly enlarged, or magnified. This was the forerunner of the compound microscope and of the telescope. In 1665, Robert Hooke, an English natural scientist, used a microscope to zoom in on a piece of cork the stuff that makes up the stoppers in wine bottles, which is made from tree bark. Inside of cork, he discovered tiny structures, which he called cells. It turns out that cells are the smallest structural unit of living organisms. This finding eventually 
Basic light microscopes opened up a new 	  world to curious people. led to the development of the theory that all living things are made of cells. Without microscopes, this discovery would not have been possible, and the cell theory would not have been developed. Hooke’s discovery of the cell set the stage for other scientists to discover other types of organisms. After Hooke, the "father of microscopy," Dutch scientist Antoine van Leeuwenhoek ( Figure 1.11) taught himself to make one of the first microscopes. In one of his early experiments, van Leeuwenhoek took a sample of scum from his own teeth and used his microscope to discover bacteria, the smallest living organism on the planet. Using microscopes, van Leeuwenhoek also discovered one-celled protists and sperm cells. Today, microscopes are used by all types of scientists, including cell biologists, microbiologists, virologists, forensic scientists, entomologists, taxonomists, and many other types. 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  Antoine van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch cloth merchant with a passion for microscopy. 
Types of  Microscopes 	  Some modern microscopes use light, as Hooke’s and van Leeuwenhoek’s did. Others may use electron beams or sound waves. Researchers now use these four types of microscopes: schools and laboratories are light microscopes. Light microscopes use lenses, typically made of glass or plastic, to focus light either into the eye, a camera, or some other light detector. The most powerful light microscopes can make images up to 2,000 times larger. image up to two million times bigger, with a very clear image. small objects, including a paperclip, a bedbug, or even an atom. These microscopes slide a beam of electrons across the surface of a specimen, producing detailed maps of the surface of objects. Magnification in a SEM can be controlled over a range from about 10 to 500,000 times. and medical research. A scanning electron microscope. 
Summary 	  • A microscope is a tool used to make things that are too small to be seen by the naked eye look bigger. • Types of microscopes include light microscopes, transmission electron microscopes (TEM), scanning electron microscopes (SEM), and scanning acoustic microscopes.

What does this sign mean? If a substance is corrosive, it can eat through objects. Many scientists have to work with chemicals that are corrosive or otherwise dangerous. That’s one reason that following safety precautions in the laboratory or field is very important. 
Safety in the  Life  Sciences 	  There can be some very serious safety risks in scientific research. If researchers are not careful, they could poison themselves or contract a deadly illness. The kinds of risks that scientists face depend on the kind of research they perform. For example, a scientist working with bacteria in a laboratory faces different risks than a scientist studying the behavior of lions in Africa, but both scientists must still follow safety guidelines. Safety practices must be followed when working with the hazardous things such as parasites, radiation and radioactive materials, toxins, and wild animals. Also, carcinogens, which are chemical that cause cancer, pathogens, which are disease-causing virus, bacteria or fungi, and teratogens, which are chemical that cause deformities in developing embryos, are extremely 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  hazardous, and extreme care must be used when working with these items as well. For example, scientists studying dangerous organisms such as Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, use special equipment that helps keep the organism from escaping the lab. A biohazard is any biological material that could make someone sick, including disease-causing organisms. Therefore, a used needle is a biohazard because it could harbor blood contaminated with a disease-causing organism. Bacteria grown in a laboratory are also biohazards if they could potentially cause disease. 
Science laboratory safety and chemical 	  hazard signs. 
Laboratory  Safety 	  If you perform an experiment in your classroom, your teacher will explain how to be safe. Professional scientists follow safety rules as well, especially for the study of dangerous organisms like the bacteria that cause bubonic plague ( Figure 1.14). Sharp objects, chemicals, heat, and electricity are all used at times in laboratories. Below is a list of safety guidelines that you should follow when in the laboratory: • Be sure to obey all safety guidelines given in lab instructions and by your teacher. • Follow directions carefully. • Tie back long hair. • Wear closed toe shoes with flat heels and shirts with no hanging sleeves, hoods, or drawstrings. • Use gloves, goggles, or safety aprons when instructed to do so. • Broken glass should only be cleaned up with a dust pan and broom. Never touch broken glass with your bare hands. • Never eat or drink anything in the science lab. Table tops and counters could have dangerous substances on them. • Be sure to completely clean materials like test tubes and beakers. Leftover substances could interact with other substances in future experiments. • If you are using flames or heat plates, be careful when you reach. Be sure your arms and hair are kept far away from heat. • Alert your teacher immediately if anything out of the ordinary occurs. An accident report may be required if someone is hurt. Also, the teacher must know if any materials are damaged or discarded. 
Scientists studying dangerous organisms 	  such as Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, use special equipment that helps keep the organism from escaping the lab. 
Field  Research  Safety 	  A field scientist studies an organism in a natural setting, which is not usually an indoor laboratory. Scientists who work outdoors are also required to follow safety regulations. These safety regulations are designed to prevent harm to themselves, other humans, animals, and the environment. If scientists work outside the country, they are required to learn about and follow the laws and restrictions of the country in which they are doing research. For example, entomologists following monarch butterfly ( Figure 1.15) migrations between the United States and Mexico must follow regulations in both countries. Before biologists can study protected wildlife or plant species, they must apply for permission to do so, usually from the government. This is important to protect these fragile species. For example, if scientists collect rare butterflies, they must first get a permit. They must also be careful to not disturb the habitat. 
Summary 	  • There are serious risks in scientific research, including carcinogens, biohazards, and toxins. • You need to carefully follow all safety rules while working in the laboratory.

Introduction to  Life  Science 	  • Define what it means to be living. • Know the five characteristics of living organisms. • Describe the five characteristics shared by all living organisms. • Identify the role of the five characteristics shared by all living organisms. • Summarize in detail the role of each characteristic in life. Is fire alive? Fire can grow. Fire needs fuel and oxygen. But fire is not a form of life, although it shares a few traits with some living things. How can you distinguish between non-living and living things? 
The  Characteristics of  Life 	  How do you define a living thing? What do mushrooms, daisies, cats, and bacteria have in common? All of these are living things, or organisms. It might seem hard to think of similarities among such different organisms, but they actually have many properties in common. Living organisms are similar to each other because all organisms evolved from the same common ancestor that lived billions of years ago. All living organisms: 
Living  Things  Need  Resources and  Energy 	  Why do you eat everyday? To get energy. Energy is the ability to do work. Without energy, you could not do any "work." Though not doing any "work" may sound nice, the "work" fueled by energy includes everyday activities, such as walking, writing, and thinking. But you are not the only one who needs energy. In order to grow and reproduce and carry out the other process of life, all living organisms need energy. But where does this energy come from? The source of energy differs for each type of living thing. In your body, the source of energy is the food you eat. Here is how animals, plants, and fungi obtain their energy: • All animals must eat in order to obtain energy. Animals also eat to obtain building materials. Animals eat • Plants don’t eat. Instead, they use energy from the sun to make their "food" through the process of photosynplants and other animals. thesis. • Mushrooms and other fungi obtain energy from other organisms. That’s why you often see fungi growing on a fallen tree; the rotting tree is their source of energy ( Figure 1.16). Since plants harvest energy from the sun and other organisms get their energy from plants, nearly all the energy of living things initially comes from the sun. Orange bracket fungi on a rotting log in the Oak Openings Preserve in Ohio. Fungi obtain energy from breaking down dead organisms, such as this rotting log. 
Living  Things  Are  Made of  Cells 	  If you zoom in very close on a leaf of a plant, or on the skin on your hand, or a drop of blood, you will find cells, you will find cells ( Figure 1.17). Cells are the smallest structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Most cells are so small that they are usually visible only through a microscope. Some organisms, like bacteria, plankton that live in the ocean, or the Paramecium, shown in Figure 1.18, are unicellular, made of just one cell. Other organisms have millions, billions, or trillions of cells. All cells have at least some structures in common, such as ribosomes, which are the sites where proteins are made. All cells also have DNA and proteins. The nucleus is clearly visible in the blood cells ( Figure 1.17). The nucleus can be described as the "information center," containing the instructions (DNA) for making all the proteins in a cell, as well as how much of each protein to make. The nucleus is also the main distinguishing feature between the two general categories of cell, with cells known as prokaryotic lacking a nucleus. 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  Although the cells of different organisms are built differently, they all have certain general functions. Every cell must get energy from food, be able to grow and divide, and respond to its environment. More about cell structure and function will be discussed in additional concepts. These cells show the characteristic nucleus. A few smaller cells are also visible. This image has been magnified 1000 times its real size. This Paramecium is a single-celled organism. 
Living  Organisms  Respond to their  Environment 	  All living organisms are able to react to something important or interesting in their external environment. For example, living organisms constantly respond to their environment. They respond to changes in light, heat, sound, and chemical and mechanical contact. Organisms have means for receiving information, such as eyes, ears, taste buds, or other structures. 
Living  Things  Grow and  Reproduce 	  All living things reproduce to make the next generation. Organisms that do not reproduce will go extinct. As a result, there are no species that do not reproduce ( Figure 1.19). Some organisms reproduce asexually ( asexual reproduction), especially single-celled organisms, and make identical copies (or clones) of themselves. Other organisms reproduce sexually ( sexual reproduction), combining genetic information from two parents to make genetically unique offspring.

Living  Things  Maintain  Stable  Internal  Conditions 	  When you are cold, what does your body do to keep warm? You shiver to warm up your body. When you are too warm, you sweat to release heat. When any living organism gets thrown off balance, its body or cells help it return to normal. In other words, living organisms have the ability to keep a stable internal environment. Maintaining a balance inside the body or cells of organisms is known as homeostasis. Like us, many animals have evolved behaviors that control their internal temperature. A lizard may stretch out on a sunny rock to increase its internal temperature, and a bird may fluff its feathers to stay warm ( Figure 1.20). 
Summary 	  • Living things are called organisms. • All living organisms need energy to carry out life processes, are composed of one or more cells, respond to their environment, grow, reproduce, and maintain a stable internal environment.

What’s happening in this beaker? The bubbles indicate that vapor is being formed, which lets you know that a chemical reaction is taking place. Many chemical reactions are going on constantly inside your body. In fact, there are probably thousands of chemical reactions occurring every second in every one of your cells. And as all living things are comprised of chemicals, understanding how chemicals work is essential to understanding how living things work. 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  If you pull a flower petal from a plant and break it in half, and then take that piece and break it in half again, and take the next piece and break it half, and so on, and so on, until you cannot even see the flower anymore, what do you think you will find? We know that the flower petal is made of cells, but what are cells made of? Scientists have broken down matter, or anything that takes up space and has mass—like a cell—into the smallest pieces that cannot be broken down anymore. Every physical object, including rocks, animals, flowers, and your body, are all made up of matter. Matter is made up of a mixture of things called elements. Elements are substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. There are more than 100 known elements, and 92 occur naturally around us. The others have been made only in the laboratory. Inside of elements, you will find identical atoms. An atom is the simplest and smallest particle of matter that still has chemical properties of the element. Atoms are the building block of all of the elements that make up the matter in your body or any other living or non-living thing. Atoms are so small that only the most powerful microscopes can see them. Atoms themselves are composed of even smaller particles, including positively charged protons, uncharged neutrons, and negatively charged electrons. Protons and neutrons are located in the center of the atom, or the nucleus, and the electrons move around the nucleus. How many protons an atom has determines what element it is. For example, hydrogen (H) has just one proton, helium (He) always has two protons ( Figure 1.21), while sodium (Na) always has 11. All the atoms of a particular element have the exact same number of protons, and the number of protons is that element’s atomic number. An atom usually has the same number of protons and electrons, but sometimes an atom may gain or lose an electron, giving the atom a positive or negative charge. These atoms are known as ions and are depicted with a "+" or "-" sign. Ions, such as H+, Na+, K+, or Cl− have significant biological roles. An atom of Helium (He) contains two positively charged protons (red), two uncharged neutrons (blue), and two negatively charged electrons (yellow). 
The  Periodic  Table 	  In 1869, a Russian scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev created the periodic table, which is a way of organizing elements according to their unique characteristics, like atomic number, density, boiling point, and other values ( Au stands for gold. The vertical columns in the periodic table are known as groups, and elements in groups tend to have very similar properties. The table is also divided into rows, known as periods. The periodic table groups the elements based on their properties. The table begins with Hydrogen, atomic number 
Chemical  Reactions 	  A molecule is any combination of two or more atoms. The oxygen in the air we breathe is two oxygen atoms connected by a chemical bond to form O2, or molecular oxygen. A carbon dioxide molecule is a combination of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, CO2. Because carbon dioxide includes two different elements, it is a compound as well as a molecule. A compound is any combination of two or more different elements. A compound has different properties from the elements that it contains. Elements and combinations of elements (compounds) make up all the many types of matter in the Universe. A chemical reaction is a process that breaks or forms the bonds between atoms of molecules and compounds. For example, two hydrogens and one oxygen bind together to form water, H2O. The molecules that come together to start a chemical reaction are the reactants. So hydrogen and oxygen are the reactants. The product is the end result of a reaction. In this example, water is the product. Atoms also come together to form compounds much larger than water. It is some of these large compounds that come together to form the basis of the cell. So essentially, your cells are made out of compounds, which are made out of atoms.

What makes up a healthy diet? A healthy diet includes protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Why? Because these compounds are three of the main building blocks that make up your body. You obtain these building blocks from the food that you eat, and you use these building blocks to make the organic compounds necessary for life. 
Organic  Compounds 	  The main chemical components of living organisms are known as organic compounds. Organic compounds are molecules built around the element carbon (C). Living things are made up of very large molecules. These large molecules are called macromolecules because “macro” means large; they are made by smaller molecules bonding together. Our body gets these smaller molecules, the "building blocks" or monomers, of organic molecules from the food we eat. Which organic molecules do you recognize from the list below? The four main types of macromolecules found in living organisms, shown in Table 1.5, are: 
Enzymes, muscle 	  fibers, antibodies 
C,  H,  	  Sugar, starch, cellulose 
Monosaccharides 	  (simple sugars) glucose, glycogen, 
C,  H,  O,  	  Fats, oils, waxes, steroids, phospholipids in membranes 
Often include fatty 	  acids 
Monomer 	  building molecule) (small block 
Carbohydrates 	  Carbohydrates are sugars, or long chains of sugars. An important role of carbohydrates is to store energy. Glucose ( Figure 1.23) is an important simple sugar molecule with the chemical formula C6H12O6. Simple sugars are known as monosaccharides. Carbohydrates also include long chains of connected sugar molecules. These long chains often consist of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharides bonded together to form polysaccharides. Plants store sugar in polysaccharides called starch. Animals store sugar in polysaccharides called glycogen. You get the carbohydrates you need for energy from eating carbohydrate-rich foods, including fruits and vegetables, as well as grains, such as bread, rice, or corn. A molecule of glucose, a type of carbohydrate. 
Proteins 	  Proteins are molecules that have many different functions in living things. All proteins are made of monomers called amino acids ( Figure 1.24) that connect together like beads on a necklace ( Figure 1.25). There are only making about 100,000 or more unique proteins in humans. Proteins can differ in both the number and order of amino acids. It is the number and order of amino acids that determines the shape of the protein, and it is the shape (structure) of the protein that determines the unique function of the protein. Small proteins have just a few hundred amino acids. The largest proteins have more than 25,000 amino acids. This model shows the general structure of all amino acids. Only the side chain, R, varies from one amino acid to another. KEY: H = hydrogen, N = nitrogen, C = carbon, O = oxygen, R = variable side chain. 
Amino acids connect together like beads 	  on a necklace. MET, ASN, TRP, and GLN refer to four different amino acids. Many important molecules in your body are proteins. Examples include enzymes, antibodies, and muscle fiber. Enzymes are a type of protein that speed up chemical reactions. They are known as "biological catalysts." For example, your stomach would not be able to break down food if it did not have special enzymes to speed up the rate of digestion. Antibodies that protect you against disease are proteins. Muscle fiber is mostly protein ( Figure 1.26). Muscle fibers are made mostly of protein. It’s important for you and other animals to eat food with protein, because we cannot make certain amino acids on our own. You can get proteins from plant sources, such as beans, and from animal sources, like milk or meat. When you eat food with protein, your body breaks the proteins down into individual amino acids and uses them to build new proteins. You really are what you eat! 
Lipids 	  Have you ever tried to put oil in water? They don’t mix. Oil is a type of lipid. Lipids are molecules such as fats, oils, and waxes. The most common lipids in your diet are probably fats and oils. Fats are solid at room temperature, whereas oils are fluid. Animals use fats for long-term energy storage and to keep warm. Plants use oils for longterm energy storage. When preparing food, we often use animal fats, such as butter, or plant oils, such as olive 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  oil or canola oil. There are many more type of lipids that are important to life. One of the most important are the phospholipids that make up the protective outer membrane of all cells ( Figure 1.27). These lipid membranes are impermeable to most water soluble compounds. 
Phospholipids in a membrane, shown as 	  two layers (a bilayer) of phospholipids facing each other. 
Nucleic acids 	  Nucleic acids are long chains of nucleotides. Nucleotides are made of a sugar, a nitrogen-containing base, and a phosphate group. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are the two main nucleic acids. DNA is a double-stranded nucleic acid. DNA is the molecule that stores our genetic information ( Figure 1.28). The single-stranded RNA is involved in making proteins. ATP (adenosine triphosphate), known as the "energy currency" of the cell, is also a nucleic acid.

Introduction to  Life  Science 	  • Explain the main contribution of Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus. • Define binomial nomenclature. • Summarize modern classification of living organisms. • Define a species. How would you classify a horse? It’s easy enough to classify the horse in the animal kingdom. That’s one level of classification. But what other groups does the horse belong to? Horses also belong to a class—the mammals. These animals all have fur and nurse their young. 
Classification of  Life 	  When you see an organism that you have never seen before, you probably put it into a group without even thinking. If it is green and leafy, you probably call it a plant. If it is long and slithers, you probably call it as a snake. How do you make these decisions? You look at the physical features of the organism and think about what it has in common with other organisms. Scientists do the same thing when they classify, or put into categories, living things. Scientists classify organisms not only by their physical features, but also by how closely related they are. Lions and tigers look like each other more than they look like bears, but are lions and tigers related? Evolutionarily speaking, yes. Evolution is the change in a species over time. Lions and tigers both evolved from a common ancestor. So it turns out that the two cats are actually more closely related to each other than to bears. How an organism looks and how it is related to other organisms determines how it is classified. 
Linnaean  System of  Classification 	  People have been concerned with classifying organisms for thousands of years. Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle developed a classification system that divided living things into several groups that we still use today, including mammals, insects, and reptiles. Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus (1707-1778) ( Figure 1.29) built on Aristotle’s work to create his own classification system. He invented the way we name organisms today, with each organism having a two word name. Linnaeus is considered the inventor of modern taxonomy, the science of naming and grouping organisms. In the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus invented the two-name system of naming organisms (genus and species) and introduced the most complete classification system then known. Linnaeus developed binomial nomenclature, a way to give a scientific name to every organism. In this system, each organism receives a two-part name in which the first word is the genus (a group of species), and the second word refers to one species in that genus. For example, a coyote’s species name is Canis latrans. Latrans is the species and Canis is the genus, a larger group that includes dogs, wolves, and other dog-like animals. Here is another example: the red maple, Acer rubra, and the sugar maple, Acer saccharum, are both in the same genus and they look similar ( Figure 1.30). Notice that the genus is capitalized and the species is not, and that the whole scientific name is in italics. Tigers (Panthera tigris) and lions (Panthera leo) have the same genus name, but are obviously different species. The names may seem strange, but the names are written in a language called Latin. 
These leaves are from two different 	  species of trees in the Acer, or maple, genus. The green leaf (far left) is from the sugar maple, and the red leaf (center) are from the red maple. One of the characteristics of the maple genus is winged seeds (far right). 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  Modern taxonomists have reordered many groups of organisms since Linnaeus. The main categories that biologists use are listed here from the most specific to the least specific category ( Figure 1.31). All organisms can be classified into one of three domains, the least specific grouping. The three domains are Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The Kingdom is the next category after the Domain. All life is divided among six kingdoms: Kingdom Bacteria, Kingdom Archaea, Kingdom Protista, Kingdom Plantae, Kingdom Fungi, and Kingdom Animalia. 
This diagram illustrates the classification 	  categories for organisms, with the broadest category (kingdom) at the bottom, and the most specific category (species) at the top. We are Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus of great apes that includes modern humans and closely related species, and sapiens is the only living species of the genus. 
Defining a  Species 	  Even though naming species is straightforward, deciding if two organisms are the same species can sometimes be difficult. Linnaeus defined each species by the distinctive physical characteristics shared by these organisms. But two members of the same species may look quite different. For example, people from different parts of the world sometimes look very different, but we are all the same species ( Figure 1.32). So how is a species defined? A species is defined as a group of similar individuals that can interbreed with one another and produce fertile offspring. A species does not produce fertile offspring with other species. 
Summary 	  • Scientists have defined several major categories for classifying organisms: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. • The scientific name of an organism consists of its genus and species. 
These children are all members of the 	  same species, Homo sapiens.

Introduction to  Life  Science 	  • Distinguish between the three domains of life. • List the four Eukarya kingdoms. What do you have in common with pond scum? Humans are in the same domain as trees and algae, which makes up the "pond scum" you see here. What could they possibly have in common? It is the location of their DNA inside their cells. Their cells all have a nucleus that is home to their genetic material. 
The  Domains of  Life 	  Let’s explore the domain, the least specific category of classification. All of life can be divided into three domains, based on the type of cell of the organism: 
Archaea and  Bacteria 	  The Archaea and Bacteria domains ( Figure 1.33) are both entirely composed of small, single-celled organisms and seem very similar, but they also have significant differences. Both are composed of prokaryotic cells, which are cells without a nucleus. In addition, both domains are composed of species that reproduce asexually ( asexual 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  reproduction) by dividing in two. Both domains also have species with cells surrounded by a cell wall, however, the cell walls are made of different materials. Bacterial cell walls contain the polysaccharide peptidoglycan. Lastly, Archaea often live in extreme environments including hot springs, geysers, and salt flats. Bacteria do not live in these environments. 
The  Group  A  Streptococcus organism 	  (left) is in the domain Bacteria, one of the three domains of life. The Halobacterium (right) is in the domain Archaea, another one of the three domains. 
Eukarya 	  All of the cells in the domain Eukarya keep their genetic material, or DNA, inside the nucleus. The domain Eukarya is made up of four kingdoms: synthesis. organisms. These organisms absorb their nutrients from other organisms. from tiny ants to the largest whales, and include arthropods, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals ( Figure fungi are. Protists are all the eukaryotic organisms that do not fit into one of the other three kingdoms. They include many kinds of microscopic one-celled (unicellular) organisms, such as algae and plankton, but also giant seaweeds that can grow to be 200 feet long. Plants, animals, fungi, and protists might seem very different, but remember that if you look through a microscope, you will find similar cells with a membrane-bound nucleus in all of them. These are eukaryotic cells. These cells also have membrane-bound organelles, which prokaryotic cells lack. The main characteristics of the three domains of life are summarized in Table 1.6.

Introduction to  Life  Science 	  extremophiles are not the only members of this domain.) • Explain why viruses are not considered living. • Describe the features and list examples of viruses. What causes the common cold? That miserable cough and runny nose is caused by one villain: a virus. Viruses come in many different shapes, including the prickly balls you see here. They are so tiny that they can only be seen with a very powerful microscope. What is a Virus? We have all heard of viruses. The flu, the common cold, and many other diseases are caused by viruses. But what is a virus? Do you think viruses are living? Which domain do they belong to? Bacteria? Archaea? Eukarya? Are Viruses Alive? The answer is actually “no.” A virus is essentially DNA or RNA surrounded by a coat of protein ( Figure 1.35). It is not made of a cell, and cannot maintain a stable internal environment ( homeostasis). Recall that a cell is the basic unit of living organisms. So if a virus is not made of at least one cell, can it be living? Viruses also cannot reproduce on their own—they need to infect a host cell to reproduce. So a virus is very different from any of the organisms that fall into the three domains of life. Though viruses are not considered living, they share two important traits with living organisms. They have genetic material like all cells do (though they are not made of cells), and they can evolve. The genetic material of a virus 
Introduction to  Life  Science 	  can change (mutate), altering the traits of the virus. As the process of evolution has resulted in all life on the planet today, the classification of viruses has been controversial. It calls into question the very definition of life. 
These little "alien" looking creatures are 	  viruses, and these specific viruses infect 
Escherichia coli bacteria.  Shown is a 	  representation of viruses infecting a cell. 
The virus lands on the outside of the cell 	  and injects its genetic material into the cell. 
Replication 	  Viruses infect a variety of organisms, including plants, animals, and bacteria, injecting its genetic material into a cell of the host organism. Once inside the host cell, they use the cell’s own ATP (energy), ribosomes, enzymes, and other cellular parts to make copies of themselves. The host cell makes a copy of the viral DNA and produces viral proteins. These are then packaged into new viruses. So viruses cannot replicate or reproduce on their own; they rely on a host cell to make additional viruses. 
Viruses and  Human  Disease 	  Viruses cause many human diseases. In addition to the flu and the common cold, viruses cause rabies, diarrheal diseases, AIDS, cold sores, and many other diseases ( Figure 1.36). Viral diseases range from mild to fatal.

Summary 	  Biology is the study of life, so the Life Sciences are essentially, the study of biology. The scientific method is the process by which biological information, like that of all other sciences, has been identified. This has resulted in a number of important biological scientific theories, including the cell theory and the theory of evolution. All life is built around the element carbon, and four categories of organic compounds: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. One particular type of protein, enzymes, are biological catalysts, allowing biochemical reactions to proceed at the rate necessary to maintain life. All life can be classified into three domains. All members of these domains share characteristics in common. Viruses do not share all of the characteristics of life, and so many scientists do not consider viruses to be living.

Introduction 	  What is a cell? It could easily be said that a cell is the fundamental unit of life, the smallest unit capable of life or the structural and functional unit necessary for life. But whatever it is, a cell is necessary for life. And as shown above, a cell may be filled with all sorts of structures, each with its own specific function. This concept will discuss some of the fundamental properties of the cell, with lessons that include the cell structure, transport in and out of the cell, energy metabolism, and cell division and reproduction. • Explain how cells are observed. • Define cell. Describe the general role of a cell. • State the three main parts of the cell theory. • Summarize the structure-function relationship of a cell. • Explain the levels of organization in an organism. What are you made of? Cells make up all living things, including your own body. This picture shows a typical group of cells. But not all cells look alike. Cells can differ in shape and sizes. And the different shapes usually means different functions. 
Introduction to  Cells 	  A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism. Some organisms, like bacteria, consist of only one cell. Big organisms, like humans, consist of trillions of cells. Compare a human to a banana. On the outside, they look very different, but if you look close enough you’ll see that their cells are actually very similar. 
Observing  Cells 	  Most cells are so small that you cannot see them without the help of a microscope. It was not until 1665 that English scientist Robert Hooke invented a basic light microscope and observed cells for the first time, by looking at a piece of cork. You may use light microscopes in the classroom. You can use a light microscope to see cells ( Figure 2.1). But many structures in the cell are too small to see with a light microscope. So, what do you do if you want to see the tiny structures inside of cells? In the 1950s, scientists developed more powerful microscopes. A light microscope sends a beam of light through a specimen, or the object you are studying. A more powerful microscope, called an electron microscope, passes a The outline of onion cells are visible under a light microscope. beam of electrons through the specimen. Sending electrons through a cell allows us to see its smallest parts, even the parts inside the cell ( Figure 2.2). Without electron microscopes, we would not know what the inside of a cell looked like. An electron microscope allows scientists to see much more detail than a light microscope, as with this sample of pollen. 
Cell  Theory 	  In 1858, after using microscopes much better than Hooke’s first microscope, Rudolf Virchow developed the hypothesis that cells only come from other cells. For example, bacteria, which are single-celled organisms, divide in half (after they grow some) to make new bacteria. In the same way, your body makes new cells by dividing the cells you already have. In all cases, cells only come from cells that have existed before. This idea led to the development of one of the most important theories in biology, the cell theory. Cell theory states that: As with other scientific theories, many hundreds, if not thousands, of experiments support the cell theory. Since Virchow created the theory, no evidence has ever been identified to contradict it. 
Specialized  Cells 	  Although cells share many of the same features and structures, they also can be very different ( Figure 2.3). Each cell in your body is designed for a specific task. In other words, the cell’s function is partly based on the cell’s structure. For example: • Red blood cells are shaped with a pocket that traps oxygen and brings it to other body cells. • Nerve cells are long and stringy in order to form a line of communication with other nerve cells, like a wire. Because of this shape, they can quickly send signals, such as the feeling of touching a hot stove, to your brain. • Skin cells are flat and fit tightly together to protect your body. As you can see, cells are shaped in ways that help them do their jobs. Multicellular (many-celled) organisms have many types of specialized cells in their bodies. 
Red blood cells (left) are specialized to 	  carry oxygen in the blood. Neurons (center) are shaped to conduct electrical impulses to many other nerve cells. These epidermal cells (right) make up the “skin” of plants. Note how the cells fit tightly together. 
Levels of  Organization 	  While cells are the basic units of an organism, groups of cells can perform a job together. These cells are called specialized because they have a special job. Specialized cells can be organized into tissues. For example, your liver cells are organized into liver tissue. Your liver tissue is further organized into an organ, your liver. Organs are formed from two or more specialized tissues working together to perform a job. All organs, from your heart to your liver, are made up of an organized group of tissues. These organs are part of a larger system, the organ systems. For example, your brain works together with your spinal cord and other nerves to form the nervous system. This organ system must be organized with other organ systems, such as the circulatory system and the digestive system, for your body to work. Organ systems work together to form the entire organism. There are many levels of organization in living things ( Figure 2.4). Levels of organization, from the atom (smallest) to the organism (largest). Notice that organelles are inside a cell, and organs are inside an organism. 
Summary 	  • Cells were first observed under a light microscope, but today’s electron microscopes allow scientists to take a closer look at the inside of cells. • Cell theory says that: – All organisms are composed of cells. – Cells are alive and the basic living units of organization in all organisms. – All cells come from other cells. • Cells are organized into tissues, which are organized into organs, which are organized into organ systems, which are organized to create the whole organism.

Explain your thinking fully. study endosymbiosis.) • Distinguish between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. • Define an organelle. • Describe the main role of the nucleus Are bacteria cells like our cells? Yes and no. Bacteria cells are similar to our cells in some ways. Like our cells, bacteria cells have DNA and a plasma membrane. But bacteria are unique in other ways. They are called prokaryotic cells because of these differences. 
Prokaryotic and  Eukaryotic 	  There are two basic types of cells, prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. The main difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells is that eukaryotic cells have a nucleus. The nucleus is where cells store their DNA, which is the genetic material. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane. Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus. Instead, their DNA floats around inside the cell. Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes. All prokaryotes are single-celled (unicellular) organisms. Bacteria and Archaea are the only prokaryotes. Organisms with eukaryotic cells are called eukaryotes. Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes. All multicellular organisms are eukaryotes. Eukaryotes may also be single-celled. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have structures in common. All cells have a plasma membrane, ribosomes, cytoplasm, and DNA. The plasma membrane, or cell membrane, is the phospholipid layer that surrounds the cell and protects it from the outside environment. Ribosomes are the non-membrane bound organelles where proteins are made, a process called protein synthesis. The cytoplasm is all the contents of the cell inside the cell membrane, not including the nucleus. 
Eukaryotic  Cells 	  Eukaryotic cells usually have multiple chromosomes, composed of DNA and protein. Some eukaryotic species have just a few chromosomes, others have close to 100 or more. These chromosomes are protected within the nucleus. In addition to a nucleus, eukaryotic cells include other membrane-bound structures called organelles. Organelles allow eukaryotic cells to be more specialized than prokaryotic cells. Pictured below are the organelles of eukaryotic cells ( Figure 2.9), including the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. These will be discussed in additional concepts. special 
Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and 	  compartments various other surrounded called organelles. The nucleus is where the 
A (chromatin) is stored.  Organelles 	  give eukaryotic cells more functions than prokaryotic cells. by membranes, 
Prokaryotic  Cells 	  Prokaryotic cells ( Figure 2.6) are usually smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells. They do not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. In prokaryotic cells, the DNA, or genetic material, forms a single large circle that coils up on itself. The DNA is located in the main part of the cell. 
Plants, animals, fungi 	  Prokaryotes do not have a nucleus. Instead, their genetic material is located in the main part of the cell. 
Summary 	  • All cells have a plasma membrane, ribosomes, cytoplasm, and DNA. • Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound structures. • Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound structures called organelles. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Compare Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells at URL (1:55) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Describe the roles of the plasma membrane and cytosol. • Explain the concept of semipermeability. • Summarize how the plasma membrane separates the cytosol from the outside environment. Who guards your cells? Not everything can make it into your cells. Your cells have a plasma membrane that helps to guard your cells from unwanted intruders. 
The  Plasma  Membrane and  Cytosol 	  If the outside environment of a cell is water-based, and the inside of the cell is also mostly water, something has to make sure the cell stays intact in this environment. What would happen if a cell dissolved in water, like sugar does? Obviously, the cell could not survive in such an environment. So something must protect the cell and allow it to survive in its water-based environment. All cells have a barrier around them that separates them from the environment and from other cells. This barrier is called the plasma membrane, or cell membrane. 
The  Plasma  Membrane 	  The plasma membrane ( Figure 2.7) is made of a double layer of special lipids, known as phospholipids. The phospholipid is a lipid molecule with a hydrophilic ("water-loving") head and two hydrophobic ("water-hating") tails. Because of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the phospholipid, the molecule must be arranged in a specific pattern as only certain parts of the molecule can physically be in contact with water. Remember that there is water outside the cell, and the cytoplasm inside the cell is mostly water as well. So the phospholipids are arranged in a double layer (a bilayer) to keep the cell separate from its environment. Lipids do not mix with water (recall that oil is a lipid), so the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane acts as a barrier, keeping water out of the cell, and keeping the cytoplasm inside the cell. The cell membrane allows the cell to stay structurally intact in its water-based environment. The function of the plasma membrane is to control what goes in and out of the cell. Some molecules can go through the cell membrane to enter and leave the cell, but some cannot. The cell is therefore not completely permeable. "Permeable" means that anything can cross a barrier. An open door is completely permeable to anything that wants to enter or exit through the door. The plasma membrane is semipermeable, meaning that some things can enter the cell, and some things cannot. 
Plasma membranes are primarily made 	  up of phospholipids (orange). The hydrophilic ("water-loving") head and two hydrophobic ("water-hating") tails are shown. The phospholipids form a bilayer (two layers). The middle of the bilayer is an area without water. There can be water on either side of the bilayer. There are many proteins throughout the membrane. 
Cytosol 	  The inside of all cells also contain a jelly-like substance called cytosol. Cytosol is composed of water and other molecules, including enzymes, which are proteins that speed up the cell’s chemical reactions. Everything in the cell sits in the cytosol, like fruit in a jello mold. The term cytoplasm refers to the cytosol and all of the organelles, the specialized compartments of the cell. The cytoplasm does not include the nucleus. As a prokaryotic cell does not have a nucleus, the DNA is in the cytoplasm.

Where is your DNA? You may know that a criminal can easily leave DNA at a crime scene. How? DNA is found in every cell of your body. In each cell there is a nucleus, which is home to your DNA. So if a criminal has a cut, and blood is left at the crime scene, or a hair falls out and is left behind, then DNA will also be left at the scene. 
The  Nucleus 	  The nucleus is only found in eukaryotic cells. It contains most of the genetic material (the DNA) of the cell. The genetic material of the nucleus is like a set of instructions. These instructions tell the cell how to build molecules needed for the cell to function properly. That is, the DNA tells the cell how to build molecules needed for life. The nucleus is surrounded by the nuclear envelope, a double membrane (two phospholipid bilayers) that controls what goes in and out of the nucleus. The nucleus also has holes embedded in the nuclear envelope. These holes are known as nuclear pores, and they allow things to flow in and out of the nucleus. 
Chromosomes 	  Inside of the nucleus, you will find the chromosomes. Chromosomes are strands of DNA wrapped around proteins. They contain genes, or small units of genetic material (DNA) that contains the code for the creation of a protein. Human cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). There are hundreds to thousands of genes on each chromosome. 
Nucleolus 	  The nucleus of many cells also contains a central region called the nucleolus. The job of the nucleolus is to build ribosomes. These ribosomes flow out the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm. Ribosomes are organelles that make proteins in the cytoplasm. See the composition of the nucleus pictured below ( Figure 2.8). In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is kept in the nucleus. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. Within the nucleus is the nucleolus. 
Summary 	  • The nucleus contains the genetic material of the cell. • The genetic material of the cell is found in chromosomes, DNA wrapped around proteins. • The nucleolus, which makes ribosomes, is also within the nucleus.

Do brain cells have the same internal structures as your other cells? Yes. Although brain cells look quite different from your other cells, they have the same internal structures as other cells. They need the same structures because they need to perform the same tasks, such as making proteins and obtaining energy. 
Organelles 	  Eukaryotic cells have many specific functions, so it can be said that a cell is like a factory. A factory has many machines and people, and each has a specific role. Just like a factory, the cell is made up of many different parts. Each part has a special role. The different parts of the cell are called organelles, which means "small organs." All organelles are found in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are "simpler" than eukaryotic cells. Though prokaryotic cells still have many functions, they are not as specialized as eukaryotic cells, lacking membrane-bound organelles. Thus, most organelles are not found in prokaryotic cells. Below are the main organelles found in eukaryotic cells ( Figure 2.9): material (DNA), the information needed to build thousands of proteins. is produced, providing the energy needed to power chemical reactions. This process, known as cellular respiration, produces energy is in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Cells that use a lot of energy may have thousands of mitochondria. and nutrients in their large central vacuoles. enzymes that break down old molecules into parts that can be recycled. made. Ribosomes are like the machines in the factory that produce the factory’s main product. Proteins are the main product of the cell. freely in the cytoplasm. If the ER is covered with ribosomes, it looks bumpy like sandpaper, and is called the rough endoplasmic reticulum. If the ER does not contain ribosomes, it is smooth and called the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Many proteins are made on the ribosomes on the rough ER. These proteins immediately enter the ER, where they are modified, packaged into vesicles and sent to the Golgi apparatus. Lipids are made in the smooth ER. puts "shipping addresses" on them. The Golgi then packages the proteins into vesicles and sends them to the right place in the cell or to the cell membrane. Some of these proteins are secreted from the cell (they exit the cell); others are placed into the cell membrane. Eukaryotic cells contain special compartments surrounded by membranes, called organelles. For example, notice in this image the mitochondria, lysosomes, and Golgi apparatus. Also, the cytoskeleton gives the cell its shape, and the flagella helps the cell to move. Prokaryotic cells may also have flagella. 
Summary 	  • The nucleus stores the genetic information. • The vacuoles are needed for storage. • The lysosomes recycle waste. • The cytoskeleton provides the shape of the cell. • The ribosomes produce proteins. • The rough ER is covered with ribosomes and makes proteins, while the smooth ER makes lipids. • The Golgi apparatus packages proteins.

Do plants have cells like yours? Yes, your cells are actually very similar to a plant’s cells. For example, they are both eukaryotic cells, both contain DNA in a nucleus, and both make proteins in ribosomes. However, plant cells also differ in some crucial ways from your own cells. 
Plant  Cells 	  Even though plants and animals are both eukaryotes, plant cells differ in some ways from animal cells ( Figure organelles of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis converts the sun’s solar energy into chemical energy. This chemical energy, which is the carbohydrate glucose, serves as "food" for the plant. 
Vacuoles 	  First, plant cells have a large central vacuole that holds a mixture of water, nutrients, and wastes. A plant cell’s vacuole can make up 90% of the cell’s volume. The large central vacuole essentially stores water. In animal cells, vacuoles are much smaller. 
A plant cell has several features that make 	  it different from an animal cell, including a cell wall, huge vacuoles, and chloroplasts, which photosynthesize. 
Cell  Wall 	  Second, plant cells have a cell wall, while animal cells do not ( Figure 2.11). The cell wall surrounds the plasma membrane but does not keep substances from entering or leaving the cell. A cell wall gives the plant cell strength and protection. 
In this photo of plant cells taken with 	  a light microscope, you can see green chloroplasts, as well as a cell wall around each cell. 
Plastids 	  A third difference between plant and animal cells is that plants have several kinds of organelles called plastids. And there are several different kinds of plastids in plant cells. For example, Chloroplasts are needed for photosynthesis, leucoplasts can store starch or oil, and brightly colored chromoplasts give some flowers and fruits their yellow, orange, or red color. It is the presence of chloroplasts and the ability to photosynthesize, that is one of the defining features of a plant. No animal or fungi can photosynthesize, and only some protists are able to. The photosynthetic protists are the plant-like protists, represented mainly by the unicellular algae.

How is a cell membrane like a castle wall? The walls of a castle, like the cell membrane, are designed to keep out dangerous things. Whether you’re concerned about an enemy army or a disease-causing bacteria, you don’t want to allow everything to enter! However, in order to survive, there are some things that the cell (or the castle) does need to let in. 
Introduction to  Cell  Transport 	  Cells are found in all different types of environments, and these environments are constantly changing. For example, one-celled organisms, like bacteria, can be found on your skin, in the ground, or in all different types of water. Therefore, cells need a way to protect themselves. This job is done by the cell membrane, which is also known as the plasma membrane. 
Controlling the  Cell  Contents 	  The cell membrane is semipermeable, or selectively permeable, which means that only some molecules can pass through the membrane. If the cell membrane were completely permeable, the inside of the cell would be the same as the outside of the cell. It would be impossible for the cell to maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis means maintaining a stable internal environment. For example, if your body cells have a temperature of 98.6◦F, and it is freezing outside, your cells will maintain homeostasis if the temperature of the cells stays the same and does not drop with the outside temperature. How does the cell ensure it is semipermeable? How does the cell control what molecules enter and leave the cell? The composition of the cell membrane helps to control what can pass through it. 
Composition of the  Cell  Membrane 	  Molecules in the cell membrane allow it to be semipermeable. The membrane is made of a double layer of phospholipids (a "bilayer") and proteins ( Figure below). Recall that phospholipids, being lipids, do not mix with water. It is this quality that allows them to form the outside barrier of the cell. A single phospholipid molecule has two parts: The cell membrane is made up of a phospholipid bilayer, two layers of phospholipid molecules. Notice the polar head group of the phospholipid is attached to the phosphate, and the tails are two fatty acid chains. The head group and tails are attached by a glycerol backbone. There is water found on both the inside and the outside of cells. Since hydrophilic means water-loving, and they want to be near water, the heads face the inside and outside of the cell where water is found. The water-fearing, hydrophobic tails face each other in the middle of the cell membrane, because water is not found in this space. The phospholipid bilayer allows the cell to stay intact in a water-based environment. An interesting quality of the plasma membrane is that it is very "fluid" and constantly moving, like a soap bubble. This fluid nature of the membrane is important in maintaining homeostasis. It allows the proteins in the membrane to float to areas where they are needed. Due to the composition of the cell membrane, small molecules such as oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass freely through the membrane, but other molecules, especially large molecules, cannot easily pass through the plasma membrane. These molecules need assistance to get across the membrane. That assistance will come in the form of transport proteins. 
Summary 	  • The cell membrane is selectively permeable, meaning only some molecules can get through. • The cell membrane is made of a double layer of phospholipids, each with a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail.

What happens if you put a few drops of food coloring in water? Over time, the molecules of color spread out through the rest of the water. When the molecules are evenly spread throughout the space, the water will become an even color. This process of molecules moving from an area where there are lots of molecules to an area where there are fewer molecules is known as diffusion. 
Diffusion 	  Small molecules can pass through the plasma membrane through a process called diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area where there is a higher concentration (larger amount) of the substance to an area where there is a lower concentration (lower amount) of the substance ( Figure 2.13). The amount of a substance in relation to the total volume is the concentration. During diffusion, molecules are said to flow down their concentration gradient, flowing from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Molecules flowing down a concentration gradient is a natural process and does not require energy. Diffusion can occur across a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membrane, as long as a concentration gradient exists. Molecules will continue to flow in this manner until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium, there is no longer an area of high concentration or low concentration, and molecules flow equally in both directions across the semipermeable membrane. At equilibrium, equal amounts of a molecule are entering and leaving a cell. 
Diffusion is the movement of a substance 	  from an area of a higher amount toward an area of lower amount. A concentration gradient initially exists across the cell membrane. Equilibrium is reached when there is an equal amount of the substance on both sides of the membrane. 
Osmosis 	  The diffusion of water across a membrane because of a difference in concentration is called osmosis. Let’s explore three different situations and analyze the flow of water. If a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water will move into the material than the inside of the cell. cell. This causes the cell to swell, and it may even burst. the cell. If a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water will leave the cell. This can cause a cell to shrink and shrivel. of the cell. Water still flows in both directions, but an equal amount enters and leaves the cell. 
Applications of  Osmosis 	  How do marine animals keep their cells from shrinking? How do you keep your blood cells from bursting? Both of these questions have to do with the cell membrane and osmosis. Marine animals live in salt water, which is a hypertonic environment; there is more salt in the water than in their cells. To prevent losing too much water from their bodies, these animals intake large quantities of salt water and then secrete the excess salt. Red blood cells can be kept from bursting or shriveling if put in a solution that is isotonic to the blood cells. If the blood cells were put in pure water, the solution would be hypotonic to the blood cells, so water would enter the blood cells, and they would swell and burst ( Figure 2.14). 
Osmosis causes these red blood cells to 	  change shape by losing or gaining water.

Can any molecule move freely through your cell membranes? The cell regulates most molecules that pass through the cell membrane. If a molecule is charged or very big, it won’t make it through the cell membrane on its own. However, small, non-charged molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water, can pass through the cell membrane freely. 
Passive  Transport 	  Recall that the cell membrane is semipermeable. It does not allow everything to pass through. Some molecules can pass easily through your cell membranes, while others have more difficulty. Sometimes molecules need the help of special transport proteins to move across the cell membrane. Some molecules even need an input of energy to help get them across the cell membrane. The movement of molecules across a membrane without the input of energy is known as passive transport. When energy (ATP) is needed, the movement is known as active transport. Active transport moves molecules against their concentration gradient, from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. 
Simple  Diffusion 	  One example of passive transport is diffusion, when molecules move from an area of high concentration (large amount) to an area of low concentration (low amount). Molecules are said to naturally flow down their concentration gradient. This type of diffusion proceeds without an input of energy. In simple diffusion, molecules that are small and uncharged can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. They simply flow through the cell membrane. Simple diffusion does not require energy or need the assistance of a transport protein. Other larger or charged molecules that diffuse across a membrane may need assistance from a protein. Oxygen is a molecule that can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. For example, oxygen diffuses out of the air sacs in your lungs into your bloodstream because oxygen is more concentrated in your lungs than in your blood. Oxygen moves from the high concentration of oxygen in your lungs to the low concentration of oxygen in your bloodstream. Carbon dioxide, which is exhaled, moves in the opposite direction from a high concentration in your bloodstream to a low concentration in your lungs. 
Passive  Transport using  Membrane  Proteins 	  Sometimes, molecules cannot move through the cell membrane on their own. These molecules need special transport proteins to help them move across the membrane, a process known as facilitative diffusion. These special proteins are called channel proteins or carrier proteins ( Figure 2.15), and they are attached to the cell membrane. In fact, they go through the cell membrane, from the inside of the cell to the outside. Channel proteins provide an open channel or passageway through the cell membrane for molecules to move across. Many channel proteins allow the diffusion of ions. Ions are charged atoms. The charge makes it difficult to cross the cell membrane without assistance. Channel proteins are specific for the molecule they transport. For example a sodium ion crosses the membrane through a channel protein specific for sodium ions. Carrier proteins bind and carry the molecules across the cell membrane. These proteins bind a molecule on one side of the membrane, change shape as they carry the molecule across the membrane, and deposit the molecule on the other side of the membrane. Even though a protein is involved in both these methods of transport, neither method requires energy. Therefore these are still types of passive transport. 
Protein channels and carrier proteins are 	  involved in passive transport. 
Summary 	  • Passive transport does not require energy input. • An example of passive transport is diffusion, the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. • Carrier proteins and channel proteins are involved in facilitated diffusion.

What affects the direction of their movement? • Define active transport. • Describe the process of active transport. • Summarize the role of the sodium-potassium pump. What does it take to roll a stone uphill? This round stone tends to roll downhill due to the force of gravity. It takes an input of energy to push it uphill. Due to diffusion, molecules tend to move from an area of a large amount to an area of a small amount. So guess what it takes to move molecules the opposite way, from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration? Energy, of course! 
Active  Transport 	  During active transport, molecules move from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. This is the opposite of diffusion, and these molecules are said to flow against their concentration gradient. Active transport is called "active" because this type of transport requires energy to move molecules. ATP is the most common source of energy for active transport. As molecules are moving against their concentration gradients, active transport cannot occur without assistance. A carrier protein is always required in this process. Like facilitated diffusion, a protein in the membrane carries the molecules across the membrane, except this protein moves the molecules from a low concentration to a high concentration. These proteins are often called "pumps" because they use energy to pump the molecules across the membrane. There are many cells in your body that use pumps to move molecules. For example, your nerve cells (neurons) would not send messages to your brain unless you had protein pumps moving molecules by active transport. The sodium-potassium pump ( Figure 2.16) is an example of an active transport pump. The sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to move three sodium (Na+) ions and two potassium (K+) ions to where they are already highly concentrated. Sodium ions move out of the cell, and potassium ions move into the cell. How do these ions then return to their original positions? As the ions now can flow down their concentration gradients, facilitated diffusion returns the ions to their original positions either inside or outside the cell. 
The sodium-potassium pump moves 	  sodium ions to the outside of the cell and potassium ions to the inside of the cell, areas where these ions are already highly concentrated. 
P is 	  required for the protein to change shape. 
P is converted into  P (adenosine 	  diphosphate) during active transport. 
Summary 	  • During active transport, a protein pump uses energy, in the form of ATP, to move molecules from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. • An example of active transport is the sodium-potassium pump, which moves sodium ions to the outside of the cell and potassium ions to the inside of the cell.

What can a tiny plant do that you can’t do? This tiny plant can use the energy of the sun to make its own food. You can’t make food by just sitting in the sun. Plants are not the only organisms that can get energy from the sun, however. Some protists, such as algae, and some bacteria can also use the energy of the sun to make their own food. What is Photosynthesis? If a plant gets hungry, it cannot walk to a local restaurant and buy a slice of pizza. So, how does a plant get the food it needs to survive? Plants are producers, which means they are able to make, or produce, their own food. They also produce the "food" for other organisms. Plants are also autotrophs. Autotrophs are the organisms that collect the energy from the sun and turn it into organic compounds. Using the energy from the sun, they produce complex organic compounds from simple inorganic molecules. So once again, how does a plant get the food it needs to survive? Through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make their own “food” from the sun’s energy, carbon dioxide, and water. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water combine with solar energy to create glucose, a carbohydrate (C6H12O6), and oxygen. The process can be summarized as: in the presence of sunlight, carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen. Glucose, the main product of photosynthesis, is a sugar that acts as the "food" source for plants. The glucose is then converted into usable chemical energy, ATP, during cellular respiration. The oxygen formed during photosynthesis, which is necessary for animal life, is essentially a waste product of the photosynthesis process. Actually, almost all organisms obtain their energy from photosynthetic organisms. For example, if a bird eats a caterpillar, then the bird gets the energy that the caterpillar gets from the plants it eats. So the bird indirectly gets energy that began with the glucose formed through photosynthesis. Therefore, the process of photosynthesis is central to sustaining life on Earth. In eukaryotic organisms, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts. Only cells with chloroplasts—plant cells and algal (protist) cells—can perform photosynthesis. Animal cells and fungal cells do not have chloroplasts and, therefore, cannot photosynthesize. That is why these organisms, as well as the nonphotosynthetic protists, rely on other organisms to obtain their energy. These organisms are heterotrophs.

Are plants the only organisms that perform photosynthesis? Although we generally discuss plants when learning about photosynthesis, keep in mind that plants are not the only organisms that can make their own food. Some bacteria and some protists, such as the algae pictured here, also perform photosynthesis. This alga has chloroplasts and photosynthesizes just like a plant. 
In the  Presence of  Sunlight,  Carbon  Dioxide 	  Photosynthesis takes place in the organelle of the plant cell known as the chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are one of the main differences between plant and animal cells. Animal cells do not have chloroplasts, so they cannot photosynthesize. Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. During the first stage, the energy from sunlight is absorbed by the chloroplast. Water is used, and oxygen is produced during this part of the process. During the second stage, carbon dioxide is used, and glucose is produced. Chloroplasts contain stacks of thylakoids, which are flattened sacs of membrane. Energy from sunlight is absorbed by the pigment chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane. There are two separate parts of a chloroplast: the space inside the chloroplast itself, and the space inside the thylakoids ( Figure 2.17). • The inner compartments inside the thylakoids are called the thylakoid space (or lumen). This is the site of the first part of photosynthesis. • The interior space that surrounds the thylakoids is filled with a fluid called stroma. This is where carbon dioxide is used to produce glucose, the second part of photosynthesis. The chloroplast is the photosynthesis factory of the plant. 
The  Reactants 	  What goes into the plant cell to start photosynthesis? The reactants of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water. These are the molecules necessary to begin the process. But one more item is necessary, and that is sunlight. All three components, carbon dioxide, water, and the sun’s energy are necessary for photosynthesis to occur. These three components must meet in the chloroplast of the leaf cell for photosynthesis to occur. How do these three components get to the cells in the leaf? • Chlorophyll is the green pigment in leaves that captures energy from the sun. Chlorophyll molecules are located in the thylakoid membranes inside chloroplasts. • The veins in a plant carry water from the roots to the leaves. • Carbon dioxide enters the leaf from the air through special openings called stomata ( Figure 2.18). 
The  Products 	  What is produced by the plant cell during photosynthesis? The products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen. This means they are produced at the end of photosynthesis. Glucose, the food of plants, can be used to store energy in the form of large carbohydrate molecules. Glucose is a simple sugar molecule which can be combined with other glucose molecules to form large carbohydrates, such as starch. Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis. It is released into the atmosphere through the stomata. As you know, animals need oxygen to live. Without photosynthetic organisms like plants, there would not be enough oxygen in the atmosphere for animals to survive. 
The  Chemical  Reaction 	  The overall chemical reaction for photosynthesis is 6 molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and 6 molecules of water (H2O), with the addition of solar energy. This produces 1 molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) and 6 molecules of oxygen 
Stomata are special pores that allow 	  gasses to enter and exit the leaf. (O2). Using chemical symbols, the equation is represented as follows: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6+ 6O2. Though this equation may not seem that complicated, photosynthesis is a series of chemical reactions divided into two stages, the light reactions and the Calvin cycle ( Figure 2.19). 
The  Light  Reactions 	  Photosynthesis begins with the light reactions. It is during these reactions that the energy from sunlight is absorbed by the pigment chlorophyll in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. The energy is then temporarily transferred to two molecules, ATP and NADPH, which are used in the second stage of photosynthesis. ATP and NADPH are generated by two electron transport chains. During the light reactions, water is used and oxygen is produced. These reactions can only occur during daylight as the process needs sunlight to begin. 
The  Calvin  Cycle 	  The second stage of photosynthesis is the production of glucose from carbon dioxide. This process occurs in a continuous cycle, named after its discover, Melvin Calvin. The Calvin cycle uses CO2 and the energy temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH to make the sugar glucose. Photosynthesis is a two stage process. As is depicted here, the energy from sunlight is needed to start photosynthesis. The initial stage is called the light reactions as they occur only in the presence of light. During these initial reactions, water is used and oxygen is released. 
The energy from sunlight 	  is converted into a small amount of ATP and an energy carrier called NADPH. Together with carbon dioxide, these are used to make glucose (sugar) through a process called the Calvin Cycle. NADP+ and ADP (and 
Pi, inorganic phosphate) are regenerated 	  to complete the process.

Why or why not? • Define cellular respiration. • Summarize the significance of ATP. Why do you need food? The main reason you need to eat is to get energy. Food is your body’s only supply of energy. However, this energy must be converted from the apple (or any other food you eat) into an energy source that your body can use. The process of getting energy from your food is called cellular respiration. What is Cellular Respiration? How does the food you eat provide energy? When you need a quick boost of energy, you might reach for an apple or a candy bar. But cells do not "eat" apples or candy bars; these foods need to be broken down so that cells can use them. Through the process of cellular respiration, the energy in food is changed into energy that can be used by the body’s cells. Initially, the sugars in the food you eat are digested into the simple sugar glucose, a monosaccharide. Recall that glucose is the sugar produced by the plant during photosynthesis. The glucose, or the polysaccharide made from many glucose molecules, such as starch, is then passed to the organism that eats the plant. This organism could be you, or it could be the organism that you eat. Either way, it is the glucose molecules that holds the energy. 
 	  Specifically, during cellular respiration, the energy stored in glucose is transferred to ATP ( Figure 2.20). ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is chemical energy the cell can use. It is the molecule that provides energy for your cells to perform work, such as moving your muscles as you walk down the street. But cellular respiration is slightly more complicated than just converting the energy from glucose into ATP. Cellular respiration can be described as the reverse or opposite of photosynthesis. During cellular respiration, glucose, in the presence of oxygen, is converted into carbon dioxide and water. Recall that carbon dioxide and water are the starting products of photosynthesis. What are the products of photosynthesis? The process can be summarized as: glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water. During this process, the energy stored in glucose is transferred to ATP. −) of the ATP molecule. When ATP is broken Energy is stored in the bonds between the phosphate groups (PO4 down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate, energy is released. When ADP and inorganic phosphate are joined to form ATP, energy is stored. During cellular respiration, about 36 to 38 ATP molecules are produced for every glucose molecule. 
The structural 	  formula for adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During cellular respiration, energy from the chemical bonds of the food you eat must be transferred to ATP.

The  Process of  Cellular  Respiration 	  Cellular respiration is the process of extracting energy in the form of ATP from the glucose in the food you eat. How does cellular respiration happen inside of the cell? Cellular respiration is a three step process. Briefly: organelles known as the energy "powerhouses" of the cells ( Figure 2.21). In the mitochondria, the pyruvate, which have been converted into a 2-carbon molecule, enter the Krebs cycle. Notice that mitochondria have an inner membrane with many folds, called cristae. These cristae greatly increase the membrane surface area where many of the cellular respiration reactions take place. energy is used to produce ATP. Oxygen is needed to help the process of turning glucose into ATP. The initial step releases just two molecules of ATP for each glucose. The later steps release much more ATP. Most of the reactions of cellular respiration are carried out in the mitochondria. 
The  Reactants 	  What goes into the cell? Oxygen and glucose are both reactants of cellular respiration. Oxygen enters the body when an organism breathes. Glucose enters the body when an organism eats. 
The  Products 	  What does the cell produce? The products of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide is transported from your mitochondria out of your cell, to your red blood cells, and back to your lungs to be exhaled. ATP is generated in the process. When one molecule of glucose is broken down, it can be converted to a net total of 
The  Chemical  Reaction 	  The overall chemical reaction for cellular respiration is one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) and six molecules of oxygen (O2) yields six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and six molecules of water (H2O). Using chemical symbols the equation is represented as follows: 
C6 H12 O6 + 6 O2 → 6 O2 + 6 H2 	  ATP is generated during the process. Though this equation may not seem that complicated, cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions divided into three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. 
Glycolysis 	  Stage one of cellular respiration is glycolysis. Glycolysis is the splitting, or lysis of glucose. Glycolysis converts the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, and it occurs in the presence or absence of oxygen. During glycolysis a small amount of NADH is made as are four ATP. Two ATP are used during this process, leaving a net gain of two ATP from glycolysis. The NADH temporarily holds energy, which will be used in stage three. 
The  Krebs  Cycle 	  In the presence of oxygen, under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the mitochondria to proceed into the Krebs cycle. The second stage of cellular respiration is the transfer of the energy in pyruvate, which is the energy initially in glucose, into two energy carriers, NADH and FADH2. A small amount of ATP is also made during this process. This process occurs in a continuous cycle, named after its discover, Hans Krebs. The Krebs cycle uses a 2-carbon molecule (acetyl-CoA) derived from pyruvate and produces carbon dioxide. 
The  Electron  Transport  Chain 	  Stage three of cellular respiration is the use of NADH and FADH2 to generate ATP. This occurs in two parts. First, the NADH and FADH2 enter an electron transport chain, where their energy is used to pump, by active transport, protons (H+) out of the thylakoid. This establishes a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. These protons then flow down their concentration gradient, moving back into the thylakoid by facilitated diffusion. During this process, ATP is made by adding inorganic phosphate to ADP. Most of the ATP produced during cellular respiration is made during this stage. For each glucose that starts cellular respiration, in the presence of oxygen (aerobic conditions), 36-38 ATP are generated. Without oxygen, under anaerobic conditions, much less (only two!) ATP are produced. 
Summary 	  • Most of the steps of cellular respiration take place in the mitochondria. • Oxygen and glucose are both reactants in the process of cellular respiration. • The main product of cellular respiration is ATP; waste products include carbon dioxide and water.

How do trees help you breathe? Recall that trees release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis. And you need oxygen to breathe. Do you know why? So your cells can perform cellular respiration and make ATP. 
Connecting  Cellular  Respiration and  Photosynthesis 	  Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are connected through an important relationship. This relationship enables life to survive as we know it. The products of one process are the reactants of the other. Notice that the equation for cellular respiration is the direct opposite of photosynthesis: • Cellular Respiration: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O • Photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6+ 6O2 Photosynthesis makes the glucose that is used in cellular respiration to make ATP. The glucose is then turned back into carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. While water is broken down to form oxygen during photosynthesis, in cellular respiration oxygen is combined with hydrogen to form water. While photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, cellular respiration requires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. It is the released oxygen that is used by us and most other organisms for cellular respiration. We breathe in that oxygen, which is carried through our blood to all our cells. In our cells, oxygen allows cellular respiration to proceed. Cellular respiration works best in the presence of oxygen. Without oxygen, much less ATP would be produced. Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are important parts of the carbon cycle. The carbon cycle is the pathways through which carbon is recycled in the biosphere. While cellular respiration releases carbon dioxide into the environment, photosynthesis pulls carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen during photosynthesis ( Figure 2.22) and cellular respiration worldwide helps to keep atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide at stable levels. 
Cellular respiration and photosynthesis 	  are direct opposite reactions. Energy from the sun enters a plant and is converted into glucose during photosynthesis. Some of the energy is used to make 
P in the mitochondria during cellular 	  respiration, and some is lost to the environment as heat.

How is wine made? You probably realize that grapes are needed to make wine. You might not realize, however, that yeast are also central in the process of making wine. Yeast take the sugars from the grapes and convert them into alcohol through the process of fermentation. 
Fermentation 	  Sometimes cells need to obtain energy from sugar, but there is no oxygen present to complete cellular respiration. In this situation, cellular respiration can be anaerobic, occurring in the absence of oxygen. In this process, called fermentation, only the first step of respiration, glycolysis, occurs, producing two ATP; no additional ATP is produced. Therefore, the organism only obtains the two ATP molecules per glucose molecule from glycolysis. Compared to the 36-38 ATP produced under aerobic conditions, anaerobic respiration is not a very efficient process. Fermentation allows the first step of cellular respiration to continue and produce some ATP, even without oxygen. Yeast (single-celled eukaryotic organisms) perform alcoholic fermentation in the absence of oxygen. The products of alcoholic fermentation are ethyl alcohol (drinking alcohol) and carbon dioxide gas. This process is used to make common food and drinks. For example, alcoholic fermentation is used to bake bread. The carbon dioxide bubbles allow the bread to rise and become fluffy. Meanwhile, the alcohol evaporates. In wine making, the sugars of grapes are fermented to produce wine. The sugars are the starting materials for glycolysis. Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. Pictured below are some products of fermentation ( Figure 2.23). 
Products of fermentation include cheese 	  (lactic acid fermentation) and wine (alcoholic fermentation).

Where does this ATP come from? and why? • Define cell division. • Explain why cells must divide. Do cells get worn out? Yes, just like this car, cells cannot last forever. Cells do eventually wear out. At that point, they need to be replaced. This is one reason that your cells divide. New cells that result after cells divide are also used for growth and to repair cuts. 
Why  Cells  Divide 	  Imagine the first stages of life. In humans and other animals, a sperm fertilizes an egg, forming the first cell. But humans are made up of trillions of cells, so where do the new cells come from? Remember that according to the cell theory, all cells come from existing cells. Once a sperm and egg cell unite and the first cell, called a zygote, forms, an entire baby will develop. And each cell in that baby will be genetically identical, meaning that each cell will have exactly the same DNA. How does a new life go from one cell to so many? The cell divides in half, creating two cells. Then those two cells divide, for a total of four cells. The new cells continue to divide and divide. One cell becomes two, then four, then eight, and so on ( Figure 2.24). This continual process of a cell dividing and creating two new cells is known as cell division. Cell division is part of a cycle of cellular growth and division known as the cell cycle—cells must grow before they divide. The cell cycle describes the "life" of a eukayrotic cell. In addition to cell division, the cell cycle includes the division of the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Most cell division produces genetically identical cells, meaning they have the same DNA. The process of mitosis, which specifically is the division of the nucleus, ensures that each cell has the same DNA. During mitosis, the chromosomes equally separate, thus making sure each nucleus in each resulting cell after cell division is genetically identical. A special form of cell division, called meiosis, produces cells with half as much DNA as the parent cell. These cells are used for reproduction. In prokaryotic organisms, cell division is how those organisms reproduce. Cells divide repeatedly to produce an embryo. Previously the one-celled zygote (the first cell of a new organism) divided to make two cells (a). Each of the two cells divides to yield four cells (b), then the four cells divide to make eight cells (c), and so on. Through cell division, an entire embryo forms from one initial cell. Besides the development of a baby, there are many other reasons that cell division is necessary for life: spurt. Growing just an inch requires countless cell divisions. Your body must produce new bone cells, new skin cells, new cells in your blood vessels and so on. will eventually disappear and new skin cells will grow to repair the wound. Where do these cells come from? Some of your existing skin cells divide and produce new cells. essential to this process. 
Summary 	  • Cells must divide repeatedly for an embryo to develop or for you to grow. • Cells also divide in order to replace damaged or worn-out cells.

Do cells have a life cycle? Yes, just like a butterfly passes through different phases, such as caterpillar, chrysalis, and adult butterfly, there are a series of phases in a cell’s life as it gets ready to divide. The sequence of phases leading up to cell division and then ending with cell division itself is called the cell cycle. 
Cell  Cycle 	  The process of cell division in eukaryotic cells is carefully controlled. The cell cycle ( Figure 2.25) is the life cycle of an eukaryotic cell, with cell division at the end of the cycle. Like a human life cycle, which is made up of different phases, like childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, the cell cycle also occurs in a series of phases. The first cell cycle begins with the formation of a zygote from the fusion of a male and female sex cell ( gamete). The steps of the cell cycle can be divided into two main components: interphase and the mitotic phase. Interphase is the stage when the cell mostly performs its “everyday” functions. For example, it is when a kidney cell does what a kidney cell is supposed to do. The cell also gets ready to divide during this time. The cell divides during the mitotic phase, which consists of mitosis and cytokinesis. Most of the cell cycle consists of interphase, the time between cell divisions. Interphase can be divided into three stages: organelles. the cell’s DNA is made. This ensures that each new cell has a set of genetic material identical to that of the parental cell. This process is called DNA replication. the cell is ready to enter mitosis. 
Shown is the cell cycle.  Notice that 	  most of the cell cycle is spent in Interphase (G1, S, and G2). Mitosis and cytokinesis occur during the Mitotic phase. Some cells may enter a resting phase during which progression through the cycle stops. During mitosis, the nucleus divides as the chromosomes are equally separated. One nucleus becomes two nuclei, each with an identical set of chromosomes. Mitosis is followed by cytokinesis, when the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two cells. After cytokinesis, cell division is complete. The one parent cell (the dividing cell) forms two genetically identical daughter cells (the cells that divide from the parent cell). The term "genetically identical" means that each cell has an identical set of DNA, and this DNA is also identical to that of the parent cell. If the cell cycle is not carefully controlled, it can cause a disease called cancer in which the cells divide out of control. A tumor can result from this kind of growth.

How is your DNA organized? Your DNA is organized into chromosomes, the pink structures pictured above. Your DNA doesn’t always look so pretty, though. It only winds tightly into chromosomes when the cell is getting ready to divide. If your DNA wasn’t organized into chromosomes, your DNA would look like a mass of strings and would be difficult to divide up! 
Mitosis and  Chromosomes 	  The genetic information of the cell, or DNA, is stored in the nucleus. During mitosis, two nuclei (plural for nucleus) must form, so that one nucleus can be in each of the new cells after the cell divides. In order to create two genetically identical nuclei, DNA inside of the nucleus must be copied or replicated. This occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. During mitosis, the copied DNA is divided into two complete sets, so that after cytokinesis, each cell has a complete set of genetic instructions. 
Chromosomes 	  To begin mitosis, the DNA in the nucleus wraps around proteins to form chromosomes. Each organism has a unique number of chromosomes. In human cells, our DNA is divided up into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Replicated DNA forms a chromosome made from two identical sister chromatids, forming an "X" shaped molecule ( Figure 2.26). The two chromatids are held together on the chromosome by the centromere. The centromere is also where spindle fiber microtubules attach during mitosis. The spindles separate sister chromatids from each other. The DNA double helix wraps around proteins (2) and tightly coils a number of times to form a chromosome (5). This figure shows the complexity of the coiling process. The red dot shows the location of the centromere, which holds the sister chromatids together and is where the spindle microtubules attach during mitosis and meiosis. Notice that a chromosome resembles an "X." 
Four  Phases of  Mitosis 	  During mitosis, the two sister chromatids must be divided. This is a precise process that has four individual phases to it. After the sister chromatids separate, each separate chromatid is now known as a chromosome. Each resulting chromosome is made of DNA from just one chromatid. So, each chromosome after this separation is made of "1/2 of the X." Through this process, each daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome. The four phases of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase ( Figure 2.27). so tightly wound that you can see them under a microscope. The membrane around the nucleus, called the nuclear envelope, disappears. Spindles also form and attach to chromosomes to help them move. a row, one on top of the next. resulting in two sets of identical chromosomes. After telophase, each new nucleus contains the exact same number and type of chromosomes as the original cell. The cell is now ready for cytokinesis, which literally means "cell movement." During cytokinesis, the cytoplasm divides and the parent cell separates, producing two genetically identical cells, each with its own nucleus. A new cell membrane forms and in plant cells, a cell wall forms as well. Below is a representation of dividing plant cells (

Do animals always have two parents? No, not all animals have two parents. When necessary, some animals can be produced from just one parent. Some reptiles, such as this Komodo dragon, have only one parent. The process of creating offspring from just one individual is called asexual reproduction. 
Reproduction 	  Animals and other organisms cannot live forever. They must reproduce if their species is to survive. But what does it mean to reproduce? Reproduction is the ability to make the next generation, and it is one of the basic characteristics of life. Two methods of reproduction are: There are advantages and disadvantages to each method, but the result is always the same: a new life begins. 
Asexual  Reproduction 	  When humans reproduce, there are two parents involved. DNA must be passed from both the mother and father to the child. Humans cannot reproduce with just one parent; humans can only reproduce sexually. But having just one parent is possible in other eukaryotic organisms, including some insects, fish, and reptiles. These organisms can reproduce asexually, meaning the offspring ("children") have a single parent and share the exact same genetic material as the parent. This is very different from reproduction in humans. Bacteria, being a prokaryotic, singlecelled organism, must reproduce asexually. The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents’ genes. Types of organisms that reproduce asexually include: in half ( Figure 2.29). First, their chromosome replicates and the cell enlarges. The cell then divides into two cells as new membranes form to separate the two cells. After cell division, the two new cells each have one identical chromosome. This simple process allows bacteria to reproduce very rapidly. flatworm identical to the original, a process called fragmentation. parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis happens when an unfertilized egg cell grows into a new organism. The resulting organism has half the amount of genetic material of the parent. Parthenogenesis is common in honeybees. In a hive, the sexually produced eggs become workers, while the asexually produced eggs become drones. 
Sexual  Reproduction 	  During sexual reproduction, two parents are involved. Most animals are dioecious, meaning there is a separate male and female sex, with the male producing sperm and the female producing eggs. When a sperm and egg meet during fertilization, a zygote, the first cell of a new organism, is formed ( Figure 2.30). This process combines the genetic material from both parents. The resulting organism will be genetically unique. The zygote will divide by mitosis and grow into the embryo. Let’s explore how animals, plants, and fungi reproduce sexually: Animals often have gonads, organs that produce eggs or sperm. The male gonads are the testes, and the female gonads are the ovaries. Testes produce sperm; ovaries produce eggs. Sperm and egg, the two sex cells, are known as gametes, and can combine two different ways, both of which combine the genetic material from the two parents. Gametes have half the amount of the genetic material of a regular body cell; they are haploid cells. In humans, gametes have one set of 23 chromosomes. Gametes are produced through a special type of cell division known as meiosis. Normal human cells have 46 chromosomes. They are diploid cells, with two sets of 23 chromosomes (23 pairs). Bacteria reproduce by binary fission. 
Shown is one bacterium reproducing and 	  becoming two bacteria. During sexual reproduction, a sperm fertilizes an egg. Fish and other aquatic animals release their gametes in the water, which is called external fertilization ( Figure by internal fertilization. Typically males have a penis that deposits sperm into the vagina of the female. Birds do not have penises, but they do have a chamber called the cloaca that they place close to another bird’s cloaca to deposit sperm. Amphibians must live close to water as they must lay their eggs in a moist or wet environment prior to external fertilization. 
This fish guards her eggs, which will be 	  fertilized externally. • Plants can also reproduce sexually, but their reproductive organs are different from animals’ gonads. Plants that have flowers have their reproductive parts in the flower. The sperm is contained in the pollen, while the egg is contained in the ovary, deep within the flower. The sperm can reach the egg two different ways: of sexual reproduction, cross-pollination allows new combinations of traits. Cross-pollination occurs when pollen is carried by the wind to another flower. It can also occur when animal pollinators, like honeybees or butterflies ( Figure 2.32), carry the pollen from flower to flower. Butterflies receive nectar when they deposit pollen into flowers, resulting in cross-pollination. • Fungi can also reproduce sexually, but instead of female and male sexes, they have (+) and (-) strains. When the filaments of a (+) and (-) fungi meet, the zygote is formed. Just like in plants and animals, each zygote receives DNA from two parent strains. 
Summary 	  • Types of asexual reproduction, when a new individual is formed from a single parent, include binary fission in bacteria and parthenogenesis in some animals. • During sexual reproduction in animals, fertilization can be internal or external. • Cross-pollination allows sexual reproduction in plants.

Do you have ALL your parents’ chromosomes? No, you only received half of your mother’s chromosomes and half of your father’s chromosomes. If you inherited them all, you would have twice the number of chromosomes that you’re supposed to have. Humans typically have 
Introduction to  Meiosis 	  Sexual reproduction combines gametes from two parents. Gametes are reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg. As gametes are produced, the number of chromosomes must be reduced by half. Why? The zygote must contain genetic information from the mother and from the father, so the gametes must contain half of the chromosomes found in normal body cells. When two gametes come together at fertilization, the normal amount of chromosomes results. Gametes are produced by a special type of cell division known as meiosis. Meiosis contains two rounds of cell division without DNA replication in between. This process reduces the number of chromosomes by half. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each chromosome within a pair is called a homologous chromosome. For each of the 23 chromosome pairs, you received one chromosome from your father and one chromosome from your mother. Alleles are alternate forms of genes found on chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes have the same genes, though they may have different alleles. So, though homologous chromosomes are very similar, they are not identical. The homologous chromosomes are separated when gametes are formed. Therefore, gametes have only 23 chromosomes, not 23 pairs. 
Haploid vs.  Diploid 	  A cell with two sets of chromosomes is diploid, referred to as 2n, where n is the number of sets of chromosomes. Most of the cells in a human body are diploid. A cell with one set of chromosomes, such as a gamete, is haploid, referred to as n. Sex cells are haploid. When a haploid sperm (n) and a haploid egg (n) combine, a diploid zygote will be formed (2n). In short, when a diploid zygote is formed, half of the DNA comes from each parent. 
Overview of  Meiosis 	  Before meiosis begins, DNA replication occurs, so each chromosome contains two sister chromatids that are identical to the original chromosome. Meiosis ( Figure 2.33) is divided into two divisions: Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Each division can be divided into the same phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Cytokinesis follows telophase each time. Between the two cell divisions, DNA replication does not occur. Through this process, one diploid cell will divide into four haploid cells. 
Overview of  Meiosis.  During meiosis, four 	  haploid cells are created from one diploid parent cell. 
Meiosis  	  During meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes are separated from each other. This requires that they line up in their homologous paris during metaphase I. The steps are outlined below: in meiosis can occur. This process is called crossing-over ( Figure 2.34), which is the exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes. Crossing-over forms new combinations of alleles on the resulting chromosome. Without crossing-over, the offspring would always inherit all of the alleles on one of the homologous chromosomes. Also during prophase I, the spindle forms, the chromosomes condense as they coil up tightly, and the nuclear envelope disappears. from the mother or from the father can each attach to either side of the spindle. Their attachment is random, so all of the chromosomes from the mother or father do not end up in the same gamete. The gamete will contain some chromosomes from the mother and some chromosomes from the father. opposite sides (opposite poles) of the cell. after cytokinesis, the nucleus will immediately begin to divide again. No DNA replication occurs between meiosis I and meiosis II because the chromosomes are already duplicated. After cytokinesis, two haploid cells result, each with chromosomes made of sister chromatids. Since the separation of chromosomes into gametes is random during meiosis I, this process results in different combinations of chromosomes (and alleles) in each gamete. With 23 pairs of chromosomes, there is a possibility of over 8 million different combinations of chromosomes (223) in a human gamete. 
During crossing-over, segments of  	  are exchanged between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Notice how this can result in an allele (A) on one chromatid being moved onto the other non-sister chromatid. 
Meiosis  	  During meiosis II, the sister chromatids are separated and the gametes are generated. This cell division is similar to that of mitosis, but results in four genetically unique haploid cells. The steps are outlined below: they line up in mitosis. The spindle is attached to the centromere of each chromosome. cytokinesis. After cytokinesis, each cell has divided again. Therefore, meiosis results in four haploid genetically unique daughter cells, each with half the DNA of the parent cell ( Figure 2.35). In human cells, the parent cell has 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), so the cells produced by meiosis have 23 chromosomes. These cells will become gametes.

Mitosis or Meiosis? This represents a tiny embryo just beginning to form. Once an egg is fertilized, the resulting single cell must divide many, many times to develop a fetus. Both mitosis and meiosis involve cell division; is this type of cell division an example of mitosis or meiosis? The answer is mitosis. With each division you are making a genetically exact copy of the parent cell, which only happens through mitosis. 
Mitosis vs.  Meiosis 	  Mitosis, meiosis, and sexual reproduction are discussed at URL and http s://URL ploid-gamete-zygote-homologous . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Both mitosis and meiosis result in eukaryotic cells dividing. So what is the difference between mitosis and meiosis? The primary difference is the differing goals of each process. The goal of mitosis is to produce two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell, meaning the new cells have exactly the same DNA as the parent cell. Mitosis happens when you want to grow, for example. You want all your new cells to have the same DNA as the previous cells. The goal of meiosis, however, is to produce sperm or eggs, also known as gametes. The resulting gametes are not genetically identical to the parent cell. Gametes are haploid cells, with only half the DNA present in the diploid parent cell. This is necessary so that when a sperm and an egg combine at fertilization, the resulting zygote has the correct amount of DNA—not twice as much as the parents. The zygote then begins to divide through mitosis. Pictured below is a comparison between binary fission ( Figure 2.36), which is cell division of prokaryotic organisms, mitosis, and meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are also compared in the table that follows ( Table 2.2). A comparison between binary fission, mitosis, and meiosis.

Summary 	  The cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living organisms. But this smallest of units still performs some very complex processes. In fact, for some organisms, just one cell must do everything necessary for life. Cell Biology focuses on significant aspects of the cell from its structure to its division. Some organisms contain just one cell, and others contain trillions. Some have a nucleus with DNA, others do not. Some have many organelles, others do not. But all cells are surrounded by a cell membrane. And it is this semipermeable membrane that determines what can enter and leave the cell. All cells need energy, and for many organisms, this energy comes from the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. All cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division, which can produce a new prokaryotic organism.

Introduction 	  Why is heredity so important? Genetics is the study of inheritance. Inheritance is the passing of traits from parents to offspring. How are these traits "passed"? Through DNA, which is the genetic material of all organisms. This concept will focus on genetics, inheritance, and DNA. • Explain the importance of DNA. • Define and describe a nucleotide. • Describe the shape of DNA. • Summarize the base-pairing rules. Where’s the instructions? How do your cells know what to do? Just like builders have blueprints to tell them how to build a house, your cells also have instructions. Your cells’ instructions are molecules of DNA. What is DNA? DNA is the material that makes up our chromosomes and stores our genetic information. When you build a house, you need a blueprint, a set of instructions that tells you how to build. The DNA is like the blueprint for living organisms. The genetic information is a set of instructions that tell your cells what to do. DNA is an abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid. As you may recall, nucleic acids are a type of macromolecule that store information. The deoxyribo part of the name refers to the name of the sugar that is contained in DNA, deoxyribose. DNA may provide the instructions to make up all living things, but it is actually a very simple molecule. DNA is made of a very long chain of nucleotides. In fact, in you, the smallest DNA molecule has well over 20 million nucleotides. 
Nucleotides 	  Nucleotides are composed of three main parts: The only difference between each nucleotide is the identity of the base. There are only four possible bases that make up each DNA nucleotide: adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). 
The  Genetic  Code 	  The various sequences of the four nucleotide bases make up the genetic code of your cells. It may seem strange that there are only four letters in the “alphabet” of DNA. But since your chromosomes contain millions of nucleotides, there are many, many different combinations possible with those four letters. But how do all these pieces fit together? James Watson and Francis Crick won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for piecing together the structure of DNA. Together with the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, they determined that DNA is made of two strands of nucleotides formed into a double helix, or a two-stranded spiral, with the sugar and phosphate groups on the outside, and the paired bases connecting the two strands on the inside of the helix ( 
A’s three-dimensional structure is a 	  double helix. The hydrogen bonds between the bases at the center of the helix hold the helix together. 
Base- Pairing 	  The bases in DNA do not pair randomly. When Erwin Chargaff looked closely at the bases in DNA, he noticed that the percentage of adenine (A) in the DNA always equaled the percentage of thymine (T), and the percentage of guanine (G) always equaled the percentage of cytosine (C). Watson and Crick’s model explained this result by suggesting that A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C in the DNA helix. Therefore A and T, and G and C, are "complementary bases," or bases that always pair together, known as a base-pair. The base-pairing rules state that A will always bind to T, and G will always bind to C ( Figure 3.2). For example, if one DNA strand reads ATGCCAGT, the other strand will be made up of the complementary bases: TACGGTCA. Hydrogen bonds hold the complementary bases together, with two bonds forming between an A and a T, and three bonds between a G and a C. 
The chemical structure of  A includes 	  a chain of nucleotides consisting of a 5carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen base. Notice how the sugar and phosphate group form the backbone of DNA (strands highlighted in pink), with the hydrogen bonds between the bases joining the two strands. 
Summary 	  • DNA stores the genetic information of the cell in the sequence of its 4 bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. • DNA is made of a long chain of nucleotides consisting of a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and nitrogencontaining base.

Explain your reasoning. • Explain why DNA must replicate itself. • Describe the process of DNA replication. • Explain the meaning of semiconservative replication. Does DNA copy itself? Yes, your DNA needs to copy itself every time a new cell is created. The new cell needs to have DNA exactly like the rest of your cells. Otherwise, that cell might malfunction. That’s why it’s important that the process of copying DNA, called DNA replication, is very accurate. 
A  Replication 	  DNA must replicate (copy) itself so that each resulting cell after mitosis and cell division has the same DNA as the parent cell. All these cells, the parent cell and the two new daughter cells, are genetically identical. DNA replication occurs during the S phase (the Synthesis phase) of the cell cycle, before mitosis and cell division. The base pairing rules are crucial for the process of replication. DNA replication occurs when DNA is copied to form an identical molecule of DNA. The general steps involved in DNA replication are as follows: Helicase is involved in breaking these bonds. template means that on the new strand, the bases are placed in the correct order because of the base pairing rules. Recall that A and T are complementary bases, as are G and C. As a template strand is read, the new strand is created. If ATGCCA is on the "template strand," then TACGGT will be on the new DNA strand. The enzyme DNA Polymerase reads the template and builds the new strand of DNA. molecules, each with one old strand and one new strand of DNA. This process is known as semiconservative replication because one strand is conserved (kept the same) in each new DNA molecule ( Figure 3.3). DNA replication occurs when the DNA strands “unzip,” and the original strands of DNA serve as a template for new nucleotides to join and form a new strand. 
Summary 	  • During DNA replication, the DNA helix unwinds and the two single strands of DNA then each serve as a template for a new stand to be created. • DNA replication is semi-conservative: the new DNA molecule consists of half of the parent DNA molecule. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • DNA replication at URL (7:47) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Define gene. • Describe the purpose of protein synthesis. • Explain the meaning of gene expression. • Summarize the relationship between DNA, amino acids, and proteins. How do you build a protein? Your body needs proteins to create muscles, regulate chemical reactions, transport oxygen, and perform other important tasks in your body. But how are these proteins built? They are made up of units called amino acids. Just like there are only a few types of blocks in a set, there are a limited number of amino acids. But there are many different ways in which they can be combined. 
Introduction to  Protein  Synthesis 	  A monomer is a molecule that can bind to other monomers to form a polymer. Amino acids are the monomers of a protein. The DNA sequence contains the instructions to place amino acids into a specific order. When the amino acid monomers are assembled in that specific order, proteins are made, a process called protein synthesis. In short, DNA contains the instructions to create proteins. But DNA does not directly make the proteins. Proteins are made on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, and DNA (in an eukaryotic cell) is in the nucleus. So the cell uses an RNA intermediate to produce proteins. Each strand of DNA has many separate sequences that code for a specific protein. Insulin is an example of a protein made by your cells ( Figure 3.4). Units of DNA that contain code for the creation of a protein are called genes. 
Cells  Can  Turn  Genes  On or  Off 	  There are about 22,000 genes in every human cell. Does every human cell have the same genes? Yes. Does every human cell make the same proteins? No. In a multicellular organism, such as us, cells have specific functions Insulin. Each blue or purple bead represents a different amino acid. Just 20 different amino acids are arranged in many different combinations to make thousands of proteins. because they have different proteins. They have different proteins because different genes are expressed in different cell types (which is known as gene expression). Imagine that all of your genes are "turned off." Each cell type only "turns on" (or expresses) the genes that have the code for the proteins it needs to use. So different cell types "turn on" different genes, allowing different proteins to be made. This gives different cell types different functions. Once a gene is expressed, the protein product of that gene is usually made. For this reason, gene expression and protein synthesis are often considered the same process. 
Summary 	  • DNA contains the instructions to assemble amino acids in a specific order to make protein. • Each cell type only "turns on" (or expresses) the genes that have the code for the proteins it needs to use. • Gene expression and protein synthesis are usually considered the same molecular process. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Protein Synthesis at URL • Distinguish between DNA and RNA. • Name the three types of RNA. • Explain the functions of each type of RNA. How does your DNA send a message? DNA is the blueprint that provides the directions on how to build all the proteins your body needs to function. However, DNA is confined to the nucleus and, therefore, isn’t involved directly in the process of actually making the proteins. So how does DNA tell the rest of the cell what to do? It sends a message! The messengers consist of a special type of RNA. 
Three  As 	  DNA contains the instructions to create proteins, but it does not make proteins itself. DNA is located in the nucleus, which it never leaves, while proteins are made on ribosomes in the cytoplasm. So DNA needs a messenger to bring its instructions to a ribosome located outside of the nucleus. DNA sends out a message, in the form of RNA (ribonucleic acid), describing how to make the protein. There are three types of RNA directly involved in protein synthesis: • Messenger RNA ( mRNA) carries the instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. mRNA is produced in the nucleus, as are all RNAs. • The other two forms of RNA, ribosomal RNA ( rRNA) and transfer RNA ( tRNA), are involved in the process of ordering the amino acids to make the protein. rRNA becomes part of the ribosome, which is the site of protein synthesis, and tRNA brings an amino acid to the ribosome so it can be added to a growing chain during protein synthesis. There are numerous tRNAs, as each tRNA is specific for an amino acid. The amino acid actually attaches to the tRNA during this process. More about RNAs will be discussed during the Transcription and Translation Concepts. All three RNAs are nucleic acids, made of nucleotides, similar to DNA ( Figure 3.5). The RNA nucleotide is different from the DNA nucleotide in the following ways: • RNA contains a different kind of sugar, called ribose. • In RNA, the base uracil (U) replaces the thymine (T) found in DNA. • RNA is a single strand molecule. 
A comparison of  A and  A, with the 	  bases of each shown. Notice that in RNA, uracil replaces thymine. 
Summary 	  • Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. • The other two forms of RNA, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA), are involved in the process of ordering the amino acids to make proteins. • RNA is a nucleic acid, like DNA, but differs slightly in its structure. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Three types of RNA at URL (1:13) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Define transcription. • Explain the relationship between a codon and the mRNA. • Describe how mRNA is created from DNA. How does DNA write its message? The process of DNA sending a message to the cytoplasm is called transcription. Transcription means "a written copy." However, DNA can’t get out a pen and write a message. It creates an mRNA molecule to carry the message. 
Transcription 	  DNA is located in the nucleus. Proteins are made on ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Remember that information in a gene is converted into mRNA, which carries the information to the ribosome. In the nucleus, mRNA is created by using the DNA in a gene as a template. A template is a model provided for others to copy. The process of constructing an mRNA molecule from DNA is known as transcription ( Figure 3.6 and Figure of double stranded DNA. In transcription, only one strand of DNA is used as a template. First, the double helix of DNA unwinds and an enzyme, RNA Polymerase, builds the mRNA using the DNA as a template. The nucleotides follow basically the same base pairing rules as in DNA to form the correct sequence in the mRNA. This time, however, uracil (U) pairs with each adenine (A) in the DNA. For example, a DNA sequence ACGGGTAAGG will be transcribed into the mRNA sequence UGCCCAUUCC. In this manner, the information of the DNA is passed on to the mRNA. The mRNA will carry this code to the ribosomes to tell them how to make a protein. As not all genes are used in every cell, a gene must be "turned on" or expressed when the gene product is needed by the cell. Only the information in a gene that is being expressed is transcribed into an mRNA. 
Transcription is when  A is created from 	  a DNA template. Each gene (a) contains triplets of bases (b) that are transcribed into RNA (c). Every triplet in the DNA, or codon in the mRNA, encodes for a unique amino acid. 
Base-pairing ensures the accuracy of 	  transcription. Notice how the helix must unwind for transcription to take place. The new mRNA is shown in green.

How does the cell translate a message? The mRNA is the message sent from the nucleus to the ribosome, the organelle of protein synthesis. Like a foreign language, the genetic code of the mRNA message must then be translated so that the ribosomes make the correct protein. The process of reading the code of a mRNA to make a protein is called translation. 
Translation 	  The mRNA, which is transcribed from the DNA in the nucleus, carries the directions for the protein-making process. mRNA tells the ribosome ( Figure 3.8) how to create a specific protein. Ribosomes translate RNA into a protein with a specific amino acid sequence. The tRNA binds and brings to the ribosome the amino acid encoded by the mRNA. The process of reading the mRNA code in the ribosome to make a protein is called translation ( Figure 3.9): the mRNA is translated from the language of nucleic acids (nucleotides) to the language of proteins (amino acids). Sets of three bases, called codons, are read in the ribosome, the organelle responsible for making proteins. This summary of how genes are expressed shows that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is translated, in turn, to protein. The one letter code represents amino acids. The following are the steps involved in translation: • mRNA travels to the ribosome from the nucleus. The following steps occur in the ribosome: • The base code in the mRNA determines the order of the amino acids in the protein. The genetic code in mRNA is read in “words” of three letters (triplets), called codons. Each codon codes for an amino acid. There are 20 amino acids used to make proteins, and different codons code for different amino acids. For example, GGU codes for the amino acid glycine, while GUC codes for valine. • tRNA reads the mRNA code and brings a specific amino acid to attach to the growing chain of amino acids. The anticodon on the tRNA binds to the codon on the mRNA. Each tRNA carries only one type of amino acid and only recognizes one specific codon. For example, a GGC anticodon will bind to a CCG codon, and a CGA anticodon will bind to a GCU codon. • tRNA is released from the amino acid. • Three codons, UGA, UAA, and UAG, indicate that the protein should stop adding amino acids. They are called stop codons and do not code for an amino acid. Once tRNA comes to a stop codon, the protein is set free from the ribosome. The following chart ( Figure 3.10) is used to determine which amino acids correspond to which codons. the center for the first base of 
This chart shows the genetic code used 	  by all organisms. For example, an RNA codon reading GUU would encode for a valine (Val) according to this chart. Start at the three base codon, and work your way out. Notice that more than one codon may encode for a single amino acid. For example, glycine (Gly) is encoded by a 
G,  A,  C, and  U.  Notice there 	  are 64 codons. Of the 64 codons, three are stop codons.

Would a mutation make you a superhero? In the comic books, a mutation can give a person superpowers. Do you think this really happens? In real life, a mutation can be beneficial, or it can harm an organism. For example, beneficial mutations lead to evolution, and harmful mutations can lead to diseases like cancer. A mutation, however, is not going to turn you into a superhero! 
Mutations 	  The process of DNA replication is not always 100% accurate. Sometimes the wrong base is inserted in the new strand of DNA. This wrong base could become permanent. A permanent change in the sequence of DNA is known as a mutation. Small changes in the DNA sequence are usually point mutations, which is a change in a single nucleotide. Once DNA has a mutation, that mutation will be copied each time the DNA replicates. After cell division, each resulting cell will carry the mutation. A mutation may have no effect. However, sometimes a mutation can cause a protein to be made incorrectly. A defect in the protein can affect how well the protein works, or whether it works at all. Usually the loss of a protein function is detrimental to the organism. In rare circumstances, though, the mutation can be beneficial. Mutations are a mechanism for how species evolve. For example, suppose a mutation in an animal’s DNA causes the loss of an enzyme that makes a dark pigment in the animal’s skin. If the population of animals has moved to a light colored environment, the animals with the mutant gene would have a lighter skin color and be better camouflaged. So in this case, the mutation is beneficial. 
Point  Mutations 	  If a single base is deleted (called a deletion, which is also a point mutation), there can be huge effects on the organism, because this may cause a frameshift mutation. Remember that the bases in the mRNA are read in groups of three by the tRNA. If the reading frame is off by even one base, the resulting sequence will consist of an entirely different set of codons. The reading of an mRNA is like reading three-letter words of a sentence. Imagine the sentence: “The big dog ate the red cat.” If you take out the second letter from "big," the frame will be shifted so now it will read: “The bgd oga tet her edc at.” One single deletion makes the whole “sentence” impossible to read. A point mutation that adds a base (known as an insertion) would also result in a frameshift. 
Chromosomal  Mutations 	  Mutations may also occur in chromosomes ( Figure 3.11). These mutations are going to be fairly large mutations, possible affecting many genes. Possible types of mutations in chromosomes include: result in many genes missing from the chromosome. multiple copies of genes in the chromosome. 
Causes of  Mutations 	  Many mutations are not caused by errors in replication. Mutations can happen spontaneously, and they can be caused by mutagens in the environment. Some chemicals, such as those found in tobacco smoke, can be mutagens. Sometimes mutagens can also cause cancer. Tobacco smoke, for example, is often linked to lung cancer. 
Summary 	  • A mutation is a permanent change in the sequence of bases in DNA. • Mutations occur in the DNA through deletion, duplication, inversion, insertion, and translocation within the chromosome. • Mutations can occur due to errors during DNA replication or by mutagens in the environment. Mutations can arise in DNA through deletion, duplication, inversion, insertion, and translocation within the chromosome.

Why do you look like your family? For a long time people understood that traits are passed down through families. The rules of how this worked were unclear, however. The work of Gregor Mendel was crucial in explaining how traits are passed down to each generation. 
Mendel’s  Experiments 	  What does the word "inherit" mean? You may have inherited something of value from a grandparent or another family member. To inherit is to receive something from someone who came before you. You can inherit objects, but you can also inherit traits. For example, you can inherit a parent’s eye color, hair color, or even the shape of your nose and ears! Genetics is the study of inheritance. The field of genetics seeks to explain how traits are passed on from one generation to the next. In the late 1850s, an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel ( Figure 3.12) performed the first genetics experiments. To study genetics, Mendel chose to work with pea plants because they have easily identifiable traits ( Figure 3.13). For example, pea plants are either tall or short, which is an easy trait to observe. Furthermore, pea plants grow quickly, so he could complete many experiments in a short period of time. Mendel also used pea plants because they can either self-pollinate or be cross-pollinated. Self-pollination means that only one flower is involved; the flower’s own pollen lands on the female sex organs. Cross pollination is done Gregor Mendel, the "father" of genetics. Characteristics of pea plants. by hand by moving pollen from one flower to the stigma of another (just like bees do naturally). As a result, one plant’s sex cells combine with another plant’s sex cells. This is called a "cross." These crosses produce offspring (or "children"), just like when male and female animals mate. Since Mendel could move pollen between plants, he could carefully control and then observe the results of crosses between two different types of plants. He studied the inheritance patterns for many different traits in peas, including round seeds versus wrinkled seeds, white flowers versus purple flowers, and tall plants versus short plants. Because of his work, Mendel is considered the "Father of Genetics." 
Mendel’s  First  Experiment 	  In one of Mendel’s early experiments, he crossed a short plant and a tall plant. What do you predict the offspring of these plants were? Medium-sized plants? Most people during Mendel’s time would have said medium-sized. But an unexpected result occurred. Mendel observed that the offspring of this cross (called the F1 generation) were all tall plants! Next, Mendel let the F1 generation self-pollinate. That means the tall plant offspring were crossed with each other. He found that 75% of their offspring (the F2 generation) were tall, while 25% were short. Shortness skipped a generation. But why? In all, Mendel studied seven characteristics, with almost 20,000 F2 plants analyzed. All of his results were similar to the first experiment—about three out of every four plants had one trait, while just one out of every four plants had the other. For example, he crossed purple flowered-plants and white flowered-plants. Do you think the colors blended? No, they did not. Just like the previous experiment, all offspring in this cross (the F1 generation) were one color: purple. In the F2 generation, 75% of plants had purple flowers and 25% had white flowers ( Figure 3.14). There was no blending of traits in any of Mendel’s experiments. 
The results of  Mendel’s experiment with 	  purple flowered and white flowered-plants numerically matched the results of his experiments with other pea plant traits. 
Summary 	  • Gregor Mendel was the father of the field of genetics, which seeks to explain how traits are passed on from one generation to the next. • To study genetics, Mendel chose to work with pea plants because they have easily identifiable traits. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Pea experiment at URL homozygous for both traits. What will the peas of the next generation look like? second individual. What will the peas of the next generation look like? • Distinguish between dominant and recessive traits. • Explain the law of segregation. What does it mean to be dominant? The most powerful or influential individual in a group is sometimes called dominant. In genetics, a dominant trait means nearly the same thing. A dominant trait is the most influential trait and masks the other trait. 
Dominance 	  Do you remember what happened when Mendel crossed purple flowered-plants and white flowered-plants? All the offspring had purple flowers. There was no blending of traits in any of Mendel’s experiments. Mendel had to come up with a theory of inheritance to explain his results. He developed a theory called the law of segregation. 
The  Law of  Segregation 	  Mendel proposed that each pea plant had two hereditary factors for each trait. There were two possibilities for each hereditary factor, such as a purple factor or white factor. One factor is dominant to the other. The other trait that is masked is called the recessive factor, meaning that when both factors are present, only the effects of the dominant factor are noticeable ( Figure 3.15). Although you have two hereditary factors for each trait, each parent can only pass on one of these factors to the offspring. When the sex cells, or gametes (sperm or egg), form, the heredity factors must separate, so there is only one factor per gamete. In other words, the factors are "segregated" in each gamete. Mendel’s law of segregation states that the two hereditary factors separate when gametes are formed. When fertilization occurs, the offspring receive one hereditary factor from each gamete, so the resulting offspring have two factors. The law of segregation predates our understanding or meiosis. Mendel developed his theories without an understanding of DNA, or even the knowledge that DNA existed. Quite a remarkable feat! In peas, purple flowers are dominant to white. 
If one of these purple 	  flowers is crossed with a white flower, all the offspring will have purple flowers. 
Example  Cross 	  This law explains what Mendel had seen in the F1 generation when a tall plant was crossed with a short plant. The two heredity factors in this case were the short and tall factors. Each individual in the F1 would have one of each factor, and as the tall factor is dominant to the short factor (the recessive factor), all the plants appeared tall. In describing genetic crosses, letters are used. The dominant factor is represented with a capital letter (T for tall) while the recessive factor is represented by a lowercase letter (t). For the T and t factors, three combinations are possible: TT, Tt, and tt. TT plants will be tall, while plants with tt will be short. Since T is dominant to t, plants that are Tt will be tall because the dominant factor masks the recessive factor. In this example, we are crossing a TT tall plant with a tt short plant. As each parent gives one factor to the F1 generation, all of the F1 generation will be Tt tall plants. When the F1 generation (Tt) is allowed to self-pollinate, each parent will give one factor (T or t) to the F2 generation. So the F2 offspring will have four possible combinations of factors: TT, Tt, tT, or tt. According to the laws of probability, 25% of the offspring would be tt, so they would appear short. And 75% would have at least one T factor and would be tall. 
Summary 	  • One hereditary factor is dominant to the other. The dominant trait masks the recessive factor, so that when both factors are present, only the effects of the dominant factor are noticeable. • According to Mendel’s law of segregation, there are two hereditary factors for each trait that must segregate during gamete (egg and sperm) production. As a result, offspring receive one factor from each parent, resulting in two factors for each trait in the offspring.

What did he conclude from this ratio? Explain where these ratios came from. F1 generation is allowed to self-pollinate? • Explain the relationship between probability and genetics. • Use a Punnett square to make predictions about the traits of the offspring of a genetic cross. What’s the chance of the coin landing on heads? There is always a 50-50 chance that a coin will land on heads. Half the time it will land on heads and half the time it will land on tails. What is the chance of it landing heads twice in a row? Or three times? These rules of probability also apply to genetics. A parent only gives one factor for each trait to an offspring. If a parent has one dominant and one recessive factor for a trait, then, on average, half the time the dominant factor will be passed on, and half the time the recessive factor will be passed on. 
Probability and  Punnett  Squares 	  A Punnett square is a special tool derived from the laws of probability. It is used to predict the possible offspring from a cross, or mating between two parents. An example of a Punnett square ( Figure 3.16) shows the results of a cross between two purple flowers that each have one dominant factor and one recessive factor (Bb). The Punnett square of a cross between two purple flowers (Bb). A Punnett square can be used to calculate what percentage of offspring will have a certain trait. To create a Punnett square, perform the following steps: The possible offspring are represented by the letters in the boxes, with one factor coming from each parent. Results: • Top left box: BB, or purple flowers • Top right box: Bb, or purple flowers • Lower left box: Bb, or purple flowers • Lower right box: bb, or white flowers Only one of the plants out of the four, or 25% of the plants, has white flowers (bb). The other 75% have purple flowers (BB, Bb), because the purple factor (B) is the dominant factor. This shows that the color purple is the dominant trait in pea plants. Now imagine you cross one of the white flowers (bb) with a purple flower that has both a dominant and recessive factor (Bb). The only possible gamete in the white flower is recessive (b), while the purple flower can have gametes with either dominant (B) or recessive (b). Practice using a Punnett square with this cross (see Table 3.1). TABLE 3.1: White Flower (bb) Crossed with Purple Flower (Bb)

Did Mendel know about DNA? No, people did not understand that DNA is our hereditary material until long after Mendel’s time. Our modern understanding of DNA and chromosomes helped to explain how Mendel’s rules worked. 
Modern  Genetics 	  Mendel laid the foundation for modern genetics, but there were still a lot of questions he left unanswered. What exactly are the dominant and recessive factors that determine how all organisms look? And how do these factors work? Since Mendel’s time, scientists have discovered the answers to these questions. Genetic material is made out of DNA. It is the DNA that makes up the hereditary factors that Mendel identified. By applying our modern knowledge of DNA and chromosomes, we can explain Mendel’s findings and build on them. In this concept, we will explore the connections between Mendel’s work and modern genetics. 
Traits,  Genes, and  Alleles 	  Recall that our DNA is wound into chromosomes. Each of our chromosomes contains a long chain of DNA that encodes hundreds, if not thousands, of genes. Each of these genes can have slightly different versions from individual to individual. These variants of genes are called alleles. Each parent only donates one allele for each gene to an offspring. For example, remember that for the height gene in pea plants there are two possible factors. These factors are alleles. There is a dominant allele for tallness (T) and a recessive allele for shortness (t). 
Genotype and  Phenotype 	  Genotype is a way to describe the combination of alleles that an individual has for a certain gene ( Table 3.2). For each gene, an organism has two alleles, one on each chromosome of a homologous pair of chromosomes (think of it as one allele from Mom, one allele from Dad). The genotype is represented by letter combinations, such as TT, Tt, and tt. When an organism has two of the same alleles for a specific gene, it is homozygous (homo means "same") for that gene. An organism can be either homozygous dominant (TT) or homozygous recessive (tt). If an organism has two different alleles (Tt) for a certain gene, it is known as heterozygous (hetero means different). 
Two of the same allele 	  One dominant allele and one recessive allele 
 	  tt Phenotype is a way to describe the traits you can see. The genotype is like a recipe for a cake, while the phenotype is like the cake made from the recipe. The genotype expresses the phenotype. For example, the phenotypes of Mendel’s pea plants were either tall or short, or they were purple-flowered or white-flowered. Can organisms with different genotypes have the same phenotypes? Let’s see. What is the phenotype of a pea plant that is homozygous dominant (TT) for the tall trait? Tall. What is the phenotype of a pea plant that is heterozygous (Tt)? It is also tall. The answer is yes, two different genotypes can result in the same phenotype. Remember, the recessive phenotype will be expressed only when the dominant allele is absent, or when an individual is homozygous recessive (tt) ( Figure 3.17). 
Summary 	  • Mendel’s hereditary "factors" are variants of genes called alleles. • Genotype describes the combination of alleles that an individual has for a certain gene, while phenotype describes the traits that you can see.

How would Mendel explain blood types? The inheritance of traits is not always as simple as Mendel’s rules. Each characteristic Mendel investigated was controlled by one gene that had only two possible alleles, one of which was completely dominant over the other. We now know that inheritance is often more complicated than this. In blood types, for example, there are actually three alleles instead of two. And some traits even have more than three alleles. 
Exceptions to  Mendel’s  Rules 	  In all of Mendel’s experiments, he worked with traits where a single gene controlled the trait. Each also had one allele that was always dominant over the recessive allele. But this is not always true. There are exceptions to Mendel’s rules, and these exceptions usually have something to do with the dominant allele. If you cross a homozygous red flower with a homozygous white flower, according to Mendel’s laws, what color flower should result from the cross? Either a completely red or completely white flower, depending on which allele is dominant. But since Mendel’s time, scientists have discovered this is not always the case. 
Incomplete  Dominance 	  One allele is NOT always completely dominant over another allele. Sometimes an individual has a phenotype between the two parents because one allele is not dominant over another. This pattern of inheritance is called incomplete dominance. For example, snapdragon flowers show incomplete dominance. One of the genes for flower color in snapdragons has two alleles, one for red flowers and one for white flowers. A plant that is homozygous for the red allele (RR) will have red flowers, while a plant that is homozygous for the white allele will have white flowers (WW). But the heterozygote will have pink flowers (RW) ( Figure 3.18) as both alleles are expressed. Neither the red nor the white allele is dominant, so the phenotype of the offspring is a blend of the two parents. Pink snapdragons are an example of incomplete dominance. Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant (SS) will have normal red blood cells. What type of blood cells do you think a person who is heterozygous (Ss) for the trait will have? They will have some misshapen cells and some normal cells ( Figure 3.19). Both the dominant and recessive alleles are expressed, so the result is a phenotype that is a combination of the recessive and dominant traits. Sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become misshapen and curved unlike normal, rounded red blood cells. 
Codominance 	  Another exception to Mendel’s laws is a phenomenon called codominance. For example, our blood type shows codominance. Do you know what your blood type is? Are you A? O? AB? Those letters actually represent alleles. Unlike other traits, your blood type has three alleles, instead of two! The ABO blood types ( Figure 3.20) are named for the protein attached to the outside of the blood cell. In this case, two alleles are dominant and completely expressed (IA and IB), while one allele is recessive (i). The IA allele encodes for red blood cells with the A antigen, while the IB allele encodes for red blood cells with the B antigen. The recessive allele (i) does not encode for any proteins. Therefore a person with two recessive alleles (ii) has type O blood. As no dominant (IA and IB) allele is present, the person cannot have type A or type B blood. What are the genotypes of a person with type A or type B blood? 
An example of codominant inheritance is 	  ABO blood types. There are two possible genotypes for type A blood, homozygous (IAIA) and heterozygous (IAi), and two possible genotypes for type B blood, (IBIB and IBi). If a person is heterozygous for both the IA and IB alleles, they will express both and have type AB blood with both proteins on each red blood cell. This pattern of inheritance is significantly different than Mendel’s rules for inheritance, because both alleles are expressed completely, and one does not mask the other. 
Summary 	  • Incomplete dominance, as seen in sickle cell anemia, is a form of inheritance in which one allele is only partly dominant over the other allele, resulting in an intermediate phenotype. • Codominance, as in human blood type, is a form of inheritance in which both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype of the heterozygote.

Unlike Mendel’s peas, people do not all fall into two categories: short or tall. Most people, in fact, are somewhere in between. Obviously, Mendel’s rules are too simple to explain the inheritance of human height. 
Polygenic  Traits 	  Another exception to Mendel’s rules is polygenic inheritance, which occurs when a trait is controlled by more than one gene. This means that each dominant allele "adds" to the expression of the next dominant allele. Usually, traits are polygenic when there is wide variation in the trait. For example, humans can be many different sizes. Height is a polygenic trait, controlled by at least three genes with six alleles. If you are dominant for all of the alleles for height, then you will be very tall. There is also a wide range of skin color across people. Skin color is also a polygenic trait, as are hair and eye color. Polygenic inheritance often results in a bell shaped curve when you analyze the population ( Figure 3.21). That means that most people fall in the middle of the phenotypic range, such as average height, while very few people are at the extremes, such as very tall or very short. At one end of the curve will be individuals who are recessive for all the alleles (for example, aabbcc); at the other end will be individuals who are dominant for all the alleles (for example, AABBCC). Through the middle of the curve will be individuals who have a combination of dominant and recessive alleles (for example, AaBbCc or AaBBcc). Polygenic traits tend to result in a distribution that resembles a bell-shaped curve, the extremes and most with few at in the middle. 
There may be 4 or 6 or 	  more alleles involved in the phenotype. At the left extreme, individuals are completely dominant for all alleles, and at the right extreme, individuals are completely recessive for all alleles. 
Individuals in 	  the middle have various combinations of recessive and dominant alleles.

Male or female? One of the exciting things about expecting a child is wondering if the baby will be a boy or a girl. There are many superstitions about how one might influence or predict the outcome. But what really determines if a baby is male or female? We now know that the gender of a baby is determined by a special pair of chromosomes known as the sex chromosomes. 
Sex-linked  Inheritance 	  What determines if a baby is a male or female? Recall that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes—and one of those pairs is the sex chromosomes. Everyone has two sex chromosomes. Your sex chromosomes can be X or Y. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY). If a baby inherits an X chromosome from the father and an X chromosome from the mother, what will be the child’s sex? The baby will have two X chromosomes, so it will be female. If the father’s sperm carries the Y chromosome, the child will be male. Notice that a mother can only pass on an X chromosome, so the sex of the baby is determined by the father. The father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the Y or X chromosome, so there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be male, and there is a 50 percent chance a child will be female. This 50:50 chance occurs for each baby. A couple’s first five children could all be boys. The sixth child still has a 50:50 chance of being a girl. One special pattern of inheritance that doesn’t fit Mendel’s rules is sex-linked inheritance, referring to the inheritance of traits that are located on genes on the sex chromosomes. Since males and females do not have the same sex chromosomes, there will be differences between the sexes in how these sex-linked traits—traits linked to genes located on the sex chromosomes—are expressed. Sex-linked traits usually refer to traits due to genes on the X chromosome. One example of a sex-linked trait is red-green colorblindness. People with this type of colorblindness cannot tell the difference between red and green. They often see these colors as shades of brown ( Figure 3.22). Boys are much more likely to be colorblind than girls ( Table 3.3). This is because colorblindness is a sex-linked, recessive trait. Boys only have one X chromosome, so if that chromosome carries the gene for colorblindness, they will be colorblind. As girls have two X chromosomes, a girl can have one X chromosome with the colorblind gene and one X chromosome with a normal gene for color vision. Since colorblindness is recessive, the dominant normal gene will mask the recessive colorblind gene. Females with one colorblindness allele and one normal allele are referred to as carriers. They carry the allele but do not express it. How would a female become colorblind? She would have to inherit two genes for colorblindness, which is very unlikely. Many sex-linked traits are inherited in a recessive manner. 
A person with red-green colorblindness 	  would not be able to see the number. TABLE 3.3: Cross Between a Female Carrier for Colorblindness and a Male with Normal Vision

At some point in your life, you’re bound to catch a cold. And there are ways to prevent catching a cold. But what if you couldn’t prevent an illness? What if you were born with a disease? What if having a disease was actually due to your DNA? These are genetic diseases, and they can be very serious. 
Human  Genetic  Disorders 	  Many genetic disorders are caused by mutations in one or a few genes. Others are caused by chromosomal mutations. Some human genetic disorders are X-linked or Y-linked, which means the faulty gene is carried on these sex chromosomes. Other genetic disorders are carried on one of the other 22 pairs of chromosomes; these chromosomes are known as autosomes or autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes. Some genetic disorders are due to new mutations, others can be inherited from your parents. 
Autosomal  Recessive  Disorders 	  Some genetic disorders are caused by recessive alleles of a single gene on an autosome. An example of autosomal recessive genetic disorders are Tay-Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. Children with cystic fibrosis have excessively thick mucus in their lungs, which makes it difficult for them to breathe. The inheritance of this recessive allele is the same as any other recessive allele, so a Punnett square can be used to predict the probability that two carriers of the disease will have a child with cystic fibrosis. Recall that carriers have the recessive allele for a trait but do not express the trait. What are the possible genotypes of the offspring in the following table ( Table 3.4)? What are the possible phenotypes? 
 	  f 
 	  (normal) 
Ff 	  (carrier) f 
Ff 	  (carrier) ff (affected) According to this Punnett square, two parents that are carriers (Ff ) of the cystic fibrosis gene have a 25% chance of having a child with cystic fibrosis (ff ). The affected child must inherit two recessive alleles. The carrier parents are not affected. Tay-Sachs disease is a severe genetic disorder in which affected children do not live to adulthood, so the gene is not passed from an affected individual. Carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene are not affected. How does a child become affected with Tay-Sachs? 
Automsomal  Dominant  Disorders 	  Huntington’s disease is an example of an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that if the dominant allele is present, then the person will express the disease. A child only has to inherit one dominant allele to have the disease. The disease causes the brain’s cells to break down, leading to muscle spasms and personality changes. Unlike most other genetic disorders, the symptoms usually do not become apparent until middle age. You can use a simple Punnett square to predict the inheritance of a dominant autosomal disorder, like Huntington’s disease. If one parent has Huntington’s disease, what is the chance of passing it on to the children? If you draw the Punnett square, you will find that there is a 50 percent chance of the disorder being passed on to the children. 
Summary 	  • Autosomal recessive genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, are caused by recessive alleles of a single gene on an autosome. • Autosomal dominant genetic disorders, such as Huntington’s disease, are caused by dominant alleles of a single gene on an autosome.

What’s a pedigree? When you are talking about a pedigree dog, it means the dog is purebred. Through selective breeding, the dog has all the traits of that particular breed. When talking about genetics, however, a pedigree is a chart that helps show family relationships. 
Pedigree  Analysis 	  A pedigree is a chart that shows the inheritance of a trait over several generations. A pedigree is commonly created for families, and it outlines the inheritance patterns of genetic disorders and traits. A pedigree can help predict the probability that offspring will inherit a genetic disorder. Pictured below is a pedigree displaying recessive inheritance of a disorder through three generations ( Figure 3.23). From studying a pedigree, scientists can determine the following: • If the trait is sex-linked (on the X or Y chromosome) or autosomal (on a chromosome that does not determine sex). • If the trait is inherited in a dominant or recessive fashion. Sometimes pedigrees can also help determine whether individuals with the trait are heterozygous (two different alleles) or homozygous (two of the same allele). Some points to keep in mind when analyzing a pedigree are: homozygous dominant or heterozygous. is usually recessive. In a pedigree, squares symbolize males, and circles represent females. A horizontal line joining a male and female indicates that the couple had offspring. Vertical lines indicate offspring which are listed left to right, in order of birth. Shading of the circle or square indicates an individual who has the trait being traced. 
In this 	  pedigree, the inheritance of the recessive trait is being traced. A is the dominant allele, and a is the recessive allele.

From whom did he inherit these pieces. • Describe the genetics of Down syndrome. • Explain how changes in chromosomes can cause disorders in humans. Can you have too many chromosomes? Yes, it’s not a good thing to have extra chromosomes. An extra chromosome can be fatal to an embryo, in fact. In the case of a few chromosomes, however, a baby may be born with an extra chromosome. This child will have a chromosomal disorder. 
Chromosomal  Disorders 	  Some children are born with genetic defects that are not carried by a single gene. Instead, an error in a larger part of the chromosome or even in an entire chromosome causes the disorder. Usually the error happens when the egg or sperm is forming. Having extra chromosomes or damaged chromosomes can cause disorders. 
Extra  Chromosomes 	  One common example of an extra-chromosome disorder is Down syndrome ( Figure 3.24). Children with Down syndrome are mentally disabled and also have physical deformities. Down syndrome occurs when a baby receives an extra chromosome 21 from one of his or her parents. Usually, a child will receive one chromosome 21 from the mother and one chromosome 21 from the father. In an individual with Down syndrome, however, there are three copies of chromosome 21 ( Figure 3.25). Therefore, Down syndrome is also known as Trisomy 21. These people have 47 total chromosomes. A child with Down syndrome. 
Syndrome.  Notice the extra chromosome 	  Another example of a chromosomal disorder is Klinefelter syndrome, in which a male inherits an extra “X” chromosome. These individuals have an XXY genotype. They have underdeveloped sex organs and elongated limbs. They also have difficulty learning new things. Outside of chromosome 21 and the sex chromosomes, most embryos with extra chromosomes do not usually survive. Because chromosomes carry many, many genes, a disruption of a chromosome can cause severe problems with the development of a fetus. Individuals with one (or more) fewer chromosome usually don’t survive either. Can you explain why? 
Damaged  Chromosomes 	  Chromosomal disorders also occur when part of a chromosome becomes damaged. For example, if a tiny portion of chromosome 5 is missing, the individual will have cri du chat (cat’s cry) syndrome. These individuals have misshapen facial features, and the infant’s cry resembles a cat’s cry.

Can we alter DNA? You might think that DNA is stable and unchangeable. For the most part you are right. However, there are new technologies that allow us to alter the DNA of humans and other organisms. 
Recombinant  	  Recombinant DNA is the combination of DNA from two different sources. For example, it is possible to place a human gene into bacterial DNA. Recombinant DNA technology is useful in gene cloning and in identifying the function of a gene. Recombinant DNA technology can also be used to produce useful proteins, such as insulin. To treat diabetes, many people need insulin. Previously, insulin had been taken from animals. Through recombinant DNA technology, bacteria were created that carry the human gene which codes for the production of insulin. These bacteria become tiny factories that produce this protein. Recombinant DNA technology helps create insulin so it can be used by humans. Recombinant DNA technology is used in gene cloning. A clone is an exact genetic copy. Genes are cloned for many reasons, including use in medicine and in agriculture. Below are the steps used to copy, or clone, a gene: As the bacteria divide, the recombinant DNA molecules are divided between the new cells. Over a 12to 
Plasmids 	  Bacteria have small rings of DNA in the cytoplasm, called plasmids ( Figure 3.26). A plasmid is not part of the bacterial chromosome, but an additional pieced of DNA. When putting foreign DNA into a bacterium, the plasmids are often used as a vector. Viruses can also be used as vectors. The manipulation of the plasmid DNA, and then the insertion of the recombinant plasmid into a bacterium, is an invaluable tool in scientific research. This image shows a drawing of a plasmid. 
The plasmid has two large segments and 	  one small segment depicted. The two large segments (green and blue) indicate antibiotic resistances usually used in a screening procedure. The antibiotic resistance segments ensure only bacteria with the plasmid will grow. The small segment (red) indicates an origin of replication. 
The origin of replication is where  	  replication starts, copying the plasmid.

Cloning 	  Cloning is the process of creating an exact genetic replica of an organism. The clone’s DNA is exactly the same as the parent’s DNA. Bacteria and other single-celled organisms have long been able to clone themselves through asexual reproduction. Plants can also reproduce asexually. In animals, however, cloning does not happen naturally. In 1997, that all changed when a sheep named Dolly was the first large mammal ever to be successfully cloned. Other animals can now also be cloned in a laboratory. The process of producing an animal like Dolly starts with a single cell from the animal that is going to be cloned. Below are the steps involved in the process of cloning: other somatic cells can be used. Somatic cells come from the body and are not gametes like sperm or egg. donor egg to maintain the appropriate chromosome number. zygote. The zygote is the first cell of a new organism. 
To clone an animal, a nucleus from the 	  animal’s cells are fused with an egg cell (from which the nucleus has been removed) from a donor, creating a new zygote. Is Cloning Easy? Cloning is not always successful. Most of the time, this cloning process does not result in a healthy adult animal. The process has to be repeated many times until it works. In fact, 277 tries were needed to produce Dolly. This high failure rate is one reason that human cloning is banned in the United States. In order to produce a cloned human, many attempts would result in the surrogate mothers experiencing miscarriages, stillbirths, or deformities in the infant. There are also many additional ethical considerations related to human cloning. Can you think of reasons why people are for or against cloning?

The sequence of letters above represents bases in someone’s DNA. It is now possible to find out a person’s entire genetic code by determining all the bases in his or her DNA.

Human  Genome  Project 	  A person’s genome is all of his or her genetic information. In other words, the human genome is all the information that makes us human. And unless you have an identical twin, your genome is unique. No one else has a genome just like yours, though all our genomes are similar. The Human Genome Project ( Figure 3.28) was an international effort to sequence all 3 billion bases that make up our DNA and to identify within this code more than 20,000 human genes. Scientists also completed a chromosome map, identifying where the genes are located on each of the chromosomes. The Human Genome Project was completed in 2003. Though the Human Genome Project is finished, analysis of the data will continue for many years. To say the Human Genome Project has been beneficial to mankind would be an understatement. Exciting applications of the Human Genome Project include the following: • The genetic basis for many diseases can be more easily determined. Now there are tests for over 1,000 genetic disorders. • The technologies developed during this effort, and since the completion of this project, will reduce the cost of sequencing a person’s genome. This may eventually allow many people to sequence their individual genome. • Analysis of your own genome could determine if you are at risk for specific diseases. To complete the Human Genome Project, all 23 pairs of chromosomes in the human body were sequenced. Each chromosome contains thousands of genes. This is a karyotype, a visual representation of an individual’s chromosomes lined up by size. • Knowing you might be genetically prone to a certain disease would allow you to make preventive lifestyle changes or have medical screenings.

Can doctors fix your DNA? There are many genetic disorders that are due to a single gene. What if we could fix this faulty gene? With the development of gene therapy, that may eventually be possible for many types of genetic disorders. 
Gene  Therapy 	  Gene therapy is the insertion of genes into a person’s cells to cure a genetic disorder. Could gene therapy be the cure for AIDS? No, AIDS is caused by a virus. Gene therapy only works to fix disorders caused by a faulty gene. The patient would have had this disorder from birth. Though gene therapy is still in experimental stages, the common use of this therapy may occur during your lifetime. There are two main types of gene therapy: Both types of gene therapy use a vector, or carrier molecule for the gene. The vector helps incorporate the desired gene into the patient’s DNA. Usually this vector is modified viral DNA in which the viral genes have been removed. Don’t worry, the virus used in gene therapy has been deactivated. 
In  Vivo  Gene  Therapy 	  During in vivo gene therapy, done inside the body, the vector with the gene of interest is introduced directly into the patient and taken up by the patient’s cells ( Figure 3.29). For example, cystic fibrosis gene therapy is targeted at the respiratory system, so a solution with the vector can be sprayed into the patient’s nose. Recently, in vivo gene therapy was also used to partially restore the vision of three young adults with a rare type of eye disease. During gene therapy, adenovirus is a possible vector to carry the desired gene and insert it into the patient’s DNA. A deactivated virus makes a useful vector for this purpose. In ex vivo gene therapy, done outside the body, cells are removed from the patient and the proper gene is inserted using a virus as a vector. The modified cells are placed back into the patient. One of the first uses of this type of gene therapy was in the treatment of a young girl with a rare genetic disease, adenosine deaminase deficiency, or ADA deficiency. People with this disorder are missing the ADA enzyme, which breaks down a toxin called deoxyadenosine. If the toxin is not broken down, it accumulates and destroys immune cells. As a result, individuals with ADA deficiency do not have a healthy immune system to fight off infections. In the gene therapy treatment for this disorder, bone marrow stem cells were taken from the girl’s body, and the missing gene was inserted into these cells outside the body. Then the modified cells were put back into her bloodstream. This treatment successfully restored the function of her immune system, but only with repeated treatments.

Have you ever eaten genetically engineered foods? Most likely, yes. The majority of the corn in the United States is genetically engineered.

Biotechnology in  Agriculture 	  Biotechnology is changing the genetic makeup of living things to make a useful product. Biotechnology has led scientists to develop useful applications in agriculture and food science. These include the development of transgenic crops. In transgenic crops, genes are placed into plants to give the crop a beneficial trait. Benefits include: • Improved yield from crops. • Increased resistance of crops to environmental stresses. • Increased nutritional qualities of food crops. • Improved taste, texture or appearance of food. • Reduced dependence on fertilizers, insecticides, and other chemicals. Crops are obviously dependent on environmental conditions. Drought can destroy crop yields, as can too much rain and floods. But what if crops could be developed to withstand these harsh conditions? Biotechnology will allow the development of crops containing genes that will help them to withstand harsh conditions. For example, drought and salty soil are two significant factors affecting how well crops grow. But there are crops that can withstand these harsh conditions. Why? Probably because of that plant’s genetics. So scientists are studying plants that can cope with these extreme conditions. They hope to identify and isolate the genes that control these beneficial traits. The genes could then be transferred into more desirable crops, with the hope of producing the same traits in those crops. Thale cress ( Figure 3.30), a species of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), is a tiny weed that has been extensively studied. It is often used for plant research because it is very easy to grow, and its DNA has been mapped. Scientists have identified a gene from this plant, At-DBF2, that gives the plant resistance to some environmental stresses. When this gene is inserted into tomato and tobacco cells, the cells were able to withstand environmental stresses like salt, drought, cold, and heat far better than ordinary cells. If these results prove successful in larger trials, then At-DBF2 genes could help in engineering crops that can better withstand harsh environments. Thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana).

DNA is the genetic material, which is the material passed from parents to offspring. It also contains the information used to make RNA. RNA leaves the nucleus and, together with a ribosome, makes proteins. Beginning with Mendel’s pea plants, genetics has become one of the most important fields of biology. Human genetics affects many, if not every, field of medicine. Technologies associated with genetics are involved in developing products to make our lives better but have raised a number of ethical, legal, and social issues. Overview of transcription . ion .

Introduction 	  Do dinosaurs prove evolution? For millions of years dinosaurs roamed and dominated the planet. Then 65 million years ago, they went extinct. It’s hard to argue that dinosaurs did not exist. Where did they come from? Where are they now? Evolution is the "change in species over time." • Define evolution. • Describe the significance of the voyage of the HMS Beagle. • Summarize Darwin’s finding on the Galápagos Islands. Where in the world is this? This picture was taken in the Galápagos Islands, which is off the west coast of South America. The Galápagos Islands are home to many unique organisms, such as these tree-like cacti. Darwin’s observations on these islands led to his development of the theory of evolution. 
Darwin’s  Theory of  Evolution 	  Do you ever wonder why some birds are big like ostriches and some birds are small like robins? Or why a lion has a mane while a leopard has spots? In the 19th century, an English natural scientist named Charles Darwin ( Figure He set out to answer the following questions: • Why are organisms different? • Why are organisms similar? • Why are there so many different types of organisms? To answer his questions, he developed what we now call "the theory of evolution by natural selection." This theory is one of the most important theories in the field of life science. In everyday English, "evolution" simply means "change." In biology, evolution states that all living organisms came from earlier forms of life. The theory of evolution by natural selection explains why evolution occurs. Darwin spent over 20 years traveling around the world and making observations before he fully developed his theory. Charles Darwin was one of the most influential scientists who has ever lived. Darwin introduced the world to the theory of evolution by natural selection, which laid the foundation for how we understand the living world today. 
Voyage of the 	  In 1859, Charles Darwin published his book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (often known as The Origin of Species). His book describes the observations and evidence that he collected more than 20 years of research, beginning with a five-year voyage around the world on a British research ship, the HMS Beagle. During the voyage ( Figure 4.2), Darwin made observations about plants and animals around the world. He also collected specimens to study for when he returned to England. Each time the HMS Beagle stopped at a port, Darwin went on land to explore and look at the local plants, animals, and fossils. One of the most important things Darwin did was keep a diary. He took detailed notes and made drawings of his observations. 
Charles  Darwin’s famous five year voyage 	  was aboard the HMS Beagle from 1831- 
The  Galápagos  Islands 	  While the crew of the HMS Beagle mapped the coastline of South America, they traveled to a group of islands called the Galápagos. The Galápagos are a group of 16 volcanic islands near the equator, about 600 miles from the west coast of South America. Darwin spent months on foot exploring the islands. The specimens he collected from the Galápagos and sent back to England greatly influenced his ideas of evolution ( Figure 4.3). 
The  Galápagos  Islands are a group of 16 	  volcanic islands 600 miles off the west coast of South America. 
The islands 	  are famous for their many species found nowhere else. 
It was on these islands 	  where Darwin began to develop his theory of evolution. On the Galápagos, Darwin observed that the same kind of animal differed from one island to another. For example, the iguanas (large lizards) differed between islands ( Figure 4.4). The members of one iguana species spent most of their time in the ocean, swimming and diving underwater for seaweed, while those of another iguana species lived on land and ate cactus. Darwin wondered why there were two species of iguanas on the same set of islands that were so different from one another. What do you think? 
The  Galápagos iguanas are among the 	  signature animals of the Galápagos Islands. Here both a land iguana and a marine iguana are shown. 
Giant  Tortoises 	  Darwin also observed giant tortoises on the Galápagos ( Figure 4.5). These tortoises were so large that two people could ride on them. Darwin noticed that different tortoise species lived on islands with different environments. He realized that the tortoises had traits that allowed them to live in their particular environments. For example, tortoises that ate plants near the ground had rounded shells and shorter necks. Tortoises on islands with tall shrubs had longer necks and shells that bent upward, allowing them to stretch their necks ( Figure 4.5). Darwin began to hypothesize that organisms developed traits over time because of differences in their environments. Darwin began to think that organisms evolved adaptations that allowed them to live in their environment. These adaptations were beneficial traits for their environment. The name “Galápagos” means “giant tortoise.” When Darwin arrived on the Galápagos Islands, he was amazed by the size and variety of shapes of these animals. The giant tortoise (left) is a unique animal found only in the Galápagos Islands. There are only about 200 tortoises remaining on these islands. This Pinta 
Island tortoise (right) is able to reach 	  leaves high in shrubs with its long neck and curved shell. 
Darwin’s  Finches 	  The most studied animals on the Galápagos are finches, a type of bird ( Figure 4.6). When Darwin first observed finches on the islands, he did not even realize they were all finches. But when he studied them further, he realized they were related to each other. Each island had its own distinct species of finch. The birds on different islands had many similarities, but their beaks differed in size and shape. 
Galápagos  Islands.  The birds came from 	  the same finch ancestor. They evolved as they adapted to different food resources on different islands. The first bird uses its large beak to crack open and eat large seeds. Bird #3 is able to pull small seeds out of small spaces. In his diary, Darwin pointed out how each animal is well-suited for its particular environment. The shapes of the finch beaks on each island were well-matched with the seeds available on that island, but not the seeds on other islands. For example, a larger and stronger beak was needed to break open large seeds on one island, and a small beak was needed to eat the small seeds on a different island.

How old is Earth? Earth is now believed to be over 4.5 billion years old. But during Darwin’s time, most people believed that the Earth was only about 6,000 years old. If Darwin hadn’t learned about the work of geologists that suggested that the Earth was much older, he might have never have developed his theory of evolution. 
Darwin’s  Influences 	  When Darwin returned to England five years later, in 1836, at the end of his voyage, he did not rush to announce his discoveries. Unlike other naturalists before him, Darwin did not want to present any ideas unless he had strong evidence supporting them. Instead, once Darwin returned to England, he spent over twenty years examining specimens, talking with other scientists and collecting more information before he presented his theories. Some of Darwin’s ideas conflicted with widely held beliefs, including those from religious leaders. At that time, many people believed that organisms never change and never go extinct, and that the world was only about 6,000 years old, always existing in the same way, never changing. These beliefs delayed Darwin in presenting his findings. How did Darwin come up with his theories? Charles Darwin was influenced by the ideas of several people. However, Darwin differed with Lamarck on several key points. Lamarck proposed that traits acquired during one’s lifetime could be passed to the next generation. Darwin did not agree with this. Darwin about geology, paleontology, and the changing Earth. Lyell’s findings suggested the Earth must be much older than 6,000 years. And the evolution of life, as Darwin was developing his ideas, would definitely take much longer than just 6,000 years. During the Voyage of the Beagle, Darwin observed fossils of sea life high up in the mountains. What must happen to the Earth for this to occur? Darwin, using the readings of Lyell, took this as evidence of a constantly changing Earth. theory of evolution by natural selection. Wallace toured South America and made similar observations to Darwin’s. Darwin and Wallace presented their theories and evidence in public together. Due to the large number of observations and conclusions he made, Darwin is mostly credited and associated with this theory. Alfred Wallace developed a similar theory of evolution by natural selection. Imagine developing a theory that conflicted with widely held beliefs of the time, as Darwin did. Imagine pulling together material from all these different people, adding his own findings, and turning it all into his theory. Imagine the torment Darwin must have endured during this time, knowing the skepticism that would follow the release of his findings. But, upon his death, Darwin was given one of the highest honors in England. Darwin is buried in Westminster Abbey, the final resting place of many of England’s kings and queens. Why was he buried in such an important spot?

How is this deer mouse well adapted for life in the forest? Notice how its dark coloring would allow the deer mouse to easily hide from predators on the darkened forest floor. On the other hand, deer mice that live in the nearby Sand Hills are a lighter, sand-like color. What caused the deer mice to be so well adapted to their unique environments? Natural selection. 
Natural  Selection 	  The theory of evolution by natural selection means that the inherited traits of a population change over time. Inherited traits are features that are passed from one generation to the next. For example, your eye color is an inherited trait. You inherited your eye color from your parents. Inherited traits are different from acquired traits, or traits that organisms develop over a lifetime, such as strong muscles from working out ( Figure 4.8). Natural selection explains how organisms in a population develop traits that allow them to survive and reproduce. Natural selection means that traits that offer an advantage will most likely be passed on to offspring; individuals with those traits have a better chance of surviving. Evolution occurs by natural selection. Take the giant tortoises on the Galápagos Islands as an example. If a short-necked tortoise lives on an island with fruit located at a high level, will the short-necked tortoise survive? No, it will not, because it will not be able to reach the food it needs to survive. If all of the short necked tortoises die, and the long-necked tortoises survive, then, Human earlobes may be attached or free. 
You inherited the particular shape of your 	  earlobes from your parents. 
Inherited 	  traits are influenced by genes, which are passed on to offspring and future generations. Things not influenced by genes are not passed on to your offspring. Natural selection only operates on traits like earlobe shape that have a genetic basis, not on traits that are acquired, like a summer tan. over time, only the long-necked trait will be passed down to offspring. All of the tortoises with long-necks will be "naturally selected" to survive. Organisms that are not well-adapted, for whatever reason, to their environment, will naturally have less of a chance of surviving and reproducing. Every plant and animal depends on its traits to survive. Survival may include getting food, building homes, and attracting mates. Traits that allow a plant, animal, or other organism to survive and reproduce in its environment are called adaptations. Natural selection occurs when: selection would not be possible. Imagine how in the Arctic, dark fur makes a rabbit easy for foxes to spot and catch in the snow. Therefore, white fur is a beneficial trait that improves the chance that a rabbit will survive, reproduce, and pass the trait of white fur on to its offspring ( Figure 4.9). Through this process of natural selection, dark fur rabbits will become uncommon over time. Rabbits will adapt to have white fur. In essence, the selection of rabbits with white fur the beneficial trait is a natural process. Why So Many Species? Scientists estimate that there are between 5 million and 30 million species on the planet. But why are there so many? Different species are well-adapted to live and survive in many different types of environments. As environments change over time, organisms must constantly adapt to those environments. Diversity of species increases the chance that at least some organisms adapt and survive any major changes in the environment. For example, if a natural disaster kills all of the large organisms on the planet, then the small organisms will continue to survive. 
Summary 	  • Evolution occurs by natural selection, the process by which organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Evolution is due to differences in the survival and reproduction of individuals within a population. 
The white fur of 	  the Arctic hares may make it more difficult for fox and other predators to locate hares against the white snow. • Natural selection occurs when there is some variation in the inherited traits, some of these traits will give individuals an advantage over others, and the individuals with certain traits will be more likely to have more offspring.

What’s on this rock? This rock contains a portion of a fossilized tree fern. Scientists study fossils of plants, animals, and other organisms in order to better understand what life was like on Earth many years ago and how it has changed over time. Fossils are important evidence for the theory of evolution. 
The  Fossil  Record 	  Fossils are the preserved remains of animals, plants, and other organisms from the distant past. Examples of fossils include bones, teeth, and impressions. By studying fossils, evidence for evolution is revealed. Paleontologists are scientists who study fossils to learn about life in the past. Fossils allow these scientists to determine the features of extinct species. Paleontologists compare the features of species from different periods in history. With this information, they try to understand how species have evolved over millions of years ( Figure below). Until recently, fossils were the main source of evidence for evolution ( Figure below). Through studying fossils, we now know that today’s organisms look much different in many cases than those that were alive in the past. Scientists have also shown that organisms were spread out differently across the planet. Earthquakes, volcanoes, shifting seas, and other movements of the continents have all affected where organisms live and how they adapted to their changing environments. the horse. 
Evolution of 	  Fossil evidence, depicted by the skeletal fragments, demonstrates evolutionary milestones in this process. Notice the 57 million year evolution of the horse leg bones and teeth. Especially obvious is the transformation of the leg bones from having four distinct digits to that of today’s horse. 
Rock  Layers and the  Age of  Fossils 	  There are many layers of rock in the Earth’s surface. Newer layers form on top of the older layers; the deepest rock layers are the oldest. Therefore, you can tell how old a fossil is by observing in which layer of rock it was found. The fossils and the order in which fossils appear is called the fossil record. The fossil record provides evidence for when organisms lived on Earth, how species evolved, and how some species have gone extinct. Geologists use a method called radiometric dating to determine the exact age of rocks and fossils in each layer of rock. About 25 to 40 million years ago these insects were trapped in a gooey substance, called resin, that comes from trees. The fossils in the movie Jurassic Park were trapped in resin. This technique, which is possible because radioactive materials decay at a known rate, measures how much of the radioactive materials in each rock layer have broken down ( Figure 4.12). This device, called a spectrophotometer, can be used to measure the level of radioactive decay of certain elements in rocks and fossils to determine their age. Radiometric dating has been used to determine that the oldest known rocks on Earth are between 4 and 5 billion years old. The oldest fossils are between 3 and 4 billion years old. Remember that during Darwin’s time, people believed the Earth was just about 6,000 years old. The fossil record proves that Earth is much older than people once thought.

Why do you have a tail bone? If you look closely at a skeleton, you might notice a triangular bone at the end of the spinal column. This is your tailbone. Why would you have a tailbone when you don’t have a tail? You have a tailbone because your ancient ancestors did have a tail. These sorts of "left-over" structures support the theory of evolution. 
Structural  Evidence 	  Even though two different species may not look similar, they may have similar internal structures that suggest they have a common ancestor. That means both evolved from the same ancestor organism a long time ago. Common ancestry can also be determined by looking at the structure of the organism as it first develops. 
Vestigial  Structures 	  Some of the most interesting kinds of evidence for evolution are body parts that have lost their use through evolution ( Figure 4.13). For example, most birds need their wings to fly. But the wings of an ostrich have lost their original use. Structures that have lost their use through evolution are called vestigial structures. They provide evidence for evolution because they suggest that an organism changed from using the structure to not using the structure, or using it for a different purpose. Penguins do not use their wings, known as flippers, to fly in the air. However, they do use them to move in the water. The theory of evolution suggests that penguins evolved to use their wings for a different purpose. A whale’s pelvic bones, which were once attached to legs, are also vestigial structures. Whales are descended from land-dwelling ancestors that had legs. Homologous structures are structures that have a common function and suggest common ancestry. For example, homologous structures include the limbs of mammals, such as bats, lions, whales, and humans, which all have a common ancestor. Different mammals may use their limbs for walking, running, swimming or flying. The method the mammal uses to move is considered a common function. 
Moles live underground where they do 	  not need eyes to find their way around. This mole’s eyes are covered by skin. 
Body parts that do not serve their original 	  function are vestigial structures. 
Similar  Embryos 	  Some of the oldest evidence of evolution comes from embryology, the study of how organisms develop. An embryo is an animal or plant in its earliest stages of development. This means looking at a plant or animal before it is born or hatched. Centuries ago, people recognized that the embryos of many different species have similar appearances. The embryos of some species are even difficult to tell apart. Many of these animals do not differ much in appearance until they develop further. Some unexpected traits can appear in animal embryos. For example, human embryos have gill slits just like fish! In fish they develop into gills, but in humans they disappear before birth. The presence of the gill slits suggests that a long time ago humans and fish shared a common ancestor. The similarities between embryos suggests that these animals are related and have common ancestors. For example, humans did not evolve from chimpanzees. But the similarities between the embryos of both species suggest that we have an ancestor in common with chimpanzees. As our common ancestor evolved, humans and chimpanzees went down different evolutionary paths and developed different traits. 
Summary 	  • Vestigial structures, or structures that have lost their use through evolution, are important evidence of evolution. • Studying the embryos of organisms also provides evidence that two very different animals could have descended from a common ancestor. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Richard Dawkins Vestigial Organs The Wings of the Flightless Cormorant at URL watch?v=3e5cs0PtuA4 . • Describe molecular clocks. • Explain the molecular evidence for evolution. How similar are you to a chimpanzee? Chimpanzees and humans turn out to be very similar—if you look at their DNA. When scientists determined the entire genetic code of both humans and chimpanzees, they found that we have over 98% identical DNA. 
Molecular  Evidence 	  Arguably, some of the best evidence of evolution comes from examining the molecules and DNA found in all living things. Beginning in the 1940s, scientists studying molecules and DNA have confirmed conclusions about evolution drawn from other forms of evidence. Molecular clocks are used to determine how closely two species are related by calculating the number of differences between the species’ DNA sequences or amino acid sequences. These clocks are sometimes called gene clocks or evolutionary clocks. The fewer the differences, the less time since the species split from each other and began to evolve into different species ( Figure 4.14). A chicken and a gorilla will have more differences between their DNA and amino acid sequences than a gorilla and an orangutan. That means the chicken and gorilla had a common ancestor a very long time ago, while the gorilla and orangutan shared a more recent common ancestor. This provides additional evidence that the gorilla and orangutan are more closely related than the gorilla and the chicken. Which pair of organisms would have more molecular differences, a mammal and a bird, a mammal and a frog, or a mammal and a fish? On the other hand, animals may look similar but can have very different DNA sequences and evolutionary ancestry. Which would have more DNA sequences in common, a whale and a horse, or a whale and a shark? 
Almost all organisms are made from  	  with the same building blocks. 
The 	  genomes (all of the genes in an organism) of all mammals are almost identical. The genomes, or all the DNA sequences of all the genes of an organism, have been determined for many different organisms. The comparison of genomes provides new information about the relationships among species and how evolution occurs ( Figure 4.15). Molecular evidence for evolution also includes: bacteria to plants and animals. Recall that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA.

Why do pesticides sometimes stop working? Pesticides were designed to kill bothersome insects. However, sometimes these pesticides will stop working. A pesticide that has worked in the past may no longer kill a particular type of insect. This is due to the development of resistance in the population of insects. The development of resistance to pesticides is one example of microevolution, a small change in a population. 
Microevolution and  Macroevolution 	  Does evolution only happen gradually through small changes? Or is it possible that drastic environmental changes can cause new species to evolve? Or can both small and large changes occur? Evolutionary changes can be both big and small. Some evolutionary changes do not create new species, but result in changes at the population level. A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area ( Figure 4.16). But what exactly is the definition of a species? A species is a group of organisms that have similar characteristics (they are genetically similar) and can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring. This school of fish are considered members of the same species because they are able to mate with one another. They are also considered a population because they live in the same part of the ocean. 
Microevolution 	  You already know that evolution is the change in species over time. Most evolutionary changes are small and do not lead to the creation of a new species. When populations change in small ways over time, the process is called microevolution. Microevolution results in changes within a species. An example of microevolution is the evolution of mosquitoes that cannot be killed by pesticides, called pesticideresistant mosquitoes. Imagine that you have a pesticide that kills most of the mosquitoes in your state. Through a random mutation, some of the mosquitoes have resistance to the pesticide. As a result of the widespread use of this pesticide, most of the remaining mosquitoes are the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes. When these mosquitoes reproduce the next year, they produce more mosquitoes with the pesticide-resistant trait. Soon, most of the mosquitoes in your state are resistant to the pesticide. This is an example of microevolution because the number of mosquitoes with this trait changed. However, this evolutionary change did not create a new species of mosquito because the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes can still reproduce with other non-pesticide-resistant mosquitoes. 
Macroevolution 	  Macroevolution refers to much bigger evolutionary changes that result in new species. Macroevolution may happen: Earth, which changes the environment so much that natural selection leads to large changes in the traits of a species. After thousands of years of isolation from each other, Darwin’s finch populations have experienced both microevolution and macroevolution. These finch populations cannot breed with other finch populations when they are brought together. Since they do not breed together, they are classified as separate species.

Would albinism be an advantage? This rabbit is albino, meaning it lacks pigment in its skin, fur, and eyes. The same thing happens in other species, including humans. To most animals albinism would be a disadvantage since they need to blend into their environment to avoid predators or catch prey. How, then, does the gene that causes albinism stay in the gene pool? 
Evolution  Acts on the  Phenotype 	  Natural selection acts on the phenotype (the traits or characteristics) of an individual. On the other hand, natural selection does not act on the underlying genotype (the genetic makeup) of an individual. For many traits, the homozygous genotype, AA, for example, has the same phenotype as the heterozygous Aa genotype. If both an AA and Aa individual have the same phenotype, the environment cannot distinguish between them. So natural selection cannot select for a homozygous individual over a heterozygous individual. Even if the "aa" phenotype is lethal, the recessive a allele, will be maintained in the population through heterozygous Aa individuals. Furthermore, the mating of two heterozygous individuals can produce homozygous recessive (aa) individuals. However, natural selection can and does differentiate between dominant and recessive phenotypes. 
Carriers 	  Since natural selection acts on the phenotype, if an allele causes death in a homozygous individual, aa, for example, it will not cause death in a heterozygous Aa individual. These heterozygous Aa individuals will then act as carriers of the a allele, meaning that the a allele could be passed down to offspring. People who are carriers do not express the recessive phenotype, as they have a dominant allele. This allele is said to be kept in the population’s gene pool. The gene pool is the complete set of genes and alleles within a population. For example, Tay-Sachs disease is a recessive human genetic disorder. That means only individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype, rr will be affected. Affected individuals usually die from complications of the disease in early childhood, at an age too young to reproduce. The two parents are each heterozygous (Rr) for the Tay-Sachs gene; they will not die in childhood and will be carriers of the disease gene. This deadly allele is kept in the gene pool even though it does not help humans adapt to their environment. This happens because evolution acts on the phenotype, not the genotype ( Figure 4.17). Tay-Sachs disease is inherited in the autosomal recessive pattern. Each parent is an unaffected carrier of the lethal allele. 
Summary 	  • Natural selection acts on the phenotype (the traits or characteristics) of an individual, not on the underlying genotype. • Carriers of a trait can show no symptoms of a recessive disease and, yet, still pass it on to their offspring. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Harmful Genes at URL . • Define genetic equilibrium. • List the five conditions necessary for genetic equilibrium. • Explain the Hardy-Weinberg model. Can these stones keep balance indefinitely? If balance, or equilibrium, is to be maintained, there must be no outside influences on the stones. Equilibrium can also be maintained within a population’s genes; that means, no evolution can occur. But outside influences usually prevent equilibrium from staying established. 
Hardy- Weinberg  Equilibrium 	  Sometimes understanding how common a gene is within a population is necessary. Or, more specifically, you may want to know how common a certain form of that gene is within the population, such as a recessive form. This can be done using the Hardy-Weinberg model, but it can only be done if the frequencies of the genes are not changing. The Hardy-Weinberg model describes how a population can remain at genetic equilibrium, referred to as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic equilibrium occurs when there is no evolution within the population. In other words, the frequency of alleles (variants of a gene) will be the same from one generation to another. At genetic equilibrium, the gene or allele frequencies are stable—they do not change. For example, let’s assume that red hair is determined by the inheritance of a gene with two alleles—R and r. The dominant allele, R, encodes for non-red hair, while the recessive allele, r, encodes for red hair. If a population’s gene pool contains 90% R and 10% r alleles, then the next generation would also have 90% R and 10% r alleles. However, this only works under a strict set of conditions. The five conditions that must be met for genetic equilibrium to occur include: These five conditions rarely occur in nature. When one or more of the conditions does not exist, then evolution can occur. As a result, allele frequencies are constantly changing, and populations are constantly evolving. As mutations and natural selection occur frequently in nature, it is difficult for a population to be at genetic equilibrium. The Hardy-Weinberg model also serves a mathematical formula used to predict allele frequencies in a population at genetic equilibrium. If you know the allele frequencies of one generation, you can use this formula to predict the next generation. Again, this only works if all five conditions are being met in a population. 
Summary 	  • If a population stays at genetic equilibrium, then no evolution takes place. • The Hardy-Weinberg model states that a population will remain at genetic equilibrium as long as five conditions are met: (1) No change in the DNA sequence, (2) No migration, (3) A very large population size, (4) Random mating, and (5) No natural selection.

The wide variety of shells that wash up on the beach indicate that there are many forms of life in the ocean. This wide diversity of life requires that many new species have appeared over time. But how does a new species come into being? 
The  Origin of  Species 	  The creation of a new species is called speciation. Most new species develop naturally. But humans have also artificially created new breeds and species for thousands of years. New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection. Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. As new changes in the DNA sequence are constantly being generated in a population’s gene pool (changing the population’s allele frequencies), some of these changes will be beneficial and result in traits that allow adaptation and survival. Natural selection causes evolution of a species as these beneficial traits become more common within a population. Evolution can occur within a species without completely resulting in a new species. Therefore, evolution and speciation are not the same. 
Artificial  Selection 	  Artificial selection occurs when humans select which plants or animals to breed in order to pass on specific traits to the next generation. For example, a farmer may choose to breed only cows that produce the best milk. Farmers would also avoid breeding cows that produce less milk. In this way, selective breeding of the cows would increase milk quality and quantity. Humans have also artificially bred dogs to create new breeds ( Figure 4.18). 
Artificial  Selection:  Humans used artificial 	  selection to create these different breeds. 
Both dog breeds are descended from the 	  same wolves, and their genes are almost identical. 
Reproductive  Isolation 	  There are two main ways that speciation happens naturally. Both processes create new species by reproductively isolating populations of the same species from each other. Organisms can be geographically isolated or isolated by a behavior. Either way, they will no longer be able to mate. Over a long period of time, usually thousands of years, each of the isolated populations evolves in a different direction, forming distinct species. How do you think scientists test whether two populations are separate species? They bring species from two populations back together again. If the two populations do not mate and produce fertile offspring, they are separate species. 
Geographic  Isolation 	  Allopatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species are geographically isolated for long periods. Imagine all the ways that plants or animals could be isolated from each other: • Emergence of a mountain range. • Formation of a canyon. • New rivers or streams. Here are two examples of allopatric speciation: • Darwin observed thirteen distinct finch species on the Galápagos Islands that had evolved from the same ancestor. Different finch populations lived on separate islands with different environments. They evolved to best adapt to those particular environments. Later, scientists were able to determine which finches had evolved into distinct species by bringing members of each population together. The birds that could not mate were a separate species. • When the Grand Canyon in Arizona formed, two populations of one squirrel species were separated by the giant canyon. After thousands of years of isolation from each other, the squirrel populations on the northern wall of the canyon looked and behaved differently from those on the southern wall ( Figure 4.19). North rim squirrels have white tails and black bellies. Squirrels on the south rim have white bellies and dark tails. They cannot mate with each other, so they are different species. 
Abert squirrel (left) on the southern rim 	  of the Grand Canyon. Kaibab squirrel (right) found on northern rim of the Grand Canyon. 
Isolation without  Physical  Separation 	  Sympatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species stop mating because of something other than physical or geographic separation. The behavior of two groups that live in the same region is an example of such separation. The separation may be caused by different mating seasons, for example. Sympatric speciation is more difficult to identify. Here are two examples of sympatric speciation: • Some scientists suspect that two groups of orcas (killer whales) live in the same part of the Pacific Ocean part of the year but do not mate. The two groups hunt different prey species, eat different foods, sing different songs, and have different social interactions ( Figure 4.20). • Two groups of Galápagos Island finch species lived in the same space, but each had his or her own distinct mating signals. Members of each group selected mates according to different beak structures and bird calls. The behavioral differences kept the groups separated until they formed different species. 
Summary 	  • Speciation, the creation of a new species, can happen through natural selection or artificial selection. • Reproductive isolation is necessary for speciation to occur, and this can happen through a geographic barrier (allopatric speciation) or without a geographic barrier (sympatric speciation). • Different behaviors can result in sympatric speciation. 
Scientists suspect that two types of orca 	  whales live in the same part of the Pacific 
Ocean for part of the year, but they do not 	  mate.

Can you watch evolution happening? Usually evolutionary changes occur at a very slow pace. Human evolution took millions of years. However, sometimes evolution can also happen quite quickly. 
Tracing  Evolution 	  How fast is evolution? Can you actually see evolution happening within your lifetime? Usually evolution takes a long time. So how can we visualize how it has happened? 
Rates of  Evolution 	  How long did it take for the giraffe to develop a long neck? How long did it take for the Galápagos finches to evolve? How long did it take for whales to evolve from land mammals? These, and other questions about the rate of evolution, are difficult to answer. The rate of evolution depends on how many of an organism’s genes have changed over a period of time. Evolution is usually so gradual that we do not see the change for many, many generations. The rate of evolution also depends on the generation time of a particular species. Not all organisms evolve at the same rate. Humans took millions of years to evolve from a mammal that is now extinct. It is very difficult to observe evolution in humans. However, there are organisms that are evolving so fast that you can observe evolution! A human takes about 22 years to go through one generation. But some bacteria go through over a thousand generations in less than two months. Some bacteria go through many generations in a few days. And sometimes a bacterial generation is as fast as 20 minutes! We can actually trace their evolution as it is happening. 
Evolutionary  Trees 	  If evolution can take a very long time, how can we visualize how it happens? Charles Darwin came up with the idea of an evolutionary tree to represent the relationships between different species and their common ancestors ( shows where these original species evolved into new species. The branches keep splitting into smaller and smaller branches as species continue to evolve into more and more species. Some species are represented by short twigs spurting out of the tree, then stopping. These are species that went extinct before evolving into new species. Other “Trees of Life” have been created by other scientists ( Figure would that be? Animal, plant, fungi protist, or none of those? 
Life” on the left to represent how species 	  evolve and diverge into separate directions. Each point on the tree where one branch splits off from another represents the common ancestor of the species on the separate branches. Scientists have drawn many different versions of the “Tree of Life” to show different features of evolution. The Tree of Life on the right was made by Ernst Haeckel in 1879.

What did the first life forms look like? The first forms of life on Earth were probably smaller and simpler than even these bacteria. The first forms of life had to be simple single-celled organisms. But how did life begin on Earth? 
Origin of  Life 	  There is good evidence that life has probably existed on Earth for most of Earth’s history. Fossils of blue-green algae found in Australia are the oldest fossils of life forms on Earth. They are at least 3.5 billion years old ( Figure 4.22). 
Life from  Random  Reactions 	  How did life begin? In order to answer this question, scientists need to know what kinds of materials were available at that time. We know that the ingredients for life were present at the beginning of Earth’s history. Scientists believe early Earth did not contain oxygen gas (photosynthesis had yet to evolve), but did contain other gases, including: • nitrogen gas, • carbon dioxide, • carbon monoxide, 
Some of the oldest fossils on  Earth were 	  found along the coast of Australia, similar to the area shown here. • water vapor, • hydrogen sulfide. Where did these ingredients come from? Some chemicals were in water and volcanic gases ( Figure 4.23). Other chemicals would have come from meteorites in space. Energy to drive chemical reactions was provided by volcanic eruptions and lightning. Today, we have evidence that life on Earth came from random reactions between chemical compounds, which formed molecules, or groups of atoms bonded together. Small molecules, such as those present in the early atmosphere, can provide the components (including the elements C, H, N, O and S) to make larger molecules. These early molecules further reacted and eventually formed even larger molecules and organic compounds, such as amino acids (which combine to form proteins), and nucleotides (which form nucleic acids RNA or DNA). These organic molecules eventually came together in the right combinations to form basic cells. The components that were necessary for the formation of the first cells are still being studied. How long did it take to develop the first life forms? As much as 1 billion years. Many scientists still study the origin of the first life forms because there are many questions left unanswered, such as, "Did proteins or nucleic acids develop first?" or "What exactly were early Earth’s atmospheric conditions like?" There is a lot of work still left to answer these and similar questions.

Some clues to the origins of life on  Earth 	  come from studying the early life forms that developed in hot springs, such as the

Which was first, the insect or the flower? Although the land plants were here before insects, the first flowers evolved long after the first insects. The first land plants did not have flowers. Today insects and flowers are so interconnected, it’s hard to imagine one without the other. 
Timeline of  Evolution 	  For life to evolve from simple single-celled organisms to many millions of species of prokaryotic species to simple eukaryotic species to all the protists, fungi, plants, and animals, took some time. Well over 3 billion years. 
The  Age of  Earth 	  How old is Earth? How was it formed? How did life begin on Earth? These questions have fascinated scientists for centuries. During the 1800s, geologists, paleontologists, and naturalists found several forms of physical evidence that confirmed that Earth is very old. The evidence includes: • Fossils of ancient sea life on dry land far from oceans. This supported the idea that the Earth changed over time and that some dry land today was once covered by oceans. • The many layers of rock. When people realized that rock layers represent the order in which rocks and fossils appeared, they were able to trace the history of Earth and life on Earth. • Indications that volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and erosion that happened long ago shaped much of the Earth’s surface. This supported the idea of an older Earth. The Earth is at least as old as its oldest rocks. The oldest rock minerals found on Earth so far are crystals that are at least 4.404 billion years old. These tiny crystals were found in Australia. Likewise, Earth cannot be older than the solar system. The oldest possible age of Earth is 4.57 billion years old, the age of the solar system. Therefore, the age of Earth is between 4.4 and 4.57 billion years. 
Geologic  Time  Scale 	  Geologists and other Earth scientists use geologic time scales to describe when events happened in the history of Earth. The time scales can be used to show when both geologic events and events affecting plant and animal life occurred. The geologic time scale pictured below ( Figure 4.24) illustrates the timing of events like: • Earthquakes. • Volcanic eruptions. • Major erosion. • Meteorites hitting Earth. • The first signs of life forms. • Mass extinctions. The geologic time scale is used to describe events that occurred millions and billions of years ago. The geologic time scale of Earth’s past is organized according to events that took place during different periods on the time scale. Geologic time is the same as the age of the Earth: between 4.404 and 4.57 billion years. Look closely for such events as the extinction of dinosaurs and many marine animals. 
Evolution of  Major  Life  Forms 	  Life on Earth began about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. The first life forms were single-celled organisms similar to bacteria. These first life forms were, of course, very basic, and this then allowed for the evolution of more complex life forms. The first multicellular organisms did not appear until about 610 million years ago. Many different types of organisms evolved during the next ten million years, in an event called the Cambrian Explosion. This sudden burst of evolution may have been caused by some environmental changes that made the Earth’s environment more suitable for a wider variety of life forms. Plants and fungi did not appear until roughly 500 million years ago. They were soon followed by arthropods (insects and spiders). Next came the amphibians about 300 million years ago, followed by mammals around 200 million years ago and birds around 100 million years ago. Even though large life forms have been very successful on Earth, most of the life forms on Earth today are still prokaryotes—small, relatively simple single-celled organisms. As it is difficult to identify, observe and study such small forms of life, most of these organisms remain unknown to scientists. Advancing technologies, however, do allow for the identification and study of such organisms. Fossils indicate that many organisms that lived long ago are extinct. Extinction of species is common; in fact, it is estimated that 99% of the species that have ever lived on Earth no longer exist. The basic timeline of a 4.6 billion-year-old Earth includes the following: • About 3.5 3.8 billion years of simple cells (prokaryotes). • 3 billion years of photosynthesis. • 2 billion years of complex cells (eukaryotes). • 1 billion years of multicellular life. • 600 million years of simple animals. • 570 million years of arthropods (ancestors of insects, arachnids and crustaceans). • 550 million years of complex animals. • 500 million years of fish and proto-amphibians. • 475 million years of land plants. • 400 million years of insects and seeds. • 360 million years of amphibians. • 300 million years of reptiles. • 200 million years of mammals. • 150 million years of birds. • 130 million years of flowers. • 65 million years since the non-avian dinosaurs died out. • 2.5 million years since the appearance of Homo. • 200,000 years since the appearance of modern humans. • 25,000 years since Neanderthals died out.

What happened to the dinosaurs? Most of the dinosaurs disappeared from Earth about 65 million years ago. This is probably the most famous example of a mass extinction. So how do you define a mass extinction? 
Mass  Extinctions 	  An organism goes extinct when all of the members of a species die out and no more members remain. Extinctions are part of natural selection. Species often go extinct when their environment changes, and they do not have the traits they need to survive. Only those individuals with the traits needed to live in a changed environment survive (Survival of the Fittest) ( Figure 4.25). Mass extinctions, such as the extinction of dinosaurs and many marine mammals, happened after major catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes ( Figure 4.26). Since life began on Earth, there have been several major mass extinctions. If you look closely at the geological time scale, you will find that at least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past 540 million years. In each mass extinction, over 50% of animal species died. Though species go extinct frequently, a mass extinction in which such a high percentage of species go extinct is rare. The total number of mass extinctions could be as high as 20. It is probable that we are currently in the midst of another mass extinction. Two of the largest extinctions are described below: 
Humans have caused many extinctions by 	  introducing species to new places. For example, many of New Zealand’s birds have adapted to nesting on the ground. 
This was possible because there were no 	  land mammals in New Zealand. Then Europeans arrived and brought cats, foxes, and other predators with them. Several of 
New  Zealand’s ground nesting birds, such 	  as this flightless kiwi, are now extinct or threatened because of these predators. 
The fossil of  Tarbosaurus, one of the land 	  dinosaurs that went extinct during one of the mass extinctions. • At the end of the Permian Period, it is estimated that about 99.5% of individual organisms went extinct! Up to 95% of marine species perished, compared to “only” 70% of land species. Some scientists theorize that the extinction was caused by the formation of Pangaea, or one large continent made out of many smaller ones. One large continent has a smaller shoreline than many small ones, so reducing the shoreline space may have caused much of the marine life to go extinct ( Figure 4.27). 
The supercontinent  Pangaea encompassed all of today’s continents in a 	  single land mass. This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which harbor marine species. This may have contributed to the dramatic event which ended the Permian—the most massive extinction ever recorded. • At the end of the Cretaceous Period, or 65 million years ago, all dinosaurs (except those which led to birds) went extinct. Some scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth and a comet or asteroid. The collision could have caused tidal waves, changed the climate, increased atmospheric dust and clouds, and reduced sunlight by 10-20%. A decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Evidence for the extinction of dinosaurs by asteroid includes an iridium-rich layer in the Earth, dated at 65.5 million years ago. Iridium is rare in the Earth’s crust but common in comets and asteroids. Maybe the asteroid that hit the Earth left the iridium behind. After each mass extinction, new species evolve to fill the habitats where old species lived. This is well documented in the fossil record. 
Summary 	  • Extinctions, when a species entirely dies out, can happen when the environment changes, and the organisms do not have the traits they need to survive. • Since life began on Earth, there have been at least five major massive extinctions.

Summary 	  Evolution focuses on past life forms and how they turned into present life forms. The history of life on Earth demonstrates how the first cells formed, turned into simple life forms, and then became more complex plants and animals. The studies of Charles Darwin have reshaped and influenced all aspects of biology. The vast amounts of evidence of evolution demonstrates the importance of the theory of evolution by natural selection. But has this process stopped? Of course not. Evolution does continue today. , labeled . . Used under license from Shutterstock.com

Introduction 	  What are the most numerous organisms on the planet? The single-celled prokaryotic organism otherwise known as bacteria. And all it takes is one to quickly grow, under just the right conditions, into millions and billions. Luckily, we know how to control bacteria when necessary. But bacteria do serve many important purposes. In fact, we could not survive without them. • Describe common bacterial shapes. • Summarize the similarities between bacterial cells and eukaryotic cells. • Summarize the differences between bacterial cells and eukaryotic cells. • Explain the roles of the cell wall and the flagella in bacteria. Are bacteria living things? Bacteria are individual living cells. Bacteria cells are similar to your cells in many ways; yet, they also have distinct differences. Bacteria have many unique adaptations allowing them to live in many different environments. 
Characteristics of  Bacteria 	  Bacteria are the most successful organisms on the planet. They lived on this planet for two billion years before the first eukaryotes and, during that time, evolved into millions of different species. 
Size and  Shape 	  Bacteria are so small that they can only be seen with a microscope. When viewed under the microscope, they have three distinct shapes ( Figure 5.1). Bacteria can be identified and classified by their shape: Bacteria come in many different shapes. 
Some of the most common shapes are 	  bacilli (rods), cocci (spheres), and spirilli (spirals). Bacteria can be identified and classified by their shape. 
Similarities to  Eukaryotes 	  Like eukaryotic cells, bacterial cells have: located in a region of the cell called the nucleoid. The nucleoid is not an organelle, but a region within the cytoplasm. Many bacteria also have additional small rings of DNA known as plasmids. See bacterial cell pictured below ( Figure 5.2). 
The structure of a bacterial cell 	  is distinctive from a eukaryotic cell because of features such as an outer cell wall, the circular DNA of the nucleoid, and the lack of membrane-bound organelles. 
Unique  Features 	  Bacteria lack many of the structures that eukaryotic cells contain. For example, they don’t have a nucleus. They also lack membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. The DNA of a bacterial cell is also different from a eukaryotic cell. Bacterial DNA is contained in one circular chromosome, located in the cytoplasm. Eukaryotes have several linear chromosomes. Bacteria also have two additional unique features: a cell wall and flagella. Some bacteria also have a capsule outside the cell wall. 
The  Cell  Wall 	  Bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall consisting of peptidoglycan. This complex molecule consists of sugars and amino acids. The cell wall is important for protecting bacteria. The cell wall is so important that some antibiotics, such as penicillin, kill bacteria by preventing the cell wall from forming. Some bacteria depend on a host organism for energy and nutrients. These bacteria are known as parasites. If the host starts attacking the parasitic bacteria, the bacteria release a layer of slime that surrounds the cell wall. This slime offers an extra layer of protection. 
Flagella 	  Some bacteria also have tail-like structures called flagella ( Figure 5.3). Flagella help bacteria move. As the flagella rotate, they spin the bacteria and propel them forward. It is often said the flagella looks like a tiny whip, propelling the bacteria forward. Though some eukaryotic cells do have a flagella, a flagella in eukaryotes is rare. The flagella facilitate movement in bacteria. Bacteria may have one, two, or many flagella—or none at all. 
Summary 	  • Bacteria can be classified by their shape, including bacilli (rods), cocci (spheres), and spirilli (spirals) • Bacteria are like eukaryotic cells in that they have cytoplasm, ribosomes, and a plasma membrane. • Features that distinguish a bacterial cell from a eukaryotic cell include the circular DNA of the nucleoid, the lack of membrane-bound organelles, the cell wall of peptidoglycan, and flagella. Use the resources below to answer the following questions. • Prokaryotic Cells at URL (2:23) • Cells Alive at URL • Identify how bacteria aquire energy. • Explain the importance of chemosynthetic bacteria. Can bacteria make their own food from sunlight? Plants aren’t the only organisms that use the energy of the sun to make food. Some bacteria can also perform photosynthesis. In fact, the first photosynthetic organisms on Earth were bacteria. Photosynthesis is just one of many ways that bacteria can obtain energy. 
Bacteria  Nutrition 	  Like all organisms, bacteria need energy, and they can acquire this energy through a number of different ways. 
Photosynthesis 	  Photosynthetic bacteria use the energy of the sun to make their own food. 
In the presence of sunlight, carbon 	  dioxide and water are turned into glucose and oxygen. The glucose is then turned into usable energy. Glucose is like the "food" for the bacteria. An example of photosynthetic bacteria is cyanobacteria, as seen in the opening image. These bacteria are sometimes called blue-green algae, although they are not algae, due to their numerous chlorophyll molecules. 
Decomposers 	  Bacteria known as decomposers break down wastes and dead organisms into smaller molecules. These bacteria use the organic substrates they break down to get their energy, carbon, and nutrients they need for survival. 
Chemotrophs 	  Bacteria can also be chemotrophs. Chemosynthetic bacteria, or chemotrophs, obtain energy by breaking down chemical compounds in their environment. An example of one of these chemicals broken down by bacteria is nitrogen-containing ammonia. These bacteria are important because they help cycle nitrogen through the environment for other living things to use. Nitrogen cannot be made by living organisms, so it must be continually recycled. Organisms need nitrogen to make organic compounds, such as DNA. 
Mutualism 	  Some bacteria depend on other organisms for survival. For example, some bacteria live in the roots of legumes, such as pea plants ( Figure 7.5). The bacteria turn nitrogen-containing molecules into nitrogen that the plant can use. Meanwhile, the root provides nutrients to the bacteria. In this relationship, both the bacteria and the plant benefit, so it is known as a mutualism. Other mutualistic bacteria include gut microbes. These are bacteria that live in the intestines of animals. They are usually beneficial bacteria, needed by the host organism. These microbes obviously don’t kill their host, as that would kill the bacteria as well. 
These mutualistic 	  bacteria-containing nodules on a soybean root help provide the plant with nitrogen. 
Parasitism 	  Other bacteria are parasitic and can cause illness. In parasitism, the bacteria benefit, and the other organism is harmed. Harmful bacteria will be discussed in another concept. 
Summary 	  • Bacteria can obtain energy and nutrients by performing photosynthesis, decomposing dead organisms and wastes, or breaking down chemical compounds. • Bacteria can obtain energy and nutrients by establishing close relationships with other organisms, including mutualistic and parasitic relationships.

How can bacteria reproduce so rapidly? Bacteria can divide very rapidly. This image is of a growing colony of E. coli bacteria. In the right environment, a single E. coli can divide to form a colony of hundreds of bacteria in just a few hours. 
Bacteria  Reproduction 	  Bacteria, being single-celled prokaryotic organisms, do not have a male or female version. Bacteria reproduce asexually. In asexual reproduction, the "parent" produces a genetically identical copy of itself. 
Binary  Fission 	  Bacteria reproduce through a process called binary fission. During binary fission, the chromosome copies itself, forming two genetically identical copies. Then, the cell enlarges and divides into two new daughter cells. The two daughter cells are identical to the parent cell. Binary fission can happen very rapidly. Some species of bacteria can double their population in less than ten minutes! This process makes it possible for a tremendous bacterial colony to start from a single cell. 
Exchanging  	  Are there male and female bacteria? Of course the answer is no. So, sexual reproduction does not occur in bacteria. But not all new bacteria are clones. This is because bacteria can acquire new DNA. This process occurs in three different ways: to another bacterium ( Figure 5.5). Bacteria essential exchange DNA via conjugation. 
Bacteria can exchange small segments 	  of DNA through conjugation. Notice two bacterial cells are attached by a short extension. DNA can be exchanged through this extension.

Where does cheese come from? Bacteria are often used to make cheese from milk. But making foods is not the only beneficial role of bacteria. For example, they also play an essential role in your gut! 
Helpful  Bacteria 	  Can we survive without bacteria? Could bacteria survive without us? No and yes. No, we could not survive without bacteria. And yes, bacteria could survive without us. 
Foods 	  Bacteria can be used to make cheese from milk. The bacteria turn the milk sugars into lactic acid. The acid is what causes the milk to curdle to form cheese. Bacteria are also involved in producing other foods. Yogurt is made by using bacteria to ferment milk ( Figure 5.6). Fermenting cabbage with bacteria produces sauerkraut. 
Yogurt is made from milk fermented with 	  bacteria. The bacteria ingest natural milk sugars and release lactic acid as a waste product, which causes proteins in the milk to form into a solid mass, which becomes the yogurt. 
Medicines 	  In the laboratory, bacteria can be changed to provide us with a variety of useful materials. Bacteria can be used as tiny factories to produce desired chemicals and medicines. For example, insulin, which is necessary to treat people with diabetes, can be produced using bacteria. Through the process of transformation, the human gene for insulin is placed into bacteria. The bacteria then use that gene to make a protein. The protein can be separated from the bacteria and then used to treat patients. The mass production of insulin by bacteria made this medicine much more affordable. During transformation, bacteria can take up any DNA from the environment. Therefore, transformation allows scientists to insert any DNA into a bacteria, potentially producing many different proteins. This makes the bacteria greatly useful to people. 
Digestion 	  Bacteria also help you digest your food. Several species of bacteria, such as E. coli, are found in your digestive tract. In fact, in your gut, bacteria cells greatly outnumber your own cells! 
Decomposers 	  Bacteria are important in practically all ecosystems because many bacteria are decomposers. They break down dead materials and waste products and recycle nutrients back into the environment. The recycling of nutrients, such as nitrogen, by bacteria, is essential for living organisms. Organisms cannot produce nutrients, so they must come from other sources. We get nutrients from the food we eat; plants get them from the soil. How do these nutrients get into the soil? One way is from the actions of decomposers. Without decomposers, we would eventually run out of the materials we need to survive. We also depend on bacteria to decompose our wastes in sewage treatment plants.

If left untreated, the infection can be fatal. Many other illnesses, mild and severe, are also caused by certain types of bacteria. 
Harmful  Bacteria 	  With so many species of bacteria, some are bound to be harmful. Harmful bacteria can make you sick. They can also ruin food and be used to hurt people. 
Diseases 	  There are also ways that bacteria can be harmful to humans and other animals. Bacteria are responsible for many types of human illness ( Figure 5.7), including: • Strep throat • Tuberculosis • Pneumonia • Leprosy • Lyme disease Luckily most of these can be treated with antibiotics, which kill the bacteria. It is important that when a medical doctor prescribes antibiotics for you, you take the medicine exactly as the doctor tells you. You need to make sure the bacteria is killed. 
The  Black  Death, which killed at least one 	  third of Europe’s population in the 1300s, is believed to have been caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. 
Food  Contamination 	  Bacterial contamination of foods can lead to digestive problems, an illness known as food poisoning. Raw eggs and undercooked meats commonly carry the bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Food poisoning can be prevented by cooking meat thoroughly, which kills most microbes, and washing surfaces that have been in contact with raw meat. Washing your hands before and after handling food also helps prevent contamination. 
Weapons 	  Some bacteria also have the potential to be used as biological weapons by terrorists. An example is anthrax, a disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Inhaling the spores of this bacterium can lead to a deadly infection, and, therefore, it is a dangerous weapon. In 2001, an act of terrorism in the United States involved B. anthracis spores sent in letters through the mail.

What organisms can grow in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park? In the 1970s, a new group of organisms was identified. Unlike other organisms, these organisms could thrive in temperatures near 100ºC, the boiling point of water! This new group of organisms was named archaea. What are Archaea? For many years, archaea were classified as bacteria. Like the bacteria, archaea lacked a nucleus and membranebound organelles and, therefore, were prokaryotic cells. However, when scientists compared the DNA of the two prokaryotes, they found that there were distinct differences. They concluded that there must be two distinct types of prokaryotes, which they named archaea and bacteria. Even though the two groups might seem similar, archaea have many features that distinguish them from bacteria: polymer peptidoglycan, most archaea do not have peptidoglycan in their cell walls. Although archaea and bacteria share some fundamental differences, they are still similar in many ways: Archaea shapes can vary widely, but some are bacilli (rod-shaped). 
Obtaining  Food and  Energy 	  Most archaea are chemotrophs and derive their energy and nutrients from breaking down molecules in their environment. A few species of archaea are photosynthetic and capture the energy of sunlight. Unlike bacteria, which can be parasites and are known to cause a variety of diseases, there are no known archaea that act as parasites. Some archaea do live within other organisms. But these archea form mutualistic relationships with their host, where both the archaea and the host benefit. In other words, they assist the host in some way, for example by helping to digest food. 
Reproduction 	  Like bacteria, reproduction in archaea is asexual. Archaea can reproduce through binary fission, where a parent cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. Archaea can also reproduce asexually through budding and fragmentation, where pieces of the cell break off and form a new cell, also producing genetically identical organisms. 
Summary 	  • Archaea are prokaryotes, but they differ from bacteria in their DNA and biochemistry. • Most archaea are chemotrophs, but some are photosynthetic or form mutualistic relationships. • Archaea reproduce asexually through binary fission, fragmentation, or budding. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Introduction to the Archaea at URL . • Distinguish between halophiles, thermophiles, and methanogens. How can termites digest wood? Unlike us, termites can get nutrition from wood. Mutualistic archaea found in the gut of termites help them digest the wood. This is just one example of the many extreme environments in which archaea can thrive. 
Types of  Archaea 	  The first archaea described could survive in extremely harsh environments in which no other organisms could survive. As a result, archaea are often distinguished by the environment in which they live. 
Halophiles 	  The halophiles, which means "salt-loving," live in environments with high levels of salt ( Figure 5.9). They have been identified in the Great Salt Lake in Utah and in the Dead Sea between Israel and Jordan, which have salt concentrations several times that of the oceans. Halophiles, like the Halobacterium shown here, require high salt concentrations. 
Thermophiles 	  The thermophiles live in extremely hot environments. For example, they can grow in hot springs, geysers, and near volcanoes. Unlike other organisms, they can thrive in temperatures near 100°C, the boiling point of water! 
Methanogens 	  Methanogens can also live in some strange places, such as swamps and inside the guts of cows and termites. They help these animals break down cellulose, a tough carbohydrate made by plants ( Figure 5.10). This is an example of a mutualistic relationship. Methanogens are named for their waste product, a gas called methane. 
Cows are able to digest grass with the 	  help of the methanogens in their gut. 
Common  Environments 	  Although archaea are known for living in unusual environments, such as the Dead Sea, inside hot springs, and in the guts of cows, they also live in more common environments. For example, new research shows that archaea are abundant in the soil. They also live among the plankton in the ocean ( Figure 5.11). Therefore, scientists are just beginning to discover some of the important roles that archaea have in the environment. Thermococcus gammatolerans are another type of archaea. 
Summary 	  • Archaea that live in salty environments are known as halophiles. • Archaea that live in extremely hot environments are called thermophiles. • Archaea that produce methane are called methanogens. • Archaea are known for living in extreme environments, but they also can be found in common environments, like soil.

Introduction 	  Would you eat this mushroom? Now that’s an interesting mushroom! In fact, fungi can be some of the most colorful species. And protists can be some of the most interesting. These two kingdoms are the first two eukaryotic kingdoms we discuss, and they have some of the most diverse members. But this mushroom? Probably not a good idea to eat. This is a poisonous and psychoactive fungus. With its large, white-gilled, white-spotted, usually deep red appearance, it is one of the most recognizable and widely encountered mushrooms in popular culture. However, you shouldn’t eat it! • Describe the main features of the protists. • Explain protist classification. Animal? Bacteria? Plant? Fungi? What do these figures represent? None of the above! These organisms may be single-celled like bacteria, and they may look like a fungus. They also may hunt for food like an animal or photosynthesize like a plant. And, yet, they do not fit into any of these groups. These organisms are protists! What are Protists? Protists are eukaryotes, which means their cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Most, but not all, protists are single-celled. Other than these features, they have very little in common. You can think about protists as all eukaryotic organisms that are neither animals, nor plants, nor fungi. Although Ernst Haeckel set up the Kingdom Protista in 1866, this kingdom was not accepted by the scientific world until the 1960s. These unique organisms can be so different from each other that sometimes Protista is called the “junk drawer" kingdom. Just like a junk drawer, which contains items that don’t fit into any other category, this kingdom contains the eukaryotes that cannot be put into any other kingdom. Therefore, protists can seem very different from one another. Unicellular or Multicellular? Most protists are so small that they can be seen only with a microscope. Protists are mostly unicellular (one-celled) eukaryotes. A few protists are multicellular (many-celled) and surprisingly large. For example, kelp is a multicellular protist that can grow to be over 100-meters long ( Figure 6.1). Multicellular protists, however, do not show cellular specialization or differentiation into tissues. That means their cells all look the same and, for the most part, function the same. On the other hand, your cells often are much different from each other and have special jobs. Kelp is an example of a muticellular protist. 
Characteristics of  Protists 	  A few characteristics are common between protists. 
Classification of  Protists 	  For classification, the protists are divided into three groups: spores. But remember, protists are not animals, nor plants, nor fungi ( Figure 6.2). 
Summary 	  • Protists are a diverse kingdom, including all eukaryotic organisms that are neither animals, nor plants, nor fungi. Protists come in many different shapes. Some are very simple, similar to prokaryotes, and some are more complex. These simple, single-celled protists were probably the first eukaryotes to evolve. • For classification, the protists are divided into three groups: animal-like protists, plant-like protists, and fungilike protists. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Protists at URL (5:07) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Describe how protists obtain food. • Explain endocytosis in protists. What can photosynthesize AND hunt for food? No, there are no man-eating plants or leaf-growing animals. The idea of an organism both photosynthesizing and hunting for food might seem strange, but this isn’t science fiction. These organisms, examples of Euglena, are protists that can feed like an animal or use the energy of the sun to make food like a plant. 
Protists  Nutrition 	  The cells of protists need to perform all of the functions that other cells do, such as grow and reproduce, maintain homeostasis, and obtain energy. They also need to obtain "food" to provide the energy to perform these functions. Recall that protists can be plant-like, fungi-like, or animal-like. That means that protists can obtain food like plants, fungi, or animals do. There are many plant-like protists, such as algae, that get their energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. Some of the fungus-like protists, such as the slime molds ( Figure 6.3), decompose decaying matter. The animal-like protists must "eat" or ingest food. Some animal-like protists use their "tails" to eat. These protists are called filter-feeders. They acquire nutrients by constantly whipping their tails, called flagellum, back and forth. The whipping of the flagellum creates a current that brings food into the protist. Other animal-like protists must "swallow" their food through a process called endocytosis. Endocytosis happens when a cell takes in substances through its membrane. The process is described below: Also, some of the animal-like and fungi-like protists are parasitic, harming their hosts as they obtain nutrients. Fungi-like protists absorb nutrients meant for their host, harming the host in the process. 
Slime molds live on decaying plant life and 	  in the soil. 
Summary 	  • Some protists are plant-like and photosynthesize. • Some protists absorb nutrients from decaying matter like a fungus. • Some protists hunt their food or act as parasites. Use the resource below to answer the following questions. • Endocytosis and Exocytosis at URL (1:54) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Define protozoa. • Describe the types of animal-like protists. • Distinguish flagellates from ciliates. What can hunt prey and move, but is not an animal? Some protists, like these Paramecium, act much like animals. Notice the tiny hair-like cilia that help them move. The food vacuoles, where they digest their prey, are colored in orange. 
Animal-like  Protists 	  Animal-like protists are called protozoa. Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotes that share some traits with animals. Like animals, they can move, and they are heterotrophs. That means they eat things outside of themselves instead of producing their own food. Animal-like protists are very small, measuring only about 0.01–0.5mm. Animal-like protists include the flagellates, ciliates, and the sporozoans. 
Different  Kinds of  Animal-like  Protists 	  There are many different types of animal-like protists. They are different because they move in different ways. • Flagellates have long flagella, or tails. Flagella rotate in a propeller-like fashion, pushing the protist through its environment ( Figure 6.4). An example of a flagellate is Trypanosoma, which causes African sleeping sickness. • Other protists have what are called transient pseudopodia, which are like temporary feet. The cell surface extends out to form feet-like structures that propel the cell forward. An example of a protist with pseudopodia is the amoeba. • The ciliates are protists that move by using cilia. Cilia are thin, very small tail-like projections that extend outward from the cell body. Cilia beat back and forth, moving the protist along. Paramecium has cilia that propel it. • The sporozoans are protists that produce spores, such as the toxoplasma. These protists do not move at all. The spores develop into new protists. 
These flagellates all cause diseases in 	  humans. A video of the animal-like amoeba can be viewed at: URL diatom.ogg . 
Summary 	  • Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotes that share some traits with animals. • Protozoa can move by flagella, cilia, or pseudopodia, or they may not move at all.

Definition, Characteristics Examples at URL on/what-are-protozoa-definition-characteristics-examples.html#lesson • Define algae. • Distinguish algae from plants. • Give examples of multicellular plant-like protists. What is pond scum? Polluted water can form a frothy green scum on the surface. This "pond scum" is actually a living organism, algae. The algae are plant-like protists. Usually the algae are too small to notice, but sometimes algae grow in excess because of the excess nutrients in polluted water. 
Plant-like  Protists 	  Plant-like protists are known as algae ( Figure 6.5). They are a large and diverse group. Plant-like protists are autotrophs. This means that they produce their own food. They perform photosynthesis to produce sugar by using carbon dioxide and water, and the energy from sunlight, just like plants. Unlike plants, however, plant-like protists do not have true stems, roots, or leaves. Most plant-like protists live in oceans, ponds, or lakes. Protists can be unicellular (single-celled) or multicellular (many-celled). Seaweed and kelp are examples of multicellular, plant-like protists. Kelp can be as large as trees and form a "forest" in the ocean ( Figure 6.6). Plant-like protists are essential to the ecosystem. They are the base of the marine food chain, and they produce oxygen through photosynthesis for animals to breathe. They are classified into a number of basic groups ( Table 
Red algae are a very large group of 	  protists making up about 5,000–6,000 species. They are mostly multicellular and live in the ocean. Many red algae are seaweeds and help create coral reefs. Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp) is a type of multicellular, plant-like protist.

Summary 	  • Plant-like protists are autotrophs, meaning they make their own food. • Plant-like protists include algae, kelp, and seaweed. Ulva, • Describe features of the fungus-like protists. • Distinguish slime molds from water molds. What’s shrouding this dead insect? The thin filaments growing out of this dead insect look a little like a fungus. Also this mystery organism, like a fungus, is feeding on decaying matter. However, this is not a fungus. This organism is a type of fungus-like protist, known as water mold. 
Fungus-like  Protists 	  Fungus-like protists share many features with fungi. Like fungi, they are heterotrophs, meaning they must obtain food outside themselves. They also have cell walls and reproduce by forming spores, just like fungi. Fungus-like protists usually do not move, but a few develop movement at some point in their lives. Two major types of funguslike protists are slime molds and water molds. 
Slime  Molds 	  Slime molds usually measure about one or two centimeters, but a few slime molds are as big as several meters. They often have bright colors, such as a vibrant yellow ( Figure 6.7). Others are brown or white. Stemonitis is a kind of slime mold which forms small brown bunches on the outside of rotting logs. Physarum polycephalum lives inside rotting logs and is a gooey mesh of yellow "threads" that are several centimeters long. Fuligo, sometimes called “vomit mold,” is a yellow slime mold found in decaying wood. An example of a slime mold. 
Water  Molds 	  Water molds mostly live in water or moist soil. They can be parasites of plants and animals, getting their nutrients from these organisms and also from decaying organisms. They are a common problem for farmers since they cause a variety of plant diseases. One of the most famous of these diseases was the fungus that caused the Irish potato famine in the 1800s. At this time, potatoes were the main source of food for many of the Irish people. The failure of the potato crop meant that many people in Ireland died of starvation or migrated to other countries. 
Summary 	  • Slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on decaying matter. They are commonly found on items such as rotting logs. • Water molds are fungus-like protists present in moist soil and surface water; they live as parasites or on decaying organisms.

What happens to the cells of the stalk? b. What happens to the cells of the fruiting body? • Describe ways protists are important to humans. Would you eat seaweed? Seaweed is commonly eaten in many parts of the world. It’s good for you, too; it’s high in nutrients and low in calories. You have probably eaten processed seaweed and not even known it, since it’s used as a thickener in foods like ice cream. Seaweed and other protists are also food for many, many animals in the ecosystem. 
Importance of  Protists 	  Humans could not live on Earth if it were not for protists. Why? Plant-like protists produce almost one-half of the oxygen on the planet through photosynthesis. Other protists decompose and recycle nutrients that humans need to live. All protists make up a huge part of the food chain. Humans use protists for many other reasons: • Many protists are also commonly used in medical research. For example, medicines made from protists are used in treatment of high blood pressure, digestion problems, ulcers, and arthritis. • Other protists are used in scientific studies. For example, slime molds (including D. discoideum, a soil-living protist) are used to analyze the chemical signals in cells. • Protists are also valuable in industry. Look on the back of a milk carton. You will most likely see carrageenan, which is extracted from red algae. This is used to make puddings and ice cream solid ( Figure 6.8). Chemicals from other kinds of algae are used to produce many kinds of plastics. Ice cream is an example of a food made with ingredients derived from algae.

What does this fungus have in common with mold? This colorful bracket fungus doesn’t look much like mold. But they have a lot in common. They both break down organic matter to obtain nutrients. They both reproduce by spores. They are both eukaryotic, but they are not plants, and they are definitely not animals. They are both fungi. What are Fungi? Ever notice blue-green mold growing on a loaf of bread? Do you like your pizza with mushrooms? Has a physician ever prescribed an antibiotic for you? If so, then you have encountered fungi. Fungi are organisms that belong to the Kingdom Fungi ( Figure 6.9). Our environment needs fungi. Fungi help decompose matter to release nutrients and make nutritious food for other organisms. Fungi are all around us and are useful in many ways. 
These many different kinds of organisms 	  demonstrate the huge diversity within the Kingdom Fungi. 
Classification of the  Fungi 	  If you had to guess, would you say a fungus is a plant or an animal? Scientists used to debate about which kingdom to place fungi in. Finally they decided that fungi were plants. But they were wrong. Now, scientists know that fungi are not plants at all. Fungi are very different from plants. The main difference between plants and fungi is how they obtain energy. Plants are autotrophs, meaning that they make their own "food" using the energy from sunlight. Fungi are heterotrophs, which means that they obtain their "food" from outside of themselves. In other words, they must "eat" their food like animals do. But they don’t really eat. Instead, they absorb their nutrients. Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms are all different kinds of fungi. There may be as many as 1.5 million species of fungi ( Figure 6.10). You can easily see bread mold and mushrooms without a microscope, but most fungi you cannot see. Fungi are either too small to be seen without a microscope, or they live where you cannot see them easily—deep in the soil, under decaying logs, or inside plants or animals. Some fungi even live in, or on top of, other fungi. 
Fungi are  Good  Eaters 	  Fungi can grow fast because they are such good eaters. Fungi have lots of surface area, and this large surface area “eats” or absorbs. Surface area is how much exposed area an organism has, compared to their overall volume. Most of a mushroom’s surface area is actually underground. If you see a mushroom in your yard, that is just a small part of a larger fungus growing underground. These are the steps involved in fungi "eating": 
The blue in this blue cheese is actually 	  mold, which is a fungus.

Dutch elm trees used to be common, beautiful trees in the United States. Now most of them, like this tree, have been killed by Dutch elm disease. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus. This is just one example of how fungi can interact with other species. 
Symbiotic  Relationships with  Fungi 	  Fungi don’t live in isolation. They often interact with other species. In fact, fungi can be dependent on another organism for survival. When two species live close together and form a relationship, it is called symbiosis. Symbiosis can be beneficial to one or both organisms, or sometimes one organism hurts the other. Some of the partners in these relationships include plants, algae, insects and other animals, and even humans. 
Fungi and  Plants 	  If it were not for fungi, many plants would go hungry. In the soil, fungi grow closely around the roots of plants, and they begin to help each other. The plant roots together with the special root-dwelling fungi are called mycorrhizae ( Figure 6.11). As plants and fungi form a close relationship, the plant and the fungus “feed” one another. The plant provides sugars to the fungus that the plant makes through photosynthesis, which the fungus cannot do. The fungus then provides minerals and water to the roots of the plant. Since the plant and the fungus are helping each other out, this is a mutualistic relationship, a type of symbiosis known as mutualism. In a mutualistic relationship, both organisms benefit. 
These roots (brown) and the mycorrhizae 	  (white) help to feed one another. 
Lichens 	  Have you ever seen an organism called a lichen? Lichens are crusty, hard growths that you might find on trees, logs, walls, and rocks ( Figure 6.12). Although lichens may not be the prettiest organisms in nature, they are unique. A lichen is really two organisms, sometimes referred to as a composite organism, that live very closely together: a fungus and a bacterium or an alga. The cells from the alga or bacterium live inside the fungus. Besides providing a home, the fungus also provides nutrients. In turn, the bacterium or the alga provides energy to the fungus by performing photosynthesis, obtaining energy directly from the sun. A lichen is also an example of a mutualistic relationship. Because lichens can grow on rocks, these organisms are some of the earliest life forms in new ecosystems. 
Fungi and  Insects 	  Many insects have a symbiotic relationship with certain types of fungi: • Ants and termites grow fungi in underground “fungus gardens” that they create. When the ants or termites have eaten a big meal of wood or leaves, they also eat some fungi from their gardens. The fungi help them digest the wood or leaves. The fungi secrete certain enzymes that the ants or termites cannot produce on their own. 
This tree is covered in lichen, a symbiotic 	  relationship between a fungus and a bacterium or an alga. • Ambrosia beetles live in the bark of trees. Like ants and termites, they grow fungi inside the bark of trees and use it to help digest their food. 
Fungi as  Parasites 	  Although lots of symbiotic relationships help both organisms, sometimes one of the organisms is harmed. When that happens, the organism that benefits, and is not harmed, is called a parasite. This type of relationship is known as parasitism. Examples of parasitic fungi include the following: • Beginning in 1950, Dutch Elm trees in the United States began to die. Since then, most of these trees have been eliminated. The disease was caused by a fungus that acted as a parasite. The fungus that killed the trees was carried by beetles to the trees. • Some parasitic fungi cause human diseases such as athlete’s foot and ringworm. These fungi feed on the outer layer of warm, moist skin. Though its name may suggest otherwise, ringworm is not caused by a worm, but by a fungus.

How did fungi help this situation? • List the most important body parts of fungi. • Distinguish a hyphae from a mycelium and from a fruiting body. What, exactly, is a mushroom? Mushrooms aren’t around just so you can put them on your pizza. The mushroom is part of a large fungus that lives underground. The mushroom develops above the ground when the fungus is ready to reproduce. 
Body  Parts of  Fungi 	  The most important body parts of fungi include: It is similar to that found in plant cells, though the plant cell wall contains the polysaccharide cellulose. Ever see mold on a damp wall or on old bread? The things that you are seeing are really mycelia. The hyphae and mycelia help the fungi absorb nutrients from other organisms. Most of the mycelium is hidden from view deep within the fungal food source, such as rotting matter in the soil, leaf litter, rotting wood, or dead animals. Fungi produce enzymes to digest cellulose and various other materials found in rotting matter, helping with the decaying process. reproduction of a fruiting plant, a fruiting body is involved in the reproduction of a fungus. A mushroom is a fruiting body, which is the part of the fungus that produces spores ( Figure 6.14). The spores are the basic reproductive units of fungi. The mycelium remains hidden until it develops one or more fruiting bodies. The fruiting bodies are usually produced at the surface of the food source, rather than hidden within it. This allows the reproductive spores to be easily shed and carried away by the wind, water, or animals. The fruiting bodies are usually the only indication that a fungus is present. Like icebergs, the fruiting bodies represent only a tiny fraction of the whole fungus, with most of the fungus hidden from view. Hyphae of a Penicillium mold. The little “trees” are specialized hyphae on which spores are produced. A mushroom is a fruiting body.

What’s this brown powder coming out of the fungus? This is a "puffball" fungus. At maturity, clouds of a brown dust-like power escape when they are touched. This powdery substance is made up of spores, the reproductive structure of the fungus. 
Reproduction in  Fungi 	  Different fungi reproduce in different ways. Many fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually. However, some reproduce only sexually and some only asexually. Asexual reproduction involves just one parent and sexual reproduction involves two parents. 
Asexual  Reproduction 	  Through asexual reproduction, new organisms are produced that are genetically identical to the parent. That is, they have exactly the same DNA. Fungi reproduce asexually through three methods: released by puffballs. Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some bacteria, plants, algae, fungi, and protozoa. Theoretically, spores can reproduce asexually to produce countless offspring. Obviously this does not happen. If it did, the world would be covered by genetically identical fungi. a “new” organism ( Figure 6.15). fragment can eventually produce a new colony of fungi. Yeast reproduce asexually by budding. Asexual reproduction is faster and produces more fungi than sexual reproduction. This form of reproduction is controlled by many different factors. Outside conditions, such as the availability of food, determine when a fungus undergoes asexual reproduction. 
Sexual  Reproduction 	  Almost all fungi can reproduce sexually. But why reproduce sexually when asexual reproduction is much quicker? Sexual reproduction brings together traits from the two parents. This increases the genetic diversity of the species. In plants and animals, sexual reproduction occurs when sperm and egg from two parents join to make a new individual. In fungi, however, two haploid hyphae meet together and their nuclei fuse. Instead of calling a hyphae male or female, they have different mating types, such as (+) and (-) ( Figure 6.16). The common mushroom, a fruiting body, results after sexual reproduction when two hyphae, one (+) and one (-), mate, forming a mycelium with sporangia. Notice, when the sporangia burst, the spores are released from the fruiting body.

What’s growing on these oranges? Mold, of course! Did you know that mold is a type of fungus? There are many different types of fungi besides molds, however, including mushrooms. Mold and mushrooms are obviously different. So how are these fungi classified? 
Fungi  Classification 	  Scientists used to think that fungi were members of the plant kingdom. They thought this because fungi had several similarities to plants. For example: • Fungi and plants have similar structures. • Plants and fungi live in the same kinds of habitats, such as growing in soil. • Plants and fungi cells both have a cell wall, which animals do not have. 
How  Fungi and  Plants  Differ 	  However, there are a number of characteristics that make fungi different from plants: photosynthesis. Fungi are more like animals because they are heterotrophs, as opposed to autotrophs, like plants, that make their own food. Fungi have to obtain their food, nutrients and glucose, from outside sources. animals such as beetles and lobsters. The cell wall of a plant is made of cellulose, not chitin. nutrients. 
The  Types of  Fungi 	  The Kingdom Fungi can be broken down into several phyla. Each phyla has some unique traits. And even within the same phyla there are many differences among the fungi. Various types of fungi are pictured below ( Table 6.2). Notice how different each of these organisms are from one another. 
Summary 	  • Fungi are no longer classified as plants. • Although fungi have cell walls like plants, the cell walls are made of chitin instead of cellulose. • Types of fungi include molds, yeasts, and mushrooms.

What would happen if there were no fungi? We’d be living in a huge trash pile! All the fallen leaves, grass clippings, dead trees, and other organic waste would just build up. Fungi are important decomposers in the environment. Not only do they get rid of wastes, they make the nutrients in the wastes available to other organisms. This is just one way that fungi are important to us. 
Fungi  Roles 	  Fungi are extremely important to the ecosystem because they are one of the major decomposers of organic material. Decomposing organic material is how fungi acquire energy. But fungi have other roles in addition to being decomposers. How do fungi help people? They are used to help prepare food and beverages, and they have many other uses. 
Importance of  Fungi for  Human  Use 	  • Yeasts are crucial for the fermentation process that makes beer, wine, and bread. Fermentation occurs in the absence of oxygen and allows the first step of cellular respiration, glycolysis, to continue. • Some fungi are used in the production of soy sauce and tempeh, a source of protein used in Southeast Asia. • Fungi can produce antibiotics, such as penicillin. Antibiotics are important medicines that kill bacteria, and penicillin was the first identified cure against many deadly bacterial species. Antibiotics only treat bacterial diseases; they can not be used to treat viral or fungal diseases. • Mushrooms are fungi that are eaten by people all over the globe. 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single-celled fungus called brewer’s or 	  baker’s yeast, is used in the baking of bread and in making wine and beer through fermentation. 
The video  Bread  Mold  Kills  Bacteria at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv Efy Jc4 A explains  Alexander 	  Fleming’s famous discovery that lead to the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin. Antibiotics are used to kill harmful bacteria. See Alexander Fleming 1881 1955 at URL html for more information about Dr. Fleming. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Edible and  Poisonous  Fungi 	  Some of the best known types of fungi are mushrooms, which can be edible or poisonous ( Figure 6.18). Many species are grown commercially, but others are harvested from the wild. When you order a pizza with mushrooms or add them to your salad, you are most likely eating Agaricus bisporus, known as white or button mushrooms, the most commonly eaten species. Other mushroom species are gathered from the wild for people to eat or for commercial sale. Many mushroom species are poisonous to humans. Some mushrooms will simply give you a stomachache, while others may kill you. Some mushrooms you can eat when they are cooked but are poisonous when raw. So if you find mushrooms in the wild, don’t eat them until you are certain they are safe! Have you ever eaten blue cheese? Do you know what makes it blue? You guessed it. A fungus. For certain types of cheeses, producers add fungal spores to milk curds to promote the growth of mold, which makes the cheese blue. Molds used in cheese production are safe for humans to eat. Some fungi are poisonous and must be avoided.

Summary 	  Protists and Fungi are two types of eukaryotic organisms. What do they have in common? Protists are the earliest eukaryotes, and this kingdom contains some of the simplest eukaryotes. Many are single-celled organisms. Protists consist of animal-like, plant-like, and fungus-like species. Protists evolved into the other three types of eukaryotes, including fungi. Other than that, these two types of eukaryotes are very different. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that cannot make their own food and do not "eat." They must absorb their nutrients, usually from decaying organisms. Haeckel; Dr. Myron G. Schultz/CDC. Protists come in many different shapes . . Public Domain from Shutterstock.com .

Introduction 	  What exactly is a plant? Does a plant have to be green? Do they all photosynthesize? They are eukaryotic organisms that are not animals, fungi, or protists. And yes, they have to photosynthesize. • Describe the three major characteristics of all plants. • Explain the primary role of plants in ecosystems. What is this? You may be surprised that this is a picture of plants. They look a little like stones. In fact, these plants are often called "living stones." Organisms don’t need to have big green leaves to be considered plants. What do you think distinguishes plants from other organisms? What are Plants? Plants have adapted to a variety of environments, from the desert to the tropical rain forest to lakes and oceans. In each environment, plants have become crucial to supporting animal life. Plants are the food that animals eat. Plants also provide places for animals, such as insects and birds, to live; many birds build nests in plants. From tiny mosses to gorgeous rose bushes to extremely large redwood trees ( Figure 7.1), the organisms in this kingdom, Kingdom Plantae, have three main features. They are all: Recall that eukaryotic organisms also include animals, protists, and fungi. Eukaryotes have cells with nuclei that contain DNA, and membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air (and water) to make their own food, the carbohydrate glucose. Plants have chloroplasts, the organelle of photosynthesis, and are known as producers and autotrophs. Other organisms are heterotrophic consumers, meaning they must obtain their nutrients from another organism, as these organisms lack chloroplasts. Lastly, plants must be multicellular, composed of more than one cell. There are no single-celled plants. Recall that some protists, such as algae, are eukaryotic and photosynthetic but are not considered plants. Unlike plants, algae is mostly unicellular. There is great diversity in the plant kingdom, from tiny mosses to huge trees. 
Summary 	  • Plants are multicellular and eukaryotic, meaning their cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. • Plants perform photosynthesis, the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air to make their own food.

Where did plants come from? Plants have not always been around on land. For a long time, life was confined to water. The first plants evolved from green algae that looked somewhat like the Chara pictured above. 
Plants’  Adaptations for  Life on  Land 	  The first photosynthetic organisms were bacteria that lived in the water. So, where did plants come from? Evidence shows that plants evolved from freshwater green algae, a protist ( Figure 7.2). The similarities between green algae and plants is one piece of evidence. They both have cellulose in their cell walls, and they share many of the same chemicals that give them color. So what separates green algae from green plants? There are four main ways that plants adapted to life on land and, as a result, became different from algae: The ancestor of plants is green algae. 
This picture shows a close up of algae on 	  the beach. inside of themselves but release it into water. This was the first feature to evolve that separated plants from green algae. This is also the only adaptation shared by all plants. cuticle evolved to help seal water in the plant and prevent water loss. However, the cuticle also prevents gases from entering and leaving the plant easily. Recall that the exchange of gasses—taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen—occurs during photosynthesis. evolved ( Figure 7.3). The stomata can open and close depending on weather conditions. When it’s hot and dry, the stomata close to keep water inside of the plant. When the weather cools down, the stomata can open again to let carbon dioxide in and oxygen out. transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. In algae, vascular tissue is not necessary since the entire body is in contact with the water, and the water simply enters the algae. But on land, water may only be found deep in the ground. Vascular tissues take water and nutrients from the ground up into the plant, while also taking food down from the leaves into the rest of the plant. The two vascular tissues are xylem and phloem. Xylem is responsible for the transport of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant. Phloem carries the sugars made in the leaves to the parts of the plant where they are needed.

No, plants do not all have flowers. For example, the mosses and ferns pictured here are both types of plants. However, they never produce flowers. They don’t produce seeds, either. They do, however, make tiny spores to reproduce. 
Plant  Reproduction and  Life  Cycle 	  The life cycle of a plant is very different from the life cycle of an animal. Humans are made entirely of diploid cells (cells with two sets of chromosomes, referred to as ”2n”). Our only cells that are haploid cells (cells with one set of chromosomes, ”n”) are sperm and egg cells. Plants, however, can live when they are are at the stage of having haploid cells or diploid cells. If a plant has a haploid chromosome number of 20, what is the diploid chromosome number? If the diploid chromosome number is 20, what is the haploid number? Plants alternate between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell plants. This is called alternation of generations, because the plant type alternates from generation to generation. In alternation of generations, the plant alternates between a sporophyte that has diploid cells and a gametophyte that has haploid cells. Alternation of generations can be summarized in the following four steps: follow along in the Figure 7.15 as you read through the steps. haploid, having one set of chromosomes. course, is diploid. As we will see in additional Plants concepts, the generation in which the plant spends most of its life cycle is different between various plants. In the plants that first evolved, the gametophyte takes up the majority of the life cycle of the plant. During the course of evolution, the sporophyte became the major stage of the life cycle of the plant. 
In ferns, the sporophyte is dominant and 	  produces spores that germinate into a heart-shaped gametophyte. 
Summary 	  • Plants undergo alternation of generations, meaning they alternate between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell plants. • During the course of evolution, the sporophyte (diploid) became the major stage of the life cycle of the plant. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Plant Reproduction at URL (2:23) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Explain how plants are classified. • Distinguish vascular plants from nonvascular plants. • Distinguish gymnosperms from angiosperms. Do all plants grow from seeds? No, there are actually a few plants that do not make seeds. Whether or not a plant makes seeds is one criteria used to classify plants. How else could you distinguish between plants? 
Plant  Classification 	  Plants are formally divided into 12 phyla (plural for phylum), and these phyla are gathered into four groups ( Figure the reproductive structure after fertilization. These plants do not have vascular tissue, xylem or phloem, to transport nutrients, water, and food. Examples include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. Without vascular tissue, these plants do not grow very tall. Examples include the ferns, whisk ferns, club mosses, and horsetails. Vascular tissue allowed these plants to grow taller. Redwood, Fir, and Cypress trees. Gymnos means "naked" in Greek; the seeds of gymnosperms are naked, not protected by flowers. giosperms include magnolia trees, roses, tulips, and tomatoes. 
The plant kingdom contains a diversity of 	  organisms. 
Summary 	  • Nonvascular plants were the first plants to evolve and do not have vascular tissue. • Seedless vascular plants have vascular tissue but do not have seeds. • Gymnosperms have seeds but do not have flowers. • Angiosperms have vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Plant Body Systems and Classification Part 1 at URL (7:21) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Define bryophyte. • Describe examples of nonvascular seedless plants. What did forests look like millions of years ago? The trees you see today did not exist. Nonvascular plants and vascular seedless plants first dominated the forest. The remains of these forests formed the coal that we depend on today. 
Nonvascular  Seedless  Plants 	  Nonvascular seedless plants, as their name implies, lack vascular tissue. Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. As they lack vascular tissue, they also do not have true roots, stems, or leaves. Nonvascular plants do often have a “leafy” appearance, though, and they can have stem-like and root-like structures. These plants are very short because they cannot move nutrients and water up a stem. Nonvascular seedless plants, also known as bryophytes, are classified into three phyla: 
Mosses 	  Mosses are most often recognized as the green “fuzz” on damp rocks and trees in a forest. If you look closely, you will see that most mosses have tiny stem-like and leaf-like structures. This is the gametophyte stage. Remember that a gametophyte is haploid, having only one set of chromosomes. The gametophyte produces the gametes that, after fertilization, develop into the diploid sporophyte with two sets of chromosomes. The sporophyte forms a capsule, called the sporangium, which releases spores ( Figure 7.6). Sporophytes sprout up on stalks from this bed of moss gametophytes. Notice that both the sporophytes and gametophytes exist at the same time. 
Hornworts 	  Hornworts are named for their appearance. The "horn" part of the name comes from their hornlike sporophytes, and “wort” comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for herb. The hornlike sporophytes grow from a base of flattened lobes, which are the gametophytes ( Figure 7.7). They usually grow in moist and humid areas. 
Liverworts 	  Liverworts have two distinct appearances: they can either be leafy like mosses or flattened and ribbon-like. Liverworts get their name from the type with the flattened bodies, which can resemble a liver ( Figure 7.8). Liverworts can often be found along stream beds. In hornworts, the “horns” are the sporophytes that rise up from the leaflike gametophyte. Liverworts with a flattened, ribbon-like body are called thallose liverworts. 
Summary 	  • Nonvascular plants lack seeds and vascular tissue. • Nonvascular plants include the mosses, the hornworts, and the liverworts. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Nonvascular Plants at URL (3:22) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Give properties of vascular seedless plants. • Describe examples of vascular seedless plants. How do these trees and mosses differ? The trees tower in the sky, while the mosses carpet the forest floor. Mosses, like the first plants, are restricted to life near the ground because they lack vascular system. Only with a vascular system can these trees transport sugars, nutrients, and water up and down their tall trunks. The evolution of the vascular system was a big step in the evolutionary history of plants. 
Vascular  Seedless  Plants 	  For these plants, the name says it all. Vascular seedless plants have vascular tissue but do not have seeds. Remember that vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water and nutrients throughout the plant. The development of vascular tissue allowed these plants to grow much taller than nonvascular plants, forming ancient swamp forests. Most of these large vascular seedless plants are now extinct, but their smaller relatives still remain. Vascular tissue includes xylem, which transports water from the roots to the rest of the plant; and phloem, which transports sugars and nutrients from the leaves throughout the plant. Seedless vascular plants include: 
Clubmosses 	  Clubmosses are so named because they can look similar to mosses ( Figure 7.9). Clubmosses are not true mosses, though, because they have vascular tissue. The “club” part of the name comes from club-like clusters of sporangia found on the plants. One type of clubmoss is called the "resurrection plant" because it shrivels and turns brown when it dries out but then quickly turns green when watered again. Clubmosses can resemble mosses; however, clubmosses have vascular tissue, while mosses do not. 
Ferns 	  Ferns are the most common seedless vascular plants ( Figure 7.10). They usually have large divided leaves called fronds. In most ferns, fronds develop from a curled-up formation called a fiddlehead ( Figure 7.11). The fiddlehead looks like the curled decoration on the end of a stringed instrument, such as a fiddle. Leaves unroll as the fiddleheads grow and expand. Ferns grow in a variety of habitats, ranging in size from tiny aquatic species to giant tropical plants. 
Horsetails 	  Horsetails have hollow, ribbed stems and are often found in marshes ( Figure 7.12). Whorls of tiny leaves around the stem make the plant look like a horse’s tail, but these soon fall off and leave a hollow stem that can perform photosynthesis. This is unusual since photosynthesis most often occurs in leaves. The stems are rigid and rough to the touch because they are coated with a scratchy mineral. Because of their scratchy texture, these plants were once used as scouring pads for cleaning dishes. 
Whisk  Ferns 	  Whisk ferns have green branching stems with no leaves, so they resemble a whisk broom ( Figure 7.13). Another striking feature of the whisk ferns is its spherical yellow sporangia. Ferns are common in the understory of the tropical rainforest. The first leaves of most ferns appear curled up into fiddleheads.

Whisk ferns have yellow sporangia and no 	  leaves. • Describe reproductive benefits of spores. • Distinguish between a sporophyte and gametophyte. • Outline the alternation of generations life cycle. Have you ever noticed these little capsules on moss? These tiny capsules produce spores. This is one stage in the process of reproduction in the mosses. Remember mosses and other seedless plants do not have flowers, so their life cycle is quite different from other plants. 
Reproduction in  Seedless  Plants 	  Seedless plants can reproduce asexually or sexually. Some seedless plants, like hornworts and liverworts, can reproduce asexually through fragmentation. When a small fragment of the plant is broken off, it can form a new plant. 
Reproduction in  Nonvascular  Seedless  Plants 	  Like all plants, nonvascular plants have an alternation of generations life cycle. That means they alternate between diploid cell stages (having two sets of chromosomes) and haploid cell stages (having one set of chromosomes) during their life cycle. Recall the haploid stage is called the gametophyte, and the diploid stage is called the sporophyte. In the life cycle of the nonvascular seedless plants, the gametophyte stage is the longest part of the cycle. The gametophyte is the green photosynthetic carpet that you would recognize as a moss. The life cycle of nonvascular seedless plants can be described as follows: tophyte. For this reason, sexual reproduction must happen in the presence of water. Therefore, nonvascular plants tend to live in moist environments. Though the life of a nonvascular seedless plant is a cycle, this can be considered the initial step in the life cycle. phyte. 
Reproduction in  Seedless  Vascular  Plants 	  For the seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte stage is the longest part of the cycle, but the cycle is similar to nonvascular plants. For example, in ferns, the gametophyte is a tiny heart-shaped structure, while the leafy plant we recognize as a fern is the sporophyte. The fern’s sporangia, where spores are produced, are often on the underside of the fronds ( Figure 7.14). Like nonvascular plants, ferns also have flagellated sperm that must swim to the egg. Unlike nonvascular plants, once fertilization takes place, the gametophyte will die, and the sporophyte will live independently. 
This fern is producing spores underneath 	  its fronds. 
Summary 	  • In nonvascular seedless plants, the gametophyte (haploid) stage is the longest part of the cycle. • In seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte (diploid) stage is the longest part of the cycle.

Explain your answer. • Describe ways seedless plants impact humankind. Where does electricity come from? You probably have noticed these huge power lines delivering electricity across the country. But how is this electricity generated? Although there are some alternate sources like wind power and nuclear power, the majority of electricity in the United States is generated by burning coal. Seedless plants were central in forming the coal deposits that we depend on. 
Importance of  Seedless  Plants 	  Seedless plants have been tremendously useful to humans. Without these plants evolving millions of years ago, life as we know it would be very different. 
Seedless  Plants  Became  Coal 	  The greatest influence seedless plants have had on human society is in the formation of coal millions of years ago. When the seedless plants died, became buried deep in the Earth, and were exposed to heat and pressure, coal formed. Coal is essentially made of the fossilized carbon from these plants. Now coal is burned to provide energy, such as electricity. 
Current  Uses 	  But some seedless plants still have uses in society today. Peat moss is commonly used by gardeners to improve soils, since it is really good at absorbing and holding water ( Figure 7.16). Depending on the location, ferns have several different uses worldwide. Ferns are found in many gardens as ornaments, and are used as indoor plants. In tropical regions, the fern is used as a food source by many locals. The fronds can also be used to weave hats and baskets. The fiddleheads of certain species of ferns are used in gourmet food. Some species of ferns, such as the maidenhair fern, are used as medicines. In Southeast Asia, the fern is used in rice fields as a biological fertilizer. Much of the world’s fossil fuels consist of remains of ferns and their relatives. The horsetail’s reedy exterior and silica content made it popular as a metal polisher and abrasive cleanser. Herbalists still use horsetail to treat a variety of kidney/bladder problems, including inflammation, infection, and kidney stones, and it is used as a remedy for brittle nails. Club moss is also used to treat kidney ailments and digestive problems. Club moss spores can be dusted onto the skin and provide relief from itching and irritation, and provide the skin with protection. Extinct forests of club moss have fossilized and developed into huge beds of coal. 
Sphagnum, or peat moss, is commonly 	  added to soil to help absorb water, and keep it in the soil.

Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Coal Thickness Mystery at URL (1:57) Click image to the left or use the URL below. sulfur content in coal. • Describe the importance of the seed. • Explain how seeds are dispersed. Why are seeds important? Many important crops, such as corn, are planted and harvested as seeds. These seeds are important sources of food. For example, corn is ground into feed for chickens and cows. And corn syrup is used to sweeten beverages and candy. But most importantly, seeds are the starting point for a new plant. 
Seeds and  Seed  Dispersal 	  Plants seem to grow wherever they can. How? Plants can’t move on their own. So how does a plant start growing in a new area? What is a Seed? If you’ve ever seen a plant grow from a tiny seed, then you might realize that seeds are amazing structures. A seed is a plant ovule containing an embryo. The seed allows a plant embryo to survive droughts, harsh winters, and other conditions that would kill an adult plant. The tiny plant embryo can simply stay dormant, in a resting state, and wait for the perfect environment to begin to grow. In fact, some seeds can stay dormant for hundreds of years! Another impressive feature of the seed is that it stores food for the young plant after it sprouts. This greatly increases the chances that the tiny plant will survive. So being able to produce a seed is a beneficial adaptation, and, as a result, seed plants have been very successful. Although the seedless plants were here on Earth first, today there are many more seed plants than seedless plants. Learn more about seeds in the Seeds Massachusetts Institute of Technology video at URL h?v=Qk8m3iCd4vE . How are Seed Plants Successful? For a seed plant species to be successful, the seeds must be dispersed, or scattered around in various directions. If the seeds are spread out in many different areas, there is a better chance that some of the seeds will find the right conditions to grow. But how do seeds travel to places they have never been before? To aid with seed dispersal, some plants have evolved special features that help their seeds travel over long distances. One such strategy is to allow the wind to carry the seeds. With special adaptations in the seeds, the seeds can be carried long distances by the wind. For example, you might have noticed how the "fluff" of a dandelion moves in the wind. Each piece of fluff carries a seed to a new location. If you look under the scales of pine cone, you will see tiny seeds with "wings" that allow these seeds to be carried away by the wind. Maple trees also have specialized fruits with wing-like parts that help seed dispersal ( Figure 7.17). Maple trees have fruits with “wings” that help the wind disperse the seeds. Some flowering plants grow fleshy fruit that helps disperse their seeds. When animals eat the fruit, the seeds pass through an animal’s digestive tract unharmed. The seeds germinate after they are passed out with the animal’s feces. Berries, citrus fruits, cherries, apples, and a variety of other types of fruits are all adapted to be attractive to animals, so the animals will eat them and disperse the seed ( Figure 7.18). Some non-fleshy fruits are specially adapted for animals to carry them on their fur. You might have returned from a walk in the woods to find burrs stuck to your socks. These burrs are actually specialized fruits designed to carry seeds to a new location.

Today a gymnasium means a place for playing indoor sports. In ancient Greece, sports were done in the nude, so the word "gymnasium" is based on the Greek word for naked (gymnos). The root word is the same for "gymnosperm," which means "naked seed." Gymnosperms are those plants that do not have a fruit encasing the seed. 
Gymnosperms 	  Gymnosperms have seeds, but they do not produce fruit. Instead, the seeds of gymnosperms are usually found in cones. There are four phyla of gymnosperms: 
Conifers 	  Conifers, members of the phylum Coniferophyta, are probably the gymnosperms that are most familiar to you. Conifers include trees such as pines, firs, spruces, cedars, and the coastal redwood trees in California, which are the tallest living vascular plants. Conifers have their reproductive structures in cones, but they are not the only plants to have that trait ( Figure 7.19). Conifer pollen cones are usually very small, while the seed cones are larger. Pollen contains gametophytes that produce the male gamete of seed plants. The pollen, which is a powder-like substance, is carried by the wind to fertilize the seed cones that contain the female gamete ( Figure 7.20). A red pine, which bears seeds in cones, is an example of a conifer. Conifers have many uses. They are important sources of lumber and are also used to make paper. Resins, the sticky substance you might see oozing out of a wound on a pine tree, are collected from conifers to make a variety of products, such as the solvent turpentine and the rosin used by musicians and baseball players. The sticky rosin improves the pitcher’s hold on the ball or increases the friction between the bow and the strings to help create music from a violin or other stringed instrument. 
Cycads 	  Cycads, in the phylum Cycadophyta, are also gymnosperms. They have large, finely-divided leaves and grow as short shrubs and trees in tropical regions. Like conifers, they produce cones, but the seed cones and pollen cones are always on separate plants ( Figure 7.21). One type of cycad, the Sago Palm, is a popular landscape plant. During the Age of the Dinosaurs (about 65 to 200 million years ago), cycads were the dominant plants. So you can imagine dinosaurs grazing on cycad seeds and roaming through cycad forests. 
The end of a pine tree branch bears the 	  male cones that produce the pollen. 
Cycads bear their pollen and seeds in 	  cones on separate plants. 
Ginkgoes 	  Ginkgoes, in the phylum Ginkgophyta, are unique because they are the only species left in the phylum. Many other species in the fossil record have gone extinct ( Figure 7.22). The ginkgo tree is sometimes called a "living fossil" because it is the last species from its phylum. One reason the ginkgo tree may have survived is because it was often grown around Buddhist temples, especially in China. The ginkgo tree is also a popular landscape tree today in American cities because it can live in polluted areas better than most plants. Ginkgoes, like cycads, has separate female and male plants. The male trees are usually preferred for landscaping because the seeds produced by the female plants smell terrible when they ripen. 
Ginkgo trees are gymnosperms with 	  broad leaves. 
Gnetophytes 	  Gnetophytes, in the phylum Gnetophyta, are a very small and unusual group of plants. Ephedra is an important member of this group, since this desert shrub produces the ephedrine used to treat asthma and other conditions. Welwitschia produces extremely long leaves and is found in the deserts of southwestern Africa ( Figure 7.23). Overall, there are about 70 different species in this diverse phylum. One type of gnetophyte is Welwitschia. 
Summary 	  • Gymnosperms have seeds, but they do not produce fruit; the seeds of gymnosperms are usually found in cones. • There are four phyla of gymnosperms: conifers, cycads, ginkgoes, and gnetophytes. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Gymnosperms at URL (4:31) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Define angiosperm. • List and define the major parts of the flower. • Distinguish self-pollination from cross-fertilization. Why do plants make fruit? When this bird eats a berry, it also consumes the seeds contained inside. The bird may fly for many miles before digestion is complete and the seeds are excreted. This allows the plant to spread its seeds to a new location. For this reason, plants that make fruits have been very successful. 
Angiosperms 	  Angiosperms, in the phylum Anthophyta, are the most successful phylum of plants. This category also contains the largest number of individual plants ( Figure 7.24). Angiosperms evolved the structure of the flower, so they are also called the flowering plants. Angiosperms live in a variety of different environments. A water lily, an oak tree, and a barrel cactus, although different, are all angiosperms. 
The  Parts of a  Flower 	  Even though flowers may look very different from each other, they do have some structures in common. The structures are explained in the picture below ( Figure 7.25). • The green outside of a flower that often looks like a leaf is called the sepal ( Figure 7.26). All of the sepals together are called the calyx, which is usually green and protects the flower before it opens. Angiosperms are the flowering plants. A complete flower has sepals, petals, stamens, and one or more carpels. • All of the petals ( Figure 7.26) together are called the corolla. They are bright and colorful to attract a particular pollinator, an animal that carries pollen from one flower to another. Examples of pollinators include birds and insects. • The next structure is the stamen, consisting of the stalk-like filament that holds up the anther, or pollen sac. The pollen, which is found at the top of the stamen, is the male gametophyte. • At the very center is the carpel, which is divided into three different parts: (1) the sticky stigma, where the pollen lands, (2) the tube of the style, and (3) the large, bottom part, known as the ovary. The ovary holds the ovules, the female gametophytes. When the ovules are fertilized, the ovule becomes the seed and the ovary becomes the fruit. The following table summarizes the parts of the flower ( Table 7.1).

This image shows the difference between 	  a petal and a sepal. How Do Angiosperms Reproduce? Flowering plants can reproduce two different ways: into a genetically identical plant. flower to flower by wind or by animals. Flowers that are pollinated by animals such as birds, butterflies, or bees are often colorful and provide nectar, a sugary reward, for their animal pollinators. Why Are Angiosperms Important to Humans? Angiosperms are important to humans in many ways, but the most significant role of angiosperms is as food. Wheat, rye, corn, and other grains are all harvested from flowering plants. Starchy foods, such as potatoes, and legumes, such as beans, are also angiosperms. And, as mentioned previously, fruits are a product of angiosperms that increase seed dispersal and are nutritious. There are also many non-food uses of angiosperms that are important to society. For example, cotton and other plants are used to make cloth, and hardwood trees are used for lumber. 
Summary 	  • Angiosperms are plants that produce flowers and fruit. • Angiosperms can be self-pollinated, meaning pollen falls on the stigma of the same flower, or cross-fertilized, during which pollen from one flower travels to a stigma of a flower on another plant.

How do fruits know when to fall? Fruits, such as these peaches, do not leave their trees until it’s the right time. The seeds are mature, and the fruit is ripe. But what tells the fruits it’s time to drop? The signal that is sent through the tree is a type of hormone. Hormones also send signals through your body. 
Plant  Hormones 	  Plants may not move, but that does not mean they don’t respond to their environment. Plants can sense gravity, light, touch, and seasonal changes. For example, you might have noticed how a house plant bends toward a bright window. Plants can sense and then grow toward the source of light. Scientists say that plants are able to respond to "stimuli," or something—usually in the environment—that results in a response. For instance, light is the stimulus, and the plant moving toward the light is the "response." Hormones are special chemical messengers molecules that help organisms, including plants, respond to stimuli in their environment. In order for plants to respond to the environment, their cells must be able to communicate with other cells. Hormones send messages between the cells. Animals, like humans, also have hormones, such as testosterone or estrogen, to carry messages from cell to cell. In both plants and animals, hormones travel from cell to cell in response to a stimulus; they also activate a specific response. 
Types of  Plant  Hormones 	  Five different types of plant hormones are involved in the main responses of plants, and they each have different functions ( Table 7.2). 
Involved in tropisms and apical dominance 	  The hormone ethylene has two functions. It (1) helps ripen fruit and (2) is involved in the process of abscission, the dropping of leaves, fruits, and flowers. When a flower is done blooming or a fruit is ripe and ready to be eaten, ethylene causes the petals or fruit to fall from a plant ( Figure 7.27 and Figure 7.28). Ethylene is an unusual plant hormone because it is a gas. That means it can move through the air, and a ripening apple can cause another apple to ripen, or even over-ripen. That’s why one rotten apple spoils the whole barrel! Some farmers spray their green peppers with ethylene gas to cause them to ripen faster and become red peppers. You can try to see how ethylene works by putting a ripe apple or banana with another unripe fruit in a closed container or paper bag. What do you think will happen to the unripe fruit? 
The hormone ethylene is signaling these 	  tomatoes to ripen. 
The hormone ethylene causes flower 	  petals to fall from a plant, a process known as abscission. 
Gibberellins 	  Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure 7.29). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open. 
Dwarf plants like this bonsai tree often 	  have unusually low concentrations of gibberellins. 
Cytokinins 	  Cytokinins are hormones that cause plant cells to divide. Cytokinins were discovered from attempts to grow plant tissue in artificial environments ( Figure 7.30). Cytokinins prevent the process of aging (senescence). So florists sometimes apply cytokinins to cut flowers, so they do not get old and die. 
Cytokinins promote cell division and are 	  necessary for growing plants in tissue culture. A small piece of a plant is placed in sterile conditions to regenerate a new plant. 
Abscisic  Acid 	  Abscisic acid is misnamed because it was once believed to play a role in abscission (the dropping of leaves, fruits, and flowers), but we now know abscission is caused by ethylene. The actual role of abscisic acid is to close the stomata, the tiny openings in leaves that allow substances to enter and leave, and to maintain dormancy. When a plant is stressed due to lack of water, abscisic acid tells the stomata to close. This prevents water loss through the stomata. When the environment is not good for a seed to germinate, abscisic acid signals for the dormancy period of the seed to continue. Abscisic acid also tells the buds of plants to stay in the dormancy stage. When conditions improve, the levels of abscisic acid drop and the levels of gibberellins increase, signaling that is time to break dormancy ( Figure 
Auxins 	  Auxins are hormones that play a role in plant growth. Auxins produced at the tip of the plant are involved in apical dominance, when the main central stem grows more strongly than other stems and branches. When the tip of the plant is removed, the auxins are no longer present, and the side branches begin to grow. This is why pruning a plant by cutting off the main branches helps produce a fuller plant with more branches. You actually need to cut branches off of a plant for it to grow more branches! Auxins are also involved in tropisms, responses to stimuli in the environment 
Summary 	  • Plant hormones are chemical signals that control different processes in plants. A decrease in levels of abscisic acid allows these buds to break dormancy and put out leaves. • Plant hormones include ethylene, gibberellins, cytokinins, absciscic acid, and auxins. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Plant Hormones at URL (5:39) • Define tropism. • Distinguish phototropism from gravitropism and from thigmotropism. Why are these plants turning sideways? Plants respond to their environment in how they grow. In this picture, the light source is probably off to the left side. As a result, the plants grow in this direction to get more light. 
Tropisms 	  Plants may not be able to move to another location, but they are able to change how they grow in response to their environment. Growth toward or away from a stimulus is known as a tropism ( Table 7.3). Auxins, a class of plant hormones, allow plants to curve in specific directions as they grow. The auxin moves to one side of the stem, where it starts a chain of events that cause rapid cell growth on just that one side of the stem. With one side of the stem growing faster than the other, the plant begins to bend. 
Phototropism 	  You might have noticed that plants bend toward the light. This is an example of a tropism where light is the stimulus, known as phototropism ( Figure 7.32). To obtain more light for photosynthesis, leaves and stems grow toward the light. On the other hand, roots grow away from light. This is beneficial for the roots, because they need to obtain water and nutrients from deep within the ground. 
These seedlings bending toward the sun 	  are displaying phototropism. 
Gravitropism 	  So, how do the roots of seeds underground know to grow downward? How do the roots deep in the soil know which way is up? Gravitropism is a growth toward or away from the pull of gravity ( Figure 7.33). Shoots, the new growth of a plant, also show a gravitropism, but in the opposite direction. If you place a plant on its side, the stem and new leaves will curve upward. 
This shoot is exhibiting gravitropism: it is 	  growing against the pull of gravity. 
Thigmotropism 	  Plants also have a touch response called thigmotropism. If you have ever seen a morning glory or the tendrils of a pea plant twist around a pole, then you know that plants must be able to sense the pole. Thigmotropism works much like the other tropisms. The plant grows straight until it comes in contact with the pole. Then, the side of the stem that is in contact with the pole grows slower than the opposite side of the stem. This causes the stem to bend around the pole. 
Summary 	  • Tropisms are growth toward or away from a stimulus. • Types of tropisms include gravitropism (gravity), phototropism (light), and thigmotropism (touch).

How does this plant know it’s Christmas? This plant is known as a Christmas cactus because it only blooms once a year, during the Christmas season. But plants can’t read a calendar. How can a houseplant know the time of the year? 
Seasonal  Changes 	  Have you seen the leaves of plants change colors? During what time of year does this happen? What causes it to happen? Plants can sense changes in the seasons. Leaves change color and drop each autumn in some climates ( Certain flowers, like poinsettias, only bloom during the winter. And, in the spring, the winter buds on the trees break open, and the leaves start to grow. How do plants detect time of year? Although you might detect seasonal changes by the change in temperature, this is not the way in which plants know the seasons are changing. Plants determine the time of year by the length of daylight, known as the photoperiod. Because of the tilt of the Earth, during winter days, there are less hours of light than during summer days. That’s why, in the winter, it starts getting dark very early in the evening, and then stays dark while you’re getting ready for school the next morning. But in the summer it will be bright early in the morning, and the sun will not set until late that night. With a light-sensitive chemical, plants can sense the differences in day length. 
Leaves changing color is a response to 	  the shortened length of the day in autumn. For example, in the fall, when the days start to get shorter, the trees sense that there is less sunlight. The plant is stimulated, and it sends messages telling the leaves to change colors and fall. This is an example of photoperiodism, the reaction of organisms, such as plants, to the length of day or night. Photoperiodism is also the reaction of plants to the length of light and dark periods. Many flowering plants sense the length of night, a dark period, as a signal to flower. Each plant has a different photoperiod, or night length. When the plant senses the appropriate length of darkness, resulting in an appropriate length of daylight, it flowers. Flowering plants are classified as long-day plants or short-day plants. Long-day plants flower when the length of daylight exceeds the necessary photoperiod, and short-day plants flower when the day length is shorter than the necessary photoperiod. Long-day plants include carnations, clover, lettuce, wheat, and turnips. Short-day plants include cotton, rice, and sugar cane. 
Summary 	  • Plants can respond to the change of season by losing their leaves, flowering, or breaking dormancy. • Plants go through seasonal changes after detecting differences in day length. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Why Do Leaves Change Color? at URL .

Introduction 	  Fighting or playing? You might think that these young tigers are fighting, but they’re really just playing. Like most other young mammals, tigers like to play. Why do mammals play? Is playing just for fun, or does it serve some other purpose as well? Playing is actually an important way of learning. By playing, these tigers are learning moves that will help them become successful predators as adults. Playing is just one of many ways that mammals and other animals learn how to behave. • Explain the meaning of animal behavior. • Give examples of animal behaviors. • Discuss the importance of animal behavior. • Explain how animal behaviors can increase fitness. Why do spiders spin webs? You have probably seen a spider web before. You may even know that spiders create webs to catch their prey. This is an example of animal behavior. Animals have many different behaviors. 
Introduction to  Animal  Behavior 	  Barking, purring, and playing are just some of the ways in which dogs and cats behave. These are examples of animal behaviors. Animal behavior is any way that animals act, either alone or with other animals. 
Examples of  Animal  Behavior 	  Can you think of examples of animal behaviors? What about insects and birds? How do they behave? Pictured below are just some of the ways in which these, and other animals act ( Figure 8.1). Look at the pictures and read about the behaviors. Think about why the animal is behaving that way. 
These pictures show examples of animal 	  behaviors. Why do the animals behave these ways? 
Importance of  Animal  Behavior 	  Why do animals behave the way they do? The answer to this question depends on what the behavior is. A cat chases a mouse to catch it. A mother dog nurses her puppies to feed them. All of these behaviors have the same purpose: getting or providing food. All animals need food for energy. They need energy to move around. In fact, they need energy just to stay alive. Energy allows all the processes inside cells to occur. Baby animals also need energy to grow and develop. Birds and wasps build nests to have a safe place to store their eggs and raise their young. Many other animals build nests for the same reason. Animals protect their young in other ways, as well. For example, a mother dog not only nurses her puppies. She also washes them with her tongue and protects them from strange people or other animals. All of these behaviors help the young survive and grow up to be adults. Rabbits run away from foxes and other predators to stay alive. Their speed is their best defense. Lizards sun themselves on rocks to get warm because they cannot produce their own body heat. When they are warmer, they can move faster and be more alert. This helps them escape from predators and also find food. All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection.

Do you play a sport? If you play a sport like soccer, then you realize it takes a lot of work. Remember how you didn’t know at all what you were doing when you first started? You had rules to figure out and skills to practice. Playing a sport is an example of a learned behavior. 
Learned  Behavior 	  Just about all human behaviors are learned. Learned behavior is behavior that occurs only after experience or practice. Learned behavior has an advantage over innate behavior: it is more flexible. Learned behavior can be changed if conditions change. For example, you probably know the route from your house to your school. Assume that you moved to a new house in a different place, so you had to take a different route to school. What if following the old route was an innate behavior? You would not be able to adapt. Fortunately, it is a learned behavior. You can learn the new route just as you learned the old one. Although most animals can learn, animals with greater intelligence are better at learning and have more learned behaviors. Humans are the most intelligent animals. They depend on learned behaviors more than any other species. Other highly intelligent species include apes, our closest relatives in the animal kingdom. They include chimpanzees and gorillas. Both are also very good at learning behaviors. You may have heard of a gorilla named Koko. The psychologist, Dr. Francine Patterson, raised Koko. Dr. Patterson wanted to find out if gorillas could learn human language. Starting when Koko was just one year old, Dr. Patterson taught her to use sign language. Koko learned to use and understand more than 1,000 signs. Koko showed how much gorillas can learn. See A Conversation with Koko at URL . Think about some of the behaviors you have learned. They might include riding a bicycle, using a computer, and playing a musical instrument or sport. You probably did not learn all of these behaviors in the same way. Perhaps you learned some behaviors on your own, just by practicing. Other behaviors you may have learned from other people. Humans and other animals can learn behaviors in several different ways. The following methods of learning will be explored below: 
Habituation 	  Habituation is learning to get used to something after being exposed to it for a while. Habituation usually involves getting used to something that is annoying or frightening, but not dangerous. Habituation is one of the simplest ways of learning. It occurs in just about every species of animal. You have probably learned through habituation many times. For example, maybe you were reading a book when someone turned on a television in the same room. At first, the sound of the television may have been annoying. After a while, you may no longer have noticed it. If so, you had become habituated to the sound. Another example of habituation is shown below ( Figure 8.2). Crows and most other birds are usually afraid of people. They avoid coming close to people, or they fly away when people come near them. The crows landing on this scarecrow have become used to a “human” in this place. They have learned that the scarecrow poses no danger. They are no longer afraid to come close. They have become habituated to the scarecrow. Can you see why habituation is useful? It lets animals ignore things that will not harm them. Without habituation, animals might waste time and energy trying to escape from things that are not really dangerous. 
Observational  Learning 	  Observational learning is learning by watching and copying the behavior of someone else. Human children learn many behaviors this way. When you were a young child, you may have learned how to tie your shoes by watching your dad tie his shoes. More recently, you may have learned how to dance by watching a pop star dancing on TV. Most likely, you have learned how to do math problems by watching your teachers do problems on the board at school. Can you think of other behaviors you have learned by watching and copying other people? Other animals also learn through observational learning. For example, young wolves learn to be better hunters by watching and copying the skills of older wolves in their pack. Another example of observational learning is This scarecrow is no longer scary to this crow. The crow has become used to its being in this spot and learned that it is not dangerous. This is an example of habituation. how some monkeys have learned to wash their food. They learned by watching and copying the behavior of other monkeys. 
Conditioning 	  Conditioning is a way of learning that involves a reward or punishment. Did you ever train a dog to fetch a ball or stick by rewarding it with treats? If you did, you were using conditioning. Another example of conditioning is shown in the video below; the rats have been taught to “play basketball” by being rewarded with food pellets. What do you think would happen if the rats were no longer rewarded for this behavior? Click image to the left or use the URL below. Conditioning also occurs in wild animals. For example, bees learn to find nectar in certain types of flowers because they have found nectar in those flowers before. Humans learn behaviors through conditioning, as well. A young child might learn to put away his toys by being rewarded with a bedtime story. An older child might learn to study for tests in school by being rewarded with better grades. Can you think of behaviors you have learned by being rewarded for them? Conditioning does not always involve a reward. It can involve a punishment, instead. A toddler might be punished with a time-out each time he grabs a toy from his baby brother. After several time-outs, he may learn to stop taking his brother’s toys. A dog might be scolded each time she jumps up on the sofa. After repeated scolding, she may learn to stay off the sofa. A bird might become ill after eating a poisonous insect. The bird may learn from this “punishment” to avoid eating the same kind of insect in the future. 
Learning by  Playing 	  Most young mammals, including humans, like to play. Play is one ways they learn the skills that they will need as adults. Think about how kittens play. They pounce on toys and chase each other. This helps them learn how to be better predators when they are older. Big cats also play. The lion cubs pictured below are playing and practicing their hunting skills at the same time ( Figure 8.3). The dogs are playing tug-of-war with a toy ( Figure 8.3). What do you think they are learning by playing together this way? Other young animals play in different ways. For example, young deer play by running and kicking up their hooves. This helps them learn how to escape from predators. Left: These two lion cubs are playing. 
They are not only having fun, but they are 	  also learning how to be better hunters. 
Right:  These dogs are really playing.  This 	  play fighting can help them learn how to be better predators. Human children learn by playing as well. For example, playing games and sports can help them learn to follow rules and work with others. The toddlers pictured below are playing in the sand ( Figure 8.4). They are learning about the world through play. What do you think they might be learning? 
Playing in a sandbox is fun for young 	  children. It can also help them learn about the world. 
Insight  Learning 	  Insight learning is learning from past experiences and reasoning. It usually involves coming up with new ways to solve problems. Insight learning generally happens quickly. An animal has a sudden flash of insight. Insight learning requires relatively great intelligence. Human beings use insight learning more than any other species. They have used their intelligence to solve problems ranging from inventing the wheel to flying rockets into space. Think about problems you have solved. Maybe you figured out how to solve a new type of math problem or how to get to the next level of a video game. If you relied on your past experiences and reasoning to do it, then you were using insight learning. One type of insight learning is making tools to solve problems. Scientists used to think that humans were the only animals intelligent enough to make tools. In fact, tool-making was believed to set humans apart from all other animals. In 1960, primate expert Jane Goodall discovered that chimpanzees also make tools. She saw a chimpanzee strip leaves from a twig. Then he poked the twig into a hole in a termite mound. After termites climbed onto the twig, he pulled the twig out of the hole and ate the insects clinging to it. The chimpanzee had made a tool to “fish” for termites. He had used insight to solve a problem. Since then, chimpanzees have been seen making several different types of tools. For example, they sharpen sticks and use them as spears for hunting. They use stones as hammers to crack open nuts. Scientists have also observed other species of animals making tools to solve problems. A crow was seen bending a piece of wire into a hook. Then the crow used the hook to pull food out of a tube. An example of a gorilla using a walking stick is shown below ( Figure 8.5). Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals can use their experience and reasoning to solve problems. They can learn through insight. This gorilla is using a branch as a tool. She is leaning on it to keep her balance while she reaches down into swampy water to catch a fish.

This kitten was probably adopted and separated from its mother at a young age. It never got a lesson in how to stalk and pounce on prey. So how does this kitten know how to attack the ball of yarn? Some behaviors do not need to be learned. 
Innate  Behavior 	  Many animal behaviors are ways that animals act, naturally. They don’t have to learn how to behave in these ways. Cats are natural-born hunters. They don’t need to learn how to hunt. Spiders spin their complex webs without learning how to do it from other spiders. Birds and wasps know how to build nests without being taught. These behaviors are called innate. An innate behavior is any behavior that occurs naturally in all animals of a given species. An innate behavior is also called an instinct. The first time an animal performs an innate behavior, the animal does it well. The animal does not have to practice the behavior in order to get it right or become better at it. Innate behaviors are also predictable. All members of a species perform an innate behavior in the same way. From the examples described above, you can probably tell that innate behaviors usually involve important actions, like eating and caring for the young. There are many other examples of innate behaviors. For example, did you know that honeybees dance? The honeybee pictured below has found a source of food ( Figure 8.6). When the bee returns to its hive, it will do a dance. This dance is called the waggle dance. The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive where to find the food. Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees, so it is an innate behavior. Besides building nests, birds have other innate behaviors. One example occurs in gulls, which are pictured below ( When this honeybee goes back to its hive, it will do a dance to tell the other bees in the hive where it found food. to feed the chick. In many other species of birds, the chicks open their mouths wide whenever the mother returns to the nest ( Figure 8.7). This innate behavior, called gaping, causes the mother to feed them. 
Left:  This mother gull will feed her chick 	  after it pecks at a red spot on her beak. 
Both pecking and feeding behaviors are 	  innate. Right: When these baby birds open their mouths wide, their mother instinctively feeds them. This innate behavior is called gaping. Another example of innate behavior in birds is egg rolling. It happens in some species of water birds, like the graylag goose ( Figure 8.8). Graylag geese make nests on the ground. If an egg rolls out of the nest, a mother goose uses her bill to push it back into the nest. Returning the egg to the nest helps ensure that the egg will hatch. 
Innate  Behavior in  Human  Beings 	  All animals have innate behaviors, even human beings. Can you think of human behaviors that do not have to be learned? Chances are, you will have a hard time thinking of any. The only truly innate behaviors in humans are called reflex behaviors. They occur mainly in babies. Like innate behaviors in other animals, reflex behaviors in human babies may help them survive. An example of a reflex behavior in babies is the sucking reflex. Newborns instinctively suck on a nipple that is placed in their mouth. It is easy to see how this behavior evolved. It increases the chances of a baby feeding and surviving. Another example of a reflex behavior in babies is the grasp reflex ( Figure 8.9). Babies instinctively grasp an object placed in the palm of their hand. Their grip may be surprisingly strong. How do you think this behavior might increase a baby’s chances of surviving? This female graylag goose is a groundnesting water bird. Before her chicks hatch, the mother protects the eggs. She will use her bill to push eggs back into the nest if they roll out. This is an example of an innate behavior. How could this behavior increase the goose’s fitness? One of the few innate behaviors in human beings is the grasp reflex. occurs only in babies.

Communication 	  What does the word "communication" make you think of? Talking on a cell phone? Texting? Writing? Those are just a few of the ways in which human beings communicate. Most other animals also communicate. Communication is any way in which animals share information, and they do this in many different ways. Do all animals talk to each other? Probably not, but many do communicate. Like human beings, many other animals live together in groups. Some insects, including ants and bees, are well known for living in groups. In order for animals to live together in groups, they must be able to communicate with each other. Animal communication, like most other animal behaviors, increases the ability to survive and have offspring. This is known as fitness. Communication increases fitness by helping animals find food, defend themselves from predators, mate, and care for offspring. 
Communication with  Sound 	  Some animals communicate with sound. Most birds communicate this way. Birds use different calls to warn other birds of danger, or to tell them to flock together. Many other animals also use sound to communicate. For example, monkeys use warning cries to tell other monkeys in their troop that a predator is near. Frogs croak to attract female frogs as mates. Gibbons use calls to tell other gibbons to stay away from their area. 
Communication with  Sight 	  Another way some animals communicate is with sight. By moving in certain ways or by “making faces,” they show other animals what they mean. Most primates communicate in this way. For example, a male chimpanzee may raise his arms and stare at another male chimpanzee. This warns the other chimpanzee to keep his distance. The chimpanzee pictured below may look like he is smiling, but he is really showing fear ( Figure 8.10). He is communicating to other chimpanzees that he will not challenge them. 
This chimpanzee is communicating with 	  his face. His expression is called a “fear grin.” It tells other chimpanzees that he is not a threat. Look at the peacock pictured below ( Figure 8.11). Why is he raising his beautiful tail feathers? He is also communicating. He is showing females of his species that he would be a good mate. 
Communication with  Scent 	  Some animals communicate with scent. They release chemicals that other animals of their species can smell or detect in some other way. Ants release many different chemicals. Other ants detect the chemicals with their antennae. This explains how ants are able to work together. The different chemicals that ants produce have different meanings. Some of the chemicals signal to all of the ants in a group to come together. Other chemicals warn of danger. Still other chemicals mark trails to food sources. When an ant finds food, it marks the trail back to the nest by leaving behind a chemical on the ground. Other ants follow the chemical trail to the food. Many other animals also use chemicals to communicate. You have probably seen male dogs raise their leg to urinate on a fire hydrant or other object. Did you know that the dogs were communicating? They mark their area with a chemical in their urine. Other dogs can smell the chemical. The scent of the chemical tells other dogs to stay away. 
This peacock is using his tail feathers to 	  communicate. What is he "saying"? 
Human  Communication 	  Like other animals, humans communicate with one another. They mainly use sound and sight to share information. The most important way in which humans communicate is with language. Language is the use of symbols to communicate. In human languages, the symbols are words. They stand for many different things. Words stand for things, people, actions, feelings, or ideas. Think of several common words. What does each word stand for? Another important way in which humans communicate is with facial expressions. Look at the face of the young child pictured below ( Figure 8.12). Can you tell from her face how she is feeling? Humans also use gestures to communicate. What are people communicating when they shrug their shoulders? When they shake their head? These are just a few examples of the ways in which humans share information without using words. What does this girl’s face say about how she is feeling?

How are you social? When you think about being social, do you think about hanging out and chatting with friends? Sending a text or posting to Facebook? Humans socialize in many ways. Social behavior is not limited to humans, however. Many animals are social. 
Social  Behavior 	  Why is animal communication important? Without it, animals would not be able to live together in groups. Animals that live in groups with other members of their species are called social animals. Social animals include many species of insects, birds, and mammals. Specific examples of social animals are ants, bees, crows, wolves, lions, and humans. To live together with one another, these animals must be able to share information. 
Highly  Social  Animals 	  Some species of animals are very social. In these species, members of the group depend completely on one another. Different animals within the group have different jobs. Therefore, group members must work together for the good of all. Most species of ants and bees are highly social animals. Ants live together in large groups called colonies ( Figure 8.13). A colony may have millions of ants, making communication among the ants very important. All of the ants in the colony work together as a single unit. Each ant has a specific job, and most of the ants are workers. Their job is to build and repair the colony’s nest. Worker ants also leave the nest to find food for themselves and other colony members. The workers care for the young as well. Other ants in the colony are soldiers. They defend the colony against predators. Each colony also has a queen. Her only job is to lay eggs. She may lay millions of eggs each month. A few ants in the colony are called drones. They are the only male ants in the colony. Their job is to mate with the queen. 
The ants in this picture belong to the 	  same colony. They have left the colony’s nest to search for food. Honeybees and bumblebees also live in colonies ( Figure 8.14). Each bee in the colony has a particular job. Most of the bees are workers. Young worker bees clean the colony’s hive and feed the young. Older worker bees build the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive. The oldest workers leave the hive to find food. Each colony usually has one queen that lays eggs. The colony also has a small number of male drones. They mate with the queen. 
All 	  the honeybees in this colony work together. Each bee has a certain job to perform. Notice the queen to the left. She is the largest bee in the colony. 
Cooperation 	  Ants, bees, and other social animals must cooperate. Cooperation means working together with others. Members of the group may cooperate by sharing food. They may also cooperate by defending each other. Look at the ants pictured below ( Figure 8.15). They show very clearly why cooperation is important. A single ant would not be able to carry this large bee back to the nest to feed the other ants. With cooperation, the job is easy. Animals in many other species cooperate. For example, lions live in groups called prides ( Figure 8.16). All the 
These ants are cooperating.  By working 	  together, they are able to move this much larger insect prey back to their nest. At the nest, they will share the bee with other ants that do not leave the nest. lions in the pride cooperate, though there is still serious competition among the males. Male lions work together to defend the other lions in the pride. Female lions work together to hunt. Then, they share the meat with other pride members. Another example of cooperation is seen with meerkats. Meerkats are small mammals that live in Africa. They also live in groups and cooperate with one another. For example, young female meerkats act as babysitters. They take care of the baby meerkats while their parents are away looking for food. Members of this lion pride work together. Males cooperate by defending the pride. Females cooperate by hunting and sharing the food.

Do you think they are displaying learned behavior, innate behavior, or both? Explain your reasoning fully. b. As social animals, which behavior do you think is most important to them? Explain your reasoning. c. Does your answer apply to all situations? • Define courtship behavior. • Explain the purpose of mating behavior. • Describe how animals care for their young and defend their territory. Why do these birds pair up? These birds are pairing up so that they can produce offspring. Many birds are monogamous, keeping the same mate for an entire season. In some species, they even stay paired for their entire life. 
Mating  Behavior and  Defending  Territory 	  Some of the most important animal behaviors involve mating. Mating is the pairing of an adult male and female to produce young. Adults that are most successful at attracting a mate are most likely to have offspring. Traits that help animals attract a mate and have offspring increase their fitness. As the genes that encode these traits are passed to the next generation, the traits will become more common in the population. 
Courtship  Behaviors 	  In many species, females choose the male they will mate with. For their part, males try to be chosen as mates. They show females that they would be a better mate than the other males. To be chosen as a mate, males may perform courtship behaviors. These are special behaviors that help attract a mate. Male courtship behaviors get the attention of females and show off a male’s traits. These behaviors are often observed as direct competition between males. Different species have different courtship behaviors. One example is a peacock raising his tail feathers. The colorful peacock is trying to impress females of his species with his beautiful feathers. Another example of courtship behavior in birds is the blue-footed booby. He is doing a dance to attract a female for mating. During the dance, he spreads out his wings and stamps his feet on the ground. You can watch the following video of a blue-footed booby doing his courtship dance at: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Courtship behaviors occur in many other species. For example, males in some species of whales have special mating songs to attract females as mates. Frogs croak for the same reason. Male deer clash antlers to court females. Male jumping spiders jump from side to side to attract mates. Courtship behaviors are one type of display behavior. A display behavior is a fixed set of actions that carries a specific message. Although many display behaviors are used to attract mates, some display behaviors have other purposes. For example, display behaviors may be used to warn other animals to stay away, as you will read below. 
Caring for the  Young 	  In most species of birds and mammals, one or both parents care for their offspring. Caring for the young may include making a nest or other shelter. It may also include feeding the young and protecting them from predators. Caring for offspring increases their chances of surviving. Birds called killdeers have an interesting way of protecting their chicks. When a predator gets too close to her nest, a mother killdeer pretends to have a broken wing. The mother walks away from the nest holding her wing as though it were injured ( Figure 8.17). The predator thinks she is injured and will be easy prey. The mother leads the predator away from the nest and then flies away. 
This mother killdeer is pretending she has 	  a broken wing. She is trying to attract a predator’s attention in order to protect her chicks. This behavior puts her at risk of harm. How can it increase her fitness? In most species of mammals, parents also teach their offspring important skills. For example, meerkat parents teach their pups how to eat scorpions without being stung. A scorpion sting can be deadly, so this is a very important skill. Teaching the young important skills makes it more likely that they will survive. Notice that, compared to other types of animals, birds and mammals have relatively few offspring. 
Defending  Territory 	  Some species of animals are territorial. This means that they defend their area. The area they defend usually contains their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring. A species is more likely to be territorial if there is not very much food in their area. Having a larger territory could mean more prey or food. Animals generally do not defend their territory by fighting. Instead, they are more likely to use display behavior. The behavior tells other animals to stay away. It gets the message across without the need for fighting. Display behavior is generally safer and uses less energy than fighting. Male gorillas use display behavior to defend their territory. They pound on their chests and thump the ground with their hands to warn other male gorillas to keep away from their area. The robin displays his red breast to warn other robins to stay away ( Figure 8.18). 
The red breast of this male robin is easy 	  to see. The robin displays his bright red chest to defend his territory. It warns other robins to keep out of his area. Some animals deposit chemicals to mark the boundary of their territory. This is why dogs urinate on fire hydrants and other objects. Cats may also mark their territory by depositing chemicals. They have scent glands in their face. They deposit chemicals by rubbing their face against objects.

What are these butterflies doing? Monarch butterflies gather in large groups as they migrate 2,500 miles south each fall. They return to the north in the spring. This migration is a cycle that repeats every year. 
Cycles of  Behavior 	  Many animal behaviors change in a regular way. They go through cycles. Some cycles of behavior repeat each year. Other cycles of behavior repeat every day. 
Yearly  Cycles 	  An example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is hibernation. Hibernation is a state in which an animal’s body processes are slower than usual, and its body temperature falls. An animal uses less energy than usual during hibernation. This helps the animal survive during a time of year when food is scarce. Hibernation may last for weeks or months. Animals that hibernate include species of bats, squirrels, and snakes. Most people think that bears hibernate. In fact, bears do not go into true hibernation. In the winter, they go into a deep sleep. However, their body processes do not slow down very much. Their body temperature also remains about the same as usual. Bears can be awakened easily from their winter sleep. Another example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is migration. Migration is the movement of animals from one place to another. Migration is an innate behavior that is triggered by changes in the environment. For example, animals may migrate when the days get shorter in the fall. Migration is most common in birds, fish, and insects. In the Northern Hemisphere, many species of birds, including robins and geese, travel south for the winter. They migrate to areas where it is warmer and where there is more food. They return north in the spring. A flock of migrating geese is pictured below ( Figure 8.19). These geese are flying south for the winter. Flocks of geese migrate in V-shaped formations. Some animals migrate very long distances. The map shown below shows the migration route of a species of hawk called Swainson’s hawk ( Figure 8.20). About how many miles do the hawks travel from start to finish? Are you surprised that birds migrate that far? Some species of birds migrate even farther. Whales also are known to migrate thousands of miles each year to take advantage of warmer waters in the winter months. The great migration of millions of zebra, wildebeest and other antelope in East Africa also occurs yearly. Each year around 1.5 million wildebeest and 300,000 zebra (along with other antelope) go in search of food and water, traveling a distance of around 1800 miles. Birds and other migrating animals follow the same routes each year. How do they know where to go? It depends on the species. Some animals follow landmarks, such as rivers or coastlines. Other animals are guided by the position of the sun, the usual direction of the wind, or other clues in the environment. 
Daily  Cycles 	  Many animal behaviors change at certain times of day, day after day. For example, most animals go to sleep when the sun sets and wake up when the sun rises. Animals that are active during the daytime are called diurnal. Some animals do the opposite. They sleep all day and are active during the night. These animals are called nocturnal. Examples of nocturnal animals include bats, foxes, possums, skunks and coyotes. Many mammals (including humans), insects, reptiles and birds are diurnal. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. Daily cycles of behavior are called circadian rhythms. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock. This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The 
The migration route of  Swainson’s hawk 	  starts in North America and ends in South America. Scientists learned their migration route by attaching tiny tracking devices to the birds. 
The birds were 	  then tracked by satellite. On the migration south, the hawks travel almost 5,000 miles from start to finish. signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours.

Introduction 	  Why does not having a backbone make things so complex? Invertebrates could be described as simple animals. And though some are very simple, the vastness of the invertebrate species makes this group of animals anything but simple. 
Invertebrates 	  • Distinguish between invertebrates and vertebrates. • List invertebrate phyla, and give examples of each. How are these jellyfish like an insect? Jellyfish and insects don’t seem to have much in common. They look much different. They live in very different environments. But both of these animals are classified as invertebrates. What Are Invertebrates? Animals are often identified as being either invertebrates or vertebrates. These are terms based on the skeletons of the animals. Vertebrates have a backbone made of bone or cartilage ( cartilage is a flexible supportive tissue. You have cartilage in your ear lobes.). Invertebrates, on the other hand, have no backbone ( Figure 9.1). Invertebrates live just about anywhere. There are so many invertebrates on this planet that it is impossible to count them all. There are probably billions of billions of invertebrates. They come in many shapes and sizes, live practically anywhere and provide many services that are vital for the survival of other organisms, including us. They have been observed in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, in the driest of the deserts and in the canopies of the wettest rainforests. They can even be found in the frozen Antarctic or on the deepest parts of the ocean floor. Snails are an example of invertebrates, animals without a backbone. All vertebrate organisms are in the phylum Chordata. Invertebrates, which make up about 95% (or more) of the animal kingdom, are divided into over 30 different phyla, some of which are listed below ( Table 9.1). Numerous invertebrate phyla have just a few species; some have only one described species, yet these are classified into separate phyla because of their unique characteristics. For example, sponges, with pores throughout their body, are from the phylum Porifera. Crabs and lobsters, with jointed appendages, are from the phylum Arthropoda.

Invertebrates 	  • Describe the key features of sponges. • Summarize feeding in sponges. Do animals wash your dishes? Natural sponges, like the one in the picture above, are actually animals taken from the sea! The sponges in your home, however, were most likely never living things. Most sponges used in kitchens today are made from unnatural materials. 
Sponges 	  Sponges ( Figure 9.2) are classified in the phylum Porifera, from the Latin words meaning "having pores." These pores allow the movement of water into the sponges’ sac-like bodies. Sponges must pump water through their bodies in order to eat. Because sponges are sessile, meaning they cannot move, they filter water to obtain their food. They are, therefore, known as filter feeders. Filter feeders must filter the water to separate out the organisms and nutrients they want to eat from those they do not. You might think that sponges don’t look like animals at all. They don’t have a head or legs. Internally, they do not have brains, stomachs, or other organs. This is because sponges evolved much earlier than other animals. In fact, sponges do not even have true tissues. Instead, their bodies are made up of specialized cells (cell-level organization) that do specific jobs. Other animals, including humans, have tissue-level organization because they have tissues with specific functions. Sponge cells perform a variety of bodily functions and appear to be more independent of each other than are the cells of other animals. For example, some cells control the flow of water, in and out of the sponge, by increasing or 
The sponges often have tube-like bodies 	  with many tiny pores. There are roughly decreasing the size of the pores. Sponges are characterized by a feeding system unique among animals. As sponges don’t have mouths, they must feed by some other method. Sponges have tiny pores in their outer walls through which water is drawn. Cells in the sponge walls filter food from the water as the water is pumped through the body and out other larger openings. The flow of water through the sponge is unidirectional, driven by the beating of flagella, which line the surface of chambers connected by a series of canals. Sponges reproduce by both asexual and sexual means. Sponges that reproduce asexually produce buds or, more often, structures called gemmules, which are packets of several cells of various types inside a protective covering. Freshwater sponges often produce gemmules prior to winter, which then develop into adult sponges beginning the following spring. Most sponges that reproduce sexually are hermaphroditic and produce eggs and sperm at different times. Sperm are frequently released into the water, where they are captured by sponges of the same species. The sperm are then transported to eggs, fertilization occurs and the zygotes develop into larvae. Some sponges release their larvae, where others retain them for some time. Once the larvae are in the water, they settle and develop into juvenile sponges.

Invertebrates 	  • Describe the key features of the cnidarians. • Define nematocyst. • Distinguish between a polyp and a medusa body plan. • Describe cnidarian colonies. Are corals animal, plant, or mineral? Some corals may look like rocks. But they are alive! And some corals may look like plants, but they are actually animals. Just like all other animals, they eat food to get energy. 
Cnidarians 	  Cnidarians, in the phylum Cnidaria, include organisms such as the jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones. These animals are found in shallow ocean water. You might know that these animals can give you a painful sting if you step on them. That’s because cnidarians have stinging cells known as nematocysts. Cnidarians use nematocysts to catch their food. When touched, the nematocysts release a thread of poison that can be used to paralyze prey. Cnidarians are among the simplest of the so-called "higher" organisms, but are also among the most beautiful. 
Body plan 	  The body plan of cnidarians is unique because these organisms show radial symmetry, making these animals very different from those that evolved before them. Radial symmetry means that they have a circular body plan, and any cut through the center of the animal leaves two equal halves. The cnidarians have two basic body forms: Unlike the sponges which evolved prior to cnidarians, the cnidarians are made up of true tissues. The inside of a cnidarian is called the gastrovascular cavity, a large space that helps the organism digest and move nutrients around the body. The cnidarians also have nerve tissue organized into a net-like structure, known as a nerve-net, with connected nerve cells dispersed throughout the body. Cnidarians do not have true organs, however. Reproduction is by asexual budding (polyps) or sexual formation of gametes (medusae, some polyps). The result of sexual reproduction is a larva, which can swim on its own. 
Cnidarian  Colonies 	  Some types of cnidarians are also known to form colonies. Two examples are described below. polyp is filled with air to help the colony float, while several feeding polyps hang below with tentacles. The tentacles are full of nematocysts. The Portuguese Man o’ War is known to cause extremely painful stings to swimmers and surfers who accidentally brush up against it in the water. The Portuguese Man o’ War can deliver nasty stings with its tentacles. called corals. The corals are sessile (non-moving) polyps that can use their tentacles to feed on ocean creatures that pass by. Their skeletons are made up of calcium carbonate, which is also known as limestone. Over long periods of time, their skeletons build on each other to produce large structures known as coral reefs. Coral reefs are important habitats for many different types of ocean life. Corals are colonial cnidarians.

Do worms have eyes? You might think that worms can’t see. But some worms, such as the above Dugesia flatworm, do have eyespots. These are not exactly like your eyes, however. Eyespots can only detect light in their environment. 
Flatworms 	  The word "worm" is not very scientific. But it is a word that informally describes animals (usually invertebrates) that have long bodies with no arms or legs. (Snakes are vertebrates, so they are not usually described as worms.) Worms are the first significant group of animals with bilateral symmetry, meaning that the right side of their bodies is a mirror of the left. One type of worm is the flatworm. Worms in the phylum Platyhelminthes are called flatworms because they have flattened bodies. There are more than 18,500 known species of flatworms. 
Features of  Flatworms 	  The main characteristics of flatworms ( Figure 9.4) include: 
Invertebrates 	  ity,flatworms are known as acoelomates. Digestion takes place in the gastrovascular cavity. body. Oxygen enters the pores by diffusion. the body. body. development of a head region, called cephalization, evolved at the same time as bilateral symmetry in animals. This process does not occur in cnidarians, which evolved prior to flatworms and have radial symmetry. Marine flatworms can be brightly colored, such as this one from the class Turbellaria. These worms are mostly carnivores or scavengers. 
Flatworms in the  Environment 	  Flatworms live in a variety of environments. Some species of flatworms are free-living organisms that feed on small organisms and rotting matter. These types of flatworms include marine flatworms and freshwater flatworms, such as Dugesia. Other types of flatworms are parasitic. That means they live inside another organism, called a host, in order to get the food and energy they need. For example, tapeworms have a head-like area with tiny hooks and suckers (known as the scolex) that help the worm attach to the intestines of an animal host ( Figure 9.5). There are over 11,000 species of parasitic flatworms. 
Summary 	  • Flatworms have no true body cavity and no blood vessels. • Flatworms can be free-living or parasitic. Tapeworms are parasitic flatworms. 
Tapeworms are parasitic flatworms that 	  live in the intestines of their hosts. They can be very long (left). Tapeworms attach to the intestinal wall with a head region that has hooks and suckers (right). The majority of flatworms are parasites.

Invertebrates 	  • Describe the major features of the roundworms. • Describe parasitic roundworms. What is heartworm? You may have heard that you need to protect your pets from heartworm. Heartworms are a type of roundworm. They can be parasites in cats and dogs. That means, once they infect your pet, they can cause harm. However, there are preventative treatments available. 
Roundworms 	  The word "worm" is not very scientific. This informal term describes animals (usually invertebrates) that have long bodies with no arms or legs. Worms with round, non-segmented bodies are known as nematodes or roundworms ( believe there could be over a million species of Nematodes. Nematodes are slender bilaterally symmetrical worms, typically less than 2.5 mm long. The smallest nematodes are microscopic, while free-living species can reach as much as 5 cm, and some parasitic species are larger still, reaching over a meter in length. The worm body is often covered with ridges, rings, bristles, or other distinctive structures. The radially symmetrical head of a nematode also has distinct features. The head is covered with sensory bristles and, in many cases, solid "head-shields" around the mouth region. The mouth has either three or six lips arranged around the mouth opening, which often have a series of teeth on their inner edges. Nematodes can be parasites of plants and animals. 
Features of  Roundworms 	  difference from the incomplete digestive system of flatworms. The roundworm digestive system also include a large digestive organ known as the gut. Digestive enzymes that start to break down food are produced here. There is no stomach, but there is an intestine which produces enzymes that help absorb nutrients. The last portion of the intestine forms a rectum, which expels waste through the anus. length of the body and are connected from the top to the bottom of the body. At the anterior end of the animal (the head region), the nerves branch from a circular ring which serves as the brain. The head of a nematode has a few tiny sense organs, including chemoreceptors, which sense chemicals. Though still a relatively simple structure, the nervous system of roundworms is very different from that of the cnidarian nerve net. 
Roundworms in the  Environment 	  Roundworms can be free-living organisms, but they are probably best known for their role as significant plant and animal parasites. Most Nematodes are parasitic, with over 16,000 parasitic species described. Heartworms, which cause serious disease in dogs while living in the heart and blood vessels, are a type of roundworm. Roundworms can also cause disease in humans. Elephantiasis, a disease characterized by the extreme swelling of the limbs ( Figure Most parasitic roundworm eggs or larvae are found in the soil and enter the human body when a person picks them up on the hands and then transfers them to the mouth. The eggs or larvae also can enter the human body directly through the skin. The best solution to these diseases is to try to prevent these diseases rather than treat or cure them. Diseases caused by roundworms are more common in developing countries. Many parasitic diseases caused by roundworms result from poor personal hygiene. Contributing factors may include • lack of a clean water supply, • inadequate sanitation measures, • crowded living conditions, combined with a lack of access to health care and low levels of education. 
Summary 	  • Roundworms have a body cavity with internal organs and a simple nervous system. • Roundworms can be free-living or parasitic.

Invertebrates 	  • Describe the major features of the segmented worms. • Compare flatworms, roundworms, and segmented worms. Does an earthworm have a brain? Just like you, earthworms do have a brain. Their brains are much simpler than yours, however. Earthworms’ brains allow them to sense and respond to light and touch. 
Segmented  Worms 	  When you think of worms, you probably picture earthworms. There are actually many types of worms, including flatworms, roundworms, and segmented worms. Earthworms are segmented worms. Segmented worms are in the phylum Annelida, which has over 22,000 known species. These worms are known as the segmented worms because their bodies are segmented, or separated into repeating units. Besides the earthworm, the segmented worms also include leeches and some marine worms. Most segmented worms like the earthworm, feed on dead organic matter. Leeches ( Figure 9.8), however, can live in fresh water and suck blood from their animal host. You may have noticed many earthworms in soil. Earthworms support terrestrial ecosystems both as prey and by aerating and enriching soil. 
Features of  Segmented  Worms 	  Segmented worms have a number of characteristic features. of parapodia that many species use for locomotion. 
Leeches are parasitic worms.  Notice the 	  presence of segments. hydroskeleton, a supportive structure that helps move the worm’s muscles. Only the most primitive worms (the flatworms) lack a body cavity. worms’. Earthworms, for example, have a complete digestive tract with two openings, as well as an esophagus and intestines. The circulatory system consists of paired hearts and blood vessels. Actually there are five pairs of hearts that pump blood along the two main vessels. And the nervous system consists of the brain and a ventral nerve cord. 
Comparison of  Worms 	  The following table compares the three worm phyla ( Table 9.2).

You might notice that both have a shell. That is one feature of the group they both belong to, the mollusks. Mollusks are a very diverse group. They include animals that live on land and in the ocean. With well over 100,000 species, there can be a lot of shells. What are Mollusks? When you take a walk along a beach, what do you find there? Sand, the ocean, lots of sunlight. You may also find shells. The shells you find are most likely left by organisms in the phylum Mollusca. On the beach, you can find the shells of many different mollusks ( Figure 9.9), including clams, mussels, scallops, oysters, and snails. Mollusks are invertebrates that usually have a hard shell, a mantle, and a radula. Their glossy pearls, mother of pearl, and abalone shells are like pieces of jewelry. Some mollusks, such as squid and octopus, do not have shells. 
On the beach, you can find a wide variety 	  of mollusk shells. 
Features of the  Mollusk 	  The Mollusk’s body is often divided into different parts ( Figure 9.10): into the sand, and others use it for jet-propulsion. an external shell, just like the ones you find on the beach. The shell is made of chitin, a tough, semitransparent substance. "tongue-like" structure. The radula is made mostly of chitin. Types of radulae range from structures used to scrape algae off of rocks to the beaks of squid and octopuses. This is the basic body plan of a mollusk. 
Note the mantle, gills, and radula.  Keep in 	  mind the basic body plan can differ slightly among the mollusks. 
Evolution of  Mollusks 	  Mollusks are probably most closely related to organisms in the phylum Annelida, also known as segmented worms. This phylum includes the earthworm and leech. Scientists believe these two groups are related because, when they are in the early stage of development, they look very similar. Mollusks also share features of their organ systems with segmented worms. Unlike segmented worms, however, mollusks do not have body segmentation. The basic mollusk body shape is usually quite different as well. 
Summary 	  • The mollusk body often has a head with tentacles, a muscular foot, a feeding organ called the radula, and a complete digestive tract. • Mollusks have a mantle, which often secretes an external shell. • Mollusks are most closely related to segmented worms.

Invertebrates 	  • Describe the different types of mollusks. • Distinguish gastropods from bivalves and from cephalopods. What’s the world’s largest mollusk? The colossal squid, one of the largest invertebrates, measures 14 feet in length here. Some of these squids are even larger and can grow up to almost 50 feet long! The smallest mollusks are snails that are microscopic in size. 
Types of  Mollusks 	  There are approximately 160,000 living species and probably 70,000 extinct species of mollusks. They are typically divided into ten classes, of which two are extinct. The major classes of living mollusks include gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods ( Figure 9.11). 
Gastropods 	  Gastropods include snails and slugs. They use their foot to crawl. They have a well-developed head. There are many thousands of species of sea snails and sea slugs, as well as freshwater snails, freshwater limpets, land snails and land slugs. Gastropods live in many diverse habitats, from gardens to deserts and mountains. They also live in rivers, lakes and the ocean. Most shelled gastropods have a one-piece shell that is typically coiled or spiraled, but not all gastropods have shells. Gastropods have no sense of hearing, but they can see and have a keen sense of smell. In land-based gastropods, the olfactory organs (for smell) are the most important. These are located on the tentacles. 
Bivalves 	  Bivalves include clams, scallops, oysters, and mussels. As their name implies, they have two parts of their shell, which can open and close. Bivalves live in both marine and freshwater habitats. Most bivalves have a pair of large gills that enable them to extract oxygen from the water (to breathe) and to capture food. Water is drawn into the bivalve and washes over the gills. Mucus on the gills helps capture food and cilia transfer the food particles to the mouth. Once in the mouth, food passes into the stomach to be digested. Bivalves have a mouth, heart, intestine, gills, and stomach, but no head. Bivalves have a muscular foot, which in many species such as clams, is used to anchor their body to a surface or dig down into the sand. 
Cephalopods 	  Cephalopods include the octopus and squid. They have a prominent head and a well-developed brain. Typically the foot has been modified into a set of arms or tentacles. Members of this class can change color. They can also change texture and body shape, and, and if those camouflage techniques don’t work, they can still "disappear" in a cloud of ink. Cephalopods have three hearts that pump blue blood, they’re jet powered by their muscular foot, and they’re found in all oceans of the world. Cephalopods are thought to be the most intelligent of invertebrates. They have eyes and other senses that rival those of humans. Many cephalopods are active and efficient predators. What features do you think allows for this? (left) An example of a gastropod species, the ostrich foot. (right) A Caribbean reef squid, an example of a cephalopod.

Where do pearls come from? Pearls are highly valued as gemstones. Most gemstones come from the Earth, but pearls come from living things. They are created by mollusks, such as oysters. 
Importance of  Mollusks 	  Mollusks are important in a variety of ways; they are used as food, for decoration, in jewelry, and in scientific studies. They are even used as roadbed material and in vitamin supplements. 
Mollusks as  Food 	  Edible species of mollusks include numerous species of clams, mussels, oysters, scallops, marine and land snails, squid, and octopuses. Many species of mollusks, such as oysters, are farmed in order to produce more than could be found in the wild ( Figure 9.12). Today, fisheries in Europe, Japan, and the US alone produce over 1 billion pounds of oyster meat each year. Abalone (a marine gastropod mollusk), a great delicacy, can fetch up to three hundred dollars per pound. Eating mollusks is associated with a risk of food poisoning from toxins that accumulate in molluscs under certain conditions, and many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. At certain times of the year, (usually the warmer months) many species of saltwater mollusks become very poisonous due to an algal bloom known as "red tide." The mollusks filter 
Invertebrates 	  An oyster harvest in France. feed on the tiny creatures (called dinoflagellates in the bloom) that produce the toxins. Eating shellfish during a red tide can cause serious illness and even death to humans. Tastes in molluscan food vary tremendously from one person to the next and from culture to culture; however, when it comes to a question of survival, most mollusks are edible. Some are considered delicacies such as oysters and escargot (a snail that lives in trees), while others such as the clams and mussels of freshwater ponds and streams are less likely to be consumed due to taste, but none-the-less are very edible. Land-based mollusks are also eaten. France alone consumes 5 million pounds of escargot every year. Of course, some people are allergic to mollusks and need to be careful about consuming any kind of shelled animals. 
Mollusks in  Decoration and  Jewelry 	  Two natural products of mollusks used for decorations and jewelry are pearls and nacre. A pearl is the hard, round object produced within the mantle of a living shelled mollusk. Pearls are produced by many bivalves when a tiny particle of sand or grit is trapped between the mantle and the shell. It’s as if the mollusk has a splinter. The mollusk forms a protective covering around the irritant. Most pearls used as jewelry are made by pearl oysters and freshwater mussels; most of the ones sold are cultured and not wild. Natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. The most desirable pearls are produced by oysters and river mussels. The substance used to form the pearl covering is made from the mother of pearl material that lines the interior of the shell. Mother of pearl is also known as nacre. Nacre is the iridescent inner shell layer. It can be found in buttons, watch faces, knives, guns, and jewelry. It is also used to decorate various musical instruments. 
Mollusks in  Scientific  Studies 	  Several mollusks are ideal subjects for scientific investigation of the nervous system. The giant squid has a sophisticated nervous system and a complex brain for study. The California sea slug, also called the California sea hare, is used in studies of learning and memory because it has a simple nervous system, consisting of just a few thousand large, easily identified neurons. These neurons are responsible for a variety of learning tasks. Some slug brain studies have even allowed scientists to better understand human brains. Some octopuses and squid are incredibly smart. They are capable of learning to solve problems and do mazes.

Invertebrates 	  • Give examples of echinoderms. • Discuss the major features of echinoderms. • Define radial symmetry. • Describe the water vascular system. • Summarize eating in echinoderms. What is a sea cucumber? A sea cucumber is not a vegetable! It is an invertebrate animal found in the ocean. Note the spines on this sea cucumber. The spines are a key feature of echinoderms. What are Echinoderms? You’re probably familiar with starfish and sand dollars ( Figure 9.13). They are both echinoderms. Sea urchins and sea cucumbers are also echinoderms. What’s similar between these three organisms? They all have radial symmetry. This means that the body is arranged around a central point. Echinoderms belong to the phylum Echinodermata. This phylum includes 7,000 living species. It is the largest animal phylum without freshwater or land-living members. 
Characteristics of  Echinoderms 	  As mentioned earlier, echinoderms show radial symmetry. Other key echinoderm features include an internal skeleton and spines, as well as a few organs and organ systems. Although echinoderms look like they have a hard exterior, they do not have an external skeleton. Instead, a thin outer skin covers an internal skeleton made of 
A starfish (left) and a keyhole sand dollar 	  (right), showing the radial symmetry characteristic of the echinoderms. Starfish are also known as sea stars. Another echinoderm, a sea urchin (Echinus esculentus), showing its spines. tiny plates and spines. This provides rigid support. Some groups of echinoderms, such as sea urchins ( Figure 9.14), have spines that protect the organism. Sea cucumbers use these spines to help them move. Echinoderms have a unique water vascular system. This network of fluid-filled tubes helps them to breathe, eat, and move. Therefore, they can function without gill slits. Echinoderms also have a very simple digestive system, circulatory system, and nervous system. The digestive system often leads directly from the mouth to the anus. The echinoderms have an open circulatory system, meaning that fluid moves freely in the body cavity. But echinoderms have no heart. This may be due to their simple radial symmetry a heart is not needed to pump the freely moving fluid. The echinoderm nervous system is a nerve net, or interconnected neurons with no central brain. Many echinoderms have amazing powers of regeneration. For example, some sea stars (starfish) are capable of regenerating lost arms. In some cases, lost arms have been observed to regenerate a second complete sea star! Sea cucumbers often release parts of their internal organs if they perceive danger. The released organs and tissues are then quickly regenerated. How do Echinoderms Eat? Feeding strategies vary greatly among the different groups of echinoderms. There’s no one food or technique that’s shared by all echinoderms. Different eating-methods include: 
Invertebrates 	  derms use their long arms to capture food particles floating past in the currents. both plant and animals. The sea urchin mainly feeds on algae on the coral and rocks, along with decomposing matter such as dead fish, mussels, sponges, and barnacles. soil. Sea cucumbers are deposit feeders, living on the ocean floor. They eat the tiny scrap particles that are usually abundant in the environments that they inhabit. mollusks like clams by prying apart their shells and actually placing their stomach inside the mollusk shell to digest the meat. How do Echinoderms Reproduce? Echinoderms reproduce sexually. In most echinoderms, eggs and sperm cells are released into open water, and fertilization takes place when the eggs and sperm meet. This is called external fertilization, and is typical of many marine animals. The release of sperm and eggs often occurs when organisms are in the same place at the same time. Internal fertilization takes place in only a few species. Some species even take care of their offspring, like parents! 
Summary 	  • Echinoderms show radial symmetry and have an endoskeleton and a unique water vascular system. Some have spines. • Echinoderms generally reproduce by external fertilization; regeneration is fairly common among echinoderms.

Invertebrates 	  • List several types of echinoderms. • Describe echinoderm movement. How can you find feathers in the ocean? Birds aren’t the only creatures that have feathers. One type of echinoderm, the feather star, has feathery arms. These animals don’t fly or even move much at all. They usually cling to rocks, using a root-like structure. 
Types of  Echinoderms 	  The echinoderms can be divided into two major groups: Listed below are the four main classes of echinoderms present in the Eleutherozoa Group ( Table 9.3).

Habitat 	  Echinoderms are spread all over the world at almost all depths, latitudes, and environments in the ocean. Most feather stars (crinoids) live in shallow water. In the deep ocean, sea cucumbers are common, sometimes making up No echinoderms are found in freshwater habitats or on land. This makes Echinodermata the largest animal phylum to only have ocean-based species. Do Echinoderms Move? While almost all echinoderms live on the sea floor, some sea-lilies can swim at great speeds for brief periods of time, and a few sea cucumbers are fully floating. Some echinoderms find other ways of moving. For example, crinoids attach themselves to floating logs, and some sea cucumbers move by attaching to the sides of fish. On the underside side of a sea star, there are hundreds of tiny feet usually arranged into several rows on each ray of the star. These are called tube feet, or podia, and are filled with seawater in most echinoderms. The water vascular system within the body of the animal is also filled with seawater. By expanding and contracting chambers within the water vascular system, the echinoderm can force water into certain tube feet to extend them. The animal has muscles in the tube feet, which are used to retract them. By expanding and retracting the right tube feet in the proper order, the animal can walk.

Invertebrates 	  • Describe the role of echinoderms in their ecosystems. • Explain how echinoderms are important to humans. What do sea otters eat? Sea otters are known for being playful and frisky. They are serious eaters, however! A major part of a sea otter’s diet are echinoderms, such as sea urchins. They manage to eat the soft part of the sea urchins while avoiding the huge sea urchin spines. 
Importance of  Echinoderms 	  Echinoderms are important for the ecosystem. They are also a source of food and medicine for humans. 
Ecological  Role 	  Echinoderms play numerous ecological roles. Sand dollars and sea cucumbers burrow into the sand, providing more oxygen at greater depths of the sea floor. This allows more organisms to live there. In addition, starfish prevent the growth of algae on coral reefs. This allows the coral to filter-feed more easily. And many sea cucumbers provide a habitat for parasites such as crabs, worms, and snails. Echinoderms are also an important step in the ocean food chain. Echinoderms are the staple diet of many animals, including the sea otter. On the other hand, echinoderms eat seaweed and keep its growth in check. Recall that the sea urchin is a grazer, mainly feeding on algae on the coral and rocks. Recently, some marine ecosystems have been overrun by seaweed. Excess seaweed can destroy entire reefs. Scientists believe that the extinction of large quantities of echinoderms has caused this destruction ( Figure 9.16). 
A large die-off of the sea urchin,  Diadema 	  antillarum, in the Caribbean Sea coincided with increases in algal growth in some areas but not others. 
Echinoderms as  Food 	  In some countries, echinoderms are considered delicacies. Around 50,000 tons of sea urchins are captured each year for food. They are consumed mostly in Japan, Peru, Spain and France. Both male and female gonads of sea urchins are also consumed. The taste is described as soft and melting, like a mixture of seafood and fruit. Sea cucumbers are considered a delicacy in some southeastern Asian countries. In China they are used as a basis for gelatinous soups and stews. 
Echinoderms as  Medicine 	  Echinoderms are also used as medicine and in scientific research. For example, some sea cucumber toxins slow down the growth rate of tumor cells, so there is an interest in using these in cancer research. Sea urchins are also model organisms used in developmental biology research. Sea urchins have been used to study the mechanisms of fertilization and egg activation, physiological processes that occur during early development, and the regulation of differentiation in the early embryo. In addition, the molecular basis of early development was studied in sea urchins. Gametes can be obtained easily, sterility is not required, and the eggs and early embryos of many commonly used species are beautifully transparent. In addition, the early development of sea urchin embryos is a highly conserved process. When a batch of eggs is fertilized, all of the resulting embryos typically develop at the same time. This makes biochemical and molecular studies of early embryos possible in the sea urchin, and has led to a number of major discoveries. 
Echinoderms in  Farming 	  The hard skeleton of echinoderms is used as a source of lime by farmers in some areas where limestone is unavailable. Lime is added to the soil to allow plants to take up more nutrients. About 4,000 tons of the animals are used each year for this purpose.

What does this lobster have in common with a wasp? You might notice that their bodies have segments. And they both have a hard outer layer. Because they share these and other features, they are both classified as arthropods. What are Arthropods? How often do you think you see an arthropod? Well, have you ever looked up close at an ant? A spider? A fly? A moth? With over a million described species (and many more yet to be described) in the phylum containing arthropods, chances are, you encounter one of these organisms every day, without even leaving your house. Arthropods are a very diverse group of animals. In fact, they are the biggest group of animals on the planet, with upwards of 5 million distinct species. 
Types of  Arthropods 	  Arthropods belong to the phylum Arthropoda, which means “jointed feet,” and includes four living subphyla. • Chelicerata, which includes spiders ( Figure 9.17), mites, and scorpions. In these animals, the first pair of appendages are often modified as fangs or pincers, and are used to manipulate food. Spiders have eight legs. • Myriapoda, which includes centipedes and millipedes. All of these animals live on land, and can have anywhere from ten to nearly 200 pairs of appendages. • Hexapoda, which includes the insects. These animals dominate the land. All hexapods have three pairs (six appendages) of walking appendages. 
Invertebrates 	  • Crustacea, which includes lobsters, crabs, barnacles, crayfish, and shrimp. These animals dominate the ocean, and usually have a set of anterior appendages that are modified as mandibles, which function in grasping, biting, and chewing food. Spiders are one type of arthropod. 
Characteristics of  Arthropods 	  Characteristics of arthropods include: tion. In addition to legs, antennas and mouth parts are considered modified appendages. to grow, arthropods shed this outer covering in a process called molting. into the body cavity where it comes in direct contact with the tissues. Hemolymph is involved with oxygen distribution. so they can absorb more oxygen. species have a tracheal system, where air sacs lead into the body from pores in the exoskeleton. These pores cover a large part of their external body surface. Others use book lungs, gills modified for breathing air, as seen in species like the coconut crab. Some areas of the legs of soldier crabs are covered with an oxygen absorbing skin. Land crabs sometimes have two different structures: one used for breathing underwater, and another used to absorb oxygen from the air. 
The blue  American lobster illustrates the 	  segmented body plan of the arthropods. 
Summary 	  • The arthropods include four living subphyla: chelicerates, including spiders, mites, and scorpions; myriapods, including centipedes and millipedes; hexapods, including insects; and crustaceans. • Arthropods are characterized by a segmented body, a hard exoskeleton, and appendages used for feeding, sensory structures, defense, and locomotion.

Invertebrates 	  • Define crustacean. • Give examples of crustaceans. • Describe the features of crustaceans. What are shrimp? Shrimp are an example of crustaceans, one group within the arthropods. Shrimp live on the ocean floor in many parts of the world. Shrimp are not only food for humans; they are also an important food source for larger marine animals. 
Crustaceans 	  Crustaceans are a large group of arthropods, consisting of almost 52,000 species. The majority of crustaceans are aquatic. Some live in the ocean, while others live in fresh water. A few groups have adapted to living on land, such as land crabs, hermit crabs, and woodlice ( Figure 9.19). Crustaceans are among the most successful animals, and can be considered the dominant aquatic animals. Though small, crustaceans are numerous enough to be the main source of energy for large ocean mammals. They are found as much in the oceans as insects are on land. 
Classes of  Crustaceans 	  Six classes of crustaceans are generally recognized ( Table 9.4). 
Mostly small, freshwater animals 	  that feed on plankton and detritus.

Crustaceans  Reproduction 	  Most crustaceans have separate sexes, so they reproduce sexually using eggs and sperm. Many land crustaceans, such as the Christmas Island red crab, mate every season and return to the sea to release the eggs. Others, such as woodlice, lay their eggs on land when the environment is damp. In some crustaceans, the females keep the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae. 
Summary 	  • Crustaceans include crabs, lobsters, shrimp, krill, and woodlice. • Features of crustaceans include an exoskeleton that may be bound together. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • URL • Distinguish centipedes from millipedes. • Describe the habitat of Myriapoda. How many legs does a centipede have? You might think that centipedes have a hundred legs. But many species of centipedes don’t have quite that many legs! The common house centipide has only 15 pairs of legs. 
Centipededs and  Millipedes 	  Centipedes and millipedes belong to the subphylum Myriapoda, which contains 13,000 species. They all live on land, which makes sense as all those legs are more adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle, as opposed to an aquatic lifestyle. The Myriapoda are divided among four classes: (1) Chilopoda (centipedes), (2) Diplopoda (millipedes), (3) Symphyla (symphylans), and (4) Pauropoda (pauropods). They range from having over 750 legs to having fewer than ten legs. They have a single pair of antennae and simple eyes. 
Invertebrates 	  Myriapoda are mostly found in moist forests, where they help to break down decaying plant material. A few live in grasslands, semi-arid habitats, or even deserts. Most myriapods are decomposers, with the majority herbivores breaking down decaying plant material, but centipedes are nighttime predators. Centipedes roam around looking for small animals to bite and eat; their prey includes insects, spiders, and other small invertebrates. If the centipede is large enough, it will even attack small vertebrates, like lizards. Although not generally considered dangerous to humans, many from this group can cause temporary blistering and discoloration of the skin. 
Centipedes 	  Centipedes ("hundred feet") ( Figure 9.21) are fast, predatory carnivores, and venomous. There are around 3,300 described species, ranging from one tiny species (less than half an inch in length) to one giant species (the Peruvian giant yellow-leg centipede or Amazonian giant centipede), which may grow larger than 12 inches. This giant centipede has been known to attack, kill and eat much larger animals, including tarantulas. Centipedes have one pair of legs per body segment, with the first pair of legs behind the head modified into a pair of fangs containing a poison gland. Many centipedes also guard their eggs and young by curling around them. Centipede. 
Millipedes 	  Most millipedes are slower than centipedes and feed on leaf litter and loose organic material. They can be distinguished from centipedes by looking at the number of legs per body segment. Millipedes have two pairs of legs per body segment, while centipedes have a single pair of legs per body segment. Millipedes protect their eggs from predators by using a nest of hard soil. Millipedes are not poisonous. They lack the pair of fangs containing a poison gland that centipedes have. 
Symphyla 	  The third class, Symphyla, contains 200 species. Symphylans resemble centipedes but are smaller and translucent. These arthropods have an elongated body, with three pairs of thoracic legs and about nine pairs of abdominal legs, giving this class 12 pairs total. Many spend their lives in soil feeding on plant roots, but some do live in trees. 
Pauropods 	  The pauropods are typically 0.5-2.0 mm long and live on all continents except Antarctica. They are usually found in soil, leaf litter, or other moist places. They feed on fungi and decaying organic matter, and are essentially harmless. Adult pauropods have 11 or 12 body segments and 9-11 pairs of legs. They also possess unique forked antennae and a distinctive pattern of movement characterized by rapid burst of movement and frequent abrupt changes in direction.

Although spiders and insects are both arthropods, a spider is not an insect. One key difference is that insects have six legs, while spiders have eight legs. 
Arachnids 	  Arachnids are a class of joint-legged invertebrates in the subphylum Chelicerata. They live mainly on land but are also found in fresh water and in all marine environments, except for the open ocean. There are over 100,000 named species, including many species of spiders, scorpions, daddy-long-legs, ticks, and mites ( Figure 9.22). There may be up to 600,000 species in total, including unknown ones. 
Characteristics of  Arachnids 	  Arachnids have the following characteristics: have three pairs of legs (six total).

Invertebrates 	  • Give examples of arthropods as food. • Discuss the roles of arthropods in their ecosystem. • Describe the importance of arthropods to humans. Are arthropods just creepy and scary? Many arthropods, such as scorpions, insects, and spiders, have a reputation of being a nuisance or even harmful. But even if they are a little scary to you, that doesn’t mean that the world would be fine without them. 
Importance of  Arthropods 	  Have you ever been startled by a bee landing on a flower? Or surprised by a swarm of pill bugs when you overturned a rock? These arthropods might seem a little scary to you, but they are actually performing important roles in the environment. Arthropods are important to the ecosystem and to humans in many ways. 
Arthropods as  Food 	  Many species of crustaceans, especially crabs, lobsters ( Figure 9.23), shrimp, prawns, and crayfish, are consumed by humans, and are now farmed on a large commercial scale. Nearly 10,000,000 tons of arthropods as food were produced in 2005. Over 70% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns. Over Insects and their grubs are at least as nutritious as meat, and are eaten both raw and cooked in many cultures. Beetles, locusts, butterflies, ants, and stinkbugs (which have an apple flavor) are insects that are regularly eaten by people in dozens of countries. In fact, there are more than 1,900 edible insect species on Earth, hundreds of which are already part of the diet of about two billion people worldwide. This is just under one of every three people worldwide, and this number should continue to grow in the future. The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects. 
Lobsters are one kind of arthropod food 	  source. 
Arthropods in  Pest  Control 	  Humans use mites to prey on unwanted arthropods on farms or in homes. Other arthropods are used to control weed growth. Populations of whip scorpions added to an environment can limit the populations of cockroaches and crickets. Millipedes also control the harmful growth of destructive fungi and bacteria. When the numbers of millipedes is low, the imbalance between predator and prey can cause harmful microorganisms to flourish, and it can became difficult to manage plagues and diseases through natural processes. Cockroaches, spiders, mites, ticks and all other insects considered as carnivorous, prey on smaller species to maintain ecological balance. Thus, communities that have a good balance of these arthropods tend to have better pest control. 
Ecological  Roles 	  Many arthropods have extremely important roles in ecosystems. Arthropods are of ecological importance because of their sheer numbers and extreme diversity. As mentioned above, bees, wasps, ants, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles are invaluable agents of pollination. Pollens and grains became accidentally attached to their chests and legs and are transferred to other agricultural crops as these animals move about, either by walking or flying. Most plants actually produce scents to send signals to insects that food (in the form of nectar) is available. Mites, ticks, centipedes, and millipedes are decomposers, meaning they break down dead plants and animals and turn them into soil nutrients. This is an important role because it supplies the plants with the minerals and nutrients 
Invertebrates 	  necessary for life. It also keeps dead material from accumulating in the environment. Plants then pass along those minerals and nutrients to the animals that eat the plants. 
Human  Uses 	  Arthropods are also invaluable to humans, as they are used in many different human-made products. Examples are: • Bees produce honey and their honeycombs contain beeswax, widely used for making candles, furniture wax and polishes, waxed papers, antiseptics, and fillings for surgical uses. • The pollens stored in honeycombs were discovered to have a rich mixture of vitamins, enzymes, and amino acids that could provide medical benefits. They were used as ingredients for supplements and medications that could provide relief for colds, asthma, and hay fever. • Silk produced by arthropods, like those produced by caterpillars to protect their cocoons, is strong enough to use and be woven into fabrics, a discovery first used in ancient China’s silk industry. • The spiders’ web was discovered as an additional material that could provide strength, and has became essential raw materials for Kevlar vests, fishing nets, surgical sutures, and adhesives, as they contained natural antiseptics.

What animals were the first to evolve wings? When someone says the word "wing," you probably think of soaring birds. Or maybe chicken wings smothered in hot sauce. But insects were actually the first animals to evolve wings. 
What are  Insects 	  Insects, with over a million described species, are the most diverse group of animals on Earth. They may be found in nearly all environments on the planet. No matter where you travel, you will see organisms from this group. Adult insects range in size from a minuscule fairy fly to a 21.9-inch-long stick insect ( Figure 9.24). 
Characteristics of  Insects 	  Characteristics of Insects include: • Segmented bodies with an exoskeleton. The outer layer of the exoskeleton is called the cuticle. It is made up of two layers. The outer layer, or exocuticle, is thin, waxy, and water-resistant. The inner layer is much thicker. The exocuticle is extremely thin in many soft-bodied insects, such as caterpillars.

A diagram of a human and an insect, comparing the three main body parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. • The segments of the body are organized into three distinct but joined units: a head, a thorax, and an abdomen ( Figure 9.25 and Table 9.6). 
Description 	  A pair of antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and three sets of appendages that form the mouthparts. Six segmented legs and two or four wings. Contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory, and reproductive structures. • A nervous system that is divided into a brain and a ventral nerve cord. • Respiration that occurs without lungs. Insects have a system of internal tubes and sacs that oxygen travels through to reach body tissues. Air is taken in through the spiracles, openings on the sides of the abdomen. • A closed digestive system, with one long enclosed coiled tube which runs lengthwise through the body, from the mouth to the anus. • A circulatory system that is simple and consists of only a single tube with openings. The tube pulses and circulates blood-like fluids inside the body cavity. • Various types of movement. Insect movement can include flight, walking, and swimming. Insects were the only invertebrates to develop the ability to fly, and this has played an important role in their success. Many adult insects use six legs for walking, and they walk in alternate triangles touching the ground. This allows the insect to walk quickly while staying stable. A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water, like water striders ( Figure 9.26). A large number of other insects also live parts of their lives underwater. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted to paddle in the water. Young dragonflies use jet propulsion, sending water out of their back end to move. A water strider utilizing water surface tension to stand on the water. 
Communication in  Insects 	  Insects use many different senses for both communicating and receiving information. The types of communication that are used by various insects are summarized below ( Table 9.7). 
Wide range of insects have evolved 	  chemical communication; chemicals are used to attract, repel, or provide other kinds of information; use of scents is especially well developed in social insects. 
Reproduction and predation:  Some 	  species produce flashes to attract mates; other species to attract prey. 
Loudest 	  sounds among insects; have special muscles to produce sounds. Predation: moths to warn bats. 
Produced mostly by 	  Antennae of males ( Figure 9.27) can detect pheromones (chemicals released by animals that influence the behavior of others within the same species) of female moths over distances of many miles. Honey bees are the only invertebrates to have evolved this type of communication; length of dance represents distance to be flown.

Insects are  Social 	  Social insects, such as termites, ants, and many bees and wasps ( Figure 9.28), are the most familiar social species. They live together in large, well-organized colonies. Only those insects which live in nests or colonies can home. 
Invertebrates 	  Homing means that an insect can return to a single hole among many other apparently identical holes, even after a long trip or after a long time. A few insects migrate in groups. For example, the monarch butterfly flies between Mexico and North America each spring and fall ( Figure 9.28). (left) Damage to this nest brings the workers and soldiers of this social insect, the termite, to repair it. (center) A wasp building its nest. (right) Monarch butterflies in an overwintering cluster. 
Two  Major  Groups of  Insects 	  Insects are divided into two major groups: Mayflies; dragonflies and damselflies; stoneflies; webspinners; angel insects; earwigs; grasshoppers, crickets, and katydids; stick insects; ice-crawlers and gladiators; cockroaches and termites; mantids; lice; thrips; true bugs, aphids, and cicadas; wasps, bees, and ants; beetles; twisted-winged parasites; snakeflies; alderflies and dobsonflies; lacewings and antlions; hangingflies (including fleas); true flies; caddisflies; and butterflies, moths, and skippers. 
Summary 	  • Characteristics of insects include segmented bodies, a system of internal tubes and sacs through which oxygen travels, and a simple circulatory system. • Insects use many types of communication, including bioluminescence, sounds, and phermones. • Some insects are social and live in groups.

Invertebrates 	  • Distinguish methods of insect eating. • Define proboscis. • Explain sponging. How do butterflies eat? You might have seen butterflies searching for food on a flower before. They have long, tube-like mouthparts that can reach deep within a flower. The butterfly uses this mouth-tube to siphon nectar from the flower, as if sucking through a straw. 
Insect  Food 	  What do insets eat? Practically anything they want. There are so many different insects, that among all of them, no potential food is safe. Lots of insects eat plants, some insects eat other insects, and some even drink blood. Many insects eat nectar from plants. And some insects will eat whatever scraps of food you leave lying around. A few insects, such as mayflies and some moths, never eat. That’s because their lives are over in just a few hours or days. Once these insects become adults, they lay eggs, and then die. On the other hand, some insects are very healthy eaters. A silkworm eats enough leaves to increase its weight more than 4,000 times in just 56 days, as the silkworm increases in size about 10,000 times since birth. A locust eats its own weight in plants every day. Just imagine eating your own weight in food every day. You probably couldn’t. You would most likely get very sick even if you tried. How do Insects Eat? Insects eat in many different ways and they eat a huge range of foods. Around half are plant-eaters, feeding on leaves, roots, seeds, nectar, or wood. Aphids and leafhoppers suck up the sap from plants. Praying mantises are predators, hunting other small creatures, including insects like moths, caterpillars, flies, beetles, and spiders. Insects like mosquitoes and aphids have special mouthparts that help them pierce and suck. Others, like assassin bugs ( or blood of larger animals without killing them. Insects have different types of appendages (arms and legs) adapted for capturing and feeding on prey. They also have special senses that help them detect prey. Furthermore, insects have a wide range of mouthparts used for feeding. An assassin bug feasts on a beetle. Examples of chewing insects include dragonflies, grasshoppers, and beetles. These insects use one pair of jaws to bite off bits of food and grind them down. Another pair of jaws helps to push the food down the throat. Some larvae also have chewing mouthparts, as in the caterpillar stages of moths and butterflies ( Figure 9.30). Caterpillar feeding on a host plant. Some insects use siphoning, as if sucking through a straw, like moths and butterflies. This long mouth-tube that they use to suck up the nectar of the flower is called a proboscis. Some moths, however, have no mouthparts at all. Some insects obtain food by sponging, like the housefly. Sponging means that the mouthpart can absorb liquid food and 
Invertebrates 	  send it to the esophagus. The housefly is able to eat solid food by releasing saliva and dabbing it over the food. As the saliva dissolves the food, the sponging mouthpart absorbs the liquid food.

What is this? These butterfly eggs look like tiny pearls on a leaf. The adult butterfly often lays her eggs on a specific type of plant. This ensures that the future caterpillars will have plenty of food to eat. 
Insect  Reproduction and  Life  Cycle 	  Most insects can reproduce very quickly within a short period of time. With a short generation time, they evolve faster and can quickly adjust to environmental changes. Most insects reproduce by sexual reproduction. The female produces eggs, which are fertilized by the male, and then the eggs are usually placed near the required food. In some insects, there is asexual reproduction during which the offspring come from a single parent. In this type of reproduction, the offspring are almost identical to the mother. This is most often seen in aphids and scale insects. With a few exceptions, all insect life begins as an egg. After leaving the egg, insects must grow and transform until reaching adulthood. Only the adult insect can mate and reproduce. The physical transformation of an insect from one stage of its life cycle to another is known as metamorphosis. 
Three  Types of  Metamorphosis 	  An insect can have one of three types of metamorphosis and life cycles ( Table 9.9). Metamorphosis describes how insects transform from an immature or young insect into an adult insect in at least two stages. Insects may undergo 
Invertebrates 	  gradual metamorphosis (incomplete), where transformation is subtle, or complete metamorphosis, where each stage of the life cycle appears quite different from the others. In some insects, there may be no true metamorphosis at all.

Invertebrates 	  • Explain the role of insects in their ecosystems. • Discuss the importance of insects to people. • Describe the use of insects as food. Would you like to try a grasshopper taco? It might seem disgusting to you, but insects are an important food source in many places across the globe. Crickets, ants, grasshoppers, and other insects are traditional foods in parts of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. 
Importance of  Insects 	  Many insects are considered to be pests by humans. However, insects are also very important for numerous reasons. 
Ecological  Importance 	  Insects can be found in every environment on Earth. While a select few insects, such as the Arctic Wooly Bear Moth, live in the harsh Arctic climate, the majority of insects are found in the warm and moist tropics. Insects have adapted to a broad range of habitats, successfully finding their own niche, because they will eat almost any substance that has nutritional value. Insects are crucial components of many ecosystems, where they perform many important functions. They aerate the soil, pollinate blossoms, and control insect and plant pests. Many insects, especially beetles, are scavengers, feeding on dead animals and fallen trees, thereby recycling nutrients back into the soil. As decomposers, insects help create top soil, the nutrient-rich layer of soil that helps plants grow. Burrowing bugs, such as ants and beetles, dig tunnels that provide channels for water, benefiting plants. Bees, wasps, butterflies, and ants pollinate flowering plants ( populations, such as aphids and caterpillars, which feed on new plant growth. Finally, all insects fertilize the soil with the nutrients from their droppings. Bees are important pollinators of flowering plants. 
Economic  Importance 	  Insects have tremendous economic importance. Some insects produce useful substances, such as honey, wax, lacquer, and silk. Honeybees have been raised by humans for thousands of years for honey. The silkworm greatly affected human history. When the Chinese used worms to develop silk, the silk trade connected China to the rest of the world. Adult insects, such as crickets, as well as insect larvae, are also commonly used as fishing bait. 
Insects as  Food 	  Insects, of course, are not just eaten by people. Insects are the sole food source for many amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, making their roles in food chains and food webs extremely important. It is possible that food webs could collapse if insect populations decline. In some parts of the world, insects are used for food by humans. Insects are a rich source of protein, vitamins, and minerals, and are prized as delicacies in many third-world countries. In fact, it is difficult to find an insect that is not eaten in one form or another by people. Among the most popular are cicadas, locusts, mantises, grubs, caterpillars, crickets, ants, and wasps. Many people support this idea to provide a source of protein in human nutrition. From South America to Japan, people eat roasted insects, like grasshoppers or beetles. 
Insects in  Medicine 	  Insects have also been used in medicine. In the past, fly larvae ( maggots) were used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene. Gangrene is caused by infection of dead flesh. Maggots only eat dead flesh, so when they are placed on the dead flesh of humans, they actually clean the wound and can prevent infection. Some hospitals still use this type of treatment.

Are ladybugs dangerous? Ladybugs won’t hurt you. But they are dangerous to some other insects! This ladybug is eating plant-harming bugs known as aphids. Since they have an appetite for aphids, ladybugs are a farmer’s friend. 
Control of  Insects 	  Though insects can be very important, some are also considered pests. Common insect pests include: Many scientists who study insects are involved in various forms of pest control. Most utilize insect-killing chemicals, but more and more rely on other methods. Ways to control insect pests are described below. 
Biological  Control 	  Biological control of pests in farming is a method of controlling pests by using other insects (or other natural predators of the pests). Biological control of insects relies on predation and parasitism. Insect predators, such as 
Invertebrates 	  Termites can destroy wooden structures. ladybugs and lacewings, consume a large number of other insects during their lifetime. If you add ladybugs to your farm or garden, they will help keep insect pests, such as aphids, under control. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions, so any control of these pests is beneficial. Ladybugs also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The larvae of many hoverfly species also feed upon aphids, with one larva consuming up to fifty aphids a day, which is about 1,000 in its lifetime. They also eat fruit tree spider mites and small caterpillars. Dragonflies are important predators of mosquitoes, and can be used to control this pest. Parasitic insects include insects such as wasps and flies that lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is then used as a food for developing larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Caterpillars also tend to be one likely target of parasitic wasps. 
Chemical  Control 	  Chemical control of pests involves the use of insecticides. Insecticides, which are also known as pesticides, are most often used to kill insects. Insecticides are chemicals that kill insects. The U.S. spends $9 billion each year on pesticides. Disadvantages to using pesticides include human, fish, and honeybee poisonings, and the contamination of meat and dairy products. When choosing to use an insecticide, there are numerous points to consider. Negative effects of the pesticide should try to be minimized. Important questions to consider include the following. • What is the chemical’s success against the target pest? Will the insecticide provide the desired level of control of the pest? If the answer is no, other methods of control should be considered. • Does the chemical have an impact on natural enemies of the pest? In large scale efforts to rid areas of mosquitoes, the insecticide used also killed the dragonfly. This effort removed a natural predator of the mosquito. This may be an unacceptable negative effect of using the insecticide. • How susceptible is the crop to insect damage? If the crop is not heavily damaged, only minor pest control may be needed. This may affect the amount or type of insecticide used. • How toxic is the chemical to the environment and humans? Some older insecticides are extremely poisonous. Keep in mind that users of these poisons have a community responsibility to minimize the contamination of the surrounding environment, as well as keeping animals, surrounding crops and humans safe. • Does using the pesticide result in the development of resistance? If so, this can make additional use of the pesticide less effective. As the resistance will be passed to future generations of the insect (which is natural selection in action), this could be considered a negative side-effect of pesticide use.

Introduction 	  What do all animals—from fish to mammals—have in common? Vertebrates. From the smallest of fish to us. One of the main features we all have in common is our backbone. Vertebrates describes main biological features of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. • Define chordate. • Explain the importance of the notochord. • Describe the features of the chordates. • Outline the classification of chordates. What do these two animals have in common with you? Notice the orange fish. Around him is another type of animal, a tunicate, in blue. Tunicates, fish, and humans seem very different from one another, but they do have some things in common. They are all chordates. 
Chordates 	  Did you know that fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals are all related? They are all chordates. Chordates are a group of animals that includes vertebrates, as well as several closely related invertebrates. Chordates (phylum Chordata) are named after a feature they all share, a notochord. A notochord is a hollow nerve cord along the back. 
Characteristics of the  Chordates 	  Chordates are defined by a set of four characteristics that are shared by these animals at some point during their development. In some chordates, all four traits are present in the adult animal and serve important functions. However, in many chordates, including humans, some traits are present only during the embryonic stage. After that, these traits may disappear. All chordates have four main traits ( Figure 10.1): animals, the nerve cord develops into the brain and spinal cord. chordates, however, they are only present during the embryonic stages and serve no apparent purpose. 
Body  Plan of a  Typical  Chordate.  The 	  body plan of a chordate includes a postanal tail, notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits. 
Classification of the  Chordates 	  The chordates are divided into nine classes. Five of the classes are the fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. There are actually five classes of marine chordates (for example, sharks are cartilaginous fish which are distinct from bony fish), and these will be discussed in additional concepts. The chordate phylum is broken down into three subphyla: (non-moving) marine animals with sack-like bodies and tubes for water movement. Urochordates have a notochord and nerve cord only during the larval stage. half-buried in the sand. Cephalochordates have a notochord and nerve cord but no backbone. In vertebrates, the notochord is typically smaller and surrounded by a backbone. 
The lancelet, an example of a chordate, is 	  found in shallow ocean waters. 
Summary 	  • Chordates are animals that have a notochord, post-anal tail, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits. • Chordates include all vertebrates and some invertebrates. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. (Note: this resource refers to human embryos as having gill slits. This is a commonly held misconception which seems to have originated in a now defunct theory by Ernst Haeckel. In the embryonic development of chordates, there is a stage where an invagination, called "gill pouches" or "pharyngeal pouches," appear in vertebrate embryos. This invagination does develop into gills in some species, but in other species the invagination develops into other structures. So, while parallels in the development of chordates are accurate, it is misleading to say human embryos have gill slits.

What animals have a backbone? You have a backbone, or vertebrate (or vertebral) column. Can you guess what other animals also have a backbone? Frogs, snakes, birds, and many other animals all have backbones. Animals that have backbones are known as vertebrates. 
Introduction to  Vertebrates 	  Vertebrates are animals with backbones. These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. 
Characteristics of  Vertebrates 	  The primary feature shared by all vertebrates is the vertebral column, or backbone. The vertebral column protects the spinal cord. Other typical vertebrate traits include: • The cranium (skull) to protect the brain. The brain is attached to the spinal cord. • An internal skeleton. The internal skeleton supports the animal, protects internal organs, and allows for movement. • A defined head region with a brain. The head region has an accumulation of sense organs. Living vertebrates range in size from a carp species, as little as 0.3 inches, to the blue whale, which can be as large as 110 feet ( Figure 10.3).

Shown below it is the smallest whale species, Hector’s dolphin (about 5 feet in length), and beside it is a human. These images are not to scale. The carp is greatly exaggerated in size and is even smaller than depicted when compared to the blue whale. 
Classification of  Vertebrates 	  Vertebrates, or subphylum Vertebrata, are all members of the phylum Chordata. Although there is some disagreement on how to classify animals, the traditional system divides the vertebrates into seven classes ( Table 10.1).

Is this animal a fish? This mudskipper might not seem like a fish. It’s not swimming in a lake or an ocean, and it appears to be using its fins like legs. Mudskippers can breathe through their skin and burrow in the mud, essentially living on land for a brief amount of time. These features are not typical of fish, and, yet, mudskippers are still classified as fish. So what features define a fish? 
Characteristics of  Fish 	  What exactly is a fish? You probably think the answer is obvious. You may say that a fish is an animal that swims in the ocean or a lake, using fins. But as we saw with the mudskipper, not all fish spend all their time in water. So how do scientists define fish? Some characteristics of fish include: mic animals are cold-blooded in that they cannot raise their body temperature on their own. This is unlike humans, whose temperature is controlled from inside the body. Fish are aquatic vertebrates, meaning they have backbones. They became a dominant form of sea life and eventually evolved into land vertebrates. There are three classes of fish: Class Agnatha (the jawless fish), Class Chondrichthyes (the cartilaginous fish), and Class Osteichthyes (the bony fish). All have the characteristics of fish in common, though there are differences unique to each class. 
The humphead or  Napoleon wrasse 	  shows some of the general traits of fish, including scales, fins, and a streamlined body. How do Fish Breathe? In order to absorb oxygen from the water, fish use gills ( Figure 10.5). Gills take dissolved oxygen from water as the water flows over the surface of the gill. Gills help a fish breathe. How Do Fish Reproduce? Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother’s body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother’s body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. How Big Are Fish? Fish range in size from the 65-foot, 75,000 pound whale shark ( Figure 10.6) to the stout infantfish, which is about about 0.31 inches (7.9 mm) long, making it also the smallest known vertebrate animal. The second-largest fish is the basking shark, which grows to about 40 feet and 8,000 pounds. Both of the large sharks may look ferocious, and would probably scare anyone who comes across one in the water, but both species are filter-feeders, and feed on tiny fish and plankton. The tiny carp species is unique in that it has the appearance of larvae, with a reduced skeleton lacking a cranium, which leaves the brain unprotected by bone. The fish lives in dark acidic waters, having a pH of Whale sharks are the largest cartilaginous fish. 
Exceptions to  Common  Fish  Traits 	  There are exceptions to many of these fish traits. For example, tuna, swordfish, and some species of shark show some warm-blooded adaptations and are able to raise their body temperature significantly above that of the water around them. Some species of fish have a slower, more maneuverable swimming style, like eels and rays ( Figure 10.7). Body shape and the arrangement of fins are highly variable, and the surface of the skin may be naked, as in moray eels, or covered with scales. Scales can be of a variety of different types. 
Why  Fish are  Important 	  How are fish important? Of course, they are used as food ( Figure 10.8). In fact, people all over the world either catch fish in the wild or farm them in much the same way as cattle or chickens. Farming fish is known as aquaculture. Fish are also caught for recreation to display in the home or in a public aquarium. 
Summary 	  • Fish are ectothermic, have a streamlined body covered with scales, and have two sets of paired fins and several unpaired fins. • To obtain fish for food, people catch fish in the wild or farm them. One of the cartilaginous fish, a stingray, shows very flexible pectoral fins connected to the head. Workers harvest catfish from the Delta Pride Catfish farms in Mississippi.

What is this organism? With this huge sucker lined with teeth, this organism might look like something out of science fiction. But this is a real fish found in the ocean, known as a lamprey. They use their teeth and sucker to bore into other fish and suck their blood. The lamprey is an example of a jawless fish. 
Jawless  Fish 	  What defines a jawless fish? You can probably guess. A jawless fish is a fish without a jaw. But there are other features that are shared by this class of organisms. Why would such an organism evolve? These fish were the first vertebrates to evolve. Logically, this makes sense, in that the vertebral column would evolve first, with the more complex jaw bones evolving later. The early jawless fish are thought to have relied on filter feeding to capture their food, and most likely would have sucked water and debris from the seafloor into their mouth, releasing water and waste out of their gills. As other sea life evolved, these jawless fish began to feed on other fish species, and are now considered a pest in their habitat. Lampreys have no natural predators. 
Features of  Jawless  Fish 	  Jawless fish are missing the following parts: Characteristics they do have include: fish. to the body’s surface. is similar to the skeleton of cartilaginous fish, which includes sharks and rays. ronment. 
Classification of  Jawless  Fish 	  Most scientists agree that the jawless fish are part of the the superclass Agnatha. They belong to the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata. There are two living groups of jawless fish, with about 100 species in total: lampreys and hagfish ( Figure 10.9). Although hagfish belong to the subphylum Vertebrata, they do not technically have vertebrae (though they do have a skull), whereas lampreys do have vertebrae. For this reason, scientists still disagree on the classification of jawless fish. A hagfish. 
Summary 	  • The jawless fish include the lampreys and the hagfish. • Jaws, fins, and stomachs are absent in the jawless fish. • Features of the jawless fish include a notochord, paired gill pouches, a pineal eye, and a two-chambered heart.

How are these organisms different? The two rays and the other fish pictured here do have a lot in common. They have streamlined bodies well suited for movement in the ocean. One difference, however, is their skeletons. The lone fish has a skeleton of bone. The rays have a skeleton of cartilage, and so they are known as cartilaginous fish. 
Cartilaginous  Fish 	  The 1,000 or so species of cartilaginous fish are subdivided into two subclasses: the first includes sharks, rays, and skates; the second includes chimaera, sometimes called ghost sharks. Fish from this group range in size from the dwarf lanternshark, at 6.3 inches, to the over 50-foot whale shark. Sharks obviously have jaws, as do the other cartilaginous fish. These fish evolved from the jawless fish. So why did fish eventually evolve to have jaws? Such an adaptation would allow fish to eat a much wider variety of food, including plants and other organisms. Other characteristics of cartilaginous fish include: • Paired fins. • Paired nostrils. • Scales. • Two-chambered hearts. • Skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone. Cartilage is supportive tissue that does not have as much calcium as bones, which makes bones rigid. Cartilage is softer and more flexible than bone. 
Blood,  Skin, and  Teeth 	  Since they do not have bone marrow (as they have no bones), red blood cells are produced in the spleen, in special tissue around the reproductive organs, and in an organ called Leydig’s organ, only found in cartilaginous fishes. The tough skin of this group of fish is covered with placoid scales, which are hard scales formed from modified teeth. The scales are covered with a hard enamel. The hard covering and the way the scales are arranged, gives the fish skin rough, sandpaper-like feel. The function of these scales is for protection against predators. The shape of sharks’ teeth differ according to their diet. Species that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense flattened teeth for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey, such as mammals, have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. Sharks continually shed and replace their teeth, with some shedding as much as 35,000 teeth in a lifetime. 
Superorders 	  The sharks, rays, and skates (which are similar to stingrays) are further broken into two superorders: Sharks are some of the most frequently studied cartilaginous fish. Sharks are distinguished by such features as: • The number of gill slits. • The number and type of fins. • The type of teeth. • The size of their jaws. • Body shape. • Their activity at night. • An elongated, toothed snout used for slashing the fish that they eat, as seen in sawsharks. • Teeth used for grasping and crushing shellfish, a characteristic of bullhead sharks. • A whisker-like organ named barbels that help sharks find food, a characteristic of carpet sharks. • A long snout (or nose-like area), characteristic of groundsharks. • Ovoviviparous reproduction, where the eggs develop inside the mother’s body after internal fertilization, and the young are born alive. This trait is characteristic of mackerel sharks. All sharks mate by internal fertilization. Some sharks then lay their eggs, others allow internal development.

Can fish have bones? Of course. Many fish have bones. They serve the same function as our bones: protection and support. Notice how the skeleton protects the fish’s brain. Also, notice the bones along the body of the fish would allow muscles to attach to aid in movement. 
Bony  Fish 	  There are about 27,000 species of bony fish ( Figure 10.11), which are divided into two classes: ray-finned fish and lobe-finned fish. Most bony fish are ray-finned. These thin fins consist of webs of skin over flexible spines. Lobe-finned fish, on the other hand, have fins that resemble stump-like appendages. 
Fins of bony fish: ray fin (left) and lobe fin 	  (right). 
Characteristics of  Bony  Fish 	  Most fish are bony fish, making them the largest group of vertebrates in existence today. They are characterized by: skin. up with or emitting gases such as oxygen. Controlling the volume of this organ helps fish control their depth. 
Ray-finned  Fish 	  Most vertebrates are ray-finned fish, with close to 27,000 known species. By comparison, there are "only" about ray-finned fish are the dominant class of vertebrates, with nearly 99% of fish falling into this category. They live in all aquatic environments, from freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams. 
Lobe-finned fish 	  The lobe-finned fish are characterized by fleshy lobed fins, as opposed to the bony fins of the ray-finned fish. There are two types of living lobe-finned fish: the coelacanths and the lungfish. The pectoral and pelvic fins have joints resembling those of tetrapod (four-limbed land vertebrates) limbs. These fins evolved into legs of amphibians, the first tetrapod land vertebrates. They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal fin of ray-finned fish. All lobe-finned fishes possess teeth covered with true enamel. The lungfish also possess both gills and lungs, solidifying this class as the ancestors of amphibians. How Big Are Bony Fish? The ocean sunfish is the most massive bony fish in the world, up to 11 feet long and weighing up to 5,070 pounds ( the giant grouper, and the goliath grouper. The long-bodied oarfish can easily be over 30 feet long, but is not nearly as massive as the ocean sunfish. In contrast, the dwarf pygmy goby measures only 0.6 inches. Fish can also be quite valuable. In January 2013, at an auction in Tokyo’s Tsukiji fish market, a 222-kilogram (489-pound) tuna caught off northeastern Japan sold for 155.4 million yen, which is $1,760,000.

What were the first land vertebrates? Amphibians! In order for water-dwelling animals to adapt to life on land, many new adaptations had to take place. First, they needed to be able to breathe air instead of obtaining oxygen from water. And fins don’t work well as legs! They needed to be able to move around well on land. 
Characteristics of  Amphibians 	  What group of animals begins its life in the water, but then spends most of its life on land? Amphibians! Amphibians are a group of vertebrates that has adapted to live in both water and on land. Amphibian larvae are born and live in water, and they breathe using gills. The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs as their lungs are not sufficient to provide the necessary amount of oxygen. There are approximately 6,000 species of amphibians. They have many different body types, physiologies, and habitats, ranging from tropical to subarctic regions. Frogs, toads, salamanders ( Figure 10.13), newts, and caecilians are all types of amphibians. 
One of the many species of amphibian is 	  this dusky salamander. How did Amphibians Adapt to Living on Land? Transition to life on land meant significant changes to both external and internal features. In order to live on land, amphibians replaced gills with another respiratory organ, the lungs. Other adaptations include: • Skin that prevents loss of water. • Eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision outside of the water. • An eardrum developed to separate the external ear from the middle ear. • A tail that disappears in adulthood (in frogs and toads). 
Classification of the  Amphibians 	  Like fish, amphibians are ectothermic vertebrates. They belong to the class Amphibia. There are three orders: Where do Amphibians Live? Most amphibians live in fresh water, not salt water. Their habitats can include areas close to springs, streams, rivers, lakes, swamps and ponds. They can be found in moist areas in forests, meadows and marshes. Amphibians can be found almost anywhere there is a source of fresh water. Although there are no true saltwater amphibians, a few can live in brackish (slightly salty) water. Some species do not need any water at all, and several species have also adapted to live in drier environments. Most amphibians still need water to lay their eggs. How do Amphibians Reproduce? Amphibians reproduce sexually. The life cycle of amphibians happens in the following stages: frogs and toads, involves a male gripping a female across her back, almost as if he is squeezing the eggs out of her. The male releases sperm over the female’s eggs as they are laid. Another method is used by salamanders, whereby the male deposits a packet of sperm onto the ground. The female then pulls it into her cloaca, a single opening for her internal organ systems. Therefore, fertilization occurs internally. By contrast, caecilians and tailed frogs use internal fertilization, just like reptiles, birds, and mammals. The male deposits sperm directly into the female’s cloaca. their evolutionary ancestors (fish). legs. Once development is complete, it can live on land. 
Summary 	  • Amphibians live in both water and on land; amphibian larvae are born and live in water, and they breathe using gills. The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs. • Adaptations for land in amphibians include protective skin and eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision outside of the water.

What has the head of a frog and the body of a lizard? A salamander! You might have mistaken it for a lizard, but lizards are very different from salamanders. Salamanders have moist skin, while lizards have dry scales on their skin. Furthermore, lizards live their entire lives on land. Salamanders must reproduce in water. 
Salamanders 	  Salamanders are characterized by slender bodies, short legs, and long tails. They are most closely related to the caecilians, little-known legless amphibians ( Figure 10.14). Most of the animals in the salamander order look like a cross between a lizard and a frog. They have moist, smooth skin like frogs and long tails like lizards. Salamanders are found in most moist or arid habitats in the Northern Hemisphere, but can also be found south of the equator. They live on all continents except Antarctica and Australia. Salamanders live in or near water or on moist ground, often in a swamp. Some species live in water most of their life, some live their entire adult life on land, and some live in both habitats. Some salamanders live in caves. These salamanders have pale skin and reduced eyes as they have adapted to living in complete darkness in underground pools of water. The reduced eyes are similar to other organisms that live in caves or underground. Salamanders are carnivorous, eating only other animals, not plants. They will eat almost any smaller animal, such as worms, centipedes, crickets, spiders, and slugs. Some will even eat small invertebrates. Finally, salamanders have the ability to grow back lost limbs, as well as other body parts. This process is known as regeneration. Salamanders have developed ways not to be eaten. Most salamanders have brightly colored, poisonous skin. The bold color tells predators not to eat the salamander. Many salamanders have glands on the back of the neck or on the tail that give off a poisonous or bad-tasting liquid. Some species can even shed their tail during an attack and grow a new one later. Some salamanders stand high on its legs and waves its tail to scare away danger. One particular salamander, the ribbed newt, has needle-like rib tips. It can squeeze its muscles to make the rib tips pierce through its skin and into its enemy, telling the predator to stay away, a feature unique among the animal kingdom. 
The marbled salamander (left) shows the 	  typical salamander body plan: slender body, short legs, long tail, and moist skin. Caecilian (right) are a type of legless amphibian most closely related to salamanders. How Do Salamanders Breathe? Different salamanders breathe in different ways. In those that have gills, breathing occurs through the gills as water passes over the gill slits. Sirens keep their gills all their lives, which allows them to breathe underwater. Species that live on land lose their gills as they grow older. These salamanders develop lungs that are used in breathing, much like breathing in mammals. Other land-living salamanders do not have lungs or gills. These are called lungless salamanders. Instead, they "breathe," or exchange gases, through their skin. This requires blood vessels that exchange gases to be spread throughout the skin. How Big Are Salamanders? Salamanders are generally small. However, some can reach a foot or more, as in the mudpuppy of North America. In Japan and China, the giant salamander reaches 6 feet and weighs up to 66 pounds ( Figure 10.15). 
Classification of  Salamanders 	  Salamanders belong to a group of approximately 500 species of amphibians. The order Urodela, containing salamanders and newts, is divided into three suborders: spend most of each year living on land. Sirens have only two legs, but the other salamander species develop four legs as adults, with fleshy toes at the end of each foot. The legs on four-legged salamanders are so short that the salamander belly drags on the ground as the animal walks. Sirens have long, strong tails that are flat to help sirens swim like a fish, with the tail swinging from side to side. 
The  Pacific giant salamander can reach 	  up to 6 feet in length and weigh up to 66 pounds.

Frog or toad? Although there is actually little difference between toads and frogs, this animal would most often be called a toad. Frogs have moist skin, while toads have dry, bumpy skin. 
Frogs and  Toads 	  Frogs and toads are amphibians in the order Anura. In terms of classification, there is actually not a big difference between frogs and toads. Frogs often have long legs that are good for hopping, skin that is smooth and moist, and special pads on their toes that help them climb. Toads are more heavyset with shorter legs, and usually have drier skin, often with warty-looking bumps. Frogs are more likely to live in or near water than toads. Frogs are found in many areas of the world, from the tropics to subarctic regions, but most species are found in tropical rainforests. Consisting of more than 5,000 species (about 88% of amphibian species are frogs), they are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Frogs range in size from less than 0.5 inches in species in Brazil and Cuba to the over 1-foot (33 cm) long goliath frog of Cameroon, which can weigh up to 7 pounds. That is 1-foot from the nose to the back of the body, not including the length of the legs. Even the largest frogs are significantly smaller than common reptiles. 
Characteristics of  Frogs 	  Adult frogs are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed finger-like parts, and the lack of a tail. They also have a three-chambered heart, as do all tetrapods except birds and mammals. Most frogs live part of the time in water and part of the time on land. They move easily on land by jumping or climbing. To become great jumpers, frogs evolved long hind legs and long ankle bones. They also have a short backbone with only ten vertebrae. Frog and toad skin hangs loosely on the body, and skin texture can be smooth, warty, or folded. Frogs and toads don’t have fur, feathers, or scales on their skin. Instead, they have a moist and permeable skin layer covered with mucous glands. Their special skin allows them to breathe through their skin in addition to using their lungs. They are vulnerable to water loss through the skin in dry conditions, which is why they need to live near water or in moist environments. The thin layer of mucous keeps the skin moist. In order to live on land and in water, frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is see-through to protect the eyes underwater, and the two other ones let them see on land. Frogs also have a tympanum, which acts like a simple ear. They are found on each side of the head. In some species, the tympanum is covered by skin. 
A tree frog.  Notice the powerful muscles 	  in the limbs and the coverings around the eyes. How do Frogs Reproduce? Frogs typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds, or lakes. Their larvae, or tadpoles, have gills, a tail, but no legs, and need to live in water. If fact, they are quite similar to a fish. Tadpoles develop into adult frogs in water ( Figure You may hear males "ribbiting," producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them. Frogs develop from tadpoles, which develop from eggs. Notice the formation of the two powerful back legs used for jumping. How Do Frogs Eat? Adult frogs are meat-eaters and eat mostly insects, spiders, slugs and worms. Larger species will eat mice, birds, and even other small reptiles and amphibians. Frogs do not have teeth on their lower jaw, so they usually swallow their food whole. Some frogs have teeth on the upper jaw that are used to hold the prey in place. Frogs and toads are responsible for keeping a large part of the world’s insect population under control. They catch these insects using their long tongue. The frog tongue is about a third the length of the frog’s body, though they can grow even longer. They can easily reach 12 inches long in an adult frog. Frog’s tongues are attached to the front of their mouths rather than at the back like humans. They release a sticky substance at the precise moment of impact with their food. When a frog catches an insect it throws its sticky tongue out of it’s mouth and wraps it around its prey. The frog’s tongue then snaps back and throws the food down its throat. This happens about as fast as a blink of your eyes.

Would you eat this? This is a plate of frog legs! Many people would view this dish as a tasty treat. As you can see, one way amphibians are important to people is that they can be used as a food source. 
Role of  Amphibians 	  Humans have used amphibians for a number of purposes for thousands of years, if not longer. Amphibians play significant roles in many food webs and are thus an important part of many ecosystems. For example, frogs keep insect populations stable. Extinction of frogs, or just significant decreases in the frog population, would probably have serious consequences for agricultural crops. Humans have also consumed amphibians, especially frogs, probably since they first ate meat. More recently, amphibians have been tremendously useful in research. 
Amphibians as  Foods 	  Amphibians play important roles in many ecosystems, especially as middle players in many food chains and food webs. In addition to consuming many worms and insects and other arthropods, and even some small reptiles and mammals and fish, they are prey for turtles and snakes, as well as some fish and birds. Tadpoles keep waterways clean by feeding on algae. Frogs are raised as a food source for humans. Frog legs are a delicacy in China, France, the Philippines, northern Greece, and the American south, especially the Frensh-speaking parts of Louisiana. Only the upper joint of the hind leg is served, which has a single bone similar to the upper joint of a chicken or turkey wing. They are commonly prepared by grilling or deep frying, sometimes breaded, though they can also be served with garlic, or turned into a soup or stew. Some estimates have well over a billion frogs harvested a year as food. That’s about one frog harvested for every seven people on the planet. 
Amphibians in  Research 	  Amphibians have long been used in scientific research, especially developmental and physiological processes, largely due to their unique ability to undergo metamorphosis, and in some species, to regenerate limbs. Amphibians are also used in cloning research. Cloning involves making identical copies of a parent organism, and the large amphibian egg helps in this process. They are also used to study embryos because their eggs lack shells, so it is easy to watch their development. The African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is a species that is studied to understand aspects of developmental biology. It is a good model organism because it is easy to raise in a lab and has a large embryo, which is easy to study ( Developing Xenopus embryos can be easily observed and studied with a basic microscope, though the eggs are large enough to see without a microscope. Because of their size, the exact developmental stage after fertilization can be easily determined. This allows proteins that are used at a specific developmental time to be collected and analyzed. Identification of Xenopus genes and proteins has allowed the identification of corresponding genes and proteins from humans. Many environmental scientists believe that amphibians, including frogs, indicate when an environment is damaged. When species of frogs begin to decline, it often indicates that there is a bigger problem within the ecosystem. This could have dramatic effects on food webs and ecosystems. 
Frog embryos are often studied to better 	  understand how development works. 
Amphibians in  Popular  Culture 	  Amphibians can be found in folklore, fairy tales, and popular culture. Numerous legends have developed over the centuries around the mystical properties of the salamander. Its name originates from the Persian words for “fire” and “within," so many of these legends are related to fire. This connection likely originates from the tendency of many salamanders to live inside rotting logs. When placed into the fire, salamanders would escape from the logs, lending to the belief that the salamander was created from flames. Unforgettable amphibians Kermit the Frog ( Figure 10.19) and his popular saying “It’s not easy being green.” Frogger, from the video game of the same name, has been teaching children about the dangers of the road and alligator-filled moats for years. And all it takes is a kiss from a princess to turn a frog into a prince, as told in The Frog Prince story. Kermit the Frog balloon is flown at the Annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

What does this chameleon have in common with a snake? Though they are both reptiles and seem very different, chameleons and snakes actually share several traits. For example, they both have skin covered in scales and are cold-blooded animals. But notice the distinct eyes and "horns" on the chameleon. Snakes don’t have these. And some chameleons have the ability to change color. 
Characteristics of  Reptiles 	  What reptiles can you name? Snakes, alligators, and crocodiles are all reptiles. Modern reptiles live on every continent except Antarctica. They range in size from the newly-discovered Jaragua Sphaero (a dwarf gecko), at 0.6 inches, to the saltwater crocodile, at up to 23 feet. There are four living orders of reptiles: A gharial crocodile (left). A tuatara (right). 
Traits of  Reptiles 	  Reptiles are tetrapods (four-legged) and ectothermic, meaning their internal temperature depends on the temperature of their environment. This is why you may see reptiles sunbathing as they use the energy from the sun to warm their bodies. Usually the sense organs of reptiles, like ears, are well developed, though snakes do not have external ears. All reptiles have advanced eyesight. Reptiles also have a sense of smell. Crocodilians, turtles, and tortoises smell like most other land vertebrates. But, some lizards, and all snakes, smell with their tongues, which is flicked out of the mouth to pick up scent molecules from the air. Reptiles also have several adaptations for living on land. They have a skin covered in scales to protect them from drying out. All reptiles have lungs to breathe air. Reptiles are also amniotes, which means their embryos are surrounded by a thin membrane. This membrane protects the embryo from the harsh conditions of living on land. Reptile eggs are also surrounded by a protective shell, which may be either flexible or inflexible. How Do Reptiles Reproduce? Most reptiles reproduce sexually, meaning there are two parents involved. In some families of lizards and one snake family, however, asexual reproduction is possible. This is when only one parent is involved in creating new life. For example, the gecko females can make tiny clones of themselves without the aid of a male. All reptiles have a cloaca, a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste, located at the base of the tail. Most reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or hard shell. These eggs can be placed anywhere as they don’t have to be in a moist environment, like the eggs of amphibians. However, not all species lay eggs, as certain species of squamates can give birth to live young. Unlike the amphibians, there are no larval stages of development. The young reptiles look like miniature versions of the adult. The young reptiles are generally left to fend for themselves. However, some reptiles provide care for their young. For example, crocodiles and alligators may defend their young from predators.

Are snakes deadly? Some snakes are poisonous, but the majority of snakes are fairly harmless if they are left alone. This rat snake is actually beneficial to humans because it eats mice and rats, keeping those populations in balance. Some related species are so tame that they are often kept as pets. 
Lizards and  Snakes 	  Lizards and snakes belong to the largest order of reptiles, Squamata. Lizards are a large group of reptiles, with nearly 
Characteristics of  Lizards and  Snakes 	  Lizards and snakes are distinguished by scales or shields and movable quadrate bones, which make it possible to open the upper jaw very wide. Quadrate bones are especially visible in snakes, because they are able to open their mouths very wide to eat large prey ( Figure 10.21). Without this ability, the snake diet would be very limited. 
Characteristics of  Lizards 	  Key features of lizards include: • Four limbs. A corn snake swallowing a mouse. • External ears. • Movable eyelids. • A short neck. • A long tail, which they can shed in order to escape from predators. • They eat insects. Vision, including color vision, is well-developed in lizards. You may have seen a lizard camouflaged to blend in with its surroundings. Since they have great vision, lizards communicate by changing the color of their bodies. They also communicate with chemical signals called pheromones. Adult lizards range from one inch in length, like some Caribbean geckos, to the nearly 10-foot-long Komodo dragon ( Figure 10.22). the largest of the A Komodo dragon, lizards, attaining a length of ten feet. Komodo dragons will eat just about anything and they often attack deer, goats, pigs, dogs and, occasionally, humans. With 40 lizard families, there is an extremely wide range of color, appearance, and size of lizards. Many lizards are capable of regenerating lost limbs or tails. Almost all lizards are carnivorous, meaning they eat animals, although most are so small that insects are their primary prey. However, some have reached sizes where they can prey on birds and mammals. On the other hand, a few species of lizards exclusively eat plants. 
Lizard  Behavior 	  Have you ever tried catching a lizard? Many lizards are good climbers or fast sprinters. Some can run on two feet, such as the collared lizard. Some, like the basilisk, can even run across the surface of water to escape danger. Many lizards can change color in response to their environments or in times of stress ( Figure 10.23). The most familiar example is the chameleon, but more subtle color changes can occur in other lizard species. 
A species of 	  lizard, showing general body form and camouflage against background. 
Legless  Lizards 	  Some lizard species, including the glass lizard and flap-footed lizards, have evolved to lose their legs, or their legs are so small that they no longer work. This provides these species an evolutionary advantage in their way of life. Legless lizards almost look like snakes, though structures leftover from earlier stages of evolution remain. For example, flap-footed lizards can be distinguished from snakes by their external ears. 
Characteristics of  Snakes 	  Snakes are different from legless lizards because they do not have eyelids, limbs, external ears, or forelimbs. The more than 2,700 species of snake can be found on every continent except Antarctica and range in size from the tiny, In order to fit inside of snakes’ narrow bodies, paired organs, such as kidneys, appear one in front of the other instead of side by side. Snakes’ eyelids are transparent “spectacle” scales which remain permanently closed. Most snakes are not venomous, but some have venom capable of causing painful injury or death to humans. However, snake venom is primarily used for killing prey rather than for self-defense. Snakes that are kept as pets can have their venom removed without affecting the health of the snake. Most snakes use specialized belly scales, which grip surfaces to move ( Figure 10.25). In the shedding of scales, known as molting, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer ( Figure 10.26). Molting replaces old and worn skin, allows the snake to grow, and helps it get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. Although different snake species reproduce in different ways, all snakes use internal fertilization, where fertilization of the egg takes place inside the female. The male uses sex organs stored in its tail to transfer sperm to the female. Most species of snakes lay eggs, and most species abandon these eggs shortly after laying them.

How do Snakes Eat? All snakes are strictly carnivorous, eating small animals including lizards, other snakes, small mammals, birds, eggs, fish, snails, or insects. Because snakes cannot bite or tear their food to pieces, prey must be swallowed whole. Therefore, the body size of a snake has a major influence on its eating habits. A snake can usually estimate in advance if a prey is too large. The snake’s jaw is unique in the animal kingdom. Snakes have a very flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached. They also have many other joints in their skull, allowing them to open their mouths wide

Other snakes kill their prey by strangling them, and still others swallow their prey whole and alive. After eating, snakes enter a resting stage, while the process of digestion takes place. The process is highly efficient, with the snake’s digestive enzymes dissolving and absorbing everything but the prey’s hair and claws!

Crocodile or Alligator? This picture is a crocodile, identified by it’s V-shaped snout. Alligators have more of a U-shaped snout. Although crocodiles and alligators have a few differences, they are very much alike and belong to the same order, Crocodilia. 
Alligators and  Crocodiles 	  Crocodilia, containing both alligators and crocodiles, is an order of large reptiles. Reptiles belonging to Crocodilia are the closest living relatives of birds. Reptiles and birds are the only known living descendants of the dinosaurs. Some would day that alligators and crocodiles actually look like small dinosaurs. Dinosaurs that evolved wings are the ancestors of birds. The basic crocodilian body plan ( Figure 10.27) is a very successful one and has changed little over time. Modern species actually look very similar to their Cretaceous ancestors of 84 million years ago. All species of crocodilians have similar body structures, including an elongated snout, powerful jaws, muscular tail, large protective scales, streamlined body, and eyes and nostrils that are positioned on top of the head. 
Characteristics of  Crocodiles 	  Crocodilians have a flexible, semi-erect posture. They can walk either in a low, sprawled “belly walk,” or hold their legs more directly underneath them to perform the “high walk.” Most other reptiles can only walk in a sprawled position. Nile crocodiles display the basic crocodilian body plan. All crocodilians have, like humans, teeth set in bony sockets. But unlike mammals, they replace their teeth throughout life. Crocodiles and gharials (large crocodilians with longer jaws) have salivary glands on their tongue, which are used to remove salt from their bodies. This helps with life in a saltwater environment. Crocodilians are often seen lying with their mouths open, a behavior called gaping. One of its functions is probably to cool them down. The crocodilian digestive system is highly adapted to their lifestyle. Crocodilians are known to swallow stones, known as gastroliths, which help digest their prey. The crocodilian stomach is divided into two chambers. The first is powerful and muscular. The other stomach is the most acidic digestive system of any animal. It can digest mostly everything from their prey, including bones, feathers, and horns! All crocodilians are carnivores. They feed on live animals such as birds, small mammals and fish. Crocodilians use several methods of attack when pursuing live prey. One approach is that of the ambush. The crocodilian lies motionless beneath the water’s surface with only their nostrils above the water line. This keeps them concealed while they watch for prey that approaches the water’s edge. The crocodilian then lunges out of the water, taking their prey by surprise and dragging it from the shoreline into deep water where the prey is killed. The sex of developing crocodilians is determined by the temperature of the eggs during incubation, when eggs are kept warm before they hatch. This means that the sex of crocodilians is not determined genetically. If the eggs are kept at a cold or a hot temperature, then their offspring may be all male or all female. To get both male and female offspring, the temperature must be kept within a narrow range. Female crocodilians care for the young after they hatch, providing them with protection until they grow large enough to defend themselves. In many species of crocodilians, the female carries her tiny offspring in her mouth. 
Evolving  More  Complex  Structures 	  Like all reptiles, crocodilians have a relatively small brain, but the crocodilian brain is more advanced than those of other reptiles. Because of their aquatic habitat, the eyes, ears, and nostrils are all located on the same "face" in a line one after the other. The crocodiles have advanced sensory organs. They see well during the day and may even have color vision, and they also have excellent night vision. A third transparent eyelid, the nictitating membrane, protects their eyes underwater. The eardrums are located behind the eyes and are covered by a movable flap of skin. This flap closes, along with the nostrils and eyes, when they dive. This prevents water from entering their external head openings. Their jaws are covered with sensory pits, which hold bundles of nerve fibers that respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water. Crocodiles can detect vibrations and small pressure changes in water. This makes it possible for them to sense prey and danger even in total darkness, and becomes very useful when the animal is submerged in the water. Like mammals and birds, and unlike other reptiles, crocodiles have a four-chambered heart. But, unlike mammals, blood with and without oxygen can be mixed. 
Summary 	  • Crocodilians swallow stones, known as gastroliths, which help digest their prey. • The sex of developing crocodilians is determined by the temperature of the eggs during incubation. • The crocodiles have advanced sensory organs, including keen eyesight, eardrums, and sensory pits that detect disturbances in the water.

What are these? This picture might look like a bunch of ping-pong balls, but actually it’s a picture of turtle eggs. Notice the soft, leathery shell that is typical of reptile eggs. 
Turtles 	  Turtles are reptiles in the order Testudines. If you have seen turtles before, what is the most noticeable thing about them? Their shells. Most turtle bodies are covered by a special shell developed from their ribs. Their shells can be bony or cartilaginous, made from a more flexible supportive tissue. About 300 species are alive today, and some are highly endangered. Like other reptiles, turtles cannot regulate their body temperature, except with behavioral means, such as burrowing underground. The major difference between turtles and tortoises is that the land dwelling ones are called tortoises and water dwelling are called turtles. Turtles are broken down into two groups, based on how they bring their neck back into their shell: 
Characteristics of  Turtles 	  Although many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater, they can also spend much of their lives on dry land and breathe air. Turtles cannot breathe in water, but can hold their breath for long periods of time. Turtles must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs. The position of a turtle’s eyes can give a clue to their natural habitat. Most turtles that spend most of their lives on land have their eyes looking down at objects in front of them. Some aquatic turtles, such as snapping turtles and soft-shelled turtles, have eyes closer to the top of the head. These species of turtles can hide from predators in shallow water, where they lie entirely submerged in water except for their eyes and nostrils. Sea turtles ( Figure 10.28) have glands near their eyes that produce salty tears, which remove excess salt taken in from the water they drink. A species of sea turtle, showing placement of eyes, shell shape, and flippers. Turtles have exceptional night vision due to the unusually large number of cells that sense light in their eyes. This allows them to be active at any time of the day. Turtles also have color vision. Turtles don’t lay eggs underwater. Turtles lay slightly soft and leathery eggs, like other reptiles. The eggs of the largest species are spherical, while the eggs of the rest are longer in shape. After internal fertilization, a female is ready to lay her eggs, she places a large numbers of eggs in holes dug into mud or sand. They are then covered and left to grow and develop by themselves. When the turtles hatch, they squirm their way to the surface and head toward the water. They need to get to the water as fast as possible before they are fed upon by animals such as seabirds, crabs, and raccoons. How do Turtles Eat? Turtles may appear slow and harmless when they are out of the water, but in the water is another story. Turtles can be either herbivores or carnivores, with most sea turtles carnivorous. Turtles have a rigid beak and use their jaws to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous, or animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. But as the turtle is not a very fast animal, and it cannot quickly turn its head to snap at prey, it does have some limitations. Sea turtles typically feed on jellyfish, sponges and other soft-bodied organisms. Some species of sea turtle with stronger jaws eat shellfish, while other species, such as the green sea turtle, do not eat any meat at all. Herbivorous turtles have serrated ridges that help them cut through tough plants. How Big Are Turtles? The largest turtle is the great leatherback sea turtle ( Figure 10.29), which can have a shell length of seven feet and can weigh more than 2,000 pounds. The only surviving giant tortoises are on the Seychelles and Galápagos Islands and can grow to over four feet in length and weigh about 670 pounds ( Figure 10.30). The smallest turtle is the speckled padloper tortoise of South Africa, measuring no more than three inches in length, and weighing about five ounces. The largest ever turtle was the know extinct Archelon genus, a Late Cretaceous sea turtle known to have been up to 15 ft long, and 16 ft wide from flipper to flipper. The closest living relative of this genus is the leatherback sea turtle. It was the giant Galápagos tortoises that Charles Darwin studied during his voyage on the Beagle, providing significant evidence that he used to support his theory of evolution. 
The leatherback turtle can reach up to 	  seven feet in length and weigh over 2,000 pounds. 
A giant tortoise can grow to over feet ft 	  in length and weigh about 670 lb. These animals can easily live over 100 years, spending their days grazing on grass, leaves, and cactus, basking in the sun, and napping nearly 16 hours each day.

What good are reptiles? There is a lot of fear surrounding snakes and other reptiles. What you might not realize is that reptiles do a lot of good. For example, snakes eat rats and other small animals. Rats can carry diseases to people, so keeping their population under control is very important. 
Importance of  Reptiles 	  Reptiles play an important role in the life of humans. In addition to playing an important role in many food chains, which keep the populations of small animals under control, reptiles serve as food, pets, and have played roles in art and culture for thousands of years. 
Reptiles as  Food 	  Reptiles are important as food sources for people: • Green iguanas, a type of large lizard, are eaten in Central America. • The tribals of Irulas from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in India are known to eat some of the snakes they catch. • Cantonese snake soup is consumed by local people in the fall to prevent colds. The soup is believed to warm up their body of those who eat it. • Cooked rattlesnake meat is commonly consumed in parts of the Midwestern United States. You can eat rattlesnake meat without worry of the poisonous venom. Other snake meat is consumed throughout the world. • Turtle soup is consumed throughout the world. 
Reptiles as  Pets 	  Reptiles also make good pets. In the Western world, some snakes, especially less aggressive species, like the ball python or corn snake, are kept as pets. Turtles, particularly small land-dwelling and freshwater turtles, are also common pets. Among the most popular are Russian tortoises, Greek spur-thighed tortoises, and terrapins. Large constrictor snakes like pythons, boa constrictors, and anacondas are powerful wild animals capable of killing an adult human, and they are commonly kept as pets. Many people don’t think this is a wise idea, as these reptiles pose dangerous threats to people, especially children. Reptiles are capable of recognizing people by voice, sight and smell; many are capable of learning. Some species actually benefit from interaction with humans. When cared for properly, all live as long or longer than mammalian pets of similar size. Having a reptile as a pet, you get to learn about everything from adaptation, behavior and the environment, to nutrition, camouflage and reproductive strategies. Learning about the natural history and proper captive care of these animals just might change your world outlook and get you thinking more about the environment as a whole. Keep in mind that if you want to have a snake as a pet, that there are no herbivorous snakes, and you must be willing to feed it a proper diet. Be prepared to feed your snake, or other reptile, mice, rats, birds’ eggs, insects, or fish. And these need to be served raw. Of course, the herbivorous reptiles, such as the green iguanas and some tortoises, are much easier to feed. They eat foods such as chopped collard greens, romaine lettuce, chopped squash and bananas. 
Reptiles in  Art and  Culture 	  Finally, reptiles play a significant role in folklore, religion, and popular culture. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped reptiles and often put lizards in their art. Snakes or serpents are connected to healing and to the Devil. Since snakes shed and then heal again, they are a symbol of healing and medicine, as shown in the Rod of Asclepius ( Figure 10.31). In Egyptian history, the Nile cobra is found on the crown of the pharaoh. This snake was worshiped as one of the gods. Reptiles have also played roles in more recent popular culture. Unforgettable reptiles include Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo, and Raphael, otherwise known as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Godzilla, one of the most famous movie reptiles who has been terrorizing Japanese cities for years. Dino, from The Flintstones is one of the more lovable television reptiles. On the other hand is Nagini from the Harry Potter series. This tremendously long snake (roughly 12 feet) is difficult to forget as she was very important to Lord Voldemort. Though her appearances are far and few between, her unwavering loyalty to the Dark Lord makes her one of the more infamous reptiles.

Can all birds fly? No, not all birds can fly. And not all birds have wings. This penguin is a good example. Their wings have evolved into flippers, adapted for swimming instead of flying. The kiwi of New Zealand is another bird without wings. 
Characteristics of  Birds 	  How many different types of birds can you think of? Robins, ostriches, hummingbirds, chickens, and eagles. All of these are birds, but they are very different from one another. There is an amazingly wide variety of birds. Like amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and fish, birds are vertebrates. What does that mean? It means they have a backbone. Almost all birds have forelimbs modified as wings, but not all birds can fly. In some birds, the wings have evolved into other structures. Birds are in the class Aves. All birds have the following key features: they are endothermic (warm-blooded), have two legs, and lay eggs. Birds range in size from the tiny two-inch bee hummingbird to the nine-foot ostrich ( Figure 10.32). With approximately 10,000 living species, birds are the most numerous vertebrates with four limbs. They live in diverse habitats around the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. 
The ostrich can reach a height of nine 	  feet! Pictured here is an ostrich with her young in the Negev Desert, southern Israel. 
Features of  Birds 	  The digestive system of birds is unique, with a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food. Birds do not have teeth. What do you think the stones do? They help them digest their food. Defining characteristics of modern birds also include: • Feathers. • High metabolism. • A four-chambered heart. • A beak with no teeth. • A lightweight but strong skeleton. • Production of hard-shelled eggs. Which of the above traits do you think might be of importance to flight? 
Adaptations for  Flight 	  In comparing birds with other vertebrates, what do you think distinguishes them the most? In most birds, flight is the obvious difference. Birds have adapted their body plan for flight: • Their skeleton is especially lightweight, with large, air-filled spaces connecting to their respiratory system. • Their neck bones are flexible. Birds that fly have a bony ridge along the breastbone that the flight muscles attach to ( Figure 10.33). This allows them to remain stable in the air as they fly. • Birds also have wings that function as an aerofoil. The surface of the aerofoil is curved to help the bird control and use the air currents to fly. Aerofoils are also found on the wings of airplanes. A bony ridge along the breastbone (green) allows birds to remain stable as they fly. What other traits do you think might be important for flight? Feathers help because they’re more lightweight than scales or fur. A bird’s wing shape and size will determine how a species flies. For example, many birds have powered flight at certain times, requiring the flapping of their wings, while at other times they soar, using up less energy ( One bird’s flight. About 60 living bird species are flightless, such as penguins, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often evolves when birds live on isolated islands. The absence of land predators might make flying no longer necessary. Other birds evolved into new niches where flying was no longer necessary. This may have been in response to limited resources. For example, the flightless cormorant can no longer fly, but its wings are now adapted to swim in the sea ( Figure 10.35). A flightless cormorant can no longer fly, but it uses its wings for swimming.

Why do peacocks have huge, bright feathers? Male peacocks use their colorful feathers to attract females. Females tend to mate with the males with the largest, brightest feathers. A large, bright tail indicates the male is healthy and likely to produce healthy offspring. You’ve probably also heard birds "sing." Eagles do aerial acrobatics and tumbling. These are other ways to attract mates. 
Reproduction in  Birds 	  How do birds reproduce? We know that chickens lay eggs. But how do they do that? It all starts with behavior aimed at attracting a mate. In birds, this will involve a type of display, usually performed by the male. Some displays are very elaborate and may include dancing, aerial flights, or wing or tail drumming. Most male birds also sing a type of song to attract females. If they are successful at attracting a female, it will lead to breeding. Birds reproduce by internal fertilization, during which the egg is fertilized inside the female. Like reptiles, birds have cloaca, or a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste. The male brings his sperm to the female cloaca. The sperm fertilizes the egg. Then the hard-shelled egg develops within the female. The hard-shelled eggs have a fluid-filled amnion, a thin membrane forming a closed sac around the embryo. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. 
Protecting  Offspring 	  Why do you think eggs come in so many different colors? Birds that make nests in the open have camouflaged eggs ( Figure 10.36). This gives the eggs protection against predation. Some species, like ground-nesting nightjars, have pale eggs, but the birds camouflage the eggs with their feathers. To protect their young, different species of birds make different nests. Birds of all types, from hummingbirds to ostriches, make nests. Many can be elaborate, shaped like cups, domes, plates, mounds, or burrows. However, some birds, like the common guillemot, do not use nests. Instead, they lay their eggs on bare cliffs. Emperor penguins do not have a nest at all; they sit on eggs to keep them warm before they hatch, a process called incubation. How else might a bird help protect its young from predators? Most species locate their nests in areas that are hidden, in order to avoid predators. Large birds, or those that nest in groups, may build nests in the open, since they are more capable of defending their young. Nest and eggs of the common moorhen, showing camouflaged eggs. 
Parental  Care 	  In birds, 90% to 95% of species are monogamous, meaning the male and female remain together for breeding for a few years or until one mate dies. Birds of all types, from parrots to eagles and falcons, are monogamous. Usually, the parents take turns incubating the eggs. Birds usually incubate their eggs after the last one has been laid. In polygamous species, where there is more than one mate, one parent does all of the incubating. The wild turkey is an example of a polygamous bird. The length and type of parental care varies widely amongst different species of birds. At one extreme, in a group of birds called the magapodes (which are chicken-like birds), parental care ends at hatching. In this case, the newlyhatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental help and can take care of itself right away. These birds are called precocial. Other precocial birds include the domestic chicken and many species of ducks and geese. At the other extreme, many seabirds care for their young for extended periods of time. For example, the chicks of the Great Frigatebird receive intensive parental care for six months, or until they are ready to fly, and then take an additional 14 months of being fed by the parents ( Figure 10.37). These birds are the opposite of precocial birds and are called altricial. In most animals, male parental care is rare. But it is very common in birds. Often both parents share tasks such as defense of territory and nest site, incubation, and the feeding of chicks. Since birds often take great care of their young, some birds have evolved a behavior called brood parasitism. This happens when a bird leaves her eggs in another bird’s nest. The host bird often accepts and raises the parasite bird’s eggs. 
Great  Frigatebird adults are known to care 	  for their young for up to 20 months after hatching, the longest in a bird species. Here, a young bird is begging for food. 
Summary 	  • Birds often use flashy displays to attract mates. • Breeding in birds is through internal fertilization, where the egg is fertilized inside the female. • Birds generally are monogamous, and both parents help to care for the young.

How are birds different? Not all birds look the same. They are obviously different in many ways. They come in all colors and sizes. They live in a variety of habitats. They eat a variety of foods. 
Diversity of  Birds 	  Turkey, hummingbird, penguin, parrot, owl and eagle. These are just some of the many different types of birds. If you just think about the birds in this list, the differences are striking. About 10,000 bird species belong to 29 different orders within the class Aves. They live and breed on all seven continents. The tropics are home to the greatest biodiversity of birds. The diversity among birds is striking. Birds can vary greatly in size and color. Some fly, some swim, some just walk or run. Some are savage carnivores, others are gentle herbivores. Some are low on the food chain, others are at the top. Birds live in a variety of different habitats. Birds that live in different habitats will encounter different foods and different predators. Birds can be carnivores (feeding on other animals), herbivores (feeding on plants), or generalists (feeding on a variety of foods). The lifestyle of the bird can affect what it looks like. For example, can you think of some examples of beaks that are adapted to the type of food a bird eats? Carnivorous birds include hawks, falcons, eagles, osprey, vultures and owls. Herbivorous birds include the goose, cockatoo and parrot. The American Crow is an example of a generalist. In addition, a specialist is a bird (or other animal) that is specially adapted to eat a certain food. An example of a specialist is a hummingbird, whose long, thin beak is excellent for reaching into flowers for nectar, but not very good for eating other foods. Waterfowl are birds that live on the water. These include ducks, geese, swans, and pelicans, to name a few. Landfowl are ground-feeding birds such as chickens and turkeys. Penguins are a group of flightless birds adapted for life in the water with flippers. Diurnal raptors are birds of prey that hunt during the day. These include falcons, eagles and hawks. Nocturnal raptors hunt during the night. These include various types of owls. Parrots are brightly colored and very intelligent. They are found in the tropics and include cockatoos, parrots, and parakeets. 
Beaks 	  The size and shape of the beak is related to the food the bird eats and can vary greatly among different birds. Parrots have down-curved, hooked bills, which are well-adapted for cracking seeds and nuts ( Figure 10.38). Hummingbirds, on the other hand, have long, thin, pointed bills, which are adapted for getting the nectar out of flowers ( Figure 10.38). Hawks, eagles, falcons and owls have a sharp, hooked beak. (left) The down-curved, hooked bill of a scarlet macaw, a large colorful parrot. (right) A long, thin and pointed bill of the hummingbird. 
Feet 	  Bird feet can also vary greatly among different birds. Some birds, such as gulls and terns and other waterfowl, have webbed feet used for swimming or floating ( Figure 10.39). Other birds, such as herons, gallinules, and rails, have four long spreading toes, which are adapted for walking delicately in the wetlands ( Figure 10.39). You can predict how the beaks and feet of birds will look depending on where they live and what type of food they eat. Flightless birds also have long legs that are adapted for running. Flightless birds include the ostrich and kiwi. Raptors have clawed feet. They also have strong legs. Hawks, eagles and falcons also have excellent vision and they hunt by sight. Owls, with excellent hearing, can hunt by that sense alone. See Wild African Vulture Birds Scavage Bones of Dead Animals at URL (left) The webbed feet of a great blackbacked gull.

Do you eat birds? If you’ve eaten a turkey or a chicken nugget, then you’ve eaten a bird! Providing a food source is just one way that birds are important to humans. In the United States, more than 230 million turkeys are consumed each year, with almost 50 million of those turkeys being eaten at Thanksgiving. 
Importance of  Birds 	  You are probably familiar with birds as food. People have always hunted birds for food. People eventually discovered that certain wild fowl (ducks, chickens, turkeys) could be tamed. This discovery led to the development of poultry, which is domesticated fowl that farmers raise for meat and eggs. Chickens are probably the oldest kinds of poultry. Chickens were domesticated in Asia at least 3,000 years ago. Since then, farmers have developed other poultry, including ducks, geese, guineafowl, pheasants, and turkeys. Around the world, people consume all these birds, and even more exotic birds, like ostriches. Today, chickens rank as the most widely raised poultry by far. Farmers throughout the world produce hundreds of millions of chickens annually for meat and eggs. Ducks and turkeys rank second and third in production worldwide. Ducks are raised for both meat and eggs. Turkeys are raised mainly for meat. Can you think of other ways that birds are important? 
Birds and  Humans 	  nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium, three nutrients essential for plant growth. carry the West Nile virus, bite young chickens and other birds, and infect them with the virus. When chickens or other birds become infected, humans may also become infected in the near future. Common bird pets include canaries, parrots, finches, and parakeets. Sometimes, people act cooperatively with birds. For example, the Borana people in Africa use birds to guide them to honey that they use in food. in art since prehistoric times, when they appeared in early cave paintings. Many young child know of Big Bird, a very large canary of Sesame Street fame. feathers are preferred because they are soft. Manufacturers often mix goose feathers with down feathers to provide extra softness. 
Birds and the  Ecosystem 	  Birds are obviously important members of many ecosystems. They are integral parts of food chains and food webs. In a woodland ecosystem for example, some birds get their food mainly from plants. Others chiefly eat small animals, such as insects or earthworms. Birds and bird eggs, in turn, serve as food for such animals as foxes, raccoons, and snakes. The feeding relationships among all the animals in an ecosystem help prevent any one species from becoming too numerous. Birds play a vital role in keeping this balance of nature. In addition to being important parts of food webs, birds play other roles within ecosystems. birds gliding through the air can easily eat hundreds of insects each day. Insect eating birds include warblers, bluebirds and woodpeckers. fertilize the sex cells and create new plants. Hummingbirds, sunbirds, and the honey-eaters are common pollinators. deposit them in new places. Fruit-eating birds include mockingbirds, orioles, finches and robins. or animals that eat or nibble on leaves, tender young shoots, or other vegetation ( Figure 10.40). Seabirds add nutrients to soil and to water with their production of guano, their dung. The kereru (left) and the kokako (right) are important browser species in New

What do you have in common with a bat? Both humans and bats have body hair, and both humans and bats can nurse their young. These are both characteristics of mammals, the class that both bats and humans belong to. 
Characteristics of  Mammals 	  What is a mammal? These animals range from bats, cats, and rats to dogs, monkeys, elephants, and whales. They walk, run, swim, and fly. They live in the ocean, fly in the sky, walk on the prairies, and run in the savanna. There is a tremendous amount of diversity within the group in terms of reproduction, habitat, and adaptation for living in those different habitats. What allows them to live in such diverse environments? They have evolved specialized traits, unlike those of any other group of animal. Mammals (class Mammalia) are endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrate animals with a number of unique characteristics. In most mammals, these include: • The presence of hair or fur. • Sweat glands. • Glands specialized to produce milk, known as mammary glands. • Three middle ear bones. • A neocortex region in the brain, which specializes in seeing and hearing. • Specialized teeth. • A four-chambered heart. There are approximately 5,400 mammalian species, ranging in size from the tiny 1-2 inch bumblebee bat to the There are three types of mammals, characterized by their method of reproduction. All mammals, except for a few, are viviparous, meaning they produce live young instead of laying eggs. The monotremes, however, have birdlike and reptilian characteristics, such as laying eggs and a cloaca. An example of a monotreme is the platypus with its birdlike beak and egg-laying characteristics. The echidnas are the only other monotreme mammals. A second type of mammal, the marsupial mammal, includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and possums. These mammals give birth to underdeveloped embryos, which then climb from the birth canal into a pouch on the front of the mother’s body, where it feeds and continues to grow. The remainder of mammals, which is the majority of mammals, are placental mammals. These mammals develop in the mother’s uterus, receiving nutrients across the placenta. Placental mammals include humans, rabbits, squirrels, whales, elephants, shrews, and armadillos. Dogs and cats, and sheep, cattle and horses are also placental mammals. Mammals are also the only animal group that evolved to live on land and then back to live in the ocean. Whales, dolphins, and porpoises have all adapted from land-dwelling creatures to a life of swimming and reproducing in the water ( Figure 10.41). Whales have evolved into the largest mammals. 
Dolphins have adapted to swimming and 	  reproducing in water. See MammalsSan Diego Kids at URL and The Cheetah Orphans at URL for additional material. Listen to They Might Be Giants Mammal at URL for a description of numerous mammal traits. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

But there are some mammals that do lay eggs. 
Mammal  Reproduction 	  You probably realize that cats, dogs, people, and other mammals don’t typically lay eggs. There are exceptions, however. Egg-laying is possible among the monotremes, mammals with birdlike and reptilian characteristics. Recall that mammals can be classified into three general groups, based on their reproductive strategy: the monotremes, the marsupials and the placental mammals. The egg-laying monotremes, such as echidnas ( Figure 10.42) and platypuses ( Figure 10.42), use one opening, the cloaca, to urinate, release waste, and reproduce, just like birds. They lay leathery eggs, similar to those of lizards, turtles, and crocodilians. Monotremes feed their young by “sweating” milk from patches on their bellies, as they lack the nipples present on other mammals. All other mammals give birth to live young and belong to one of two different categories, the marsupials and the placental mammals. A marsupial is an animal in which the embryo, which is often called a joey, is born at an immature stage. Development must be completed outside the mother’s body. Most female marsupials have an abdominal pouch or skin fold where there are mammary glands. The pouch is a place for completing the development of the baby. Although blind, without fur, and with only partially formed hind legs, the tiny newborns have well developed forelimbs with claws that enable them to climb their way into their mother’s pouch where they drink their mother’s milk and continue their development. Marsupials include kangaroos, koalas, and opossums. Other 
The echidna (right) is a member of the 	  monotremes, the most primitive order of mammals. Another monotreme, the platypus (left), like other mammals in this order, lays eggs and has a single opening for the urinary, genital, and digestive organs. marsupials are the wallaby and the Tasmanian Devil. Most marsupials live in Australia and nearby areas. ( Figure The majority of mammals are placental mammals. These are mammals in which the developing baby is fed through the mother’s placenta. Female placental mammals develop a placenta after fertilization. A placenta is a spongy structure that passes oxygen, nutrients, and other useful substances from the mother to the fetus. It also passes carbon dioxide and other wastes from the fetus to the mother. The placenta allows the fetus to grow for a long time within the mother. A marsupial mammal, kangaroo) in its abdominal pouch. this eastern gray kangaroo has a joey (young Some mammals are alone until a female can become pregnant. Others form social groups with big differences between sexes, such as size differences, a trait called sexual dimorphism. Dominant males are those that are the largest or best-armed. These males usually have an advantage in mating. They may also keep other males from mating with females within a group. This is seen in elephant seals ( Figure 10.44), and also with elk, lions and non-human primates, including the orangutans and gorillas. Male elk grow antlers, while female elk do not have antlers. Adult male lions are not only larger than females, they have a mane of long hair on the side of the face and top of the head.

To what group do rats belong? Rats are mammals, but this class can be divided into more specific groups. Rats are in a group known as rodents. Rodents are gnawing animals that include beavers, mice, and squirrels. 
Groups of  Mammals 	  Traditionally, mammals were divided into groups based on their characteristics. Scientists took into consideration their anatomy (body structure), their habitats, and their feeding habits. Mammals are divided into three subclasses and about 26 orders. Some of the groups of mammals include: strong hind limbs that provide for a bouncing method of locomotion. They are all are small to medium-sized terrestrial herbivores. growing incisors (teeth) in each of the upper and lower jaws that must be kept short by gnawing. pods, and earthworms. 
One of the subgroups of mammals is the 	  insectivores, including this shrew. mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. the hands and feet, a shortened snout, and a large brain. by a thick nail rolled around the tip of the toe. The ungulates (hoofed animals), subgroups of mammals. like the giraffe here, is one of the Mammals can also be grouped according to the adaptations they form to live in a certain habitat. For example, terrestrial mammals with leaping kinds of movement, as in some marsupials and lagomorphs, typically live in open habitats. Other terrestrial mammals are adapted for running, such as dogs or horses. Still others, such as elephants, hippopotamuses, and rhinoceroses, move slowly. Other mammals are adapted for living in trees, such as many monkeys ( Figure 10.47). Others live in water, such as manatees, whales, dolphins, and seals. Still others are adapted for flight, like bats. 
This howler monkey shows adaptations 	  for life among the trees.

Importance of  Mammals 	  Mammals play many important roles in ecosystems, and they also benefit people. 
Importance to  Ecosystems 	  Mammals have important roles in the food webs of practically every ecosystem. Mammals are important members of food chains and food webs, as grazers and predators. Mammals can feed at various levels of food chains, as herbivores, insectivores, carnivores and omnivores. Mammals also interact with other species in many symbiotic relationships. For example, bats have established mutually beneficial relationships with plants. Nectar-feeding bats receive a tasty treat from each flower, and, in return, they pollinate the flowers. That means they transfer pollen from one flower to another, allowing the plant to reproduce. Non-flying mammalian pollinators include marsupials, primates, and rodents. In most cases, these animals visit flowers to eat their nectar, and end up with pollen stuck to their bodies. When the animal visits another flower to eat the nectar, the pollen is transferred to that flower. Fruit-eating bats ( Figure 10.48) also receive food from plants. In return, they help these plants spread their seeds. When bats consume fruit, they also consume the seeds within the fruit. Then they carry the seeds in their guts to far-away locations. Zebras have been known to befriend ostriches. In this symbiotic relationship, both species benefit. The ostrich, with its terrible senses of smell and hearing and the zebra with its poor eyesight, are both able to warn the other when danger is near. The zebra can smell or hear certain dangers approaching, while the ostrich can see other dangers. Both are prepared to warn one another at a moment’s notice so they can each flee when necessary. Baboons and impala have a similar relationship. Impala are one of the most common prey species for all predators and need to be constantly alert. Impala have good hearing and eyesight, raising an alarm when danger is near. Baboons use trees to check for danger and bark an alarm when danger is sensed. What do the baboons receive? Male baboons sometimes prey on young impala soon after birth. So, though both alert others to dangers, sometimes this is not the best of relationships for young impala. Zebra and wildebeest are found together on the African savanna grazing different parts of the same grass. The zebra grazes the tougher parts of the plant, saving the softer parts for the wildebeest. A zebra will move into an area of tall grass before other herbivores and graze the grass down to the area that the wildebeest prefers. 
Bats, like this  Egyptian fruit bat, play an 	  important role in seed dispersal. 
Importance to  Humans 	  We see examples of mammals (other than people!) serving our needs everywhere. We have pets that are mammals, such as dogs and cats. Mammals are also used around the world for transport. For example, horses, donkeys, mules, or camels ( Figure 10.49) may be the primary means of transport in some parts of the world. Mammals also do work for us. Service dogs can be trained to help the disabled. These include guide dogs, which are assistance dogs trained to lead blind and visually impaired people around obstacles. Horses and elephants can carry heavy loads. Humans also use some mammals for food. For example, cows and goats are commonly raised for their milk and meat. Mammals’ more highly developed brains have made them ideal for use by scientists in studying such things as learning, as seen in maze studies of mice and rats. 
This camel provides transportation in 	  Egypt. 
Cultural  Importance 	  Mammals have also played a significant role in different cultures’ folklore and religion. For example, the grace and power of the cougar have been admired in the cultures of the native peoples of the Americas. The Inca city of Cuzco is designed in the shape of a cougar, and the thunder god of the Inca, Viracocha, has been associated with the animal. In North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of several American Indian tribes. Important mammals include Dolly the sheep, Lassie the dog, and flipper the dolphin. Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic (body) cell, using the process of nuclear transfer. Lassie was a collie dog who appeared in seven full length feature films in the 1940s and 1950s, starting with Lassie Come Home in 1943. Additional Lassie movies were made as recently as 2005. Between 1954 and 1973, the Lassie television series aired, with plenty of additional productions as recently as 2007. Flipper was a bottle nose dolphin that starred in a television series between 1964 and 1967. The most famous mammal may be King Kong, the giant gorilla that terrorized New York City in 1933 in the movie of the same name.

How are the monkey and the girl alike? Both are intelligent and can learn new things quickly. They both like to play. And they are both primates. What Are Primates? If primates are mammals, what makes them seem so different from most mammals? Primates, including humans, have several unique features. Some adaptations give primates advantages that allow them to live in certain habitats, such as in trees. Other features have allowed them to adapt to complex social and cultural situations. Primates are mostly omnivorous, meaning many primate species eat both plant and animal material. The order contains all of the species commonly related to lemurs, monkeys, and apes. The order also includes humans ( Key features of primates include: • Five fingers, known as pentadactyl. • Several types of teeth. • Certain eye orbit characteristics, such as a postorbital bar, or a bone that runs around the eye socket. • An opposable thumb, a finger that allows a grip that can hold objects. (top left) Ring-tailed lemurs. Lemurs belong to the prosimian group of primates. (top right) One of the New World monkeys, a squirrel monkey. (bottom left) Chimpanzees belong to the great apes, one of the groups of primates. (bottom right) Reconstruction of a Neanderthal man, belonging to an extinct subspecies of Homo sapiens. This subspecies of humans lived in Europe and western and central Asia from about 100,000 –40,000 BCE. What’s the difference between monkeys and apes? The easiest way to distinguish monkeys from the other primates is to look for a tail. Most monkey species have tails, but no apes or humans do. Monkeys are much more like other mammals than apes and humans are. 
Big  Brains 	  In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger compared to the rest of the brain. A larger cerebrum allows primates to develop higher levels of intelligence. Primates have the ability to learn new behaviors. They also engage in complex social interactions, such as fighting and play. 
Social  Relationships 	  Old World species, such as apes and some monkeys ( Figure 10.50 and Figure 10.51), tend to have significant size differences between the sexes. This is known as sexual dimorphism. Males tend to be slightly more than twice as heavy as females. This dimorphism may have evolved when one male had to defend many females. Old World generally refers to monkeys of Africa and Asia. New World refers to monkeys of the Americas. New World species, including tamarins (squirrel-sized monkeys) and marmosets (very small primitive monkeys) ( cooperatively raise the young and generally do not show a significant size difference between the sexes. Old World monkeys do not tend to form monogamous relationships. (left) An Old World monkey, a species of macaque, in Japan. (center) A New World species of monkey, a tamarin. (right) Another New World species of monkey, the pygmy marmoset. Where Do Non-human Primates Live? Non-human primates live mostly in Central and South America, Africa, and South Asia. Since primates evolved from animals living in trees, many modern species still live mostly in trees. Other species live on land most of the time, such as baboons ( Figure 10.52) and the Patas monkey. Only a few species live on land all of the time, such as the gelada and humans. 
Baboons are partially terrestrial.  Pictured 	  here is a mother baboon and her young. Primates live in a diverse number of forested habitats, including rain forests, mangrove forests and mountain forests to altitudes of over 9,800 feet. The combination of opposable thumbs, short fingernails, and long, inward-closing fingers has allowed some species to develop the ability to move by swinging their arms from one branch to another ( grasping ( Figure 10.53). A few species, such as the proboscis monkey, De Brazza’s monkey, and Allen’s swamp monkey, evolved webbed fingers so they can swim and live in swamps and aquatic habitats. Some species, such as the rhesus macaque and the Hanuman langur, can even live in cities by eating human garbage. (left) A gibbon shows how its limbs are modified for hanging from trees. (right)

Humans and  Primates 	  The great apes are the members of the biological family Hominidae, which includes four living genera: chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and humans. Among these four genera are just seven species, two of each except humans, which has only one species, Homo sapiens. 
Characteristics 	  The Great Apes are large, tailless primates, ranging in size from the pygmy chimpanzee, at 66-88 pounds in weight, to the gorilla, at 300-400 pounds ( Figure 10.54). In all species, the males are, on average, larger and stronger than the females. 
A  Western  Lowland gorilla, member of the 	  great apes. The gorilla is the largest of the hominids, weighing up to 309-397 lbs. Most living primate species are four-footed, but all are able to use their hands for gathering food or nesting materials. In some cases, hands are used as tools, such as when gorillas use sticks to measure the depth of water ( Figure 10.55). Chimpanzees sharpen sticks to use as spears in hunting; they also use sticks to gather food and to “fish” for termites. 
Tool using in a primate.  A gorilla uses a 	  stick to determine the water’s depth. Most primate species eat both plants and meat ( omnivorous), but fruit is the preferred food among all but humans. In contrast, humans eat a large amount of highly processed, low fiber foods, and unusual proportions of grains and vertebrate meat. As a result of our diets, human teeth and jaws are markedly smaller for our size than those of other apes. Humans may have been eating cooked food for a million years or more, so perhaps our teeth adapted to eating cooked food. Gestation (pregnancy) lasts 8-9 months and usually results in the birth of a single offspring. The young are born helpless, and thus, they need parental care for long periods of time. Compared with most other mammals, great apes have a long adolescence and are not fully mature until 8-13 years of age (longer in humans). Females usually give birth only once every few years. Gorillas and chimpanzees live in family groups of approximately five to ten individuals, although larger groups are sometimes observed. The groups include at least one dominant male, and females leave the group when they can mate. Orangutans, however, generally live alone. 
Genetic and  Behavioral  Similarities 	  Gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans have more than 97% of their DNA sequence in common. This means that a similar percent of the amino acid sequences of the proteins will be the same, resulting in many proteins with similar or identical functions. All organisms in the Hominidae communicate with some kind of language. They can also create simple cultures beyond the family or group of animals. Having a culture means that knowledge and behaviors can be passed on from generation to generation. 
Specialized  Human  Features 	  Specialized features of Homo sapiens include the following: • small front teeth (canines and incisors) and very large molars relative to other primate species, • a fully upright posture resulting in bipedalism (walking on two limbs instead of four), • shortening of the arms relative to the legs, • increased usefulness (dexterity) of the hands, • increase in brain size, especially in the frontal lobes • and a decrease in bone mass of the skull and face.

Summary 	  Vertebrates. From fish to mammals. Obviously, there is a tremendous amount of differences among these groups of species. But there also exist many similarities. Fish had to evolve first. Then they moved onto land as amphibians, but they still had to live close to the water. Then they moved farther away from the water as reptiles. Reptiles could live anywhere, and they did. Reptiles became very large and dominated life on the planet. Some reptiles evolved flight and turned into birds. Others stayed small and became mammals. When all the large reptiles were extinct, what remained? Smaller animals, including mammals, which then became the dominant form of life. in shallow ocean waters . Public Domain human .

Introduction 	  Human Biology provides an overview of the physiology of humans, from the skin inward. In addition to the skin, the skeletal, muscular, nervous, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, excretory, immune, and reproductive systems are described. • List the levels of organization in the human body. • Define cell, tissue, organ, and organ system. • Identify the four types of tissues that make up the body. • Give examples of organ systems and their functions. Do cells work together? Cells, like these nerve cells, do not work in isolation. To send orders from your brain to your legs, for example, signals pass through many nerve cells. These cells work together to perform a similar function. Just as muscle cells work together, bone cells and many other cells do as well. A group of similar cells that work together is known as a tissue. 
Organization of  Your  Body:  Cells,  Tissues,  Organs 	  Cells are grouped together to carry out specific functions. A group of cells that work together form a tissue. Your body has four main types of tissues, as do the bodies of other animals. These tissues make up all structures and Your body has four main types of tissue: nervous tissue, epithelial tissue, connective tissue, and muscle tissue. They are found throughout your body. epithelial tissue include the skin, the lining of the mouth and nose, and the lining of the digestive system. other tissues of the body. Examples include tendon, cartilage, and bone. Blood is also classified as a specialized connective tissue. nerves, the spinal cord, and the brain. 
Groups of  Tissues  Form  Organs 	  A single tissue alone cannot do all the jobs that are needed to keep you alive and healthy. Two or more tissues working together can do a lot more. An organ is a structure made of two or more tissues that work together. The heart ( Figure 11.2) is made up of the four types of tissues. The four different tissue types work together in the heart as they do in the other organs. 
Groups of  Organs  Form  Organ  Systems 	  Your heart pumps blood around your body. But how does your heart get blood to and from every cell in your body? Your heart is connected to blood vessels such as veins and arteries. Organs that work together form an organ system. Together, your heart, blood, and blood vessels form your cardiovascular system. What other organ systems can you think of? 
Organ  Systems  Work  Together 	  Your body’s 12 organ systems are shown below ( Table 11.1). Your organ systems do not work alone in your body. They must all be able to work together. For example, one of the most important functions of organ systems is to provide cells with oxygen and nutrients and to remove toxic waste products such as carbon dioxide. A number of organ systems, including the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, all work together to do this. 
Transports oxygen, hormones, and 	  nutrients to the body cells. Moves wastes and carbon dioxide away from cells. Defend against infection and disease, moves lymph between tissues and the blood stream. TABLE 11.1: (continued)

See how fast you can assemble the systems. • All Systems Go at URL • Define homeostasis. • Describe homeostasis and how it is maintained. • Distinguish negative feedback from positive feedback. How does your body react to cold? These people may be having fun in the icy water, but their bodies are struggling to react to the cold. For example, they may begin to shiver. Shivering helps the body return to a stable temperature. The body is always working to achieve stability, or homeostasis. 
Homeostasis and  Feedback  Regulation 	  When you walk outside on a cool day, does your body temperature drop? No, your body temperature stays stable at around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Even when the temperature around you changes, your internal temperature stays the same. This ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment despite a changing environment is called homeostasis. Homeostasis doesn’t just protect against temperature changes. Other aspects of your internal environment also stay stable. For example, your body closely regulates your fluid balance. You may have noticed that if you are slightly dehydrated, your urine is darker. That’s because the urine is more concentrated and less water is mixed in with it. 
Maintaining  Homeostasis 	  So how does your body maintain homeostasis? The regulation of your internal environment is done primarily through negative feedback. Negative feedback is a response to a stimulus that keeps a variable close to a set value ( Figure For example, your body has an internal thermostat. During a winter day, in your house a thermostat senses the temperature in a room and responds by turning on or off the heater. Your body acts in much the same way. When body temperature rises, receptors in the skin and the brain sense the temperature change. The temperature change triggers a command from the brain. This command can cause several responses. If you are too hot, the skin makes sweat and blood vessels near the skin surface dilate. This response helps decrease body temperature. Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. For additional information, see Homeostasis at URL . Feedback Regulation. 
If a raise in body 	  temperature (stimulus) is detected (receptor), a signal will cause the brain to maintain homeostasis (response). Once the body temperature returns to normal, negative feedback will cause the response to end. This sequence of stimulus-receptorsignal-response is used throughout the body to maintain homeostasis. 
Positive  Feedback 	  Some processes in the body are regulated by positive feedback. Positive feedback is when a response to an event increases the likelihood of the event to continue. An example of positive feedback is milk production in nursing mothers. As the baby drinks her mother’s milk, the hormone prolactin, a chemical signal, is released. The more the baby suckles, the more prolactin is released, which causes more milk to be produced. Other examples of positive feedback include contractions during childbirth. When constrictions in the uterus push a baby into the birth canal, additional contractions occur.

Why is your skin important? Some people put a lot of time and money into maintaining their skin. They may use special creams and lotions. While expensive creams may not be necessary, it is a good idea to take care of your skin. It does a lot of things for you, from protecting you from disease to sensing your environment. 
Your  Skin 	  Did you know that you see the largest organ in your body every day? You wash it, dry it, cover it up to stay warm, and uncover it to cool off. Yes, your skin is your body’s largest organ. Your skin is part of your integumentary system ( Figure 11.4), which is the outer covering of your body. The integumentary system is made up of your skin, hair, and nails. 
Skin acts as a barrier that stops water 	  and other things, like soap and dirt, from getting into your body. The skin has many important functions. The skin: • Provides a barrier. It keeps organisms that could harm the body out. It stops water from entering or leaving the body. • Controls body temperature. It does this by making sweat (or perspiration), a watery substance that cools the body when it evaporates. • Gathers information about your environment. Special nerve endings in your skin sense heat, pressure, cold, and pain. • Helps the body get rid of some types of waste, which are removed in sweat. • Acts as a sun block. A pigment called melanin blocks sunlight from getting to deeper layers of skin cells, which are easily damaged by sunlight. 
Structure of  Skin 	  Your skin is always exposed to your external environment, so it gets cut, scratched, and worn down. You also naturally shed many skin cells every day. Your body replaces damaged or missing skin cells by growing more of them. Did you know that the layer of skin you can see is actually dead? As the dead cells are shed or removed from the upper layer, they are replaced by the skin cells below them. Two different layers make up the skin: the epidermis and the dermis ( Figure 11.5). A fatty layer lies under the dermis, but it is not part of your skin. 
The  Epidermis 	  The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin. It forms the waterproof, protective wrap over the body’s surface. Although the top layer of epidermis is only about as thick as a sheet of paper, it is made up of 25 to 30 layers of cells. The epidermis also contains cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin and hair their color. Melanin-producing cells are found in the bottom layer of the epidermis. The epidermis does not have any blood vessels. The lower part of the epidermis receives blood by diffusion from blood vessels of the dermis. Skin is made up of two layers, the epidermis on top and the dermis below. The tissue below the dermis is called the hypodermis, but it is not part of the skin. 
The  Dermis 	  The dermis is the layer of skin directly under the epidermis. It is made of a tough connective tissue. The dermis contains hair follicles, sweat glands, oil glands, and blood vessels ( Figure 11.5). It also holds many nerve endings that give you your sense of touch, pressure, heat, and pain. Do you ever notice how your hair stands up when you are cold or afraid? Tiny muscles in the dermis pull on hair follicles which cause hair to stand up. The resulting little bumps in the skin are commonly called "goosebumps" ( 
Oil  Glands and  Sweat  Glands 	  Glands and hair follicles open out into the epidermis, but they start in the dermis. Oil glands ( Figure 11.5) release, or secrete an oily substance, called sebum, into the hair follicle. Sebum “waterproofs” hair and the skin surface to prevent them from drying out. It can also stop the growth of bacteria on the skin. It is odorless, but the breakdown of sebum by bacteria can cause odors. If an oil gland becomes plugged and infected, it develops into a pimple. Up to of sebum on the skin. Sweat glands ( Figure 11.5) open to the skin surface through skin pores. They are found all over the body. Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface helps to lower skin temperature. The skin also releases excess water, salts, sugars, and other wastes, such as ammonia and urea, in sweat. The Integumentary System Song can be heard at URL . Goosebumps are caused by tiny muscles in the dermis that pull on hair follicles, which causes the hairs to stand up straight. 
Summary 	  • Skin serves many functions, from acting as a barrier that keeps particles and water out of the body, to helping to cool the body. • Skin is made up of two layers, the epidermis and the dermis.

Why do you have arm hair? Hair covers much of our bodies. But why? Think of the way that you can sense something brush against your arm. Your arm hair is important in providing this type of sensation and making you aware of your environment. Also, hair can trap heat and keep your body warm. 
Hair and  Nails 	  Along with the skin, the integumentary system includes the nails and hair. Both the nails and hair contain the tough protein, keratin. The keratin forms fibers, which makes your nails and hair tough and strong. Keratin is similar in toughness to chitin, the carbohydrate found in the exoskeleton of arthropods. 
Nails 	  Nails are similar to claws in other animals. They cover the tips of fingers and toes. Fingernails and toenails both grow from nail beds. As the nail grows, more cells are added at the nail bed. Older cells get pushed away from the nail bed and the nail grows longer. There are no nerve endings in the nail. Otherwise cutting your nails would hurt a lot! Nails act as protective plates over the fingertips and toes. Fingernails also help in sensing the environment. The area under your nail has many nerve endings. These nerve endings allow you to receive more information about objects you touch. The Guinness Book of World Records began tracking record fingernail lengths in 1955. At that time the record was all nails on his left hand, the longest being his thumbnail at 4 feet 9.6 inches. The record for women is held by an American woman. The record is 28 feet (850 cm) for all nails of both hands, with the longest nail on her right thumb at 2 feet 11 inches. Since adult nails grow at about 3 mm a month (1/10 of an inch), how long would it take to grow such long nails? 
Hair 	  Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. In fact, mammals are the only animals to have hair. Hair sticks out from the epidermis, but it grows from the dermis ( Figure 11.7). Hair grows from inside the hair follicle. New cells grow in the bottom part of the hair, called the bulb. Older cells get pushed up, and the hair grows longer. The cells that make up the hair strand are dead and filled with the rope-like protein keratin. 
Hair, hair follicle, and oil glands.  The 	  oil, called sebum, helps to prevent water loss from the skin. The sebaceous gland secretes sebum, which waterproofs the skin and hair. In humans, hair grows everywhere on the body except the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands, the lips, and the eyelids (except for eyelashes). Hair grows at a rate of about half an inch (1.25 cm) each month, or about 6 inches (15 cm) a year. Hair, especially on the head, helps to keep the body warm. The air traps a layer of warm air near the skin and acts like a warm blanket. Hair can also act as a filter. Nose hair helps to trap particles in the air that may otherwise travel to the lungs. Eyelashes shield eyes from dust and sunlight. Eyebrows stop salty sweat and rain from flowing into the eye. The world’s longest documented hair, according to Guinness World Records, belongs to Xie Qiuping of China at just under 18 feet 6 inches (5.627 m) when measured on May 8, 2004. She had been growing her hair since 1973 when she was 13 years old.

Why shower every day? Of course, showering every day keeps you feeling and smelling fresh. But keeping clean is also good for your health! For example, a shower or bath washes away bacteria and viruses that could harm you. 
Keeping  Skin  Healthy 	  Your skin is your largest organ and constantly protects you from infections, so keeping your skin healthy is a good idea. 
Avoiding  Sunburn 	  Some sunlight is good for your health. Vitamin D is made in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. But getting too much sun can be unhealthy. A sunburn is a burn to the skin that is caused by overexposure to UV radiation from the sun’s rays or tanning beds. Light-skinned people, like the man pictured below ( Figure 11.8), get sunburned more quickly than people with darker skin. This is because pigments (melanin) in the skin act as a natural sunblock that help to protect the body from UV radiation. With over one million new cases each year, skin cancer, which is cancer that forms in the tissues of the skin, is the most common form of human cancer. Children and teens who have been sunburned are at a greater risk of developing skin cancer later in life. Long-term exposure to UV radiation is the leading cause of skin cancer. About 90 percent of skin cancers are linked to sun exposure. UV radiation damages the genetic material (DNA) of skin cells. This damage can cause the skin cells to grow out of control and form a tumor. Some of these tumors are very difficult to cure. For this reason you should always wear sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF), a hat, and clothing when out in the sun. 
V rays.  Getting sunburned as a child 	  or a teen, especially sunburn that causes blistering, increases the risk of developing skin cancer later in life. 
Keeping  Clean 	  Keeping your skin clean is important because dirty skin is more prone to infection. Bathing every day helps to keep your skin clean and healthy. Also, you know that taking a bath or shower helps prevent body odor. But where does body odor come from? During the day, sweat, oil, dirt, dust, and dead skin cells can build up on the skin surface. If not washed away, the mix of these materials can encourage the excess growth of bacteria. These bacteria feed on these substances and cause a smell that is commonly called body odor. 
Skin  Disorders 	  Conditions that irritate, clog or inflame your skin can cause symptoms such as redness, swelling, burning and itching. Allergies, irritants, your genetic background and certain diseases and immune system problems can cause numerous skin conditions. Many skin problems, such as acne, also affect your appearance. 
Acne 	  Your skin has tiny holes called pores that that can become blocked by oil, bacteria, dead skin and dirt. When this occurs, you may develop a pimple. Acne is a skin condition that causes pimples, and is one of the more common skin problem among teenagers. A diet high in refined sugars or carbohydrates such as bread and chips can also lead to acne. Each pore on your skin is the opening to a follicle, which is made of a hair and sebaceous gland that releases sebum. Acne may result from too much sebum produced by the follicle, dead skin cells accumulating in the pore, or bacteria built up in the pore. Cleaning your skin daily with a mild soap to remove excess oil and dirt can help prevent acne. 
Cold  Sores 	  Cold sores are red, fluid-filled blisters that appear near the mouth or on other areas of the face, usually caused by herpes simplex virus type 1. Visible sores are contagious, but herpes may be spread even when sores can’t be seen. You can catch the herpes simplex virus through kissing, sharing cosmetics, or sharing food with infected individuals. Once you catch herpes simplex virus, it can’t be cured. Even after sores have healed, the virus remains in your body, and new cold sores can appear at any time. This is not to be confused with genital herpes, which is caused by herpes simplex virus type 2. 
Canker  Sore 	  A canker sore is a mouth ulcer or sore that is open and painful. They may be on the lips or inside of the lip or cheek. Canker sores are usually white or yellowish, surrounded by red, inflamed soft tissue. A canker sore can be either a simple canker or a complex canker. A simple canker sore reemerges about three to four times every year, and is the common type in people between the ages of 10 and 20. Canker sores are not contagious and usually heal on their own within a week or two. Causes of canker sores include a viral infection, stress, hormonal fluctuations, food allergies, immune system problems, or mouth injuries.

Are bones alive? From seeing a skeleton, you might think that bones are just dead, hollow structures. But in a living person, those hollow spaces are full of living cells. Bones have a blood supply and nerves. Bones are a living tissue. 
Your  Skeleton 	  How important is your skeleton? Can you imagine your body without it? You would be a wobbly pile of muscle and internal organs, and you would not be able to move. The adult human skeleton has 206 bones, some of which are named below ( Figure 11.9). Bones are made up of living tissue. They contain many different types of tissues. Cartilage, a dense connective tissue, is found at the end of bones and is made of tough protein fibers. Cartilage creates smooth surfaces for the movement of bones that are next to each other, like the bones of the knee. Ligaments are made of tough protein fibers and connect bones to each other. Your bones, cartilage, and ligaments make up your skeletal system. The skeletal system is made up of bones, cartilage, and ligaments. The skeletal system has many important functions in your body. What bones protect the heart and lungs? What protects the brain? 
Functions of  Bones 	  Your skeletal system gives shape and form to your body, but it also plays other important roles. The main functions of the skeletal system include: • Support. The skeleton supports the body against the pull of gravity, meaning you don’t fall over when you stand up. The large bones of the lower limbs support the rest of the body when standing. • Protection. The skeleton supports and protects the soft organs of the body. For example, the skull surrounds the brain to protect it from injury. The bones of the rib cage help protect the heart and lungs. • Movement. Bones work together with muscles to move the body. • Making blood cells. Blood cells are mostly made inside certain types of bones. • Storage. Bones store calcium. They contain more calcium than any other organ. Calcium is released by the bones when blood levels of calcium drop too low. The mineral, phosphorus is also stored in bones. 
Structure of  Bones 	  Bones come in many different shapes and sizes, but they are all made of the same materials. Bones are organs, and recall that organs are made up of two or more types of tissues. The two main types of bone tissue are compact bone and spongy bone ( Figure 11.10). • Compact bone makes up the dense outer layer of bones. • Spongy bone is found at the center of the bone and is lighter and more porous than compact bone. Bones look tough, shiny, and white because they are covered by a layer called the periosteum. Many bones also contain a soft connective tissue called bone marrow in the pores of the spongy bone. Bone marrow is where blood cells are made. 
Bones are made up of different types of 	  tissues. 
Bone  Growth 	  Early in human development, the skeleton consists of only cartilage and other connective tissues. At this point, the skeleton is very flexible. As the fetus develops, hard bone begins to replace the cartilage, and the skeleton begins to harden. Not all of the cartilage, however, is replaced by bone. Cartilage remains in many places in your body, including your joints, your rib cage, your ears, and the tip of your nose. A baby is born with zones of cartilage in its bones that allow growth of the bones. These areas, called growth plates, allow the bones to grow longer as the child grows. By the time the child reaches an age of about 18 to 25 years, all of the cartilage in the growth plate has been replaced by bone. This stops the bone from growing any longer. Even though bones stop growing in length in early adulthood, they can continue to increase in thickness throughout life. This thickening occurs in response to strain from increased muscle activity and from weight-lifting exercises.

Why does his knee hurt? As you age, you might start noticing pain in your knees or elbows. These are examples of joints. Joints are the part of the skeletal system that connect your bones. Joint pain is a common problem as people age. 
Joints and  How  They  Move 	  A joint is a point at which two or more bones meet. There are three main types of joints in the body: There are eight bones that fuse together to form the cranium. The joints between these bones do not allow movement, which helps protect the brain. 
The skull has fixed joints.  Fixed joints 	  do not allow any movement of the bones, which protects the brain from injury. vertebrae ( Figure 11.12). 
The joints between your vertebrae are 	  partially movable. Movable joints are also the most common type of joint in your body. Your fingers, toes, hips, elbows, and knees all provide examples of movable joints. The surfaces of bones at movable joints are covered with a smooth layer of cartilage. The cartilage reduces friction between the bones. Ligaments often cross a joint, holding two nones together. For example, there are numerous ligaments connecting the leg bones across the knee joint. 
Types of  Movable  Joints 	  Four types of movable joints are discussed here. ples of a ball-and-socket joint include the hip ( Figure 11.13) and the shoulder. Your hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint. 
The “ball” end of one bone fits into the 	  “socket” of another bone. These joints can move in many different directions. backward. Examples of hinge joints are the knees ( Figure 11.14) and elbows. 
Hinge  Joint.  The knee joint is a hinge 	  joint. Like a door hinge, a hinge joint allows backward and forward movement. between the radius and ulna that allows you to turn the palm of your hand up and down. 
Pivot  Joint.  The joint at which the radius 	  and ulna meet is a pivot joint. Movement at this joint allows you to flip your palm over without moving your elbow joint. the other. The gliding joint in your wrist allows you to flex your wrist. It also allows you to make very small side-to-side motions. There are also gliding joints in your ankles.

Why drink milk? Milk is naturally a good source of calcium. Vitamin D is also often added to milk. Both these nutrients help build strong bones. 
Keeping  Bones and  Joints  Healthy 	  You can help keep your bones and skeletal system healthy by eating well and getting enough exercise. Weightbearing exercises help keep bones strong. Weight-bearing exercises and activities work against gravity. Such activities include basketball, tennis, gymnastics, karate, running, and walking. When the body is exercised regularly by performing weight-bearing activity, bones respond by adding more bone cells to increase their bone density. 
Eating  Well 	  Did you know that what you eat as a teenager can affect how healthy your skeletal system will be in 30, 40, and even need calcium to grow properly. If you do not get enough calcium in your diet as a teenager, your bones may become weak and break easily later in life. Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones lose mass and become more fragile than they should be. Osteoporosis also makes bones more likely to break. Two of the easiest ways to prevent osteoporosis are eating a healthy diet that has the right amount of calcium and vitamin D and to do some sort of weight-bearing exercise every day. Foods that are a good source of calcium include milk, yogurt, and cheese. Non-dairy sources of calcium include Chinese cabbage, kale, and broccoli. Many fruit juices, fruit drinks, tofu, and cereals have calcium added to them. It is recommended that teenagers get 1300 mg of calcium every day. For example, one cup (8 fl. oz.) of milk provides about 300 mg of calcium, or about 30% of the daily requirement. Other sources of calcium are pictured in the Figure 11.16. There are many different sources of calcium. Getting enough calcium in your daily diet for good bone health. is important Vitamin D is unusual since you don’t have to rely on your diet alone to get enough of this vitamin. Your skin makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Pigments in the skin act like a filter that can prevent the skin from making vitamin D. As a result, people with darker skin need more time in the sun than people with lighter skin to make the same amount of vitamin D. You can also get vitamin D from foods. Fish is naturally rich in vitamin D. In the United States, vitamin D is added to other foods, including milk, soy milk, and breakfast cereals. Teenagers are recommended to get 5 micrograms (200 IU) of vitamin D every day. A 3 1 glass of milk is fortified with about 100 IU of vitamin D. 
Bone  Fractures 	  Even though they are very strong, bones can fracture, or break. Fractures can happen at different places on a bone. They are usually caused by excess bending stress on the bone. Bending stress is what causes a pencil to break if you bend it too far. Soon after a fracture, the body begins to repair the break. The area becomes swollen and sore. Within a few days, bone cells travel to the break site and begin to rebuild the bone. It takes about two to three months before compact and spongy bone form at the break site. Sometimes the body needs extra help in repairing a broken bone. In such a case, a surgeon will piece a broken bone together with metal pins. Moving the broken pieces together will help keep the bone from moving and give the body a chance to repair the break. Below, a broken ulna has been repaired with pins ( Figure 11.17). 
The upper part of the ulna, just above the 	  elbow joint, is broken, as you can see in the X-ray to the left. The x-ray to the right was taken after a surgeon inserted a system of pins and wires across the fracture to bring the two pieces of the ulna into close proximity. 
Cartilage  Injuries 	  Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage at the ends of the bones breaks down. The break down of the cartilage leads to pain and stiffness in the joint. Decreased movement of the joint because of the pain may lead to weakening of the muscles that normally move the joint, and the ligaments surrounding the joint may become loose. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It has many contributing factors, including aging, sport injuries, fractures, and obesity. 
Ligament  Injuries 	  Recall that a ligament is a short band of tough connective tissue that connects bones together to form a joint. Ligaments can get injured when a joint gets twisted or bends too far. The protein fibers that make up a ligament can get strained or torn, causing swelling and pain. Injuries to ligaments are called sprains. Ankle sprains are a common type of sprain. 
Preventing  Injuries 	  Preventing injuries to your bones and ligaments is easier and much less painful than treating an injury. Wearing the correct safety equipment when performing activities that require such equipment can help prevent many common injuries. For example, wearing a bicycle helmet can help prevent a skull injury if you fall. Warming up and cooling down properly can help prevent ligament and muscle injuries. Stretching before and after activity also helps prevent injuries.

Does the heart have muscles? When you think of muscles, you might think of biceps and the external muscles you see in a bodybuilder. However, some muscles are found deep inside your body. The heart, for example, is a very muscular organ. It has to pump blood all around your body. 
Types of  Muscles 	  The muscular system consists of all the muscles in the body. This is the body system that allows us to move. You also depend on many muscles to keep you alive. Your heart, which is mostly muscle, pumps blood around your body. Each muscle in the body is made up of cells called muscle fibers. Muscle fibers are long, thin cells that can do something that other cells cannot do—they are able to get shorter. Shortening of muscle fibers is called contraction. Muscle fibers can contract because they are made of proteins, called actin and myosin, that form long filaments (or fibers). When muscles contract, these protein filaments slide or glide past one another, shortening the length of the cell. When your muscles relax, the length extends back to the previous position. Nearly all movement in the body is the result of muscle contraction. You can control some muscle movements. However, certain muscle movements happen without you thinking about them. Muscles that are under your conscious control are called voluntary muscles. Muscles that are not under your conscious control are called involuntary muscles. Muscle tissue is one of the four types of tissue found in animals. There are three different types of muscle in the body ( Figure 11.18): body. They can also contract involuntarily by reflexes. For example, you can choose to move your arm, but your arm would move automatically if you were to burn your finger on a stove top. This voluntary contraction begins with a thought process. A signal from your brain tells your muscles to contract or relax. Quickly contract and relax the muscles in your fingers a few times. Think about how quickly these signals must travel throughout your body to make this happen. as the esophagus, stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. These muscles push materials like food or blood through organs. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle can never be under your control. together, generating enough force to push blood throughout the body. What would happen if this muscle was under conscious or voluntary control? 
There are three types of muscles in the 	  body: cardiac, skeletal, and smooth. 
Summary 	  • Muscles that are under your conscious control are called voluntary muscles, while muscles that are not under your conscious control are called involuntary muscles. • The three types of muscles in the body include skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Three Types of Muscles at URL (4:04) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Describe how skeletal muscles and bones work together to move the body. • Compare the flexor to the extensor. • Describe functions of smooth muscle. • Explain the importance of cardiac muscle. Do muscles come in pairs? This woman is doing a stretch for the muscles on the back of her legs, the hamstrings. She also has a muscles on the front of her legs, directly opposite the hamstrings. These are the quadriceps. The hamstrings and quadriceps work together as a pair to move your legs back and forth while you run. 
Muscles,  Bones, and  Movement 	  When skeletal muscles contract, bones move. But how do muscles make your bones move? A voluntary muscles usually works across a joint. It is attached to both the bones on either side of the joint by strong cords called tendons. A tendon is a tough band of connective tissue that connects a muscle to a bone. Tendons are similar to ligaments, except that ligaments join bones to each other. Muscles move the body by contracting against the skeleton. When muscles contract, they get shorter. By contracting, muscles pull on bones and allow the body to move. Muscles can only contract. They cannot actively extend, though they can move or relax back into the non-contracted neutral position. Therefore, to move bones in opposite directions, pairs of muscles must work in opposition. Each muscle in the pair works against the other to move bones at the joints of the body. The muscle that contracts to cause a joint to bend is called the flexor. The muscle that contracts to cause the joint to straighten is called the extensor. When one muscle is contracted, the other muscle from the pair is always elongated. For example, the biceps and triceps muscles work together to allow you to bend and straighten your elbow. When you want to bend your elbow, your biceps muscle contracts ( Figure 11.19), and, at the same time, the triceps muscle relaxes. The biceps is the flexor, and the triceps is the extensor of your elbow joint. Other muscles that work together are the quadriceps and hamstrings used to bend and straighten the knee, and the pectorals and trapezius used to move the arms and shoulders forward and backward. During daily routines we do not use muscles equally. For example, we use our biceps more than our triceps due to lifting against gravity. The biceps and triceps act against one another to bend and straighten the elbow joint. To bend the elbow, the biceps contracts and the triceps relaxes. To straighten the elbow, the triceps contract and the biceps relax. 
Smooth  Muscles and  Cardiac  Muscles 	  Smooth muscles and cardiac muscles are not attached to bone. Recall that these types of muscles are under involuntary control. Smooth muscle is responsible for the contractility of hollow organs, such as blood vessels, the gastrointestinal tract, the bladder, or the uterus. Like skeletal muscles, smooth muscle fibers do contract together, causing the muscle to shorten. Smooth muscles have numerous functions, including the following. • The smooth muscle in the uterus helps a woman to push out her baby. • In the bladder, smooth muscle helps to push out urine. • Smooth muscles move food through the digestive tract. • In arteries, smooth muscle movements maintain the arteries’ diameter. • Smooth muscle regulates air flow in lungs. • Smooth muscle in the lungs helps the airways to expand and contract as necessary. • Smooth muscles in arteries and veins are largely responsible for regulation of blood pressure. Cardiac muscle also contracts and gets shorter. This muscle is found only in the heart. The sudden burst of contraction forces blood throughout your body. When the cardiac muscle relaxes, the heart fills with blood. This rhythmic contraction must continue for your whole life, luckily the heart muscle never gets tired. If your heart beats

What is aerobic exercise? When you hear the word "aerobic," an aerobics class may come to mind. But that’s just one type of aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise is any exercise that strengthens your cardiovascular system—playing basketball or swimming, for example. 
Muscles and  Exercise 	  Regular physical exercise is important in preventing lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular disease, some types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Regular exercise also improves the health of the muscular system. Muscles that are exercised are bigger and stronger than muscles that are not exercised. Exercise improves both muscular strength and muscular endurance. Muscular strength is the ability of a muscle to use force during a contraction. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle to continue to contract over a long time without getting tired. Exercises are grouped into three types depending on the effect they have on the body: • Aerobic exercises, such as cycling, walking, and running, increase muscular endurance and cardiovascular health. • Anaerobic exercises, such as weight training or sprinting, increase muscle strength. • Flexibility exercises, such as stretching, improve the range of motion of muscles and joints. Regular stretching helps people avoid activity-related injuries. 
Anaerobic  Exercise and  Muscular  Strength 	  Anaerobic exercises comprise brief periods of physical exertion and high-intensity, strength-training activities. Anaerobic exercises cause muscles to get bigger and stronger. Anaerobic exercises use a resistance against which the muscle has to work to lift or push away. The resistance can be a weight or a person’s own body weight ( Figure 
Anaerobic exercises involve the muscles 	  working against resistance. 
In this case 	  the resistance is the weight of a barbell. 
Aerobic  Exercise and  Muscular  Endurance 	  Aerobic exercises are exercises in which a low to moderate level of exertion can be sustained over long periods. These are exercises that cause your heart to beat faster and allow your muscles to use oxygen to contract. If you exercise aerobically, overtime, your muscles will not get easily tired, and you will use oxygen more efficiently. Aerobic exercise ( Figure 11.21) also helps improve cardiac muscle. 
Muscle  Injuries 	  Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure 11.22). When you don’t do a proper warm-up, several types of injuries can occur. A strain happens when muscle or tendons tear. Strains are also known as "pulled muscles." Another common injury is tendinitis, the irritation of the tendons. Strains and tendinitis are usually treated with rest, cold compresses, and stretching exercises that a physical therapist designs for each patient. Injuries can also be prevented by proper rest and recovery. If you do not get enough rest, your body will become injured and will not react well to exercise, or improve. You can also rest by doing a different activity. For example, if you run, you can rest your running muscles and joints by swimming. When done regularly, aerobic activities, such as cycling, make the heart stronger. 
Other aerobic activities include mowing 	  lawn, shoveling snow and cross country skiing. 
Warming up before the game helps the 	  players avoid injuries. Some warm-ups may include stretching exercises. 
Summary 	  • Aerobic exercise helps improve the cardiovascular system, while anaerobic exercise causes muscles to get bigger and stronger. • Muscle strain and tendinitis can be prevented by warming up before rigorous exercise and allowing your muscles to rest and recover.

What happens when you don’t eat? Refusing one meal won’t stunt your growth. But lack of proper food over a period of time can lead to malnutrition. That means, the body is not getting enough nutrients to grow and stay healthy. Kids who are malnourished may not grow as tall as they would otherwise. 
Why  We  Need  Food 	  Did you ever hear the old saying, An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Do apples really prevent you from getting sick? Probably not, but eating apples and other fresh fruits can help keep you healthy. Do you eat your vegetables? Maybe you do, but you may have friends who won’t touch a piece of broccoli or asparagus. Should you eat these foods and food like them? The girls pictured in the Figure 11.23 are eating salads. Why do you need foods like these for good health? What role does food play in the body? Your body needs food for three reasons: converts the glucose in the food you eat into ATP, or cellular energy. Which has more glucose, a salad or a These girls are eating leafy green vegetables. Fresh vegetables such as these are excellent food choices for good health. piece of meat? Do you remember what types of foods produce glucose? Recall that glucose is the product of photosynthesis. itself. Specifically, it needs these materials to produce more cells and its components. good health. For all these reasons, you must have a regular supply of nutrients. Nutrients are chemicals in food that your body needs. There are five types of nutrients. Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids are categories of organic compounds. They give your body energy, though carbohydrates are the main source of energy. Proteins provide building materials, such as amino acids to build your own proteins. Proteins, vitamins, and minerals also help control body processes. Carbohydrates include sugars such as the glucose made by photosynthesis. Often glucose is stored in large molecules such as starch. Proteins are found in foods like meats and nuts. Lipids includes fats and oils. Though you should stay away from many types of fats, others are needed by your body. Important vitamins include vitamins A, B (multiple types) C, D, and E. Important minerals include calcium and potassium. What should you drink to get calcium? Milk is a good source. 
Summary 	  • Your body needs food to obtain energy, to get building blocks for your body, and to get substances that help control body processes. • Nutrients, chemicals in food that your body needs, include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Nutrition at URL (6:39) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Identify sources of nutrients. • Identify the roles of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. • Distinguish simple carbohydrates from complex carbohydrates. • Distinguish saturated fats from unsaturated fats. What nutrients are in this meal? There are many different nutrients that are present in this meal. For example, the steak is a source of protein. The french fries are a source of carbohydrates. Both these nutrients help supply the body with energy. 
Nutrients 	  Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids contain energy. When your body digests food, it breaks down the molecules of these nutrients. This releases the energy so your body can use it. 
Carbohydrates 	  Carbohydrates are nutrients that include sugars, starches, and fiber. There are two types of carbohydrates: simple and complex. Pictured below are some foods that are good sources of carbohydrates ( Figure 11.24). 
Simple  Carbohydrates 	  Sugars are small, simple carbohydrates that are found in foods such as fruits and milk. The sugar found in fruits is called fructose. The sugar found in milk is called lactose. These sugars are broken down by the body to form glucose (C6H12O6), the simplest sugar of all. 
Up to the age of 13 years, you need about 	  of the carbohydrates should be complex. 
They are broken down by the body more 	  slowly than simple carbohydrates. Therefore, they provide energy longer and more steadily. Where does glucose come from? Recall that glucose is the product of photosynthesis, so some organisms such as plants are able to make their own glucose. As animals cannot photosynthesize, they must eat to obtain carbohydrates. Through the process of cellular respiration, glucose is converted by cells into energy that is usable by the cell (ATP). 
Complex  Carbohydrates 	  Starch is a large, complex carbohydrate made of thousands of glucose units (monomers) joined together. Starches are found in foods such as vegetables and grains. Starches are broken down by the body into sugars that provide energy. Breads and pasta are good sources of complex carbohydrates. Fiber is another type of large, complex carbohydrate that is partly indigestible. Unlike sugars and starches, fiber does not provide energy. However, it has other important roles in the body. For example, fiber is important for maintaining the health of your gastrointestinal tract. Eating foods high in fiber also helps fill you up without providing too many calories. Most fruits and vegetables are high in fiber. Some examples are pictured below ( Figure 11.25). 
Proteins 	  Proteins are nutrients made up of smaller molecules called amino acids. Recall that there are 20 different amino acids arranged like "beads on a string" to form proteins. These amino acid chains then fold up into a threedimensional molecule, giving the protein a specific function. Proteins have several important roles in the body. For example, proteins make up antibodies, muscle fibers and enzymes that help control cell and body processes. You need to make sure you have enough protein in your diet to obtain the necessary amino acids to make your proteins. Between the ages of 9 and 13 years, girls need about 26 grams of fiber per day, and boys need about 31 grams of fiber per day. If you eat more than you need for these purposes, the extra protein is used for energy. The image below shows how many grams of protein you need each day ( Figure 11.26). It also shows some foods that are good sources of protein. 
Lipids 	  Lipids are nutrients, such as fats that store energy. Lipids also have several other roles in the body. For example, lipids protect nerves and make up the membranes that surround cells. Fats are one type of lipid. Stored fat gives your body energy to use for later. It’s like having money in a savings account: it’s there in case you need it. Stored fat also cushions and protects internal organs. In addition, it insulates the body. It helps keep you warm in cold weather. Between the ages of 9 and 13 years, you need about 34 grams of proteins a day. Seafood and eggs are other good sources of protein. There are two main types of fats, saturated and unsaturated. meats, whole milk, and eggs. So even though these foods are good sources of proteins, they should be eaten in limited amounts. Saturated lipids increase cholesterol levels in the blood. Too much cholesterol in the blood can lead to heart disease. are also found in fish, such as salmon. Unsaturated lipids are needed in small amounts for good health. Most lipids in your diet should be unsaturated. Another type of lipid is called trans fat. Trans fats are manufactured and added to certain foods to keep them fresher for longer. Foods that contain trans fats include cakes, cookies, fried foods, and margarine. Eating foods that contain trans fats increases the risk of heart disease. Beginning with Denmark in 2003, many nations now limit the amount of trans fat that can be in food products or ban these products all together. On January 1, 2008, Calgary became the first city in Canada to ban trans fats from restaurants and fast food chains. Beginning in 2010, California banned trans fats from restaurant products, and in 
Summary 	  • Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids provide energy and have other important roles in the body. • Unsaturated fats are better for your health than trans fats or saturated fats.

How do you get your vitamins? You may take a vitamin pill. That is a good way to make sure you are getting most of the vitamins your body needs to grow. But the best way to get your vitamins is through eating a healthy diet. 
Vitamins and  Minerals 	  Vitamins and minerals are also nutrients. They do not provide energy, but they are needed for good health. 
Vitamins 	  Vitamins are organic compounds that the body needs in small amounts to function properly. Humans need 13 different vitamins. Some of them are listed below ( Table 11.2). The table also shows how much of each vitamin you need every day. Vitamins have many roles in the body. For example, Vitamin A helps maintain good vision. Vitamin B9 helps form red blood cells. Vitamin K is needed for blood to clot when you have a cut or other wound.

Vitamins B12 and K are produced by bacteria that normally live inside the body. Most other vitamins must come from foods. Foods that are good sources of vitamins include whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and milk ( Table 11.2). Not getting enough vitamins can cause health problems. For example, too little vitamin C causes a disease called scurvy. People with scurvy have bleeding gums, nosebleeds, and other symptoms. 
Minerals 	  Minerals are chemical elements that are needed for body processes. Minerals that you need in relatively large amounts are listed below ( Table 11.3). Minerals that you need in smaller amounts include iodine, iron, and zinc. Minerals have many important roles in the body. For example, calcium and phosphorus are needed for strong bones and teeth. Potassium and sodium are needed for muscles and nerves to work normally.

Sodium 	  Your body cannot produce any of the minerals that it needs. Instead, you must get minerals from the foods you eat. Good sources of minerals include milk, leafy green vegetables, and whole grains ( Table 11.3). Not getting enough minerals can cause health problems. For example, too little calcium may cause osteoporosis. This is a disease in which bones become soft and break easily. Getting too much of some minerals can also cause health problems. Many people get too much sodium. Sodium is added to most packaged foods. People often add more sodium to their food by using table salt. Too much sodium causes high blood pressure in some people.

Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Smart Nutrition at URL (3:42) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Describe how to choose foods wisely for optimal health. • Explain MyPyramid and MyPlate. • List eating healthy guidelines. • Read and understand a nutrition facts label. • Define obesity. Which foods would be the best choice? Each day you make many food choices. You decide which lunch line to get into. Then you may choose an afterschool snack. How can you make the most healthy decisions? 
Choosing  Healthy  Foods 	  Foods such as whole grain breads, fresh fruits, and fish provide nutrients you need for good health. But different foods give you different types of nutrients. You also need different amounts of each nutrient. How can you choose the right mix of foods to get the proper balance of nutrients? Three tools can help you choose foods wisely: MyPyramid, MyPlate, and food labels. 
My Pyramid 	  MyPyramid ( Figure 11.27) is a diagram that shows how much you should eat each day of foods from six different food groups. It recommends the amount of nutrients you need based on your age, your gender, and your level of activity. The six food groups in MyPyramid are: • Grains, such as bread, rice, pasta, and cereal. • Vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, carrots, and sweet potatoes. • Fruits, such as oranges, apples, bananas, and strawberries. • Oils, such as vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, and peanut oil. • Dairy, such as milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other cheeses. • Meat and beans, such as chicken, fish, soybeans, and kidney beans. 
My Pyramid can help you choose foods 	  wisely for good health. Each colored band represents a different food group. 
The key shows which food group each 	  color represents. Which colored band of 
My Pyramid is widest?  Which food group 	  does it represent? In MyPyramid, each food group is represented by a band of a different color. For example, grains are represented by an orange band, and vegetables are represented by a green band. The wider the band, the more foods you should choose from that food group each day. The orange band in MyPyramid is the widest band. This means that you should choose more foods from the grain group than from any other single food group. The green, blue, and red bands are also relatively wide. Therefore, you should choose plenty of foods from the vegetable, dairy, and fruit groups as well. You should choose the fewest foods from the food group with the narrowest band. Which band is narrowest? Which food group does it represent? Are you wondering where foods like ice cream, cookies, and potato chips fit into MyPyramid? The white tip of MyPyramid represents foods such as these. These are foods that should be eaten only in very small amounts and not very often. Such foods contain very few nutrients and are called nutrient-poor. Instead, they are high in fats, sugars, and sodium, which are nutrients that you should limit in a healthy eating plan. Ice cream, cookies, and potato chips are also high in calories. Eating too much of them may lead to unhealthy weight gain. 
Healthy  Eating  Guidelines 	  • Make at least half your daily grain choices whole grains. Examples of whole grains are whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, and brown rice. • Choose a variety of different vegetables each day. Be sure to include both dark green vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli, and orange vegetables, such as carrots and sweet potatoes. • Choose a variety of different fruits each day. Select mainly fresh fruits rather than canned fruits, and whole fruits instead of fruit juices. • When choosing oils, choose unsaturated oils, such as olive oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil. • Choose low-fat or fat-free milk and other dairy products. For example, select fat-free yogurt and low-fat cheese. • For meats, choose fish, chicken, and lean cuts of beef. Also, be sure to include beans, nuts, and seeds. 
My Plate 	  In June 2011, the United States Department of Agriculture replaced My Pyramid with MyPlate. MyPlate depicts the relative daily portions of various food groups ( Figure 11.28). See URL for more information. 
My Plate is a visual guideline for balanced 	  eating, replacing MyPyramid in 2011. The following guidelines accompany MyPlate: • Enjoy your food, but eat less. • Avoid oversized portions. • Make half your plate fruits and vegetables. • Make at least half your grains whole grains. • Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk. • Compare sodium in foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals; choose the foods with lower levels. • Drink water instead of drinks with high levels of sugar. 
Using  Nutrition  Facts  Labels 	  In the United States and other nations, packaged foods are required by law to have nutrition facts labels. A nutrition facts label ( Figure 11.29) shows the nutrients in a food. Packaged foods are also required to list their ingredients. The information listed at the right of the label tells you what to look for. At the top of the label, look for the serving size. The serving size tells you how much of the food you should eat to get the nutrients listed on the label. A cup of food from the label pictured below is a serving. The calories in one serving are listed next. In this food, there are 
Reading nutrition facts labels can help 	  you choose healthy foods. Look at the nutrition facts label shown here. Do you think this food is a good choice for a healthy eating plan? Why or why not? Next on the nutrition facts label, look for the percent daily values (% DV) of nutrients. Remember the following tips when reading a food label: • A food is low in a nutrient if the percent daily value of the nutrient is 5% or less. • The healthiest foods are low in nutrients such as fats and sodium. • A food is high in a nutrient if the percent daily value of the nutrient is 20% or more. • The healthiest foods are high in nutrients such as fiber and proteins. Look at the percent daily values on the food label ( Figure 11.29). Which nutrients have values of 5% or less? These are the nutrients that are low in this food. They include fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, and iron. Which nutrients have values of 20% or more? These are the nutrients that are high in this food. They include sodium, potassium, and calcium. 
Balancing  Food with  Exercise 	  Look at MyPyramid ( Figure 11.27). Note the person walking up the side of the pyramid. This shows that exercise is important for balanced eating. Exercise helps you use any extra energy in the foods you eat. The more active you are, the more energy you use. You should try to get at least an hour of physical activity just about every day. Pictured below are some activities that can help you use extra energy ( Figure 11.30). 
Weight  Gain and  Obesity 	  Any unused energy in food is stored in the body as fat. This is true whether the extra energy comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids. What happens if you take in more energy than you use, day after day? You will store more and more fat and become overweight. Eventually, you may become obese. Obesity is having a very high percentage of body fat. Obese people are at least people often have serious health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. They are also more likely to develop arthritis and some types of cancer. People who remain obese during their entire adulthood usually do not live as long as people who stay within a healthy weight range. The current generation of children and teens is the first generation in our history that may have a shorter life than their parents. The reason is their high rate of obesity and the health problems associated with obesity. You can avoid gaining weight and becoming obese. The choice is yours. Choose healthy foods by using MyPyramid and reading food labels. Then get plenty of exercise to balance the energy in the foods you eat.

Which of the activities do you enjoy? nutrients such as _______ and _______. • List the functions of the digestive system. • Define digestion and absorption. • Distinguish chemical digestion from mechanical digestion. Do you know when you’re digesting food? Unless you have an upset stomach, digestion usually happens without you even noticing. You consciously chew up your food, but most of the digestive process takes place without your conscious awareness. Long after you put down your fork, food is still passing through your stomach and small intestine. It may take over a day for a meal to pass all the way through your digestive system. 
Function of the  Digestive  System 	  Nutrients in the foods you eat are needed by the cells of your body. How do the nutrients in foods get to your body cells? What organs and processes break down the foods and make the nutrients available to cells? The organs are those of the digestive system. The processes are digestion and absorption. The digestive system is the body system that breaks down food and absorbs nutrients. It also gets rid of solid food waste. The digestive system is mainly one long tube from the mouth to the anus, known as the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). The main organs of the digestive system include the esophagus, stomach and the intestine, and are pictured below ( Figure 11.31). The intestine is divided into the small and large intestine. The small intestine has three segments. The ileum is the longest segment of the small intestine, which is well over 10 feet long. The large intestine is about 5 feet long. 
This drawing shows the major organs of 	  the digestive system. The liver, pancreas and gallbladder are also organs of the digestive system. Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion, mechanical and chemical. In mechanical digestion, large chunks of food are broken down into small pieces. Mechanical digestion begins in the mouth and involves physical processes, such as chewing. This process continues in the stomach as the food is mixed with digestive juices. In chemical digestion, large food molecules are broken down into small nutrient molecules. This is a chemical process which also begins in the mouth as saliva begins to break down food and continues in the stomach as stomach enzymes further digest the food. Absorption is the process that allows substances you eat to be taken up by the blood. After food is broken down into small nutrient molecules, the molecules are absorbed by the blood. After absorption, the nutrient molecules travel in the bloodstream to cells throughout the body. This happens mostly in the small intestine. Some substances in food cannot be broken down into nutrients. They remain behind in the digestive system after the nutrients are absorbed. Any substances in food that cannot be digested and absorbed pass out of the body as solid waste. The process of passing solid food waste out of the body is called elimination.

What happens if you suck on a piece of white bread? If you kept a bite of white bread in your mouth for a long period of time, it would start to get really mushy. Then it would start tasting sweet. That’s because you have enzymes in your saliva. The enzymes break down the complex carbohydrates in the bread into simple sugars. 
The  Role of  Enzymes in the  Digestive  System 	  Chemical digestion could not take place without the help of digestive enzymes. An enzyme is a protein that speeds up chemical reactions in the body. Digestive enzymes speed up chemical reactions that break down large food molecules into small molecules. Did you ever use a wrench to tighten a bolt? You could tighten a bolt with your fingers, but it would be difficult and slow. If you use a wrench, you can tighten a bolt much more easily and quickly. Enzymes are like wrenches. They make it much easier and quicker for chemical reactions to take place. Like a wrench, enzymes can also be used over and over again. But you need the appropriate size and shape of the wrench to efficiently tighten the bolt, just like each enzyme is specific for the reaction it helps. Digestive enzymes are released, or secreted, by the organs of the digestive system. These enzymes include proteases that digest proteins, and nucleases that digest nucleic acids. Examples of digestive enzymes are: • Amylase, produced in the mouth. It helps break down large starch molecules into smaller sugar molecules. • Pepsin, produced in the stomach. Pepsin helps break down proteins into amino acids. • Trypsin, produced in the pancreas. Trypsin also breaks down proteins. • Pancreatic lipase, produced in the pancreas. It is used to break apart fats. • Deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease, produced in the pancreas. They are enzymes that break bonds in nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. Bile salts are bile acids that help to break down fat. Bile acids are made in the liver. When you eat a meal, bile is secreted into the intestine, where it breaks down the fats ( Figure 11.32). 
Bile is made in the liver, stored in the 	  gallbladder, and then secreted into the intestine. It helps break down fats. 
Hormones and  Digestion 	  If you are a typical teenager, you like to eat. For your body to break down, absorb and spread the nutrients from your food throughout your body, your digestive system and endocrine system need to work together. The endocrine system sends hormones around your body to communicate between cells. Essentially, hormones are chemical messenger molecules. Digestive hormones are made by cells lining the stomach and small intestine. These hormones cross into the blood where they can affect other parts of the digestive system. Some of these hormones are listed below. • Gastrin, which signals the secretion of gastric acid. • Cholecystokinin, which signals the secretion of pancreatic enzymes. • Secretin, which signals secretion of water and bicarbonate from the pancreas. • Ghrelin, which signals when you are hungry. • Gastric inhibitory polypeptide, which stops or decreases gastric secretion. It also causes the release of insulin in response to high blood glucose levels.

How many organs of the digestive system can you name? Stomach? Mouth? It takes many different organs working together in order to digest your food. Some are part of the pipeline that food passes through. Others make special chemicals that are needed for digestion. 
Organs of the  Digestive  System 	  The mouth and stomach are just two of the organs of the digestive system. Other digestive system organs are the esophagus, small intestine, and large intestine. Below, you can see that the digestive organs form a long tube ( anus. Food enters the mouth and then passes through the rest of the digestive system. Food waste leaves the body through the anus. This drawing shows the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. These organs are part of the digestive system. Food does not pass through them, but they secrete substances needed for chemical digestion. The organs of the digestive system are lined with muscles. The muscles contract, or tighten, to push food through the system ( Figure 11.34). The muscles contract in waves. The waves pass through the digestive system like waves through a slinky. This movement of muscle contractions is called peristalsis. Without peristalsis, food would not be able to move through the digestive system. Peristalsis is an involuntary process, which means that it occurs without your conscious control. The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are also organs of the digestive system ( Figure 11.33). Food does not pass through these three organs. However, these organs are important for digestion. They secrete or store enzymes or other chemicals that are needed to help digest food chemically. This diagram shows how muscles push food through the digestive system. Muscle contractions travel through the system in waves, pushing the food ahead of them. This is called peristalsis. 
Mouth,  Esophagus, and  Stomach 	  The mouth is the first organ that food enters. But digestion may start even before you put the first bite of food into your mouth. Just seeing or smelling food can cause the release of saliva and digestive enzymes in your mouth. Once you start eating, saliva wets the food, which makes it easier to break up and swallow. Digestive enzymes, including the enzyme amylase, start breaking down starches into sugars. Your tongue helps mix the food with the saliva and enzymes. Your teeth also help digest food. Your front teeth are sharp. They cut and tear food when you bite into it. Your back teeth are broad and flat. They grind food into smaller pieces when you chew. Chewing is part of mechanical digestion. Your tongue pushes the food to the back of your mouth so you can swallow it. When you swallow, the lump of chewed food passes down your throat to your esophagus. The esophagus is a narrow tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. Food moves through the esophagus because of peristalsis. At the lower end of the esophagus, a circular muscle controls the opening to the stomach. The muscle relaxes to let food pass into the stomach. Then the muscle contracts again to prevent food from passing back into the esophagus. Some people think that gravity moves food through the esophagus. If that were true, food would move through the esophagus only when you are sitting or standing upright. In fact, because of peristalsis, food can move through the esophagus no matter what position you are in—even upside down! Just don’t try to swallow food when you are upside down—you could choke! The stomach is a sac-like organ at the end of the esophagus. It has thick muscular walls. The muscles contract and relax. This moves the food around and helps break it into smaller pieces. Mixing the food around with the enzyme pepsin and other chemicals helps digest proteins. Water, salt, and simple sugars can be absorbed into the blood from the stomach. Most other substances are broken down further in the small intestine before they are absorbed. The stomach stores food until the small intestine is ready to receive it. A circular muscle controls the opening between the stomach and small intestine. When the small intestine is empty, the muscle relaxes. This lets food pass from the stomach into the small intestine. 
Small  Intestine 	  The small intestine a is narrow tube that starts at the stomach and ends at the large intestine ( Figure 11.33). In adults, the small intestine is about 23 feet long. Chemical digestion takes place in the first part of the small intestine. Many enzymes and other chemicals are secreted here. The small intestine is also where most nutrients are absorbed into the blood. The later sections of the small intestines are covered with tiny projections called villi ( Figure 11.35). Villi contain very tiny blood vessels. Nutrients are absorbed into the blood through these tiny vessels. There are millions of villi, so, altogether, there is a very large area for absorption to take place. In fact, villi make the inner surface area of the small intestine 1,000 times larger than it would be without them. The entire inner surface area of the small intestine is about as big as a basketball court! 
This is what the villi 	  lining the intestine looks like when magnified. Each one is actually only about 1 millimeter long. Villi are just barely visible with the unaided eye. The small intestine is much longer than the large intestine. So why is it called “small”? If you compare small and large intestines ( Figure 11.33), you will see the small intestine is smaller in width than the large intestine. 
Large  Intestine 	  The large intestine is a wide tube that connects the small intestine with the anus. In adults, it is about five feet long. Waste enters the large intestine from the small intestine in a liquid state. As the waste moves through the large intestine, excess water is absorbed from it. After the excess water is absorbed, the remaining solid waste is called feces. Circular muscles control the anus. They relax to let the feces pass out of the body through the anus. After feces pass out of the body, they are called stool. Releasing the stool from the body is referred to as a bowel movement.

Why eat yogurt? Yogurt is a good source of calcium. Yogurt also contains active cultures of "good" bacteria. Foods that contain these beneficial bacteria are sometimes called "probiotic." 
Bacteria in the  Digestive  System 	  Your large intestine is not just made up of cells. It is also an ecosystem, home to trillions of bacteria known as the "gut flora" ( Figure 11.36). But don’t worry, most of these bacteria are helpful. Friendly bacteria live mostly in the large intestine and part of the small intestine. The acidic environment of the stomach does not allow bacterial growth. Gut bacteria have several roles in the body. For example, intestinal bacteria: • Produce vitamin B12 and vitamin K. • Control the growth of harmful bacteria. • Break down poisons in the large intestine. • Break down some substances in food that cannot be digested, such as fiber and some starches and sugars. Bacteria produce enzymes that digest carbohydrates in plant cell walls. Most of the nutritional value of plant material would be wasted without these bacteria. These help us digest plant foods like spinach. 
Your intestines are home to trillions of 	  bacteria. A wide range of friendly bacteria live in the gut. Bacteria begin to populate the human digestive system right after birth. Gut bacteria include Lactobacillus, the bacteria commonly used in probiotic foods such as yogurt, and E. coli bacteria. About a third of all bacteria in the gut are members of the Bacteroides species. Bacteroides are key in helping us digest plant food. It is estimated that 100 trillion bacteria live in the gut. This is more than the human cells that make up you. It has also been estimated that there are more bacteria in your mouth than people on the planet. There are over 7 billion people on the planet. The bacteria in your digestive system are from anywhere between 300 and 1000 species. As these bacteria are helpful, your body does not attack them. They actually appear to the body’s immune system as cells of the digestive system, not foreign invaders. The bacteria actually cover themselves with sugar molecules removed from the actual cells of the digestive system. This disguises the bacteria and protects them from the immune system. As the bacteria that live in the human gut are beneficial to us, and as the bacteria enjoy a safe environment to live, the relationship that we have with these tiny organisms is described as mutualism, a type of symbiotic relationship. Lastly, keep in mind the small size of bacteria. Together, all the bacteria in your gut may weight just about 2 pounds.

Why might this be a problem? • Define foodborne illness. • List ways to avoid foodborne illnesses. • List common food allergies and symptoms. • Describe anaphylaxis and its symptoms. • Describe food intolerance. Have you ever been sick to your stomach? You may have even had to stay home from school because of a "stomach bug." It is possible that you caught a contagious illness, or you could have gotten sick from food you had eaten recently. The symptoms are very similar, so it’s hard to pinpoint the cause. 
Health of the  Digestive  System 	  Most of the time, you probably aren’t aware of your digestive system. It works well without causing any problems. But most people have problems with their digestive system at least once in a while. Did you ever eat something that didn’t “agree” with you? Maybe you had a stomachache or felt sick to your stomach? Maybe you had diarrhea? These could be symptoms of foodborne illness, food allergies, or a food intolerance. 
Foodborne  Illness 	  Harmful bacteria can enter your digestive system in food and make you sick. This is called foodborne illness or food poisoning. The bacteria, or the toxins they produce, may cause vomiting or cramping, in addition to the symptoms mentioned above. Foodborne illnesses can also be caused by viruses and parasites. The most common foodborne illnesses happen within a few minutes to a few hours, and make you feel really sick, but last for only about a day or so. Others can take longer for the illness to appear. Some people believe that the taste of food will tell you if it is bad. As a rule, you probably should not eat bad tasting food, but many contaminated foods can still taste good. You can help prevent foodborne illness by following a few simple rules. • Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. This helps prevent any bacteria in the foods from multiplying. • Wash your hands before you prepare or eat food. This helps prevent bacteria on your hands from getting on the food. This is the easiest way to prevent foodborne illnesses. • Wash your hands after you touch raw foods, such as meats, poultry, fish, or eggs. These foods often contain bacteria that your hands could transfer to your mouth. • Cook meats, poultry, fish, and eggs thoroughly before eating them. The heat of cooking kills any bacteria the foods may contain, so they cannot make you sick. • Refrigerate cooked food soon after a meal. Cooked food can be left out for up to two hours before they need to be placed in the cold. This will prevent the spread of bacteria. Cooked foods should not be left out all day. Bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses include Salmonella, a bacterium found in many foods, including raw and undercooked meat, poultry, dairy products, and seafood. Campylobacter jejuni is found in raw or undercooked chicken and unpasteurized milk. Several strains of E. coli can cause illnesses, and are found in raw or undercooked hamburger, unpasteurized fruit juices and milk, and even fresh produce. Vibrio is a bacterium that may contaminate fish or shellfish. Listeria has been found in raw and undercooked meats, unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, and readyto-eat deli meats and hot dogs. Most of these bacterial illnesses can be prevented with proper cooking of food and washing of hands. Common foodborne viruses include norovirus and hepatitis A virus. Norovirus, which causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines, has been a recent issue on cruise ships, infecting hundreds of passengers and crew on certain voyages. Hepatitis A causes inflammation of the liver, which is treated with rest and diet changes. Parasites are tiny organisms that live inside another organism. Giardia is a parasite spread through water contaminated with the stools of people or animals who are infected. Food preparers who are infected with parasites can also contaminate food if they do not thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom and before handling food. Trichinella is a type of roundworm parasite. People may be infected with this parasite by consuming raw or undercooked pork or wild game. 
Food  Allergies 	  Food allergies are like other allergies. They occur when the immune system reacts to harmless substances as though they were harmful. Almost ten percent of children have food allergies. Some of the foods most likely to cause allergies are shown below ( Figure 11.37). Eating foods you are allergic to may cause vomiting, diarrhea, or skin rashes. Some people are very allergic to certain foods. Eating even tiny amounts of the foods causes them to have serious symptoms, such as difficulty breathing. If they eat the foods by accident, they may need emergency medical treatment. 
Some of the foods that commonly cause 	  allergies are shown here. They include nuts, eggs, grains, milk, and shellfish. Are you allergic to any of these foods? The most common food allergy symptoms include: • tingling or itching in the mouth • hives, itching or eczema, • swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other parts of the body, • wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing, • abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, • dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting. In some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Emergency treatment is critical for anaphylaxis. Untreated, anaphylaxis can cause a coma or death. Anaphylaxis is vary rare. The vast majority of people will never have an anaphylactic reaction. The life-threatening symptoms of anaphylaxis include: • constriction and tightening of the airway, • a swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breathe, • shock, with a severe drop in blood pressure, • a rapid pulse, • dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness. 
Food  Intolerance 	  A food intolerance, or food sensitivity, is different from a food allergy. A food intolerance happens when the digestive system is unable to break down a certain type of food. This can result in stomach cramping, diarrhea, tiredness, and weight loss. Food intolerances are often mistakenly called allergies. Lactose intolerance is a food intolerance. A person who is lactose intolerant does not make enough lactase, the enzyme that breaks down the milk sugar, lactose. Lactose intolerance may be as high as 75% in some populations, but overall the percentage of affected individuals is much less. Still, well over 10% of the world’s population is lactose intolerant.

What do you do for "cardio"? "Cardio" has become slang for aerobic exercise that raises your heart rate for an extended amount of time. Cardio can include biking, running, or swimming. Can you guess one of the main organs of the cardiovascular system? Yes, your heart. 
Functions of the  Cardiovascular  System 	  Your cardiovascular system has many jobs. At times the cardiovascular system can work like a pump, a heating system, or even a postal carrier. To do these tasks, your cardiovascular system works with other organ systems, such as the respiratory, endocrine, and nervous systems. The cardiovascular system ( Figure 11.38) is made up of the heart, the blood vessels, and the blood. It moves nutrients, gases (like oxygen), and wastes to and from your cells. Every cell in your body depends on your cardiovascular system. If your cells don’t receive nutrients, they cannot survive. The main function of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen to each of your cells. Blood receives oxygen in your lungs (the main organs of the respiratory system) and then is pumped, by your heart, throughout your body. The oxygen then diffuses into your cells, and carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, moves from your cells into your blood to be delivered back to your lungs and exhaled. Each cell in your body needs oxygen, as oxygen is used in cellular respiration to produce energy in the form of ATP. Without oxygen, lactic acid fermentation would occur in your cells, which can only be maintained for a brief period of time. Arteries carry blood full of oxygen ("oxygen-rich") away from the heart and veins return oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. The cardiovascular system also plays a role in maintaining body temperature. It helps to keep you warm by moving warm blood around your body. Your blood vessels also control your body temperature to keep you from getting too hot or too cold. When your brain senses that your body temperature is increasing, it sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin to increase in diameter. Increasing the diameter of the blood vessels increases the amount of blood and heat that moves near the skin’s surface. The heat is then released from the skin. This helps you cool down. What do you think your blood vessels do when your body temperature is decreasing? The blood also carries hormones, which are chemical messenger molecules produced by organs of the endocrine system, through your body. Hormones are produced in one area of your body and have an effect on another area. To get to that other area, they must travel through your blood. An example is the hormone adrenaline, produced by the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys. Adrenaline has multiple effects on the heart (it quickens the heart rate), on muscles and on the airway. The cardiovascular system moves nutrients and other substances throughout the body.

Are your blood vessels leaky? None of your blood vessels are leaking this badly, or you’d be in the hospital! But your blood vessels do leak a little bit. Water and solutes pass out of the blood vessels and help form the fluid that bathes your body’s tissues. Ultimately the fluid that is lost from the blood vessels is returned through the lymphatic system. 
The  Lymphatic  System and  Circulation 	  The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and tissues that carry a clear fluid called lymph. The lymphatic system ( Figure 11.39) spreads all around the body and filters and cleans the lymph of any debris, abnormal cells, or pathogens. Lymph vessels are tube-shaped, just like blood vessels, with about 500-600 lymph nodes (in an adult) attached. The lymphatic system works with the cardiovascular system to return body fluids to the blood. The lymphatic system and the cardiovascular system are often called the body’s two "circulatory systems." Organs of the lymphatic system include the tonsils, thymus gland and spleen. The thymus gland produces T cells or T-lymphocytes (see below) and the spleen and tonsils help in fighting infections. The spleen’s main function is to filter the blood, removing unwanted red blood cells. The spleen also detects viruses and bacteria and triggers the release of pathogen fighting cells. 
The lymphatic system helps return fluid 	  that leaks from the blood vessels back to the cardiovascular system. 
Role of the  Lymphatic  System in  Circulation 	  You may think that your blood vessels have thick walls without any leaks, but that’s not true. Blood vessels can leak just like any other pipe. The lymphatic system makes sure leaked blood returns back to the bloodstream. When a small amount of fluid leaks out from the blood vessels, it collects in the spaces between cells and tissues. Some of the fluid returns to the cardiovascular system, and the rest is collected by the lymph vessels of the lymphatic system ( Figure 11.40). The fluid that collects in the lymph vessels is called lymph. The lymphatic system then returns the lymph to the cardiovascular system. Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not closed (meaning it is an open circulatory system that releases and collects fluid) and has no central pump (or heart). Lymph moves slowly in lymph vessels. It is moved along in the lymph vessels by the squeezing action of smooth muscles and skeletal muscles. 
Lymph capillaries collect fluid that leaks 	  out from blood capillaries. The lymphatic vessels return the fluid to the cardiovascular system. 
Role of the  Lymphatic  System in the  Body’s  Defenses 	  The lymphatic system also plays an important role in the immune system. For example, the lymphatic system makes white blood cells that protect the body from diseases. Cells of the lymphatic system produce two types of white blood cells, T cells and B cells, that are involved in fighting specific pathogens. Lymph nodes, which are scattered throughout the lymphatic system, act as filters or traps for foreign particles and are important in the proper functioning of the immune system. The role of the lymphatic system in the immune response is discussed in additional concepts.

Where is your heart? Place your hand on your heart. Did you put your hand on the left side of your chest? Most people do, but the heart is actually located closer to the center of the chest. 
The  Heart 	  What does the heart look like? How does it pump blood? The heart is divided into four chambers ( Figure 11.41), or spaces: the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles. An atrium (singular for atria) is one of the two small, thin-walled chambers on the top of the heart where the blood first enters. A ventricle is one of the two muscular V-shaped chambers that pump blood out of the heart. You can remember they are called ventricles because they are shaped like a "V." The atria receive the blood, and the ventricles pump the blood out of the heart. Each of the four chambers of the heart has a specific job. • The right atrium receives oxygen-poor blood from the body. 
The atria receive blood and the ventricles 	  pump blood out of the heart. • The right ventricle pumps oxygen-poor blood toward the lungs, where it receives oxygen. • The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs. • The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. 
Blood  Flow  Through the  Heart 	  Blood flows through the heart in two separate loops. You can think of them as a “left side loop” and a “right side loop.” The right side of the heart collects oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it into the lungs, where it releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. (Recall that carbon dioxide is a waste product that must be removed. It is removed when we exhale.) The left side carries the oxygen-rich blood back from the lungs into the left side of the heart, which then pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. The blood delivers oxygen to the cells of the body, where it is needed for cellular respiration, and returns to the heart oxygen-poor. To move blood through the heart, the cardiac muscle needs to contract in an organized way. Blood first enters the atria ( Figure 11.42). When the atria contract, blood is pushed into the ventricles. After the ventricles fill with blood, they contract, and blood is pushed out of the heart. The heart is mainly composed of cardiac muscle. These muscle cells contract in unison, causing the heart itself to contract and generating enough force to push the blood out. So how is the blood kept from flowing back on itself? Valves ( Figure 11.42) in the heart keep the blood flowing in one direction. The valves do this by opening and closing in one direction only. Blood only moves forward through the heart. The valves stop the blood from flowing backward. There are four valves of the heart. • The two atrioventricular (AV) valves stop blood from moving from the ventricles to the atria. • The two semilunar (SL) valves are found in the arteries leaving the heart, and they prevent blood from flowing back from the arteries into the ventricles. Why does a heart beat? The “lub-dub” sound of the heartbeat is caused by the closing of the AV valves ("lub") and SL valves ("dub") after blood has passed through them. 
Blood flows in only one direction in the 	  heart. Blood enters the atria, which contract and push blood into the ventricles. 
The atria relax and the ventricles fill with 	  blood. Finally, the ventricles contract and push blood around the body. 
Summary 	  • Blood enters the heart at the atria and then flows into the ventricles, which contract and push blood around the body. • Valves in the heart keep the blood flowing in one direction. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Working of the Heart at URL (1:36) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • List the three types of blood vessels. • Describe the major arteries and veins. • Distinguish between systemic circulation and pulmonary circulation. Why are these arteries so important? The major arteries of the neck are shown here in red. The heart pumps oxygen-rich blood through these arteries to the brain. Without oxygen, the brain cannot survive longer than just a few minutes. So these arteries in the neck are very important. 
Blood  Vessels and  Blood  Circulation 	  The blood vessels are an important part of the cardiovascular system. They connect the heart to every cell in the body. Arteries carry blood away from the heart, while veins return blood to the heart ( Figure 11.43). The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood into pulmonary circulation, while the left side pumps oxygenated blood into systemic circulation. 
Important  Arteries and  Veins 	  There are specific veins and arteries that are more significant than others. The pulmonary arteries carry oxygenpoor blood away from the heart to the lungs. These are the only arteries that carry oxygen-poor blood. The aorta is the largest artery in the body. It carries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart. Further away from the heart, the aorta branches into smaller arteries, which eventually branch into capillaries. Capillaries are the smallest type of blood vessel; they connect very small arteries and veins. Gases and other substances are exchanged between cells and the blood across the very thin walls of capillaries. The veins that return oxygen-poor blood to the heart are the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava. The pulmonary veins return oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart. The pulmonary veins are the only veins that carry oxygen-rich blood. 
Pulmonary  Circulation 	  Pulmonary circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system that carries oxygen-poor blood away from the heart and brings it to the lungs. Oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart from the body and leaves the right ventricle through the pulmonary arteries, which carry the blood to each lung. Once at the lungs, the red blood cells release carbon dioxide and pick up oxygen when you breathe. The oxygen-rich blood then leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins, which return it to the left side of the heart. This completes the pulmonary cycle. The oxygenated blood is then pumped to the body through systemic circulation, before returning again to pulmonary circulation. 
Systemic  Circulation 	  Systemic circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system that carries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart, to the body, and returns oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. Oxygen-rich blood leaves the left ventricle through the aorta. Then it travels to the body’s organs and tissues. The tissues and organs absorb the oxygen through the capillaries. Oxygen-poor blood is collected from the tissues and organs by tiny veins, which then flow into bigger veins, and, eventually, into the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava. This completes systemic circulation. The blood releases carbon dioxide and gets more oxygen in pulmonary circulation before returning to systemic circulation. The inferior vena cava returns blood from the body. The superior vena cava returns blood from the head.

However, there are also many other important components of your blood. 
Components of  Blood 	  Did you know that blood is a tissue? Blood is a fluid connective tissue that is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. The cells that make up blood are pictured below ( Figure 11.44). The different parts of blood have different roles. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of human blood cells. Red blood cells are the flat, bowl-shaped cells, the tiny disc-shaped pieces are platelets, and white blood cells are the round cells shown in the center. 
Plasma 	  If you were to filter out all the cells in blood, a golden-yellow liquid would be left behind. Plasma is this fluid part of the blood. Plasma is about 90% water and about 10% dissolved proteins, glucose, ions, hormones, and gases. Blood is made up mostly of plasma. 
Red  Blood  Cells 	  Red blood cells (RBCs) are flattened, disk-shaped cells that carry oxygen. They are the most common blood cell in the blood. There are about 4 to 6 million RBCs per cubic millimeter of blood. Each RBC has about 200 million molecules of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen. Hemoglobin also gives the red blood cells their red color. Red blood cells ( Figure 11.45) are made in the red marrow of long bones, rib bones, the skull, and vertebrae. Each red blood cell lives for only 120 days (about four months). After this time, they are destroyed in the liver and spleen. Mature red blood cells do not have a nucleus or other organelles. Lacking these components allows the cells to have more hemoglobin and carry more oxygen. The flattened shape of red blood cells helps them carry more oxygen than if they were rounded. 
White  Blood  Cells 	  White blood cells (WBCs) are usually larger than red blood cells. They do not have hemoglobin and do not carry oxygen. White blood cells make up less than one percent of the blood’s volume. Most WBCs are made in the bone marrow, and some mature in the lymphatic system. There are different WBCs with different jobs. WBCs defend the body against infection by bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. WBCs do have a nucleus and other organelles. • Neutrophils are WBCs that can squeeze through capillary walls and swallow particles such as bacteria and parasites. • Macrophages are large WBCs that can also swallow and destroy old and dying cells, bacteria, or viruses. Below, a macrophage is attacking and swallowing two particles, possibly disease-causing pathogens ( Figure • Lymphocytes are WBCs that fight infections caused by viruses and bacteria. Some lymphocytes attack and kill cancer cells. Lymphocytes called B-cells make antibodies. 
A type of white blood cell, called a 	  macrophage, is attacking a cancer cell. 
Platelets 	  Platelets ( Figure 11.47) are very small, but they are very important in blood clotting. Platelets are not cells. They are sticky little pieces of larger cells. Platelets bud off large cells that stay in the bone marrow. When a blood vessel gets cut, platelets stick to the injured areas. They release chemicals called clotting factors, which cause proteins to form over the wound. This web of proteins catches red blood cells and forms a clot. This clot stops more blood from leaving the body through the cut blood vessel. The clot also stops bacteria from entering the body. Platelets survive in the blood for ten days before they are removed by the liver and spleen. 
Summary 	  • Plasma, the fluid part of the blood, is mostly made up of water but also contains dissolved proteins, glucose, ions, hormones, and gases. • Red blood cells carry oxygen, while white blood cells defend the body against infection by bacteria, viruses, and other diseases. A platelet lies between a red blood cell, at left, and a white blood cell at right. 
Platelets are little pieces of larger cells 	  that are found in the bone marrow.

What’s your type? As this woman donates blood, you can see her blood collecting in a special bag. This bag is coded with her blood type. That makes it possible for doctors and nurses to match up the blood she is giving to a recipient that has the same blood type. 
Blood  Types 	  Do you know what your blood type is? Maybe you have heard people say that they have type A or type O blood. Blood type is a way to describe the type of antigens, or proteins, on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). There are four blood types; A, B, AB, and O. The ABO blood group system is important if a person needs a blood transfusion. A blood transfusion is the process of putting blood or blood products from one person into the circulatory system of another person. The blood type of the recipient needs to be carefully matched to the blood type of the donor. That’s because different blood types have different types of antibodies, or proteins, released by the blood cells. Antibodies attack strange substances in the body. This is a normal part of your immune response, which is your defense against disease. For example, imagine a person with type O blood was given type A blood. First, what type of antibodies do people with type O blood produce? They produce anti-A and anti-B antibodies. This means, if a person with type O blood received type A blood, the anti-A antibodies in the person’s blood would attack the A antigens on the RBCs in the donor blood ( Figure 11.48). The antibodies would cause the RBCs to clump together, and the clumps could block a blood vessel. This clumping of blood cells could cause death. 
A person with type  O blood has  A and  	  antibodies in his/her plasma; if the person was to get type A blood instead of type O, his/her A antibodies would attach to the antigens on the RBCs and cause them to clump together. People with type A blood produce anti-B antibodies, and people with type B blood produce anti-A antibodies. People with type AB blood do not produce either antibody. 
The  Rhesus  Factor 	  The second most important blood group system in human blood is the Rhesus (Rh) factor. A person either has, or does not have, the Rh antigen on the surface of their RBCs. If they do have it, then the person is positive. If the person does not have the antigen, they are considered negative. 
Blood  Donors 	  Recall that people with type O blood do not have any antigens on their RBCs. As a result, type O blood can be given to people with blood types A, B, or AB. If there are no antigens on the RBCs, there cannot be an antibody reaction in the blood. People with type O blood are often called universal donors. The blood plasma of AB blood does not contain any anti-A or anti-B antibodies. People with type AB blood can receive any ABO blood type. People with type AB blood are called universal recipients because they can receive any blood type. The antigens and antibodies that define blood type are listed as follows ( Table 11.4). 
A and  	  none anti-B anti-A none anti-A, anti-B

What do these foods have in common? Red meat, legumes, and spinach are all good sources of iron. Getting enough iron in your diet is important to prevent anemia. Anemia is a blood disease that causes you to feel weak and tired. Although anemia is caused by a nutrient deficiency, other blood diseases are genetic diseases, or forms of cancer. 
Blood  Diseases 	  Problems can occur with red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and other parts of the blood. Many blood disorders are genetic, meaning they are inherited from a parent. Some blood diseases are caused by not getting enough of a certain nutrient, while others are cancers of the blood. 
Anemia 	  Anemia is a disease that occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin in the blood to carry oxygen to body cells. Hemoglobin is the blood protein that normally carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Anemia leads to a lack of oxygen in organs. Anemia is usually caused by one of the following: • A loss of blood from a bleeding wound or a slow leak of blood. • The destruction of red blood cells. • A lack of red blood cell production. Anemia may not have any symptoms. Some people with anemia feel weak or tired in general or during exercise. They also may have poor concentration. People with more severe anemia often get short of breath during times of activity. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. It occurs when the body does not receive enough iron. Since there is not enough iron, hemoglobin, which needs iron to bind oxygen, cannot function properly. In the United States, 20% of all women of childbearing age have iron-deficiency anemia, compared with only 2% of adult men. The most common cause of iron-deficiency anemia in young women is blood lost during menstruation. Iron deficiency anemia can be avoided by getting the recommended amount of iron in one’s diet. Anemia is often treated or prevented by taking iron supplements. Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table 11.5). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb. 
Food 	  Canned clams, drained, 3 oz. Fortified dry cereals, about 1 oz. Roasted pumpkin and squash seeds, 1 oz. 
Cooked fresh spinach, 1 	  Cooked ground beef, 3 oz. Cooked sirloin beef, 3 oz. 
Sickle- Cell  Anemia 	  Sickle-cell anemia is a blood disease that is caused by an abnormally shaped hemoglobin protein in red blood cells. Many of the red blood cells of a person with sickle-cell anemia are long and curved (sickle-shaped) ( Figure 11.49). The long, sickle shape of the cells can cause them to get stuck in narrow blood vessels. This clotting means that oxygen cannot reach the cells. People with sickle-cell anemia are most often well but can occasionally have painful attacks. The disease is not curable, but it can be treated with medicines. 
The red blood cells of a person with 	  sickle-cell anemia (left) are long and pointed, rather than straight, like normal cells (right). The abnormal cells cannot carry oxygen properly and can get stuck in capillaries. 
Blood  Cancer 	  Blood cancers affect the production and function of your blood cells. Most of these cancers start in your bone marrow where blood is produced. In most blood cancers, the normal production of blood cells is replaced by uncontrolled growth of an abnormal type of blood cell. These abnormal blood cells are cancerous cells, and prevent your blood from performing many of its functions, like fighting off infections or preventing serious bleeding. Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow. It is characterized by an abnormal production of blood cells, usually white blood cells. Lymphoma is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. There are many types of lymphoma. 
Hemophilia 	  Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body’s ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.

Why check your blood pressure? It’s a good idea to have a blood pressure test as part of a routine physical, especially in adulthood. High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. It’s important to know if you have high blood pressure, so it can be treated. A combination of medications and lifestyle changes can be successful in lowering your blood pressure. 
Blood  Pressure 	  The health of your whole body depends on the good health of your cardiovascular system. One measure of the health of your cardiovascular system is blood pressure. Blood pressure occurs when circulating blood puts pressure on the walls of blood vessels. Since blood pressure is primarily caused by the beating of your heart, the walls of the arteries move in a rhythmic fashion. Blood in arteries is under the greatest amount of pressure. The pressure of the circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries and into the smaller blood vessels. Blood in veins is not under much pressure. 
Healthy  Blood  Pressure  Ranges 	  Blood pressure is read as two numbers. The first number is the systolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the pressure on the blood vessels when the heart beats. This is the time when there is the highest pressure in the arteries. The diastolic pressure, which is the second number, is when your blood pressure is lowest, when the heart is resting between beats. Healthy ranges for blood pressure are: • Systolic: less than 120 • Diastolic: less than 80 Blood pressure is written as systolic/diastolic. For example, a reading of 120/80 is said as "one twenty over eighty." These measures of blood pressure can change with each heartbeat and over the course of the day. Pressure varies with exercise, emotions, sleep, stress, nutrition, drugs, or disease. Studies have shown that people whose systolic pressure is around 115, rather than 120, have fewer health problems. Clinical trials have shown that people who have blood pressures at the low end of these ranges have much better long term cardiovascular health. Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer ( Figure 11.50). 
A digital sphygmomanometer is made of 	  an inflatable cuff and a pressure meter to measure blood pressure. This reading shows a blood pressure of 126/70. Hypertension, which is also called "high blood pressure," occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person’s systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person’s diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the "silent killer." Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. Some health conditions, as well as a person’s lifestyle and genetic background, can put someone at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure. As a person cannot alter their genetic background, lifestyle changes may be necessary to reduce the chance of developing high blood pressure. These changes include getting enough exercise, limiting the amount of sodium (salt) in the diet, not being overweight, not drinking alcohol to excess, and not smoking. Low blood pressure is not usually a concern, as long as there are no problems associated with the low pressure. Symptoms associated with low blood pressure include dizziness or lightheadedness, fainting, dehydration and unusual thirst, lack of concentration, blurred vision, nausea, and fatigue.

How do you "fix" arteries? When a blood vessel gets clogged, there is no medical equivalent of "Drano" that will clear it out. There is, however, a procedure known as angioplasty. A thin tube with a balloon is threaded through the blood vessels. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the clog against the artery wall. 
Cardiovascular  Diseases 	  A cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease that affects the cardiovascular system. But the term is usually used to describe diseases that are linked to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis ( Figure 11.51) is an inflammation of the walls of arteries that causes swelling and a buildup of material called plaque. Plaque is made of cell pieces, fatty substances, calcium, and connective tissue that builds up around the area of inflammation. As a plaque grows, it stiffens and narrows the artery, which decreases the flow of blood through the artery. Atherosclerosis normally begins in late childhood and is typically found in most major arteries. It does not usually have any early symptoms. Causes of atherosclerosis include a high-fat diet, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. Atherosclerosis becomes a threat to health when the plaque buildup prevents blood circulation in the heart or the brain. A blocked blood vessel in the heart can cause a heart attack. Blockage of the circulation in the brain can cause a stroke. Ways to prevent atherosclerosis include eating healthy foods, getting plenty of exercise and not smoking. These three factors are not as hard to control as you may think. If you smoke, STOP. Start a regular exercise program and watch what you eat. 
Atherosclerosis is sometimes referred to 	  as hardening of the arteries; plaque buildup decreases the blood flow through the artery. A diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels, which makes more plaque available to line artery walls and narrow your arteries. Cholesterol and saturated fats are found mostly in animal products such as meat, eggs, milk, and other dairy products. Check food labels to find the amount of saturated fat in a product. Also, avoid large amounts of salt and sugar. Be careful with processed foods, such as frozen dinners, as they can be high in fat, sugar, salt and cholesterol. Eat lots of fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, smaller portions of lean meats and fish, and whole grains such as oats and whole wheat. Limit saturated fats like butter, instead choose unsaturated vegetable oils such as canola oil. 
Coronary  Heart  Disease 	  Like any other muscle, your heart needs oxygen. Hearts have arteries that provide oxygen through the blood. They are known as coronary arteries. Coronary heart disease is the end result of the buildup of plaque within the walls of the coronary arteries. Coronary heart disease often does not have any symptoms. A symptom of coronary heart disease is chest pain. Occasional chest pain can happen during times of stress or physical activity. The pain of angina means the heart muscle fibers need more oxygen than they are getting. Most people with coronary heart disease often have no symptoms for many years until they have a heart attack. A heart attack happens when the blood cannot reach the heart because a blood vessel is blocked. If cardiac muscle is starved of oxygen for more than roughly five minutes, it will die. Cardiac muscle cells cannot be replaced, so once they die, they are dead forever. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death of adults in the United States. The image below shows the way in which a blocked coronary artery can cause a heart attack and cause part of the heart muscle to die ( Figure 11.52). Maybe one day stem cells will be used to replace dead cardiac muscle cells. 
Stroke 	  Atherosclerosis in the arteries of the brain can also lead to a stroke. A stroke is a loss of brain function due to a blockage of the blood supply to the brain. Risk factors for stroke include old age, high blood pressure, having a previous stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, and smoking. The best way to reduce the risk of stroke is to have low blood pressure. 
A blockage in a coronary artery stops 	  oxygen from getting to part of the heart muscle, so areas of the heart that depend on the blood flow from the blocked artery are starved of oxygen. 
Summary 	  • Atherosclerosis is a condition in which the inside of arteries become clogged with plaque, a deposit of fatty material. • Atherosclerosis can be dangerous when it prevents blood circulation to the heart or the brain, causing a heart attack or stroke.

Keeping  Your  Cardiovascular  System  Healthy 	  There are many risk factors that can cause a person to develop cardiovascular disease. A risk factor is anything that is linked to an increased chance of developing a disease. Some of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease you cannot control, but there are many risk factors you can control. Risk factors you cannot control include: • Age: The older a person is, the greater their chance of developing a cardiovascular disease. • Gender: Men under age 64 are much more likely to die of coronary heart disease than women, although the gender difference decreases with age. • Genetics: Family history of cardiovascular disease increases a person’s chance of developing heart disease. Risk factors you can control include many lifestyle factors: • Tobacco smoking: Giving up smoking or never starting to smoke is the best way to reduce the risk of heart disease. • Diabetes: Diabetes can cause bodily changes, such as high cholesterol levels, which are are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. • High cholesterol levels: High amounts of "bad cholesterol," increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. • Obesity: Having a very high percentage of body fat, especially if the fat is mostly found in the upper body, rather than the hips and thighs, increases risk significantly. • High blood pressure: If the heart and blood vessels have to work harder than normal, this puts the cardiovascular system under a strain. • Lack of physical activity: Aerobic activities, such as the one pictured below ( Figure 11.53), help keep your heart healthy. To reduce the risk of disease, you should be active for at least 60 minutes a day, five days a week. • Poor eating habits: Eating mostly foods that do not have many nutrients other than fat or carbohydrate leads to high cholesterol levels, obesity, and cardiovascular disease ( Figure 11.54). activity, such as basketball, is enough to help keep your cardiovascular system healthy. What is bad cholesterol? Cholesterol can’t dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as "bad" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. 
The  A’s  My Pyramid recommends 	  that you limit the amount of such foods in your diet to occasional treats. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. 
Summary 	  • A family history of cardiovascular disease increases a person’s chance of developing heart disease. • Having a poor diet and not getting enough exercise are two major causes of cardiovascular disease. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Healthy Heart For Life! Mayo Clinic at URL (2:10) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Describe how breathing works. • Define respiration, inhalation, and exhalation. • Summarize how the lungs allow air in, and how inhaled oxygen enters the bloodstream. Why do you breathe? We breathe because we need oxygen. Breathing also releases carbon dioxide from our bodies into the air. The respiratory system is the body system that brings air containing oxygen into the body and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Recall that oxygen is needed to make ATP. 
How  We  Breathe 	  Most of the time, you breathe without thinking about it. Breathing is mostly an involuntary action that is controlled by a part of your brain that also controls your heart beat. If you swim, do yoga, or sing, you know you can control your breathing, however. Taking air into the body through the nose and mouth is called inhalation. Pushing air out of the body through the nose or mouth is called exhalation. The woman pictured below is exhaling before she surfaces from the pool water ( Figure 11.55). Being able to control breathing is important for many activities, such as swimming. The woman in the photograph is exhaling as she exits the water. How do lungs allow air in? Air moves into and out of the lungs by the movement of muscles. The most important muscle in the process of breathing is the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle that spreads across the bottom of the rib cage. The diaphragm and rib muscles contract and relax to move air into and out of the lungs. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward. The rib muscles contract and cause the ribs to move outward. This causes the chest volume to increase. Because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside. This difference in air pressures causes air to be sucked into the lungs. When the diaphragm and rib muscles relax, air is pushed out of the lungs. Exhalation is similar to letting the air out of a balloon. How does the inhaled oxygen get into the bloodstream? The exchange of gasses between the lungs and the blood happens in tiny sacs called alveoli. The walls of the alveoli are very thin and allow gases to pass though them. The alveoli are lined with capillaries ( Figure 11.56). Oxygen moves from the alveoli to the blood in the capillaries that surround the alveoli. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves in the opposite direction, from capillary blood to the alveoli. The gases move by simple diffusion, passing from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. For example, initially there is more oxygen in the alveoli than in the blood, so oxygen moves by diffusion from the alveoli into the blood. 
Breathing and  Respiration 	  The process of getting oxygen into the body and releasing carbon dioxide is called respiration. Sometimes breathing is called respiration, but there is much more to respiration than just breathing. Breathing is only the movement of oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide out of the body. The process of respiration also includes the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the cells of the body.

What are the organs that help you breathe? When you think of the processes of breathing, the lungs probably come to mind. The lungs are the main organ of the respiratory system. However, many other organs are also needed for the process of respiration to take place. 
Organs of  The  Respiratory  System 	  Your respiratory system is made up of the tissues and organs that allow oxygen to enter your body and carbon dioxide to leave your body. Organs in your respiratory system include your: • Nose. • Mouth. • Larynx. • Pharynx. • Lungs. • Diaphragm. These structures are shown below ( Figure 11.57). 
The organs of 	  move air into and out of the body. the respiratory system What do you think is the purpose of each of these organs? • The nose and the nasal cavity filter, warm, and moisten the air you breathe. The nose hairs and the mucus produced by the cells in the nose catch particles in the air and keep them from entering the lungs. • Behind the nasal cavity, air passes through the pharynx, a long tube. Both food and air pass through the pharynx. • The larynx, also called the "voice box," is found just below the pharynx. Your voice comes from your larynx. Air from the lungs passes across thin tissues in the larynx and produces sound. • The trachea, or windpipe, is a long tube that leads down to the lungs, where it divides into the right and left bronchi. The bronchi branch out into smaller bronchioles in each lung. There is small flap called the epiglottis that covers your trachea when you eat or drink. The muscle controlling the epiglottis is involuntary and prevents food from entering your lungs or wind pipe. • The bronchioles lead to the alveoli. Alveoli are the little sacs at the end of the bronchioles ( Figure 11.58). They look like little bunches of grapes. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide in the alveoli. That means oxygen enters the blood, and carbon dioxide moves out of the blood. The gases are exchanged between the blood and alveoli by simple diffusion. • The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle that spreads across the bottom of the rib cage. When the diaphragm contracts, the chest volume gets larger, and the lungs take in air. When the diaphragm relaxes, the chest volume gets smaller, and air is pushed out of the lungs. "Grape-like" alveoli in the lungs.

Where does oxygen go in your body? Once you take in a breath of air, the oxygen doesn’t just stay there in your lungs. It has a lot of traveling to do! Oxygen has to reach each one of your cells. How do you think the oxygen is moved? 
The  Journey of a  Breath of  Air 	  Breathing is only part of the process of bringing oxygen to where it is needed in the body. After oxygen enters the lungs, what happens? heart. type of blood vessel. capillaries. the air during exhalation. 
Gas exchange is the movement of oxygen 	  into the blood and carbon dioxide out of the blood. Why is oxygen needed by each cell in your body? To make ATP, the usable form of cellular energy. Oxygen is needed in the final stage of cellular respiration, which is the process of converting glucose into ATP. This process is much more efficient in the presence of oxygen. Without oxygen, much less ATP is produced. As ATP is needed for the cells to function properly, every cell in your body needs oxygen. Getting that oxygen begins with inhaling. The oxygen moves into your blood, where it travels to every cell in your body. 
Summary 	  • Oxygen enters the lungs, then passes through the alveoli and into the blood. The oxygen is carried around the body in blood vessels. • Carbon dioxide moves into the blood capillaries and is brought to the lungs to be released into the air during exhalation.

Diseases of the  Respiratory  System 	  Respiratory diseases are diseases of the lungs, bronchial tubes, trachea, nose, and throat ( Figure 11.60). These diseases can range from a mild cold to a severe case of pneumonia. Respiratory diseases are common. Many are easily treated, while others may cause severe illness or death. Some respiratory diseases are caused by bacteria or viruses, while others are caused by environmental pollutants, such as tobacco smoke. Some diseases are genetic and, therefore, are inherited. This boy is suffering from whooping cough (also known as pertussis), which gets its name from the loud whooping sound that is made when the person inhales during a coughing fit. 
Bronchitis 	  Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchi, the air passages that conduct air into the lungs. The bronchi become red and swollen with infection. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses or bacteria, and may last several days or weeks. It is characterized by a cough that produces phlegm, or mucus. Symptoms include shortness of breath and wheezing. Acute bronchitis is usually treated with antibiotics. 
Asthma 	  Asthma is a chronic illness in which the bronchioles, the tiny branches into which the bronchi are divided, become inflamed and narrow ( Figure 11.61). The muscles around the bronchioles contract, which narrows the airways. Large amounts of mucus are also made by the cells in the lungs. People with asthma have difficulty breathing. Their chests feel tight, and they wheeze. Asthma can be caused by different things, such as allergies. Asthma can also be caused by cold air, warm air, moist air, exercise, or stress. The most common asthma triggers are illnesses, like the common cold. Asthma is not contagious and cannot be passed on to other people. Children and adolescents who have asthma can still lead active lives if they control their asthma. Asthma can be controlled by taking medication and by avoiding contact with environmental triggers for asthma, like smoking. 
Pneumonia 	  Pneumonia is an illness that occurs when the alveoli, the tiny sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place, become inflamed and filled with fluid. When a person has pneumonia, gas exchange cannot occur properly across the alveoli. Pneumonia can be caused by many things. Infection by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites can cause pneumonia. An injury caused by chemicals or a physical injury to the lungs can also cause pneumonia. Symptoms of pneumonia include cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. Treatment depends on the cause of pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics. Pneumonia is a common illness that affects people in all age groups. It is a leading cause of death among the elderly and people who are chronically and terminally ill. Asthma occurs when the bronchioles swell and the muscles around the bronchioles contract. 
Tuberculosis 	  Tuberculosis (TB) is a common and often deadly disease caused by a genus of bacterium called Mycobacterium. Tuberculosis most commonly attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. TB is a chronic disease, but most people who become infected do not develop the full disease. Symptoms include a cough, which usually contains mucus and coughing up blood. The TB bacteria are spread in the air when people who have the disease cough, sneeze, or spit, so it is very contagious. To help prevent the spread of the disease, public health notices, such as the one pictured below ( A public health notice from the early 20th century reminded people that TB could be spread very easily. 
Lung  Cancer 	  Lung cancer is a disease in which the cells found in the lungs grow out of control. The growing mass of cells can form a tumor that pushes into nearby tissues. The tumor will affect how these tissues work. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men, and the second most common in women. It is responsible for coughing (including coughing up blood), and weight loss. The most common cause of lung cancer is exposure to tobacco smoke. The inside of a lung showing cancerous tissue. 
Emphysema 	  Emphysema is a chronic lung disease caused by the breakdown of the lung tissue. Symptoms of emphysema include shortness of breath, especially during exercise, and chronic cough, usually due to cigarette smoking, and wheezing, especially during expiration. Damage to the alveoli ( Figure 11.64), is not curable. Smoking is the leading cause of emphysema. 
Causes of  Respiratory  Diseases 	  Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure 11.65). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics. Those caused by viruses cannot. Pollution is another common cause of respiratory disease. The quality of the air you breathe can affect the health of your lungs. Asthma, heart and lung diseases, allergies, and several types of cancers are all linked to air quality. Air pollution is not just found outdoors; indoor air pollution can also be responsible for health problems. Smoking is the major cause of chronic respiratory disease as well as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Exposure to tobacco smoke by smoking or by breathing air that contains tobacco smoke is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Regular smokers die about 10 years earlier than nonsmokers do. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes tobacco use as "the single most important preventable risk to human health The lung of a smoker who had emphysema (left). Tar, a sticky, black substance found in tobacco smoke, is evident. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (right), is a tobacco-related disease that is characterized by emphysema. This represents the influenza virus that causes the swine flu, or H1N1. 
The  Center for  Disease  Control and  Prevention recommends that children 	  between the ages of 6 months and 19 years get a flu vaccination each year. in developed countries and an important cause of [early] death worldwide." Simply stated: Stopping smoking can prevent many respiratory diseases. 
Summary 	  • Common diseases and conditions affecting the respiratory system include asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, tuberculosis, and emphysema. • Pollution, smoking, and pathogens can also contribute to diseases of the respiratory system.

Why sneeze into your elbow? Sneezing into your elbow can help stop the spread of a respiratory illness, like the flu or common cold. If you sneeze into your hands, you may then spread germs when you touch a doorknob or other surfaces. 
Keeping  Your  Respiratory  System  Healthy 	  We know that many respiratory illnesses are caused by bacteria or viruses. There are steps you can take to help the spread of these pathogens, and also to prevent you from catching one. Furthermore, many respiratory illnesses are caused by poor habits, such as smoking. Many of the diseases related to smoking are called lifestyle diseases. Lifestyle diseases are diseases that are caused by choices that people make in their daily lives. For example, the choice to smoke can lead to emphysema, cancer and heart disease in later life. But you can make healthy choices instead. There are many things you can do to keep yourself healthy. 
Avoid  Smoking 	  Cigarette smoking can cause serious diseases, so not smoking or quitting now are the most effective ways to reduce your risk of developing chronic respiratory diseases, such as lung cancer. Avoiding (or stopping) smoking is the single best way to prevent many respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Also, do your best to avoid secondhand smoke. 
Eat  Well,  Exercise  Regularly, and  Get  Rest 	  Eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep, and being active every day can help keep your respiratory system, cardiovascular system and immune system strong. Getting enough exercise makes your lungs stronger and better at giving your body the oxygen it needs. It also helps to boost your body fight germs that could make you sick. These can also, of course, keep your skeletal and muscular systems strong. 
Wash  Your  Hands 	  Washing your hands often, especially after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose, helps to protect you and others from diseases. Washing your hands for 20 seconds with soap and warm water can help prevent colds and flu. In one respect, you can think of hand washing as a survival skill. Some viruses and bacteria can live from 20 minutes to two hours or more on surfaces like cafeteria tables, doorknobs, and desks. Washing your hands often can remove many of these pathogens. Never touch your mouth, nose, or eyes without washing your hands. 
Avoid  Contact with  Others  When  Sick 	  Do not go to school or to other public places when you are sick. You risk spreading your illness to other people. You may also get even sicker if you catch something else. Do not share food and other things that go in the mouth, as in guzzling milk from the carton or double dipping chips. You never know what pathogens can be lurking around. Cover your mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and to dispose of the tissue yourself. No time to grab a tissue. Cough or sneeze into the inside of your elbow instead of your hands. 
Visit  Your  Doctor 	  Getting the recommended vaccinations can help prevent diseases, such as whooping cough and flu. In fact, a yearly flu vaccine is recommended for everyone who is at least 6 months of age. The flu vaccine is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications (like pneumonia) if they get sick with the flu. People who have certain medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, pregnant women, and people younger than 5 years (and especially those younger than 2), and people 65 years and older should also make sure they get the yearly flu vaccine. Seeking medical help for diseases like asthma can help stop the disease from getting worse. If you are unsure if you should go to the doctor, call the doctor’s office and ask.

What happens to your body’s waste? There is no space for a landfill in your body to contain wastes. You must be able to expel wastes from your body. This is the role of the excretory system. 
Excretion 	  So what happens to your body’s wastes? Obviously, you must get rid of them. This is the job of the excretory system. You remove waste as a gas (carbon dioxide), as a liquid (urine and sweat), and as a solid. Excretion is the process of removing wastes and excess water from the body. Recall that carbon dioxide travels through the blood and is transferred to the lungs where it is exhaled. In the large intestine, the remains of food are turned into solid waste for excretion. How is waste other than carbon dioxide removed from the blood? That is the role of the kidneys. Urine is a liquid waste formed by the kidneys as they filter the blood. If you are getting plenty of fluids, your urine should be almost clear. But you might have noticed that sometimes your urine is darker than usual. Do you know why this happens? Sometimes your body is low on water and trying to reduce the amount of water lost in urine. Therefore, your urine gets darker than usual. Your body is striving to maintain homeostasis through the process of excretion. Urine helps remove excess water, salts, and nitrogen from your body. Your body also needs to remove the wastes that build up from cell activity and from digestion. If these wastes are not removed, your cells can stop working, and you can get very sick. The organs of your excretory system help to release wastes from the body. The organs of the excretory system are also parts of other organ systems. For example, your lungs are part of the respiratory system. Your lungs remove carbon dioxide from your body, so they are also part of the excretory system. More organs of the excretory system are listed below ( Table 11.6).

The  Urinary  System 	  Sometimes, the urinary system ( Figure 11.66) is called the excretory system. But the urinary system is only one part of the excretory system. Recall that the excretory system is also made up of the skin, lungs, and large intestine, as well as the kidneys. The urinary system is the organ system that makes, stores, and gets rid of urine.

The kidneys filter the blood that passes 	  through them, and the urinary bladder stores the urine until it is released from the body. What is Urine? Urine is a liquid that is formed by the kidneys when they filter wastes from the blood. Urine contains mostly water, but it also contains salts and nitrogen-containing molecules. The amount of urine released from the body depends on many things. Some of these include the amount of fluid and food a person consumes and how much fluid they have lost from sweating and breathing. Urine ranges from colorless to dark yellow but is usually a pale yellow color. Light yellow urine contains mostly water. The darker the urine, the less water it contains. The urinary system also removes a type of waste called urea from your blood. Urea is a nitrogen-containing molecule that is made when foods containing protein, such as meat, poultry, and certain vegetables, are broken down in the body. Urea and other wastes are carried in the bloodstream to the kidneys, where they are removed and form urine. 
Summary 	  • The urinary system is made up of the kidneys, the ureters, the bladder, and the urethra. • Urine is the liquid that is formed by the kidneys when they filter wastes from the blood.

Why are the kidneys important? These kidney beans are named after a very important organ in your body. Though you probably can live without these beans, you can’t live without at least one kidney. The kidneys have several essential functions. For example, kidneys filter your blood, removing wastes and regulating the amount of water in your body. 
The  Kidneys 	  The kidneys ( Figure 11.67) are important organs in maintaining homeostasis, the ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment despite a changing environment. Kidneys perform a number of homeostatic functions. • They maintain the volume of body fluids. • They maintain the balance of salt ions in body fluids. • They excrete harmful nitrogen-containing molecules, such as urea, ammonia, and uric acid. There are many blood vessels in the kidneys ( Figure 11.67). The kidneys remove urea and other wastes from the blood through tiny filtering units called nephrons. Nephrons ( Figure 11.68) are tiny, tube-shaped structures found 
Structures of the kidney; fluid leaks from 	  the capillaries and into the nephrons where the fluid forms urine then moves to the ureter and on to the bladder. inside each kidney. Each kidney has up to a million nephrons. Each nephron collects a small amount of fluid and waste from a small group of capillaries. Nitrogen-containing wastes, together with water and other wastes, form the urine as it passes through the nephrons and the kidney. The fluid within nephrons is carried out into a larger tube in the kidney called a ureter, which carries it to the bladder ( Figure 11.68). The kidneys never stop filtering waste products from the blood, so they are always producing urine. The amount of urine your kidneys produce is dependent on the amount of fluid in your body. Your body loses water through sweating, breathing, and urination. The water and other fluids you drink every day help to replace the lost water. This water ends up circulating in the blood because blood plasma is mostly water. 
Formation of  Urine 	  The process of urine formation is as follows: Capillaries and nephrons lie very close to each other in the kidney. into the nephron. 
Nephrons filter about 1 	  liters of the fluid is released as urine. Urine enters the bladder through the ureters. Similar to a balloon, the walls of the bladder are stretchy. The stretchy walls allow the bladder to hold a large amount of urine. The bladder can hold about 1 1 The location of nephrons in the kidney. 
The fluid collects in the nephron tubules 	  and moves to the bladder through the ureter. How do you know when you have to urinate? Urination is the process of releasing urine from the body. Urine leaves the body through the urethra. Nerves in the bladder tell you when it is time to urinate. As the bladder first fills with urine, you may notice a feeling that you need to urinate. The urge to urinate becomes stronger as the bladder continues to fill up. 
Brain  Control of  Urination 	  The filtering action of the kidneys is controlled by the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is about the size of a pea and is found below the brain ( Figure 11.69). The pituitary gland releases hormones that help the kidneys to filter water from the blood. The movement of water back into blood is controlled by a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is one of the hormones released from the pituitary gland in the brain. One of the most important roles of ADH is to control the body’s ability to hold onto water. If a person does not drink enough water, ADH is released. It causes the blood to reabsorb water from the kidneys. If the kidneys remove less water from the blood, what will the urine look like? It will look darker, because there is less water in it. When a person drinks a lot of water, then there will be a lot of water in the blood. The pituitary gland will then release a lower amount of ADH into the blood. This means less water will be reabsorbed by the blood. The kidneys then produce a large volume of urine. What color will this urine be? 
Summary 	  • Water and waste molecules move out of the blood capillaries and into the nephrons of the kidney to form the urine. • ADH is the hormone released by the pituitary gland and controls how water is reabsorbed by the blood from the kidneys. The pituitary gland (green) is found directly below the brain and releases hormones that control how urine is produced.

Why drink water? It’s always a good idea to drink plenty of fluids, especially when you have been exercising. Drinking plenty of water helps to flush away materials that might form kidney stones. Staying hydrated is the best way to prevent kidney stones. 
Problems of the  Excretory  System 	  The urinary system controls the amount of water in the body and removes wastes. Any problem with the urinary system can also affect many other body systems. 
Kidney  Stones 	  In some cases, certain mineral wastes can form kidney stones ( Figure 11.70). Stones form in the kidneys and may be found anywhere in the urinary system. Often, stones form when the urine becomes concentrated, allowing minerals to crystallize and stick together. They can vary in size, from small stones that can flow through your urinary system, to larger stones that cannot. Some stones cause great pain, while others cause very little pain. Some stones may need to be removed by surgery or ultrasound treatments. What are the symptoms of kidney stones? You may have a kidney stone if you have pain while urinating, see blood in your urine, and/or feel a sharp pain in your back or lower abdomen (the area between your chest and hips). The A kidney stone. The stones can form anywhere in the urinary system. pain may last for a long or short time. You may also have nausea and vomiting with the pain. If you have a small stone that passes on its own easily, you may not experience any symptoms. If you have some of these symptoms, you should see your doctor. 
Kidney failure 	  Kidney failure happens when the kidneys cannot remove wastes from the blood. If the kidneys are unable to filter wastes from the blood, the wastes build up in the body. Kidney failure can be caused by an accident that injures the kidneys, the loss of a lot of blood, or by some drugs and poisons. Kidney failure may lead to permanent loss of kidney function. But if the kidneys are not seriously damaged, they may recover. Chronic kidney disease is the slow decrease in kidney function that may lead to permanent kidney failure. A person who has lost kidney function may need to get kidney dialysis. Kidney dialysis is the process of filtering the blood of wastes using a machine. A dialysis machine ( Figure 11.71) filters waste from the blood by pumping the blood through a fake kidney. The filtered blood is then returned to the patient’s body. 
During dialysis, a patient’s blood is sent 	  through a filter that removes waste products. The clean blood is returned to the body. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are bacterial infections of any part of the urinary tract. When bacteria get into the bladder or kidney and produce more bacteria in the urine, they cause a UTI. The most common type of UTI is a bladder infection. Women get UTIs more often than men. UTIs are often treated with antibiotics. Most UTIs are not serious, but some infections can lead to serious problems. Long lasting kidney infections can cause permanent damage, including kidney scars, poor kidney function, high blood pressure, and other problems. Some sudden kidney infections can be life threatening, especially if the bacteria enter the bloodstream, a condition called septicemia. What are the signs and symptoms of a UTI? • a burning feeling when you urinate, • frequent or intense urges to urinate, even when you have little urine to pass, • pain in your back or side below the ribs, • cloudy, dark, bloody, or foul-smelling urine, • fever or chills. You should see your doctor if you have signs of a UTI. Your doctor will diagnose a UTIs by asking about your symptoms and then testing a sample of your urine.

All these processes are controlled by the nervous system. 
Introduction to the  Nervous  System 	  Michelle was riding her scooter when she hit a hole in the street and started to lose control. She thought she would fall, but, in the blink of an eye, she shifted her weight and kept her balance. Her heart was pounding, but at least she didn’t get hurt. How was she able to react so quickly? Michelle can thank her nervous system for that ( Figure The nervous system, together with the endocrine system, controls all the other organ systems. The nervous system sends one type of signal around the body, and the endocrine system sends another type of signal around the body. The endocrine system makes and releases chemical messenger molecules, or hormones, which tell other body parts that a change or a reaction is necessary. So what type of signal does the nervous system send? Controlling muscles and maintaining balance are just two of the roles of the nervous system. The nervous system also lets you: • Sense your surroundings with your eyes and other sense organs. • Sense the environment inside of your body, including temperature. 
Staying balanced when riding a scooter 	  requires control over the body’s muscles. 
The nervous system controls the muscles 	  and maintains balance. • Control your internal body systems and keep them in balance. • Prepare your body to fight or flee in an emergency. • Use language, think, learn, and remember. The nervous system works by sending and receiving electrical signals. The main organs of the nervous system are the brain and the spinal cord. The signals are carried by nerves in the body, similar to the wires that carry electricity all over a house. The signals travel from all over the body to the spinal cord and up to the brain, as well as moving in the other direction. For example, when Michelle started to fall off her scooter, her nervous system sensed that she was losing her balance. It responded by sending messages from her brain to muscles in her body. Some muscles tightened while others relaxed. Maybe these actions moved her hips or her arms. The nervous system, working together with the muscular and skeletal systems, allowed Michelle to react to the situation. As a result, Michelle’s body became balanced again. The messages released by the nervous system traveled through nerves. Just like the electricity that travels through wires, nerve quickly carry the electrical messages around the body. Think about how quickly all this happens. It has to be really fast, otherwise Michelle would not have been able to react. What would happen if a car pulled out unexpectedly in front of Michelle? A signal would have to go from her eyes to her brain and then to her muscles. What allows the nervous system to react so fast. It starts with the special cell of the nervous system, the neuron.

Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Nervous System at URL • Define neuron and synapse. • Describe neuron structure. • Explain the role of the dendrites and axon. • Distinguish sensory neurons from motor neurons. • Summarize what happens when a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon. What do nerve cells look like? Note that like most other cells, these nerve cells have a nucleus. They also have other organelles. However, the long, threadlike extensions of the nerve cells are unique. This is where the nerve impulses are transmitted. 
Neurons and  Nerve  Impulses 	  The nervous system is made up of nerves. A nerve is a bundle of nerve cells. A nerve cell that carries messages is called a neuron ( Figure 11.73). The messages carried by neurons are called nerve impulses. Nerve impulses can travel very quickly because they are electrical impulses. Think about flipping on a light switch when you enter a room. When you flip the switch, the electricity flows to the light through wires inside the walls. The electricity may have to travel many meters to reach the light, but the light still comes on as soon as you flip the switch. Nerve impulses travel just as fast through the network of nerves inside the body. 
The axons of many neurons, like the one 	  shown here, are covered with a fatty layer called myelin sheath. The sheath covers the axon, like the plastic covering on an electrical wire, and allows nerve impulses to travel faster along the axon. The node of Ranvier, shown in this diagram, is any gap in the myelin sheath; it allows faster transmission of a signal. What Does a Neuron Look Like? A neuron has a special shape that lets it pass signals from one cell to another. A neuron has three main parts ( Figure The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles. Dendrites and axons connect to the cell body, similar to rays coming off of the sun. Dendrites receive nerve impulses from other cells. Axons pass the nerve impulses on to other cells. A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites, so it can communicate with thousands of other cells but only one axon. The axon is covered with a myelin sheath, a fatty layer that insulates the axon and allows the electrical signal to travel much more quickly. The node of Ranvier is any gap within the myelin sheath exposing the axon, and it allows even faster transmission of a signal. 
Types of  Neurons 	  Neurons are usually classified based on the role they play in the body. Two main types of neurons are sensory neurons and motor neurons. • Sensory neurons carry nerve impulses from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system. • Motor neurons carry nerve impulses from the central nervous system to organs, glands, and muscles—the opposite direction. Both types of neurons work together. Sensory neurons carry information about the environment found inside or outside of the body to the central nervous system. The central nervous system uses the information to send messages through motor neurons to tell the body how to respond to the information. 
The  Synapse 	  The place where the axon of one neuron meets the dendrite of another is called a synapse. Synapses are also found between neurons and other types of cells, such as muscle cells. The axon of the sending neuron does not actually touch the dendrite of the receiving neuron. There is a tiny gap between them, the synaptic cleft ( Figure 11.74). 
This diagram shows a synapse between 	  neurons. When a nerve impulse arrives at the end of the axon, neurotransmitters are released and travel to the dendrite of another neuron, carrying the nerve impulse from one neuron to the next. The following steps describe what happens when a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon. Did you ever watch a relay race? After the first runner races, he or she passes the baton to the next runner, who takes over. Neurons are a little like relay runners. Instead of a baton, they pass neurotransmitters to the next neuron. Examples of neurotransmitters are chemicals such as serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline. You can watch an animation of nerve impulses and neurotransmitters at URL rons_intro/neurons_intro.php . Some people have low levels of the neurotransmitter called serotonin in their brain. Scientists think that this is one cause of depression. Medications called antidepressants help bring serotonin levels back to normal. For many people with depression, antidepressants control the symptoms of their depression and help them lead happy, productive lives.

What’s the control center of your body? Your brain is like the control center of your body. It controls your breathing and heartbeat. It helps you to think and learn. The brain is so "central" to all your body systems, it’s not surprising that the brain and spinal cord are called the central nervous system. 
The  Central  Nervous  System 	  The central nervous system (CNS) ( Figure 11.75) is the largest part of the nervous system. It includes the brain and the spinal cord. The bony skull protects the brain. The spinal cord is protected within the bones of the spine, which are called vertebrae. 
The  Brain 	  What weighs about three pounds and contains up to 100 billion cells? The answer is the human brain. The brain is the control center of the nervous system. It’s like the pilot of a plane. It tells other parts of the nervous system what to do. The brain is also the most complex organ in the body. Each of its 100 billion neurons has synapses connecting it with thousands of other neurons. All those neurons use a lot of energy. In fact, the adult brain uses almost a quarter of the total energy used by the body. The developing brain of a baby uses an even greater amount of the body’s total energy. 
The brain and spinal cord make up the 	  central nervous system. The brain is the organ that lets us understand what we see, hear, or sense in other ways. It also allows us to use language, learn, think, and remember. The brain controls the organs in our body and our movements as well. The brain consists of three main parts, the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem ( Figure 11.76). that we are aware of, such as problem-solving and speech. It also controls voluntary movements, like waving to a friend. Whether you are doing your homework or jumping hurdles, you are using your cerebrum. cerebellum controls body position, coordination, and balance. Whether you are riding a bicycle or writing with a pen, you are using your cerebellum. brain stem controls basic body functions, such as breathing, heartbeat, and digestion. The brain stem also carries information back and forth between the cerebrum and spinal cord. The cerebrum is divided into a right and left half ( Figure 11.76). Each half of the cerebrum is called a hemisphere. The two hemispheres are connected by a thick bundle of axons called the corpus callosum. It lies deep inside the brain and carries messages back and forth between the two hemispheres. Did you know that the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body? By connecting the two hemispheres, the corpus callosum allows this to happen. Each hemisphere of the cerebrum is divided into four parts, called lobes. The four lobes are the: 
Side view of the brain (right).  Can you 	  find the locations of the three major parts of the brain? Top view of the brain (left). Each lobe has different jobs. Some of the functions are listed below ( Table 11.7). 
The  Spinal  Cord 	  Main Function(s) 
Sight 	  The spinal cord is a long, tube-shaped bundle of neurons, protected by the vertebrae. It runs from the brain stem to the lower back. The main job of the spinal cord is to carry nerve impulses back and forth between the body and brain. The spinal cord is like a two-way highway. Messages about the body, both inside and out, pass through the spinal cord to the brain. Messages from the brain pass in the other direction through the spinal cord to tell the body what to do. 
Summary 	  • The central nervous system is made up of the brain and the spinal cord. • The brain consists of three main parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem.

How does your brain connect to the rest of your body? You know you have nerves in your fingers and toes because you can feel them. But how does your brain know what’s going on in these nerves? You have a network of nerves running from your brain and spinal cord to your fingers and toes and the rest of your body. This network is known as the peripheral nervous system. 
The  Peripheral  Nervous  System 	  There are other nerves in your body that are not found in the brain or spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) ( Figure 11.77) contains all the nerves in the body that are found outside of the central nervous system. They include nerves of the hands, arms, feet, legs, and trunk. They also include nerves of the scalp, neck, and face. Nerves that send and receive messages to the internal organs are also part of the peripheral nervous system. 
The blue lines in this drawing represent 	  nerves of the peripheral nervous system. Every peripheral nerve is connected directly or indirectly to the spinal cord. Notice the thick sciatic nerve. It is the longest (and thickest) nerve in the body, running from the lower region of the spinal cord to just above the knee. The peripheral nervous system is divided into two parts, the sensory division and the motor division. How these divisions of the peripheral nervous system are related to the rest of the nervous system is shown below ( Figure 
The  Sensory  Division 	  The sensory division carries messages from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system. Human beings have several senses. They include sight, hearing, balance, touch, taste, and smell. We have special sense organs for each of these senses. What is the sense organ for sight? For hearing? Sensory neurons in each sense organ receive stimuli, or messages from the environment that cause a response in the body. For example, sensory neurons in the eyes send messages to the brain about light. Sensory neurons in the skin 
The sensory division interprets messages 	  from sense organs and internal organs, and the motor division sends messages to internal organs, glands, and muscles. send messages to the brain about touch. Our sense organs recognize sensations, but they don’t tell us what we are sensing. For example, when you breathe in chemicals given off by baking cookies, your nose does not tell you that you are smelling cookies. That’s your brain’s job. The sense organs send messages about sights, smells, and other stimuli to the brain ( Figure 11.79). The brain then reads the messages and tells you what they mean. A certain area of the brain receives and interprets information from each sense organ. For example, information from the nose is received and interpreted by the temporal lobe of the cerebrum. Which senses would be stimulated by these raspberries? 
The  Motor  Division 	  The motor division of the peripheral system carries messages from the central nervous system to internal organs and muscles. The motor division is also divided into two parts ( Figure 11.78), the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system carries messages that control body movements. It is responsible for activities that are under your control, such as waving your hand or kicking a ball. The girl pictured below ( Figure 11.80) is using her somatic nervous system to control the muscles needed to play the violin. Her brain sends messages to motor neurons that move her hands so she can play. Without the messages from her brain, she would not be able to move her hands and play the violin. The autonomic nervous system carries nerve impulses to internal organs. It controls activities that are not under your control, such as sweating and digesting food. The autonomic nervous system has two parts: 
These women’s central nervous systems 	  are controlling the movements of their hands and arms as they play the violin. Their brains send commands to their somatic nervous system, which controls the muscles of their hands and arms. fight or flight ( Figure 11.81). For example, it increases the heart rate and the flow of blood to the legs, so you can run away from danger. processes like digestion, heartbeat, and breathing when there is not an emergency. The woman pictured here is just pretending to be frightened, but assuming that she really was scared, think of which division of the autonomic nervous system would prepare her body for an emergency. Have you ever become frightened and felt your heart start pounding? How does this happen? The answer is your autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic division prepared you to deal with a possible emergency by increasing your heart rate. The fact that this happened in the blink of an eye shows how amazing the nervous system is.

How have you used your vision today? Maybe you were just doing some schoolwork. Or walking down the hallway. No matter what you were doing, you were probably using your sense of sight. You may depend on your sense of sight so much that it’s hard to think of anything you do without it, except sleep. Why is sight so important? 
The  Nature of  Human  Vision 	  Think about all the ways that students use their sense of sight during a typical school day. As soon as they open their eyes in the morning, they might look at the clock to see what time it is. Then, they might look out the window to see what the weather is like. They probably look in a mirror to comb their hair. In school, they use their eyes to read the board, their textbooks, and the expressions on their friends’ faces. After school, they might keep their eye on the ball while playing basketball ( Figure 11.82). Then, they might read their homework assignment and text messages from their friends. Sight, or vision, is the ability to see light. It depends on the eyes detecting light and forming images. It also depends on the brain making sense of the images, so that we know what we are seeing. Human beings and other primates depend on vision more than many other animals. It’s not surprising, then, that we have a better sense of vision than many other animals. Not only can we normally see both distant and close-up objects clearly, but we can also see in three dimensions and in color. But humans do not have the best vision. You may think you see things fairly clearly. Imagine if you could see even better. How about 8 times better? Raptors, or birds of prey, including the eagles, hawks and falcons can see up to Why do you think they have such a good sense of vision? Other animals also have much better night vision then us. 
All eyes are on the ball in this basketball 	  game. Think about how we use the sense of sight in other games. 
Seeing in  Three  Dimensions 	  Did you ever use 3-D glasses to watch a movie, like the boy pictured below ( Figure 11.83)? If you did, then you know that the glasses make people and objects in the movie appear to jump out of the screen. They make images on the flat movie screen seem more realistic because they give them depth. That’s the difference between seeing things in two dimensions and three dimensions. This boy is wearing 3-D glasses; when you look at objects and people in the real world, your eyes automatically see in three dimensions. We are able to see in three dimensions because we have two eyes facing the same direction but a few inches apart. As a result, we see objects and people with both eyes at the same time but from slightly different angles. Hold up a finger a few inches away from your face, and look at it, first with one eye and then with the other. You’ll notice that your finger appears to move. Now hold up your finger at arm’s length, and look at it with one eye and then the other. Your finger seems to move less than it did when it was closer. Although you aren’t aware of it, your brain constantly uses such differences to determine the distance of objects. 
Seeing in  Color 	  For animals like us that see in color, it may be hard to imagine a world that appears to be mainly shades of gray. You can get an idea of how many other animals see the world by looking at a black-and-white picture of colorful objects. For example, look at the apple on the tree pictured below ( Figure 11.84). In the top picture, they appear in color, the way you would normally see them. In the bottom picture they appear without color, in shades of gray ( Figure Humans with color vision see the apple on this tree; the bright red color of the apple stands out clearly from the green background of leaves. This black-and-white picture gives an idea of how many animals see the world. Dogs and cats would see the green and red colors as shades of gray; they are able to see blue, but red and green appear the same to them. Many animals see just one or two colors. Some see colors that we cannot see. Apes and chimps see the same colors as us. But whereas many animals cannot see colors, some animals see colors that we cannot. The range of color vision of bees and butterflies for example, extends beyond the visible spectrum of light we can see. The leaves of the flowers they pollinate have special ultraviolet patterns which guide the insects deep into the flower. 
Evolution and  Primate  Vision 	  Why do you think primates, including humans, evolved the ability to see in three dimensions and in color? To answer that question, you need to know a little about primate evolution. Millions of years ago, primate ancestors lived in trees. To move about in the trees, they needed to be able to judge how far away the next branch was. Otherwise, they might have a dangerous fall. Being able see in depth was important. It was an adaptation that would help tree-living primates survive. Primate ancestors also mainly ate fruit. They needed to be able to spot colored fruits in the leafy background of the trees ( Figure 11.86). They also had to be able to judge which fruits were ripe and which were still green. Ripe fruits are usually red, orange, yellow, or purple. Being able to see in color was important for finding food. It was an adaptation that would help fruit-eating primates survive. 
Summary 	  • Vision depends on the eyes detecting light and forming images, and then the brain must make sense of the images. With color vision, you can tell which cherries in this picture are ripe, because cherries turn red as they ripen. • Humans can see in three dimensions and color.

How do you see the board? As you are sitting in the classroom, you may at first be focused on a paper directly in front of you. Then you may look to the front of the room to see a math problem worked out on the board. How can your eyes focus directly in front of you and then, a second later, at a distance? Your eyes are rather amazing! 
How the  Eye  Works 	  The job of the eye is to focus light. The parts of the eye ( Figure 11.87) help it to carry out its job. Follow the path of light through the eye as you read about it below. Vision involves sensing and focusing light from people and objects. The steps involved are as follows: the eye. structure. Along with the cornea, the lens helps focus light at the back of the eye. This is pictured below ( shape to bend the light by just the right amount to bring objects into focus. 
The human eye is a complex structure 	  that senses light; the light passes through the cornea, pupil, and lens, and is focused on the retina. The vitreous humor is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye, and the hyaloid canal is a small transparent canal running through the vitreous humor from the optical disc to the lens. sensing photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. Rods let us see in dim light. Cones let us detect light of different colors. nerve impulses travel to the brain through the optic nerve. 
Light from objects at different distances is 	  focused by the lens of the eye. Muscles in the eye control the shape of the lens so the light is focused on the back of the eye no matter how far the object is from the lens. 
Summary 	  • Light entering the eye is focused by the lens on the retina, which sends messages to the brain through the optic nerve. • Muscles in the eye control the shape of the lens so the light is focused on the back of the eye no matter how far the object is from the lens. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Anatomy and Function of the Eye at URL (2:00) Click image to the left or use the URL below. organisms to control how much light enters the eye? • Define myopia and hyperopia. • Explain how lenses correct vision problems. Why get an eye exam? During a routine eye exam, your vision will be evaluated to see if you need glasses or contacts. Also, the eye doctor checks your eyes for diseases that could lead to vision loss. About one of every two people end up needing some sort of vision correction during their lifetime. 
Vision  Correction 	  You probably know people who need eyeglasses or contact lenses to see clearly. Maybe you need them yourself. Lenses are used to correct vision problems. Two of the most common vision problems are myopia and hyperopia. 
Myopia 	  Myopia is also called nearsightedness. It affects about one third of people. People with myopia can see nearby objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. The picture below shows how a person with myopia might see two boys that are a few meters away ( Figure 11.89). In myopia, the eye is too long. Below, you can see how images are focused on the retina of someone with myopia ( Figure 11.90). Myopia is corrected with a concave lens, which curves inward like the inside of a bowl. The lens changes the focus, so images fall on the retina as they should. Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to 
On the left, you can see how a person with 	  normal vision sees two boys. The right image shows how a person with myopia sees the boys. 
The eye of a person with myopia is longer 	  than normal. As a result, images are focused in front of the retina (top left). A concave lens is used to correct myopia to help focus images on the retina (top right). Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when objects are focused in back of the retina (bottom left). It is corrected with a convex lens (bottom right). develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Eyeglasses or contact lenses can easily help with myopia. Depending on the amount of myopia, you may only need to wear glasses or contact lenses for certain activities, like watching a movie or driving a car. Or, if you are very nearsighted, they may need to be worn all the time. 
Farsightedness 	  Farsightedness is also known as hyperopia. It affects about one fourth of people. People with hyperopia can see distant objects clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. In hyperopia, the eye is too short. This results in images being focused in back of the retina ( Figure 11.90). Hyperopia is corrected with a convex lens, which curves outward like the outside of a bowl. The lens changes the focus so that images fall on the retina as they should. Common signs of farsightedness include difficulty in concentrating and maintaining a clear focus on close objects, eye strain, fatigue and headaches after close work, and aching or burning eyes, especially after intense concentration on close work. In addition to lenses, many cases of myopia and hyperopia can be corrected with surgery. For example, a procedure called LASIK (Laser-Assisted in situ Keratomileusis) uses a laser to permanently change the shape of the cornea so light is correctly focused on the retina.

Feeling dizzy? Have you ever gotten off a spinning ride at an amusement park and felt dizzy? Why does this happen? It actually all goes back to your ears! When you stop spinning, the fluid in the canals of your ears is still moving. Sensing the position of the liquid in the canals usually helps you keep balance, so spinning the fluid throws you off balance. 
Hearing and  Balance 	  What do listening to music and riding a bike have in common? It might surprise you to learn that both activities depend on your ears. The ears do more than just detect sound. They also sense the position of the body and help maintain balance. 
Hearing 	  Hearing is the ability to sense sound. Sound travels through the air in waves, much like the waves you see in the water pictured below ( Figure 11.91). Sound waves in air cause vibrations inside the ears. The ears sense the vibrations. The human ear is pictured below ( Figure 11.92). As you read about it, trace the path of sound waves through the ear. Assume a car horn blows in the distance. Sound waves spread through the air from the horn. Some of the sound waves reach your ear. The steps below show what happens next. They explain how your ears sense the sound. 
Sound waves travel through the air in all 	  directions away from a sound, like waves traveling through water away from where a pebble was dropped. 
Read the names of the parts of the ear in 	  the text; then find each of the parts in the diagram. Note that the round window is distinct from the oval window. in the ear. that vibrates like the head of a drum when sound waves hit it. vibrations through the ear. ear. ear. vibrations pass through, like the waves in water when you drop a pebble into a pond. Tiny hair cells line the cochlea and bend when the liquid moves. When the hair cells bend, they release neurotransmitters. nerve). The brain reads the sound and “tells” you what you are hearing. No doubt you’ve been warned that listening to loud music or other loud sounds can damage your hearing. It’s true. In fact, repeated exposure to loud sounds is the most common cause of hearing loss. The reason? Very loud sounds can kill the tiny hair cells lining the cochlea. The hair cells do not generally grow back once they are destroyed, so this type of hearing loss is permanent. You can protect your hearing by avoiding loud sounds or wearing earplugs or other ear protectors. 
Balance 	  Did you ever try to stand on one foot with your eyes closed? Try it and see what happens, but be careful! It’s harder to keep your balance when you can’t see. Your eyes obviously play a role in balance. But your ears play an even bigger role. The gymnast pictured below ( Figure 11.93) may not realize it, but her ears—along with her cerebellum—are mostly responsible for her ability to perform on the balance beam. 
This gymnast 	  is using the semicircular canals in her ears, along with the cerebellum in her brain, to help keep her balance on the balance beam. The parts of the ears involved in balance are the semicircular canals. Above, the semicircular canals are colored purple ( Figure 11.92). The canals contain liquid and are like the bottle of water pictured below ( Figure 11.94). When the bottle tips, the water surface moves up and down the sides of the bottle. When the body tips, the liquid in the semicircular canals moves up and down the sides of the canals. Tiny hair cells line the semicircular canals. Movement of the liquid inside the canals causes the hair cells to send nerve impulses. The nerve impulses travel to the cerebellum in the brain along the vestibular nerve. In response, the cerebellum sends commands to muscles to contract or relax so that the body stays balanced. 
Summary 	  the cochlea. This bottle of water models the semicircular canals in your ears. When you tip the bottle, the water moves up or down the sides of the bottle; when you tip your head, the liquid inside the semicircular canals moves up and down the sides of the canals. Tiny hair cells lining the canals sense the movement of liquid and send messages to the brain.

What if you felt no pain? It might sound good to you to have a condition where you feel no pain. But actually this type of condition would be very dangerous. What would happen if you strained your back but felt no pain? Instead of resting your back, you might injure it further. 
Touch 	  When you look at the prickly cactus pictured below ( Figure 11.95), does the word "ouch" come to mind? Touching the cactus would be painful. Touch is the sense of pain, pressure, or temperature. Touch depends on sensory neurons, or nerve cells, in the skin. The skin on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and face has the most sensory neurons and is especially sensitive to touch. The tongue and lips are very sensitive to touch as well. Neurons that sense pain are also found inside the body in muscles, joints, and organs. If you have a stomach ache or pain from a sprained ankle, it’s because of these sensory neurons found inside of your body. The spines on this cactus are like needles; they help keep away animals that might want to eat the cactus. The following example shows how messages about touch travel from sensory neurons to the brain, as well as how the brain responds to the messages. Suppose you wanted to test the temperature of the water in a lake before jumping in. You might stick one bare foot in the water. Neurons in the skin on your foot would sense the temperature of the water and send a message about it to your central nervous system. The frontal lobe of the cerebrum would process the information. It might decide that the water is really cold and send a message to your muscles to pull your foot out of the water. In some cases, messages about pain or temperature don’t travel all the way to and from the brain. Instead, they travel only as far as the spinal cord, and the spinal cord responds to the messages by giving orders to the muscles. This allows you to respond to pain more quickly. When messages avoid the brain in this way, it forms a reflex arc, like the one shown below ( Figure 11.96). 
Touch  Receptors 	  Our sense of touch is controlled by a huge network of nerve endings and touch receptors. This system is responsible for all the sensations we feel, including cold, hot, smooth, rough, pressure, tickle, itch, pain, vibrations, and more. There are four main types of receptors: mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, pain receptors, and proprioceptors. • Mechanoreceptors perceive sensations such as pressure, vibrations, and texture. Your brain gets an enormous amount of information about the texture of objects through your fingertips because the ridges that make up your fingerprints are full of these sensitive receptors. • Thermoreceptors perceive sensations related to the temperature of objects. There are two basic categories of thermoreceptors: hot receptors and cold receptors. The highest concentration of thermoreceptors can be found in the face and ears. • Pain receptors, or nociceptor detect pain or stimuli that can or does cause damage to the skin and other tissues of the body. There are over three million pain receptors throughout the body, found in skin, muscles, bones, blood vessels, and some organs. • Proprioceptors detect the position of different parts of the body in relation to each other and the surrounding environment. These receptors are found in joints, tendons and muscles, and allow us to do fundamental things such as feeding or clothing ourselves. 
Reflex  Arc:  When a reflex hammer taps 	  your knee, you may immediately kick your leg—without even thinking about it. The nerve impulse from your knee travels to the spinal cord, and the spinal cord sends a message to your muscles to kick your leg. 
Summary 	  • Sensory neurons in the skin sense pain, pressure, and temperature. • When sensory messages only travel as far as the spinal cord, and skip the brain, this is called a reflex arc. Use the resources below to answer the questions that follow. • Human Senses at URL (1:05) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Describe how we identify different tastes and smells. • Describe the five tastes. Why are your senses of taste and smell important? Imagine you open a gallon of milk, and you suddenly smell a foul odor. Your sense of smell has informed you that the milk has spoiled. So you pour the spoiled milk down the kitchen sink. Your sense of smell has possibly kept you from getting sick! 
Taste and  Smell 	  The senses of taste and smell are more complicated than many people might think and have a surprisingly large impact on behavior, perception and overall health. Imagine your sense of smell disappearing as you age. Though this doesn’t usually happen, it could provide clues about diseases of the nervous system. What about differences in taste? Do all foods taste the same to all people? Are there some foods you would never eat because you don’t like the taste? Does this food taste good to other people? Genetic differences in taste could help predict what we eat, how well our metabolism works, and even whether or not we’re overweight. These two senses actually work together to provide some of the basic sensations of everyday life. 
Taste 	  Your sense of taste is controlled by sensory neurons, or nerve cells, on your tongue that sense the chemicals in food. The neurons are grouped in bundles within taste buds. Each taste bud actually has a pore that opens out to the surface of the tongue enabling molecules and ions taken into the mouth to reach the receptor cells inside. There are five different types of taste neurons on the tongue. Each type detects a different taste. The tastes are: substances. The use of salt can donate the sodium ion producing this taste. fruit, such as lemon, grape, orange, and sometimes melon. Children show a greater enjoyment of sour flavors than adults, and sour candy such as Lemon Drops, Shock Tarts and sour versions of Skittles and Starburst, is popular. Many of these candies contain citric acid. unsweetened cocoa, beer (due to hops), olives, and citrus peel. cheese, tomatoes, grains, and beans. A single taste bud contains 50–100 taste cells representing all 5 taste sensations. A stimulated taste receptor cell triggers action potentials in a nearby sensory neuron, which send messages to the brain about the taste. The brain then decides what tastes you are sensing. 
Smell 	  Your sense of smell also involves sensory neurons that sense chemicals. The neurons are found in the nose, and they detect chemicals in the air. Unlike taste neurons, which can detect only five different tastes, the sensory neurons in the nose can detect thousands of different odors. Have you ever noticed that you lose your sense of taste when your nose is stuffed up? That’s because your sense of smell greatly affects your ability to taste food. As you eat, molecules of food chemicals enter your nose (actually your nasal cavity). You experience the taste and smell at the same time. Being able to smell as well as taste food greatly increases the number of different flavors you are able to sense. For example, you can use your sense of taste alone to learn that a food is sweet, but you have to also use your sense of smell to learn that the food tastes like strawberry cheesecake. Specific scents are often associated with our memories of places and events. That’s because scents are more novel or specific than shapes or other things you might see. So an odor similar to that of your grandmother’s kitchen or pantry might be more quickly associated with your memories of that place than a similar sight, which might be more generalized.

For example, a vaccination to prevent meningitis, a serious infection of the nervous system, is now available. 
Diseases of the  Nervous  System 	  The nervous system controls sensing, feeling, and thinking. It also controls movement and just about every other body function. That’s why problems with the nervous system can affect the entire body. Diseases of the nervous system include brain and spinal cord infections. Other problems of the nervous system range from very serious diseases, such as tumors, to less serious problems, such as tension headaches. Some of these diseases are present at birth. Others begin during childhood or adulthood. 
Central  Nervous  System  Infections 	  When you think of infections, you probably think of an ear infection or strep throat. You probably don’t think of a brain or spinal cord infection. But bacteria and viruses can infect these organs as well as other parts of the body. Infections of the brain and spinal cord are not very common. But when they happen, they can be very serious. That’s why it’s important to know their symptoms. 
Encephalitis 	  Encephalitis is a brain infection ( Figure 11.97). If you have encephalitis, you are likely to have a fever and headache or feel drowsy and confused. The disease is most often caused by viruses. The immune system tries to fight off a brain infection, just as it tries to fight off other infections. But sometimes this can do more harm than good. The immune system’s response may cause swelling in the brain. With no room to expand, the brain pushes against the skull. This may injure the brain and even cause death. Medicines can help fight some viral infections of the brain, but not all infections. This scan shows a person with encephalitis. 
Meningitis 	  Meningitis is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. If you have meningitis, you are likely to have a fever and a headache. Another telltale symptom is a stiff neck. Meningitis can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Viral meningitis often clears up on its own after a few days. Bacterial meningitis is much more serious ( Figure 11.98). It may cause brain damage and death. People with bacterial meningitis need emergency medical treatment. They are usually given antibiotics to kill the bacteria. A vaccine to prevent meningitis recently became available. It can be given to children as young as two years old. Many doctors recommend that children receive the vaccine no later than age 12 or 13, or before they begin high school. 
These bacteria, shown at more than 	  cause of bacterial meningitis. Despite their tiny size, they can cause very serious illness. 
Reye’s  Syndrome 	  A condition called Reye’s syndrome can occur in young people that take aspirin when they have a viral infection. The syndrome causes swelling of the brain and may be fatal. Fortunately, Reye’s syndrome is very rare. The best way to prevent it is by not taking aspirin when you have a viral infection. Products like cold medicines often contain aspirin. So, read labels carefully when taking any medicines ( Figure 11.99). Since 1988, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has required that all aspirin and aspirin-containing products carry a warning about Reye’s syndrome. 
Other  Nervous  System  Diseases 	  Like other parts of the body, the nervous system may develop tumors. A tumor is a mass of cells that grows out of control. A tumor in the brain may press on normal brain tissues. This can cause headaches, difficulty speaking, or other problems, depending on where the tumor is located. Pressure from a tumor can even cause permanent brain damage. In many cases, brain tumors can be removed with surgery. In other cases, tumors can’t be removed without damaging the brain even more. In those cases, other types of treatments may be needed. Cerebral palsy is a disease caused by injury to the developing brain. The injury occurs before, during, or shortly after birth. Cerebral palsy is more common in babies that have a low weight at birth. But the cause of the brain injury is not often known. The disease usually affects the parts of the brain that control body movements. Symptoms range from weak muscles in mild cases to trouble walking and talking in more severe cases. There is no known cure for cerebral palsy. Epilepsy is a disease that causes seizures. A seizure is a period of lost consciousness that may include violent muscle contractions. It is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The cause of epilepsy may be an infection, a brain injury, or a tumor. The seizures of epilepsy can often be controlled with medicine. There is no known cure for the disease, but children with epilepsy may outgrow it by adulthood. A headache is a very common nervous system problem. Headaches may be a symptom of serious diseases, but they are more commonly due to muscle tension. A tension headache occurs when muscles in the shoulders, neck, and head become too tense. This often happens when people are “stressed out.” Just trying to relax may help relieve this type of headache. Mild pain relievers such as ibuprofen may also help. 
Sometimes 	  best “medicine” for a tension headache and to help muscles get rid of pain. relaxation is the A migraine is a more severe type of headache. It occurs when blood vessels in the head dilate, or expand. This may be triggered by certain foods, bright lights, weather changes, or other factors. People with migraines may also have nausea or other symptoms. Fortunately, migraines can often be relieved with prescription drugs. There are many other nervous system diseases. They include multiple sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. However, these diseases rarely, if ever, occur in young people. Their causes and symptoms are listed below ( Table 11.8). The diseases have no known cure, but medicines may help control their symptoms.

Injuries of the  Nervous  System 	  Injuries to the central nervous system may damage tissues of the brain or spinal cord. If an injury is mild, a person may have a full recovery. If an injury is severe, it may cause permanent disability or even death. Brain and spinal cord injuries most commonly occur because of car crashes or sports accidents. The best way to deal with such injuries is to try to prevent them. 
Brain  Injuries 	  Brain injuries can range from mild to extremely severe, but even mild injuries need medical attention. Brain injuries can result from falls, car accidents, violence, sports injuries, and war and combat. Falls are the most common cause of brain injuries, particularly in older adults and young children. The mildest and most common type of brain injury is a concussion. This is a bruise on the surface of the brain. It may cause temporary problems such as headache, drowsiness, and confusion. Most concussions in young people occur when they are playing sports, especially contact sports like football. Other sports, like soccer, boxing, baseball, lacrosse, skateboarding, and hockey can also result in concussions. A concussion normally heals on its own in a few days. A single concussion is unlikely to cause permanent damage. But repeated concussions may lead to lasting problems. People who have had two or more concussions may have life-long difficulties with memory, learning, speech, or balance. For this reason, concussions are treated very seriously among athletes and in professional sports. You can see an animation of how a concussion occurs by visiting URL nimation.aspx?gcid=000034&ptid=17 . A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. 
Symptoms of severe brain injuries include 	  • the loss of consciousness from several minutes to hours, • profound confusion, • slurred speech, • the inability to awaken from sleep, • seizures, • loss of coordination, • persistent headache or headache that worsens. 
Spinal  Cord  Injuries 	  A spinal cord injury is damage to any part of the spinal cord or nerves at the end of the spinal canal. This injury often causes permanent changes in strength, sensation and other body functions below the site of the injury. Spinal cord injuries make it difficult for messages to travel between the brain and body. They may cause a person to lose the ability to feel or move parts of the body. This is called paralysis. Whether paralysis occurs—and what parts of the body are affected if it does—depends on the location and seriousness of the injury. In addition to car crashes and sports injuries, diving accidents are a common cause of spinal cord injuries. Quadriplegia means your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury. Paraplegia means the paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs. These people can still use their arms and hands. Some people recover from spinal cord injuries. But many people are paralyzed for life. Thanks to the work of Christopher Reeve ( Figure 11.101), more research is being done on spinal cord injuries now than ever before. For example, scientists are trying to discover ways to regrow damaged spinal cord neurons. If you suspect that someone has a back or neck injury: • don’t move the injured person as permanent paralysis and other serious complications may result, • call 911 or your local emergency medical assistance number, • keep the person very still, • place heavy towels on both sides of the neck or hold the head and neck to prevent them from moving, until emergency care arrives, • provide basic first aid, such as stopping any bleeding and making the person comfortable, without moving the head or neck. 
Christopher  Reeve ( September 25, 1952 	  –October 10, 2004) was paralyzed from the neck down in a fall from a horse. 
The injury crushed his spinal cord so his 	  brain could no longer communicate with his body.

Do you like doing puzzles? Activities that challenge your brain, such as working on a Sudoku puzzle, are good for the health of your nervous system. Just like you need to work out your body to stay in shape, your brain also needs a good work out regularly in order to stay sharp. 
Keeping the  Nervous  System  Healthy 	  The nervous system is such an important part of your body. You want it to work at its best so that you can be at your best. Your nervous system contains what is probably the most important part of your body, which, of course, is your brain. Your brain allows you to learn. It allows you to feel emotions like love, anger, and sadness. Your brain gives you the ability to see, hear, taste, touch, and smell. It works together with the nerves and spinal cord to send the signals that make your body move. Your nervous system lets you do things like run, jump, play sports, and do your homework. There are many choices you can make to keep your nervous system healthy. One obvious choice is to avoid using alcohol or other drugs. Not only will you avoid the injury that drugs themselves can cause, but you will also be less likely to get involved in other risky behaviors that could harm your nervous system. Another way to keep the nervous system healthy is to eat a variety of healthy foods. The minerals sodium, calcium, and potassium, and vitamins B1 and B12 are important for a healthy nervous system. Some foods that are good sources for these minerals and vitamins include milk, whole grains, beef steak, and kidney beans (shown in Figure 11.102). Your brain also needs healthy fats like those in nuts and fish. Recall that fats insulate the axons of neurons. These fats help build new connections between nerves and brain cells. These fats may improve memory and increase learning and intelligence. Water is also important for the nervous system, so drink plenty of water and other fluids. This helps prevent dehydration, which can cause confusion and memory problems. And get plenty of rest. Your brain requires plenty of rest so it can strengthen circuits that help with memory. A good night’s sleep will help keep your brain functioning at its best. These foods are sources of nutrients needed for a healthy nervous system. Daily physical activity is also important for nervous system health. Regular exercise makes your heart more efficient at pumping blood to your brain. As a result, your brain gets more oxygen, which it needs to function normally. The saying “use it or lose it” applies to your brain as well as your body. This means that mental activity, not just physical activity, is important for nervous system health. Doing crossword puzzles, reading, and playing a musical instrument are just a few ways you can keep your brain active. You can also choose to practice safe behaviors to protect your nervous system from injury. To keep your nervous system safe, choose to: • Wear safety goggles or sunglasses to protect your eyes from injury. • Wear hearing protectors, such as ear plugs to protect your ears from loud sounds. • Wear a safety helmet for activities like bike riding and skating ( Figure 11.103). • Wear a safety belt every time you ride in a motor vehicle. • Avoid unnecessary risks, such as performing dangerous stunts on your bike. • Never dive into water that is not approved for diving. If the water is too shallow, you could seriously injure your brain or spinal cord. A few minutes of fun could turn into a lifetime in a wheelchair. 
Bicycle helmets help protect from head 	  injuries. Making healthy choices like this can help prevent nervous system injuries that could cause lifelong disability. Furthermore, make sure to exercise your nervous system on a daily basis. The simple act of writing requires that you use all the major components of your motor and sensory pathways. These include a number of different sensory receptors, peripheral nerves, synaptic connections within your spinal cord, major tracts within your spinal cord, and nerve tissue throughout your brain. All these components need to be utilized with great precision and coordination to produce neatly written words. What should you do? Spend a few minutes each day writing on paper as neatly as you can. This takes a lot more effort on the part of the nervous system than typing on a keyboard, as typing on a keyboard doesn’t require as much fine motor control as writing on paper. If you don’t want to write, then draw. Drawing with precision also requires use of all the major components of the sensory and motor divisions of the nervous system.

What are germs? You know germs can make you sick. They can live anywhere, from on your doorknob to in your food. A more scientific word for germ is pathogen. 
Pathogens 	  Has this ever happened to you? A student sitting next to you in class has a cold. The other student is coughing and sneezing, but you feel fine. Two days later, you come down with a cold, too. Diseases like colds are contagious. Contagious diseases are also called infectious diseases. An infectious disease is a disease that spreads from person to person. Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is a living thing or virus that causes disease. Pathogens are commonly called “germs.” They can travel from one person to another. 
Types of  Pathogens 	  Living things that cause human diseases include bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Most infectious diseases caused by these organisms can be cured with medicines. For example, medicines called antibiotics can cure most diseases caused by bacteria. Bacteria are one-celled organisms without a nucleus. Although most bacteria are harmless, some cause diseases. Worldwide, the most common disease caused by bacteria is tuberculosis (TB). TB is a serious disease of the lungs. Another common disease caused by bacteria is strep throat. You may have had strep throat yourself. Bacteria that cause strep throat are shown below ( Figure 11.104). Some types of pneumonia and many cases of illnesses from food are also caused by bacteria. 
The structures that 	  look like strings of beads are bacteria. 
They belong to 	  the genus Streptococcus. Bacteria of this genus cause diseases such as strep throat and pneumonia. They are shown here 900 times bigger than their actual size. Fungi are simple eukaryotic organisms that consist of one or more cells. They include mushrooms and yeasts. Human diseases caused by fungi include ringworm and athlete’s foot. Both are skin diseases that are not usually serious. A ringworm infection is pictured below ( Figure 11.105). A more serious fungus disease is histoplasmosis. It is a lung infection. Though fungal infections can be annoying, they are rarely as serious or deadly as bacterial or viral infections. Ringworm isn’t a worm at all. fungus causes a ring-shaped rash on the skin, like the one shown here. 
It’s a disease caused by a fungus.  The 	  Protozoa are one-celled organisms with a nucleus, making them eukaryotic organisms. They cause diseases such as malaria. Malaria is a serious disease that is common in warm climates. The protozoa infect people when they are bit by a mosquito. More than a million people die of malaria each year. Other protozoa cause diarrhea. An example is Giardia lamblia ( Figure 11.106). This picture shows a one-celled organism called Giardia lamblia. protozoan that causes diarrhea. 
It is a 	  Viruses are nonliving collections of protein and DNA that must reproduce inside of living cells. Viruses cause many common diseases. For example, viruses cause colds and the flu. Cold sores are caused by the virus Herpes simplex ( Figure 11.107). Antibiotics do not affect viruses, because antibiotics only kill bacteria. But medicines called antiviral drugs can treat many diseases caused by viruses. Keep in mind that viruses are nonliving, so can they be killed? The Herpes simplex virus, which is represented here, causes cold sores on the lips. Viruses are extremely small particles. This illustration is greatly magnified. 
How  Pathogens  Spread 	  Different pathogens spread in different ways. Some pathogens spread through food. They cause food borne illnesses, which are discussed in a previous concept. Some pathogens spread through water. Giardia lamblia is one example. Water can be boiled to kill Giardia and most other pathogens. Several pathogens spread through sexual contact. HIV is one example, which is discussed in the next concept. Other pathogens that spread through sexual contact are discussed in a separate concept. Many pathogens that cause respiratory diseases spread by droplets in the air. Droplets are released when a person sneezes or coughs. Thousands of tiny droplets are released when a person sneezes ( Figure 11.108). Each droplet can contain thousands of pathogens. Viruses that cause colds and the flu can spread in this way. You may get sick if you breathe in the pathogens. 
As this picture shows, thousands of tiny 	  droplets are released into the air when a person sneezes. Each droplet may carry thousands of pathogens. You can’t normally see the droplets from a sneeze because they are so small. However, you can breathe them in, along with any pathogens they carry. This is how many diseases of the respiratory system are spread. 
Pathogens on  Surfaces 	  Other pathogens spread when they get on objects or surfaces. A fungus may spread in this way. For example, you can pick up the fungus that causes athlete’s foot by wearing shoes that an infected person has worn. You can also pick up this fungus from the floor of a public shower or other damp areas. After acne, athlete’s foot is the most common skin disease in the United States. Therefore, the chance of coming in contact with the fungus in one of these ways is fairly high. Bacteria that cause the skin disease impetigo, which causes blisters, can spread when people share towels or clothes. The bacteria can also spread through direct skin contact in sports like wrestling. 
Pathogens and  Vectors 	  Still other pathogens are spread by vectors. A vector is an organism that carries pathogens from one person or animal to another. Most vectors are insects, such as ticks and mosquitoes. These insects tend to transfer protozoan or viral parasites. When an insect bites an infected person or animal, it picks up the pathogen. Then the pathogen travels to the next person or animal it bites. Ticks carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Mosquitoes ( Figure more serious symptoms may develop. Other diseases spread by mosquitoes include Dengue Fever and Yellow Fever. Some diseases are spread by insects. 
The type of mosquito shown here can 	  spread West Nile virus. The virus doesn’t make the mosquito sick. The mosquito just carries the virus from one person or animal to another. The mosquito is a vector. The first case of West Nile virus in North America occurred in 1999. Within just a few years, the virus had spread throughout most of the United States. Birds as well as humans can be infected with the virus. Birds often fly long distances. This is one reason why West Nile virus spread so quickly.

What does a red ribbon symbolize? This red ribbon is a symbol for support of HIV-positive people and those living with AIDS. As of 2010, an estimated 
V  Infection and  	  HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. AIDS stands for "acquired immune deficiency syndrome." It is a condition that causes death and does not have a known cure. AIDS usually develops 10 to 15 years after a person is first infected with HIV. The development of AIDS can be delayed with proper medicines. The delay can be well over 20 years with the right medicines. Today, individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age can expect to reach an average human life span. 
How  V  Spreads 	  HIV spreads through contact between an infected person’s body fluids and another person’s bloodstream or mucus membranes, which are found in the mouth, nose, and genital areas. Body fluids that may contain HIV are blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk. The virus can spread through sexual contact or shared drug needles. It can also spread from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth or breastfeeding. Saliva can carry the HIV virus, but it won’t spread it, unless the saliva gets into the bloodstream. Other body fluids such as urine and sweat do not contain the virus. HIV does not spread in any fluid in which the host cells cannot survive. Some people think they can become infected with HIV by donating blood or receiving donated blood. This is not true. The needles used to draw blood for donations are always new. Therefore, they cannot spread the virus. Donated blood is also tested to make sure it is does not contain HIV. HIV is not transmitted by day-to-day contact in the workplace, schools, or social settings. HIV is not transmitted through shaking hands, hugging, or a casual kiss. You cannot become infected from a toilet seat, a drinking fountain, a door knob, dishes, drinking glasses, food, or pets. 
V and the  Immune  System 	  How does an HIV infection develop into AIDS? HIV destroys white blood cells called helper T cells. The cells are produced by the immune system. This is the body system that fights infections and other diseases. HIV invades helper T cells and uses them to produce more virus particles ( Figure 11.110). Then, the virus kills the helper T cells. As the number of viruses in the blood rises, the number of helper T cells falls. Without helper T cells, the immune system is unable to protect the body. The infected person cannot fight infections and other diseases because they do not have T cells. This is why people do not die from HIV. Instead, they die from another illness, like the common cold, that they cannot fight because they do not have helper T cells. Medications can slow down the increase of viruses in the blood. But the medications cannot remove the viruses from the body. At present, there is no cure for HIV infection. A vaccine against HIV could stop this disease, and such a vaccine is in development, though it could take many years before it can be given to prevent this virus. In this picture, the large structure on the bottom is a human immune cell. It is infected with HIV. A new HIV particle is shown budding out of the immune cell. 
 	  AIDS is not really a single disease. It is a set of symptoms and other diseases. It results from years of damage to the immune system by HIV. AIDS occurs when helper T cells fall to a very low level, making it difficult for the affected person to fight various diseases and other infections. These people develop infections or cancers that people with a healthy immune systems can easily resist. These diseases are usually the cause of death of people with AIDS. The first known cases of AIDS occurred in 1981. Since then, AIDS has led to the deaths of more than 35 million people worldwide. Many of them were children. The greatest number of deaths occurred in Africa. It is also where medications to control HIV are least available. There are currently more people infected with HIV in Africa than any other part of the world. Well over 30 million people are living with HIV worldwide. 
Summary 	  • HIV causes AIDS by destroying disease-fighting cells produced by the immune system. • HIV spreads through contact between an infected person’s body fluids and another person’s bloodstream or mucus membranes; body fluids that may contain HIV include blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk.

What is this girl doing to prevent the spread of the flu? Notice how this girl is covering her nose and mouth with a tissue as she sneezes. This is a good habit that helps prevent her from passing on the flu virus to other people. Notice she is also staying home and resting instead of going out and possibly infecting others with her illness. 
Preventing  Infectious  Diseases 	  Infectious diseases are diseases that spread from person to person. They are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses or fungi. What can you do to avoid infectious diseases? Eating right and getting plenty of sleep are a good start. These habits will help keep your immune system healthy. With a healthy immune system, you will be able to fight off many pathogens. The next best way is to avoid pathogens. Though this is difficult, there are steps you can take to limit your exposure to pathogens. Here are the ten best ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. 
Avoiding  Pathogens 	  You can also take steps to avoid pathogens in the first place. The best way to avoid pathogens is to wash your hands often. You should wash your hands after using the bathroom or handling raw meat or fish. You should also wash your hands before eating or preparing food. In addition, you should also wash the food that your eat, and the utensils and countertop where food is prepared. In addition, you should wash your hands after being around sick people. The correct way to wash your hands is demonstrated below ( Figure 11.111). If soap and water aren’t available, use some hand sanitizer. 
This picture shows the proper way to 	  wash your hands. Frequent hand washing helps prevent the spread of pathogens. The best way to prevent diseases spread by vectors is to avoid contact with the vectors. Recall that a vector is an organism that carries pathogens from one person or animal to another. For example, ticks and mosquitoes are vectors, so you should wear long sleeves and long pants when appropriate to avoid tick and mosquito bites. Using insect repellent can also reduce your risk of insect bites. Many infectious diseases can be prevented with vaccinations. Immunization can drastically reduce your chances of contracting many diseases. You will read more about vaccinations in another concept. Vaccinations can help prevent measles, mumps, chicken pox, and several other diseases. If you do develop an infectious disease, try to avoid infecting others. Stay home from school until you are well. Also, take steps to keep your germs to yourself. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you sneeze or cough, and wash your hands often to avoid spreading pathogens to other people. Don’t go to work or school if you’re vomiting, have diarrhea or are running a fever (and if you are, drink plenty of fluids). Also, to avoid infectious diseases, don’t share personal items; use your own toothbrush, comb, and razor. And avoid sharing drinking glasses or dining utensils. Watching the news will allow you to make informed decisions. If an outbreak of bad beef due to a bacterial infection is in the news, don’t buy beef for a while. If tomatoes are making people sick, don’t eat tomatoes until the outbreak is over. If a place has an unhealthy water supply, boil the water or drink bottled water. Local news can tell you of restaurants to avoid due to unhealthy conditions. And so on. 
Summary 	  • A healthy lifestyle and frequent hand washing can help reduce your risk of infectious diseases. • To avoid infecting others when you are sick, stay home from school, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you sneeze or cough, and wash your hands often.

Cancer 	  Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen. Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. 
Pathogens 	  Pathogens that cause cancer include the human papilloma virus (HPV) ( Figure 11.112) and the hepatitis B virus. HPV is spread through sexual contact. It can cause cancer of the reproductive system in females. The hepatitis B virus is spread through sexual contact or contact with blood containing the virus. It can cause cancer of the liver. The mutations that cause cancer may occur when people are exposed to pathogens, such as the human papilloma virus (HPV), which is shown here. 
Chemicals 	  Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure 11.113). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel. The mutations that cause cancer may occur when people are exposed to chemical carcinogens, such as those in cigarettes. 
It can be argued that tobacco smoke is the 	  main source of chemical carcinogens. 
Radiation 	  Forms of radiation that cause cancer include ultraviolet (UV) radiation and radon ( Figure 11.114). UV radiation is part of sunlight. It is the leading cause of skin cancer. Radon is a natural radioactive gas that seeps into buildings from the ground. It can cause lung cancer. The mutations that cause cancer may occur when people are exposed to radiation, including the radiation from sunlight. 
Common  Types of  Cancer 	  Cancer is usually found in adults, especially in adults over the age of 50. The most common type of cancer in adult males is cancer of the prostate gland. The prostate gland is part of the male reproductive system. Prostate cancer makes up about one third of all cancers in men. The most common type of cancer in adult females is breast cancer. It makes up about one third of all cancers in women. In both men and women, lung cancer is the second most common type of cancer. Most cases of lung cancer happen in people who smoke. Cancer can also be found in children. But childhood cancer is rare. Leukemia is the main type of cancer in children. It makes up about one third of all childhood cancers. It happens when the body makes abnormal white blood cells. Sometimes cancer cells break away from a tumor. If they enter the bloodstream, they are carried throughout the body. Then, the cells may start growing in other tissues. This is usually how cancer spreads from one part of the body to another. Once this happens, cancer is very hard to stop or control. 
Treating  Cancer 	  If leukemia is treated early, it usually can be cured. In fact, many cancers can be cured, which is known as remission, if treated early. Treatment of cancer often involves removing a tumor with surgery. This may be followed by other types of treatments. These treatments may include drugs (known as chemotherapy) and radiation therapy, which kill cancer cells. The sooner cancer is treated, the greater the chances of a cure. This is why it is important to know the warning signs of cancer. Having warning signs does not mean that you have cancer. However, you should see a doctor to be sure. Everyone should know the warning signs of cancer. Detecting and treating cancer early can often lead to a cure. Some warning signs of cancer include: • Change in bowel or bladder habits. • Sores that do not heal. • Unusual bleeding or discharge. • Lump in the breast or elsewhere. • Chronic indigestion. • Difficulty swallowing. • Obvious changes in a wart or mole. • Persistent cough or hoarseness.

What do these foods have in common? These foods are all high in sugar. A person with diabetes has to avoid these types of foods. 
Diabetes 	  Diabetes is a non-infectious disease in which the body is unable to control the amount of sugar in the blood. People with diabetes have high blood sugar, either because their bodies do not produce enough insulin, or because their cells do not respond to insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells take up sugar from the blood. Without enough insulin, the blood contains too much sugar. This can damage blood vessels and other cells throughout the body. The kidneys work hard to filter out and remove some of the extra sugar. This leads to frequent urination and excessive thirst. There are two main types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes makes up about 5-10% of all cases of diabetes in the United States. Type 2 diabetes accounts for most of the other cases. Both types of diabetes are more likely in people that have certain genes. Having a family member with diabetes increases the risk of developing the disease. Either type of diabetes can increase the chances of having other health problems. For example, people with diabetes are more likely to develop heart disease and kidney disease. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are similar in these ways. However, the two types of diabetes have different causes. 
Type 1  Diabetes 	  Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system attacks normal cells of the pancreas. Since the cells in the pancreas are damaged, the pancreas cannot make insulin. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence. People with type 1 diabetes must frequently check the sugar in their blood. They use a meter to monitor their blood sugar ( Figure 11.115). Whenever their blood sugar starts to get too high, they need a shot of insulin. The insulin brings their blood sugar back to normal. There is no cure for type 1 diabetes. Therefore, insulin shots must be taken for life. Most people with this type of diabetes learn how to give themselves insulin shots. This is one type of meter used by people with diabetes to measure their blood sugar. Modern meters like this one need only a drop of blood and take less than a minute to use. 
Type 2  Diabetes 	  Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells are no longer sensitive to insulin. The pancreas may still make insulin, but the cells of the body cannot use it efficiently. Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes usually develops in adulthood, but it is becoming more common in teens and children. This is because more young people are overweight, due to a high sugar and fat diet, now than ever before. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can be cured with weight loss. However, most people with the disease need to take medicine to control their blood sugar. Regular exercise and balanced eating also help, and should be a regular part of the treatment for these people. Like people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes must frequently check their blood sugar. 
Symptoms 	  Common symptoms of diabetes include the following: • frequent urination • feeling very thirsty • feeling very hungry, even though you are eating • extreme fatigue • blurry vision • cuts or bruises that are slow to heal • weight loss, even though you are eating more (type 1) • tingling, pain, or numbness in the hands or feet (type 2) 
Complications 	  Complications of diabetes can include the following: • eye complications • foot complications • skin complications • high blood pressure • hearing issues • nerve damage • kidney disease • artery disease • stroke • stress 
Summary 	  • In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, the hormone that helps take up sugar from the blood. • In type 2 diabetes, the body cells cannot use insulin properly.

Does pollen make you sneeze? If so, you are not alone. It is one of the most common allergies. The runny nose and sneezing associated with allergies results from the immune system working improperly. 
Diseases of the  Immune  System 	  The immune system usually protects you from pathogens and other causes of disease. When the immune system is working properly, it keeps you from getting sick. But the immune system is like any other system of the body. It can break down or develop diseases. AIDS is an infectious disease of the immune system caused by a virus. Some diseases of the immune system are noninfectious. They include autoimmune diseases and allergies. 
Autoimmune  Diseases 	  Does it make sense for an immune system to attack the cells it is meant to protect? No, but an immune system that does not function properly will attack its own cells. An autoimmune disease is a disease in which the immune system attacks the body’s own cells. One example is type 1 diabetes. In this disease, the immune system attacks cells of the pancreas. Other examples are multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks nerve cells. This causes weakness and pain. In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks the cells of joints. This causes joint damage and pain. Autoimmune diseases cannot be cured. But they can be helped with medicines that weaken the immune system’s attack on normal cells. Other autoimmune diseases include celiac disease (damages to the small intestine), inflammatory bowel disease (damage to the digestive tract), psoriasis (damage to the skin), and lupus (damage to the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, and lungs). 
Allergies 	  An allergy occurs when the immune system attacks a harmless substance that enters the body from the outside. A substance that causes an allergy is called an allergen. It is the immune system, not the allergen, that causes the symptoms of an allergy. Did you ever hear of hay fever? It’s not really a fever at all. It’s an allergy to plant pollens. People with this type of allergy have symptoms such as watery eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. A common cause of hay fever is the pollen of ragweed. Many people are also allergic to poison ivy ( Figure 11.117). Skin contact with poison ivy leads to an itchy rash in people who are allergic to the plant. Ragweed is a common roadside weed found throughout the United States. Many people are allergic to its pollen. Some people are allergic to certain foods. Nuts and shellfish are common causes of food allergies. Other common causes of allergies include: • Drugs, such as penicillin. • Mold. • Dust. • The dead skin cells of dogs and cats, called dander. • Stings of wasps and bees. Most allergies can be treated with medicines. Medicines used to treat allergies include antihistamines and corticosteroids. These medicines help control the immune system when it attacks an allergen. Sometimes, allergies cause severe symptoms, a condition known as anaphylaxis. For example, they may cause the throat to swell so it is hard to breathe. Severe allergies may be life threatening. They require emergency medical care. 
Poison ivy plants are wild vines with 	  leaves in groups of three. They grow in wooded areas in most of the United 
States.  Contact with poison ivy may 	  cause a rash in a person allergic to the plant.

How can you reduce your risk of developing cancer? You can reduce your risk of developing cancer by staying away from certain hazards. For example, the use of tanning beds can lead to skin cancer. 
Preventing  Noninfectious  Diseases 	  Noninfectious diseases can’t be passed from one person to another. Instead, these types of diseases are caused by factors such as the environment, genetics, and lifestyle. Examples of inherited noninfectious conditions include cystic fibrosis and Down syndrome. If you’re born with these conditions, you must learn how to manage the symptoms. Examples of conditions caused by environmental or lifestyle factors include heart disease and skin cancer. We can’t change our genetic codes, but there are plenty of ways to prevent other noninfectious diseases. For example, cutting down on exposure to cigarette smoke and the sun’s rays will prevent certain types of cancer. It is a fact that most chronic noninfectious diseases can be prevented. The chronic noninfectious diseases that cause the most deaths in many developed countries are largely preventable. These diseases are heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer, and though they do have some genetic components, they also have many lifestyle components. For example, some cancers have genetic risks, but people at high risk for cancers can have screening examinations to catch them early or sometimes can take other steps to prevent the cancers. Heart disease, stroke and diabetes are mostly linked to lifestyle choices, even when family history puts a person at higher risk for the diseases. Most allergies can be prevented by avoiding the substances that cause them. For example, you can avoid pollens by staying indoors as much as possible. You can learn to recognize plants like poison ivy and not touch them. A good way to remember how to avoid poison ivy is "leaves of three, let it be." Some people receive allergy shots to help prevent allergic reactions. The shots contain tiny amounts of allergens, which are the substances that cause an allergic reaction. After many months or years of shots, the immune system gets used to the allergens and no longer responds to them. Type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases cannot be prevented. But choosing a healthy lifestyle can help prevent type 2 diabetes. Getting plenty of exercise, avoiding high-fat foods, and staying at a healthy weight can reduce the risk of developing this type of diabetes. This is especially important for people who have family members with the disease. Making these healthy lifestyle choices can also help prevent some types of cancer. In addition, you can lower the risk of cancer by avoiding carcinogens, which are substances that cause cancer. For example, you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure 11.118). Some people think that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan. This is a myth. Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation. Any exposure to UV radiation increases the risk of skin cancer. It doesn’t matter whether the radiation comes from tanning lamps or the sun. Overall, people in many developed countries are contributing to higher rates of noninfectious diseases (heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer) by taking advantage of technology and social environments that encourage a less active lifestyle, and also encourages faster and cheaper meals. For example, many children now spend more time on their computer or watching TV then playing outdoors. The "faster and cheaper" meals are usually less healthy than other meals. Even though many people are living longer, they can choose to live more healthily by adopting regular exercise routines and healthy eating habits. When you choose a sunscreen, select one with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or higher. Also, choose a sunscreen that protects against both UVB and UVA radiation.

What is your nose good for? Your nose does a lot of work for you! Obviously, it helps you breathe and provides your sense of smell. But you might not realize that your nose also helps to fight off disease. 
The  Immune  System’s  First  Line of  Defense 	  It is the immune system’s job to protect the body. Your body has many ways to protect you from pathogens. Your body’s defenses are like a castle. The outside of a castle was protected by a moat and high walls. Inside the castle, soldiers were ready to fight off any enemies that made it across the moat and over the walls. Like a castle, your body has a series of defenses. Only pathogens that get through all the defenses can harm you. The first line of defence includes both physical and chemical barriers that are always ready and prepared to defend the body from infection. Pathogens must make it past this first line of defense to cause harm. If this defense is broken, the second line of defense within your body is activated. Your body’s first line of defense is like a castle’s moat and walls. It keeps most pathogens out of your body. This is a non-specific type of defense, in that it tries to keep all pathogens out. The first line of defense includes different types of barriers. Being the "first line", it starts with the skin. The first line also includes tears, mucus, cilia, stomach acid, urine flow, and friendly bacteria. 
Skin and  Mucous  Membranes 	  The skin is a very important barrier to pathogens. The skin is the body’s largest organ. In adults, it covers an area of about 16 to 22 square feet! The skin is also the body’s most important defense against disease. It forms a physical barrier between the body and the outside world. The skin has several layers that stack on top of each other ( Figure 
This drawing shows that 	  the skin has many layers. The outer layer is so tough that it keeps out most pathogens. The mouth and nose are not lined with skin. Instead, they are lined with mucous membranes. Other organs that are exposed to the outside world, including the lungs and stomach, are also lined with mucous membranes. Mucous membranes are not tough like skin, but they have other defenses. One defense of mucous membranes is the mucus they release. Mucus is a sticky, moist substance that covers mucous membranes. Most pathogens get stuck in the mucus before they can do harm to the body. Many mucous membranes also have cilia. Cilia in the lungs are pictured below ( Figure 11.120). Cilia are tiny finger-like projections. They move in waves and sweep mucus and trapped pathogens toward body openings. When you clear your throat or blow your nose, you remove mucus and pathogens from your body. 
Chemicals 	  Most body fluids that you release from your body contain chemicals that kill pathogens. For example, mucus, sweat, tears, and saliva contain enzymes called lysozymes that kill pathogens. These enzymes can break down the cell walls of bacteria to kill them. This is what the cilia lining the lungs look like when they are magnified. 
Their movements constantly sweep mucus and pathogens out of the 	  lungs. Do they remind you of brushes? The stomach also releases a very strong acid, called hydrochloric acid. This acid kills most pathogens that enter the stomach in food or water. Urine is also acidic, so few pathogens can grow in it. 
Helpful  Bacteria 	  You are not aware of them, but your skin is covered by millions (or more!) of bacteria. Millions more live inside your body. Most of these bacteria help defend your body from pathogens. How do they do it? They compete with harmful bacteria for food and space. This prevents the harmful bacteria from multiplying and making you sick. 
Summary 	  • Your body’s first line of defense includes the skin and other barriers that keep pathogens out of your body. • Most body fluids that you release from your body contain chemicals that kill pathogens.

Have you ever sprained your ankle? Did you notice redness and swelling near the injury? These symptoms indicate that your body is attempting to fight off infection. 
The  Immune  System’s  Second  Line of  Defense 	  The little girl pictured below ( Figure 11.121) has a scraped knee. A scrape is a break in the skin that may let pathogens enter the body. If bacteria enter through the scrape, they could cause an infection. These bacteria would then face the body’s second line of defense. The second line of defense is also nonspecific, fighting many types of pathogens. 
Inflammation 	  The body’s second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. This little girl just got her first scraped knee. It doesn’t seem to hurt, but the break in her skin could let pathogens enter her body. That’s why scrapes should be kept clean and protected until they heal. 
White  Blood  Cells 	  What do these white blood cells do at the site of inflammation? The main role of white blood cells is to fight pathogens in the body. There are actually several different kinds of white blood cells. Some white blood cells have very specific functions. They attack only certain pathogens. Other white blood cells attack any pathogen they find. These white blood cells travel to areas of the body that are inflamed. They are called phagocytes, which means “eating cells.” Neutrophils are a type of phagocyte. In addition to pathogens, phagocytes “eat” dead cells. They surround the pathogens and destroy them. Sometimes it is said that the phagocyte engulfs the pathogen, and then destroys it. This process is called phagocytosis. White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6◦F (37◦C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection.

Do you still have your tonsils? Many people have their tonsils removed because they can hold on to germs that cause throat infections. Although sometimes they can do more harm than good, tonsils are there to help you. They trap pathogens so that they can be destroyed before they enter farther into your body. 
The  Lymphatic  System and the  Immune  Response 	  If pathogens get through the body’s first two lines of defense, a third line of defense takes over. This third line of defense involves the immune system. It is called an immune response, and is a specific type of response. The immune system has a special response for each type of pathogen. The immune system ( Figure 11.122) is also part of the lymphatic system—named for lymphocytes, which are the type of white blood cells involved in an immune response. They include several lymph organs, lymph vessels, lymph, and lymph nodes. This diagram shows the parts of the immune system. The immune system includes several organs and a system of vessels that carry lymph. Lymph nodes are located along the lymph vessels. 
Lymph  Organs 	  The lymph organs are the red bone marrow, tonsils, spleen, and thymus gland. They are described below ( Figure 
Each lymph organ has a different job in 	  the immune system. 
Lymph and  Lymph  Vessels 	  Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the cardiovascular system, which you can read about in a previous concept. Lymph vessels are like blood vessels, except they move lymph instead of blood. Lymph is a yellowish liquid that leaks out of tiny blood vessels into spaces between cells in tissues. Where there is more inflammation, there is usually more lymph in tissues. This lymph may contain many pathogens. The lymph that collects in tissues slowly passes into tiny lymph vessels. It then travels from smaller to larger lymph vessels. Lymph is not pumped through lymph vessels like blood is pumped through blood vessels by the heart. Instead, muscles around the lymph vessels contract and squeeze the lymph through the vessels. The lymph vessels also contract to help move the lymph along. The lymph finally reaches the main lymph vessels in the chest. Here, the lymph drains into two large veins. This is how the lymph returns to the bloodstream. Before lymph reaches the bloodstream, pathogens are removed from it at lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small, oval structures located along the lymph vessels. They act like filters. Any pathogens filtered out of the lymph at lymph nodes are destroyed by lymphocytes in the nodes. 
Lymphocytes 	  Lymphocytes ( Figure 11.124), a type of white blood cell, are the key cells of an immune response. There are trillions of lymphocytes in the human body. They make up about one quarter of all white blood cells. Usually, fewer than half of the body’s lymphocytes are in the blood. The rest are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes: 
This image of a lymphocyte was made 	  with an electron microscope. The lymphocyte is shown 10,000 times its actual size. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in the red bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow larger. The "B" in B cells stands for “bone.” B cells grow larger in red bone marrow. The "T" in T cells stands for “thymus.” T cells mature in the thymus gland. B and T cells must be “switched on” in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells ready to fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have proteins, often located on their cell surface. These proteins are called antigens. An antigen is any protein that causes an immune response, because it is unlike any protein that the body makes. Antigens are found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Your body sees these as foreign, meaning they do not belong in your body. 
Summary 	  • The immune system includes lymph organs, lymph vessels, lymph, and lymph nodes. • Lymph organs include the red bone marrow, thymus gland, spleen, and tonsils. • Lymphocytes, including B cells and T cells, are key cells in the immune response. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Lymphatic System: Facts, Functions Diseases at URL ml • Distinguish B cells from T cells. • Define antibody and antigen. • Explain how B cells and T cells respond to pathogens. • Summarize the roles of killer T cells and helper T cells. What happens when your body recognizes an invader? When your immune system detects an invading pathogen, it goes on the attack! Notice how this T-cell is setting out to destroy a cancer cell. 
B and  T  Cell  Response 	  Some defenses, like your skin and mucous membranes, are not designed to ward off a specific pathogen. They are just general defenders against disease. Your body also has defenses that are more specialized. Through the help of your immune system, your body can generate an army of cells to kill that one specific pathogen. There are two different types of specific immune responses. One type involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. Recall that B cells and T cells are types of white blood cells that are key in the immune response. Whereas the immune system’s first and second line of defense are more generalized or non-specific, the immune response is specific. It can be described as a specific response to a specific pathogen, meaning it uses methods to target just one pathogen at a time. These methods involve B and T cells. 
B  Cell  Response 	  B cells respond to pathogens and other cells from outside the body in the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen, a protein that is recognized as foreign. Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen ( Figure 11.125). They fit together like a lock and key. Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the pathogen is destroyed by this process. At any one time the average human body contains antibodies that can react with about 100,000,000 different antigens. This means that there can be 100,000,000 different antibody proteins in the body. 
This diagram shows how an antibody 	  binds with an antigen. The antibody was produced by a B cell. It binds with just one type of antigen. Antibodies produced by different B cells bind with other types of antigens. The antigen-binding sites can vary, such that they are specific for just one antigen. 
T  Cell  Response 	  There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and helper T cells. Killer T cells destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells ( Figure 11.126). When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it releases poisons. The poisons make tiny holes in the cell membrane of the infected cell. This causes the cell to burst open. Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed. 
In this diagram, a killer  T cell recognizes 	  a body cell infected with a virus. After the killer T cell makes contact with the infected cell, it releases poisons that cause the infected cell to burst. This kills both the infected cell and the viruses inside it. Helper T cells do not destroy infected or damaged body cells. But they are still necessary for an immune response. They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by helper T cells “switch on” both B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and fight specific pathogens.

Is this child more fortunate than many children? You may not feel lucky to get a shot. But you are very lucky to be able to get vaccinations. In many parts of the world, children do not get routine vaccinations. In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 1.5 million children under the age of 5 died from diseases that are preventable with vaccinations. 
Immunity and  Vaccination 	  In previous concepts, you learned about B and T cells, special types of white blood cells that help your body to fight off a specific pathogen. They are necessary when the body is fighting off an infection. But what happens to them after the pathogen has been destroyed? Most B and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control. But some of them survive for many years. They may even survive for a person’s lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called memory cells. They allow the immune system to “remember” the pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again, the memory cells will start dividing in order to fight the pathogen or disease. These dividing cells will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to fight the pathogen. They will begin a faster, stronger attack than the first time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system will be able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection. Being able to attack the pathogen in this way is called immunity. Immunity can also be caused by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to a pathogen on purpose in order to develop immunity. In vaccination, a modified pathogen is usually injected under the skin by a shot. Only part of the pathogen is injected, or a weak or dead pathogen is used. It sounds dangerous, but the shot prepares your body for fighting the pathogen without causing the actual illness. Vaccination triggers an immune response against the injected antigen. The body prepares "memory" cells for use at a later time, in case the antigen is ever encountered again. Essentially, a vaccine imitates an infection, triggering an immune response, without making a person sick. In many countries, children receive their first vaccination at birth with the Hepatitis B shot, which protects infants from Hepatitis B, a serious liver disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are now protected by vaccines, we do not see these diseases nearly as often. Diseases you have probably been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox. How does a vaccine work? See How a Vaccine Works at URL and The History of Vaccines at URL .

How does this work? • List the functions of the male reproductive system. • List the roles of testosterone. Why do men and women look different? The features that make men unique from women, such as this man’s beard, are controlled by the sex hormones. The production of the sex hormones is a key role of the male reproductive system. 
The  Male  Reproductive  System  Functions 	  Dogs have puppies. Cats have kittens. All organisms reproduce, obviously including humans. Like other mammals, humans have a body system that controls reproduction. It is called the reproductive system. It is the only human body system that is very different in males and females. The male and female reproductive systems have different organs and different functions. The male reproductive system has two main functions: Sperm are male gametes, or reproductive cells. When a male gamete meets a female gamete, they can form a new organism. Sperm form when certain cells in the male reproductive system divide by meiosis, resulting in cells with half the amount of DNA as a regular "body" cell. More precisely, sperm cells are haploid sex cells, having one set of chromosomes. Regular body cells are diploid, having two set of chromosomes. As there are 46 chromosomes in a diploid human cell, how many are in a human sperm cell? When males grow older, they produce millions of sperm each day. The male reproductive system also maintains and transports and delivers sperm and a protective fluid, known as semen. Testosterone is the main sex hormone in males. Hormones are chemicals that control many body processes. Testosterone has two major roles: • During the teen years, testosterone causes the reproductive organs to mature. It also causes other male traits to develop. For example, it causes hair to grow on the face and allows for muscle growth. • During adulthood, testosterone helps a man to produce sperm. When a hormone is released into the body, we say it is "secreted." Testosterone is secreted by males, but it is not the only sex hormone that males secrete. Males also secrete small amounts of estrogen. Even though estrogen is the main female sex hormone, scientists think that estrogen is needed for normal sperm production in males. 
Testosterone, the main sex hormone in 	  males, allows men to build larger muscles than women. 
Summary 	  • The main functions of the male reproductive system are to produce sperm and secrete testosterone. • Testosterone, the main sex hormone in males, causes the reproductive organs to mature and other male traits to develop.

What organs are unique to the male body? Men and women share most of the same organs. We all have skin, a heart, and lungs. Men and women differ only in their reproductive organs. 
Male  Reproductive  Organs 	  The male reproductive organs include the penis, testes, and epididymis ( Figure 11.128). The figure also shows other parts of the male reproductive system. • The penis is a cylinder-shaped organ. It contains the urethra. The urethra is a tube that carries urine out of the body. The urethra also carries sperm out of the body. 
This drawing shows the organs of 	  the male reproductive system. 
It shows the 	  organs from the side. Find each organ in the drawing as you read about it in the text. • The two testes (singular, testis) are egg-shaped organs. They produce sperm and secrete testosterone. The testes are found inside of the scrotum. The scrotum is a sac that hangs down outside the body. The scrotum also contains the epididymis. The testes, being in the scrotum outside the body, allow the temperature of the sperm to be maintained at a few degrees lower than body temperature. This is necessary for the stability of these reproductive cells. • The epididymis is a tube that is about six meters (20 feet) long in adults. It is tightly coiled, so it fits inside the scrotum. It rests on top of the testes. The epididymis is where sperm grow larger and mature. The epididymis also stores sperm until they leave the body. Other parts of the male reproductive system include the vas deferens and the prostate gland. Both of these structures are pictured below ( Figure 11.128). • The vas deferens is a tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. • The prostate gland secretes a fluid that mixes with sperm to help form semen. The prostate gland is located beneath the bladder. Semen is a "milky" liquid that carries sperm through the urethra and out of the body. In addition to sperm cells, semen contains sugars (fructose) which provide energy to the sperm cells, and enzymes and other substances which help the sperm survive.

Sperm and  Sperm  Production 	  Sperm ( Figure 11.129), the male reproductive cells, are tiny. In fact, they are the smallest cells in the human body. What do you think a sperm cell looks like? Some people think that it looks like a tadpole. Do you agree? 
Sperm 	  A sperm has three main parts: enzymes that help the sperm break through the cell membrane of an egg. energy. Sperm use the energy in the midpiece to move.

This may not sound very fast, but don’t forget how small a sperm is. For its size, a sperm moves about as fast as you do when you walk briskly. 
Sperm  Production 	  To make sperm, cells start in the testes and end in the epididymis. It takes up to two months to make sperm. The steps are explained below: half the number of chromosomes as the original cell. The spermatids are immature and cannot move on their own. spermatids along. cytoplasm from the head. It is here that the spermatids mature, becoming sperm cells. them to leave the body. Sperm leave the epididymis through the vas deferens. As they travel through the vas deferens, they pass by the prostate and other glands. The sperm mix with liquids from these glands, forming semen. The semen travels through the urethra and leaves the body through the penis. A teaspoon of semen may contain as many as 500 million sperm!

What causes a girl to develop into a woman? Adult female characteristics, such as breasts, develop during the teen years. What causes this to happen?

The  Female  Reproductive  System  Functions 	  Most of the male reproductive organs are outside of the body. But female reproductive organs are inside of the body. The male and female organs also look very different and have different jobs. Two of the functions of the female reproductive system are similar to the functions of the male reproductive system. The female system: One of the main roles of the female reproductive system is to produce eggs. Eggs ( Figure 11.130) are female gametes, and they are made in the ovaries. After puberty, females release only one egg at a time. Eggs are actually made in the body before birth, but they do not fully develop until later in life. Like sperm, eggs are produced by meiosis, so they contain half the number of chromosomes as the original cell. Another role of the female system is to secrete estrogen. Estrogen is the main sex hormone in females. Estrogen has two major roles: develop. For example, it causes the breasts to grow. each month from her ovaries. The female reproductive system has another important function. After puberty, the female reproductive system must prepare itself to accept a fertilized egg each cycle (about every month). This cycle is controlled by a well-planned and very complex interplay of hormones. If an egg is not fertilized, the system must prepare itself again the next cycle. The female reproductive system also supports a baby as it develops before birth, and it facilitates the baby’s birth at the end of pregnancy. 
This represents a human egg, which is 	  the gamete, or reproductive cell, in females. Notice that is does not have a distinct shape, like a sperm cell has. The egg is a round cell with a haploid nucleus in the center. The egg contains most of the cytoplasm and organelles present in the first cell of a new organism. 
Summary 	  • The functions of the female reproductive system are to produce eggs, secrete estrogen, and support a baby as it develops before birth. • Estrogen, the main sex hormone in females, causes the female traits and reproductive organs to develop and is needed for the release of eggs.

Where are the female reproductive organs? Unlike the male reproductive organs, much of the female reproductive organs are internal. This allows them to be well-protected by the body. 
Female  Reproductive  Organs 	  The female reproductive organs include the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries ( Figure 11.131). The breasts are not shown in this figure. They are not considered reproductive organs, even though they are involved in reproduction. They contain mammary glands that give milk to feed a baby. The milk leaves the breast through the nipple when the baby sucks on it. • The vagina is a cylinder-shaped organ found inside of the female body. One end of the vagina opens at the outside of the body. The other end joins with the uterus. During sexual intercourse, sperm may be released into the vagina. If this occurs, the sperm will move through the vagina and into the uterus. During birth, a baby passes from the uterus to the vagina to leave the body. • The uterus is a hollow organ with muscular walls. The part that connects the vagina with the uterus is called the cervix. The uterus is where a baby develops until birth. The walls of the uterus grow bigger as the baby grows. The muscular walls of the uterus push the baby out during birth. 
This drawing shows the organs of 	  the female reproductive system. It shows the organs from the side. Find each organ in the drawing as you read about it in the text. • The two ovaries are small, oval organs on either side of the uterus. Each ovary contains thousands of eggs, with about 1-2 million immature eggs present at birth and 40,000 immature eggs present at puberty, as most of the eggs die off. The eggs do not fully develop until a female has gone through puberty. About once a month, on average one egg completes development and is released by the ovary. The ovaries also secrete estrogen, the main female sex hormone. • The two fallopian tubes are narrow tubes that open off from the uterus. Each tube reaches for one of the ovaries, but the tubes are not attached to the ovaries. The end of each fallopian tube by the ovary has “fingers” ( Figure 11.131). They sweep an egg into the fallopian tube. Then the egg passes through the fallopian tube to the uterus. If an egg is to be fertilized, this will occur in the fallopian tube. A fertilized egg then implants into the wall of the uterus, where it begins to develop. An unfertilized egg will flow through the uterus and be excreted from the body. 
Summary 	  • Female reproductive organs include the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. • The ovaries release the eggs and secrete estrogen. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Female Reproductive Organs at URL • State facts associated with the egg. • Summarize egg production. How is egg different from sperm? Egg and sperm are both gametes, or reproductive cells. Notice how different they are, however. The egg is much larger than the sperm. The egg also does not have a tail. And the female only releases one egg at time, while the male releases millions of sperm at a time. 
Eggs and  Egg  Production 	  When a baby girl is born, her ovaries contain all of the eggs they will ever produce. But these eggs are not fully developed. They develop only after she starts having menstrual periods at about age 12 or 13. Just one egg develops each month. A woman will release an egg once each month until she is in her 40s. A girl is born with over a million eggs. They die off and by puberty about 40,000 remain. 
Eggs 	  Eggs are very big cells. In fact, they are the biggest cells in the human female body. (How many egg cells are in the human male body?) An egg is about 30 times as wide as a sperm cell! You can even see an egg cell without a microscope. Like a sperm cell, the egg contains a nucleus with half the number of chromosomes as other body cells. Unlike a sperm cell, the egg contains a lot of cytoplasm, the contents of the cell, which is why it is so big. The egg also does not have a tail. 
Egg  Production 	  Egg production takes place in the ovaries. It takes several steps to make an egg: meiosis at that time. They go through the second stage of cell division after the female goes through puberty. happens ( Figure 11.132). As you can see from the figure, the egg rests in a nest of cells called a follicle. The follicle and egg grow larger and go through other changes. The follicle protects the egg as it matures in the ovary. After a couple of weeks, the egg bursts out of the follicle and through the wall of the ovary. This is called ovulation, which usually occurs at the midpoint of a monthly cycle. In a 28 day cycle, ovulation would occur around day 14. The moving fingers of the nearby fallopian tube then sweep the egg into the tube. At this time, if sperm are present the egg can be fertilized. 
This diagram shows how an egg and 	  its follicle develop in an ovary. After it develops, the egg leaves the ovary and enters the fallopian tube. (1) Undeveloped eggs, (2) Egg and follicle developing, (3) Egg and follicle developing, (4) Ovulation. 
After ovulation, what remains of the follicle 	  is known as the corpus luteum, which degenerates (5, 6). Fertilization occurs if a sperm enters the egg while it is passing through the fallopian tube. When this happens, the egg finally completes meiosis. This results in two daughter cells that are different in size. The smaller cell is called a polar body. It contains very little cytoplasm. It soon breaks down and disappears. The larger cell is the egg. It contains most of the cytoplasm. This will develop into a child. 
Summary 	  • Eggs are female gametes that form in the ovaries and are released into the fallopian tubes. • The eggs are formed before a baby girl is born, but these eggs are not fully developed.

What happens during the menstrual cycle? When you think of the menstrual cycle, you probably think of the discharge of blood that happens during menstruation. This is only one small part of the female monthly cycle, however. 
The  Female  Monthly  Cycle 	  The menstrual cycle is a series of changes in the reproductive system of mature females that repeats every month. While the egg and follicle are developing in the ovary, tissues are building up inside the uterus, the reproductive organ where the baby would develop. The uterus develops a thick lining covered in tiny blood vessels. This prepares the uterus to receive an egg that could develop into a child (a fertilized egg). The occurs during the first part of the cycle. Ovulation, the release of an egg from the ovary, occurs at about the midpoint of the cycle. This would be around day 14 of a 28 day cycle. The egg is swept into the fallopian tube. If sperm is present, fertilization may occur. As sperm can only survive in the fallopian tube for up to a few days, fertilization can only occur within those few days post-ovulation. If the egg is fertilized, the egg makes its way through the fallopian tube into the uterus, where it imbeds into the thick lining. When this occurs, the monthly cycle stops. The monthly cycle does not resume until the pregnancy is over. If a sperm does not enter an egg, the lining of the uterus breaks down. Blood and other tissues from the lining break off from the uterus. They pass through the vagina and out of the body. This is called menstruation. Menstruation is also called a menstrual period. It lasts about 4 days, on average. When the menstrual period ends, the cycle repeats. Some women feel discomfort during this process. Some people think that the average length of a menstrual period is the same as the “normal” length. They assume that shorter or longer menstrual periods are not normal. In fact, menstrual periods can vary from 1 to 8 days in length. This is usually normal. The average length of the cycle (time between menstrual periods) is about 28 days, but there is no “normal” cycle length. 
Some women experience cramping and 	  pain before and during menstruation. 
Summary 	  • The menstrual cycle is a monthly cycle of changes in the ovaries and uterus. • During menstruation, blood and other tissues from the lining of the uterus are shed and exit the body.

Where do sperm meet the egg? You might guess that sperm meet the egg in the uterus, the organ where the baby develops. But that is incorrect. The sperm meet the egg in the fallopian tubes that carry the egg from the ovary to the uterus. Then the developing embryo travels to the uterus. 
Fertilization and  Implantation 	  The sperm and egg don’t look anything like a human baby ( Figure 11.134). After they come together, they will develop into a human being. How does a single cell become a complex organism made up of billions of cells? Keep reading to find out. Sexual reproduction happens when a sperm and an egg cell combine together. This is called fertilization. Sperm are released into the vagina during sexual intercourse. They “swim” through the uterus and enter a fallopian tube. This is where fertilization normally takes place. A sperm that is about to enter an egg is pictured below ( Figure 11.134). If the sperm breaks through the egg’s membrane, it will immediately cause changes in the egg that keep other sperm out. This ensures that only a single sperm can penetrate an egg. It will also cause the egg to go through meiosis. Recall that meiosis, cell division that creates the egg, begins long before an egg is released from an ovary. In fact, it begins prior to birth. The sperm and egg each have only half the number of chromosomes as other cells in the body. These cells are haploid, with a single set of chromosomes. This is because when they combine together, they form a cell with the full number of chromosomes. The cell they form is called a zygote. The zygote is diploid, with two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. A human zygote has two sets of 23 chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). 
This sperm is ready to penetrate the 	  membrane of this egg. Notice the difference in size of the sperm and egg. Why is the egg so much larger? The egg contributes all the cytoplasm and organelles to the zygote. The sperm only contributes one set of chromosomes. The zygote slowly travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus. As it travels, it divides by mitosis many times. It forms a hollow ball of cells. After the ball of cells reaches the uterus, it fixes itself to the side of the uterus. This is called implantation. It usually happens about a week after fertilization. Now the implanted ball of cells is ready to continue its development into a baby boy or girl. 
Summary 	  • Fertilization occurs when an egg and sperm come together to form a zygote. • Implantation occurs when the developing embryo fixes itself to the side of the uterus.

Does a growing embryo always look like a tiny human? The above picture shows the very early stages of human development. Notice that, at first, the embryo doesn’t look very human! It takes time for the human features to take shape. 
Pregnancy and  Childbirth 	  While a woman is pregnant, the developing baby may be called an embryo or a fetus. Do these mean the same thing? No, in the very early stages the developing baby is called an embryo, while in the later stages it is called a fetus. When the ball of cells first implants into the uterus, it is called an embryo. The embryo stage lasts until the end of the 8th week after fertilization. After that point until birth, the developing baby is called a fetus. 
Growth and  Development of the  Embryo 	  During the embryo stage, the baby grows in size. • 3rd week after fertilization: Cells of different types start to develop. Cells that will form muscles and skin, for example, start to develop at this time. • 4th week after fertilization: Body organs begin to form. • 8th week after fertilization: All the major organs have started to develop. Pictured below are some of the changes that take place during the 4th and 8th weeks ( Figure 11.135). Look closely at the two embryos in the figure. Do you think that the older embryo looks more human? Notice that it has arms and legs and lacks a tail. The face has also started to form, and it is much bigger. 
Embryonic  Development 	  (Weeks 4–8). 
Most organs develop in the embryo during 	  weeks four through eight. the drawings of the embryos are not to scale.) (Note: 
Growth and  Development of the  Fetus 	  There are also many changes that take place after the embryo becomes a fetus. Some of the differences between them are obvious. For example, the fetus has ears and eyelids. Its fingers and toes are also fully formed. The fetus even has fingernails and toenails. In addition, the reproductive organs have developed to make the baby a male or female. The brain and lungs are also developing quickly. The fetus has started to move around inside the uterus. This is usually when the mother first feels the fetus moving. By the 28th week, the fetus is starting to look much more like a baby. Eyelashes and eyebrows are present. Hair has started to grow on the head. The body of the fetus is also starting to fill out as muscles and bones develop. Babies born after the 28th week are usually able to survive. However, they need help breathing because their lungs are not yet fully mature. A baby should not be delivered prior to this time, unless absolutely necessary. A baby born prior to week 28 will need considerable medical intervention to survive. During the last several weeks of the fetal period, all of the organs become mature. The most obvious change, however, is an increase in body size. The fetus rapidly puts on body fat and gains weight during the last couple of months. By the end of the 38th week, all of the organs are working, and the fetus is ready to be born. This is when birth normally occurs. A baby born before this time is considered premature. 
The  Amniotic  Sac and  Placenta 	  During pregnancy, other structures also develop inside the mother’s uterus. They are the amniotic sac, placenta, and umbilical cord ( Figure 11.136). 
Surrounding the fetus is the fluid-filled 	  amniotic sac. The placenta and umbilical cord are also shown here. They provide a connection between the mother’s and fetus’s blood for the transfer of nutrients and gases. • The amniotic sac is a membrane that surrounds the fetus. It is filled with water and dissolved substances, known as amniotic fluid. Imagine placing a small plastic toy inside a balloon and then filling the balloon with water. The toy would be cushioned and protected by the water. It would also be able to move freely inside the balloon. The amniotic sac and its fluid are like a water-filled balloon. They cushion and protect the fetus. They also let the fetus move freely inside the uterus. • The placenta is a spongy mass of blood vessels. Some of the vessels come from the mother. Some come from the fetus. The placenta is attached to the inside of the mother’s uterus. The fetus is connected to the placenta by a tube called the umbilical cord. The cord contains two arteries and a vein. Substances pass back and forth between the mother’s and fetus’s blood through the placenta and cord. Oxygen and nutrients pass from the mother to the fetus. Carbon dioxide passes from the fetus to the mother. It is important for the mother to eat plenty of nutritious foods during pregnancy. She must take in enough nutrients for the fetus as well as for herself. She needs extra calories, proteins, and lipids. She also needs more vitamins and minerals. In addition to eating well, the mother must avoid substances that could harm the embryo or fetus. These include alcohol, illegal drugs, and some medicines. It is especially important for her to avoid these substances during the first eight weeks after fertilization. This is when all the major organs are forming. Exposure to harmful substances during this time could damage the developing body systems. 
Childbirth 	  During childbirth, a baby passes from the uterus, through the vagina, and out of the mother’s body. Childbirth usually starts when the amniotic sac breaks. Then, the muscles of the uterus start contracting. The contractions get stronger and closer together. They may go on for hours. Eventually, the contractions squeeze the baby out of the uterus. Once the baby enters the vagina, the mother starts pushing. She soon pushes the baby through the vagina and out of her body. As soon as the baby is born, the umbilical cord is cut. After the cord is cut, the baby can no longer get rid of carbon dioxide through the cord and placenta. As a result, carbon dioxide builds up in the baby’s blood. This triggers the baby to start breathing. The amniotic sac and placenta pass through the vagina and out of the body shortly after the birth of the baby.

Does a baby learn much during his first year? The first years of life are full of important milestones as new skills are mastered. For example, at first this baby wasn’t even able to roll over on his stomach or hold up his head! 
Infancy and  Childhood 	  The first year after birth is called infancy. Infancy is a period when the baby grows very fast. During infancy, the baby doubles in length and triples in weight. Other important changes also happen during infancy: • The baby’s teeth start to come in, usually at about six months of age ( Figure 11.137). • The baby starts smiling, paying attention to other people, and grabbing toys. • The baby begins making babbling sounds. By the end of the first year, the baby is starting to say a few words, such as “mama” and “dada.” • The baby learns to sit, crawl, and stand. By the end of the first year, the baby may be starting to walk. Childhood begins after the baby’s first birthday and continues until the teen years. Between one and three years of age, a child is called a toddler. During the toddler stage, growth is still fast, but not as fast as it was during infancy. A toddler learns many new words. The child even starts putting together words in simple sentences. Motor skills also develop quickly during this stage. By age three, most children can run and climb steps. They can hold crayons and scribble with them. They can also feed themselves and use the toilet. 
This baby’s teeth have started to come 	  in. Babies often chew on toys or other objects when they are getting new teeth. They may even chew on their toes. From age three until the teens, growth is slower. The body also changes shape. The arms and legs get longer compared to the trunk. Children continue to develop new motor skills. For example, many young children learn how to ride a tricycle and then a bicycle. Most also learn how to play games and sports ( Figure 11.138). By age six, children start losing their baby teeth. Their permanent teeth begin coming in to replace them. They also start school and learn how to read and write. They develop friendships and become less dependent on their parents. 
Early  Childhood  Development 	  There are numerous milestones that occur during the first few years of childhood. These include • the use of language, • walking and running, • understanding simple concepts, • pretend play, Children develop better motor skills as they get older. • the development of fine motor skills, • the development of independence, • having temper tantrums, • demonstrating separation anxiety, • becoming fully potty-trained, • showing natural curiosity.

How do you know you are entering puberty? The first signs of puberty appear at different times for different people. A boy might realize he’s reached puberty when he starts needing to shave. A girl, on the other hand, starts getting her menstrual period during puberty. 
Puberty and  Adolescence 	  Puberty is the stage of life when a child becomes sexually mature. Puberty lasts from about 12 to 18 years of age in boys and from about 10 to 16 years of age in girls. The age when puberty begins is different from one child to another. Children that begin puberty much earlier or later than their peers may feel self-conscious. They may also worry that something is wrong with them. Usually, an early or late puberty is perfectly normal. In boys, puberty begins when the pituitary gland tells the testes to secrete testosterone. Testosterone causes the following to happen: In girls, puberty begins when the pituitary gland tells the ovaries to secrete estrogen. Estrogen causes the following to happen: Boys and girls are close to the same height during childhood. In both boys and girls, growth in height and weight is very fast during puberty. But boys grow faster than girls during puberty. Their period of fast growth also lasts longer. By the end of puberty, boys are an average of 10 centimeters (4 inches) taller than girls. 
Adolescence 	  Adolescence is the period of life between the start of puberty and the beginning of adulthood. Adolescence includes the physical changes of puberty. It also includes many other changes, including significant mental, emotional, and social changes. During adolescence: • Teenagers develop new thinking abilities. For example, they can think about abstract ideas, such as freedom. They are also better at thinking logically. They are usually better at solving problems as well. • Teenagers try to establish a sense of who they are as individuals. They may try to become more independent from their parents. Most teens also have emotional ups and downs. This is partly due to changing hormone levels. • Teenagers usually spend much more time with peers than with family members.

What does adulthood mean to you? You might think sometimes that you can’t wait to be an adult! In adulthood you have greater freedom, but you also have greater responsibilities. Like this man, you might have a house and children to take care of. 
Adulthood 	  When is a person considered an adult? That depends. Most teens become physically mature by the age of 16 or so. But they are not adults in a legal sense until they are older. For example, in the U.S., you must be 18 to vote. Once adulthood begins, it can be divided into three stages: (1) early, (2) middle, and (3) late adulthood. 
Early  Adulthood 	  Early adulthood starts at age 18 or 21. It continues until the mid-30s. During early adulthood, people are at their physical peak. They are also usually in good health. The ability to have children is greatest during early adulthood, as well. This is the stage of life when most people complete their education. They are likely to begin a career or take a full-time job. Many people also marry and start a family during early adulthood. 
Middle  Adulthood 	  Middle adulthood begins in the mid-30s. It continues until the mid-60s. During middle adulthood, people start to show signs of aging. Their hair slowly turns gray. Their skin develops wrinkles. The risk of health problems also increases during middle adulthood. For example, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes become more common during this time. This is the stage of life when people are most likely to achieve career goals. Their children also grow up and may leave home during this stage. 
Late  Adulthood 	  Late adulthood begins in the mid-60s. It continues until death. This is the stage of life when most people retire from work. They are also likely to reflect on their life. They may focus on their grandchildren. During late adulthood, people are not as physically able. For example, they usually have less muscle and slower reflexes. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, they have a harder time fighting diseases like the flu. The risk of developing diseases such as heart disease and cancer continues to rise. Arthritis is also common. In arthritis, joints wear out and become stiff and painful. As many as one in four late adults may develop Alzheimer’s disease. In this disease, brain changes cause mental abilities to decrease. 
This family picture shows females in each 	  of the three stages of life. Which stage does each represent? Despite problems such as these, many people remain healthy and active into their 80s or even 90s. Do you want to be one of them? Then adopt a healthy lifestyle now and follow it for life. Doing so will increase your chances of staying healthy and active to an old age. Exercising the body and brain help prevent the physical and mental effects of aging.

What is safe sex? Safe sex is sexual activity engaged in by people who have taken precautions to protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections. Abstaining from sexual activity, however, is the only way to be absolutely sure that you won’t get a sexually transmitted infection. 
Sexually  Transmitted  Infections 	  A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that spreads through sexual contact. STIs are caused by pathogens, a living thing or virus that causes infection. The pathogens enter the body through the reproductive organs. Many STIs also spread through body fluids, such as blood. For example, a shared tattoo needle is one way an STI could spread. Some STIs can also spread from a mother to her baby during childbirth. STIs are more common in teens and young adults than in older people. One reason is that young people are more likely to take risks. They also may not know how STIs spread. They are likely to believe myths about STIs ( Table 
If you are sexually active with just one person, you 	  can’t get STIs. 
If you don’t have any symptoms, then you don’t have 	  an STI. Getting STIs is no big deal, because STIs can be cured with medicine. 
Fact 	  The only way to avoid the risk of STIs is to practice abstinence from sexual activity. Many STIs do not cause symptoms, especially in females. 
Only some  Is can be cured with medicine; other  Is 	  cannot be cured. Most STIs are caused by bacteria or viruses. STIs caused by bacteria usually can be cured with drugs called antibiotics. But antibiotics are not effective against viruses. Therefore, STIs caused by viruses are not treated with antibiotics. Other drugs may be used to help control the symptoms of viral STIs, but they cannot be cured. Once you have a viral STI, you are usually infected for life. 
Bacterial  Is 	  In the U.S., chlamydia is the most common STI caused by bacteria. Females are more likely than males to develop the infection. Rates of chlamydia among U.S. females in 2006 are shown below ( Figure 11.141). Rates were much higher in teens and young women than in other age groups. Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis. But in many cases it causes no symptoms. As a result, people do not know they are infected, so they don’t go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections may leave a woman unable to have children. 
This graph shows data on the number 	  of cases of chlamydia in U.S. males and females in 2009. Which two age groups had the highest rates of chlamydia? Why do you think rates were highest in these age groups? Gonorrhea is another common STI. Gonorrhea may cause pain during urination. It may also cause a discharge from the vagina or penis. On the other hand, some people with gonorrhea have no symptoms. As a result, they don’t seek treatment. Without treatment, gonorrhea may lead to infection of other reproductive organs. This can happen in males as well as females. Syphilis is a very serious STI. Luckily, it is less common than chlamydia or gonorrhea. Syphilis usually begins with a small sore on the genitals. This is followed a few months later by a rash and flu-like symptoms. If syphilis is not treated, it may damage the heart, brain, and other organs. It can even cause death. 
Viral  Is 	  Genital warts are an STI caused by human papilloma virus, or HPV. They are one of the most common STIs in teenagers. HPV infections cannot be cured. But a new vaccine called Gardasil® can prevent most HPV infections in females. Many doctors recommend that females between the ages of 9 and 26 years receive the vaccine. Preventing HPV infections in females is important because HPV can also cause cancer of the cervix. A related herpes virus causes cold sores on the lips ( Figure 11.142). Both viruses cause painful blisters. In the case of genital herpes, the blisters are on the penis or around the vaginal opening. The blisters go away on their own, but the virus remains in the body. The blisters may come back repeatedly, especially when a person is under stress. There is no cure for genital herpes. But drugs can help prevent or shorten outbreaks. Researchers are trying to find a vaccine to prevent genital herpes. 
This lip blister, or cold sore, is caused by a 	  herpes virus. The virus is closely related to the virus that causes genital herpes. 
The genital herpes virus causes similar 	  blisters on the genitals. If you’ve ever had a cold sore, you know how painful they can be. Genital herpes blisters are also painful. Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B. HIV stands for "human immunodeficiency virus." It is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV and AIDS are described in a previous concept. HIV can spread through sexual contact. It can also spread through body fluids such as blood. There is no cure for HIV infection, and AIDS can cause death, although AIDS can be delayed for several years with medication. Researchers are trying to find a vaccine to prevent HIV infection. 
Summary 	  • Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by pathogens. They spread through sexual contact or other exchanges of body fluids. • Examples of STIs caused by bacteria include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. • Examples of STIs caused by viruses include HPV, genital herpes, hepatitis B, and AIDS.

Why should women perform a monthly breast self-exam? If you are a young woman, getting in the habit of performing a monthly breast self-exam is a good idea. Lumps or other subtle changes in the breasts may indicate breast cancer. The outcome is typically better if breast cancer is caught and treated early. 
Other  Reproductive  System  Disorders 	  Many disorders of the reproductive system are not sexually transmitted infections. They are not caused by pathogens, so they don’t spread from person to person. They develop for other reasons. The disorders are different between males and females. In both genders, the disorders could cause a little discomfort, or they could cause death. 
Disorders in  Males 	  Most common disorders of the male reproductive system involve the testes. For example, injuries to the testes are very common. In teenagers, injuries to the testes most often occur while playing sports. An injury such as a strike or kick to the testes can be very painful. It may also cause bruising and swelling. Such injuries do not usually last very long. Another disorder of the testes is cancer. Cancer of the testes is most common in males aged 15 to 35. It occurs when cells in the testes grow out of control. The cells form a lump called a tumor. If found early, cancer of the testes usually can be easily cured with surgery. 
Disorders in  Females 	  Disorders of the female reproductive system may affect the vagina, uterus, or ovaries. They may also affect the breasts. One of the most common disorders is vaginitis. This is redness and itching of the vagina. It may be due to irritation by soap or bubble bath. Another possible cause of vaginitis is a yeast infection. Yeast normally grow in the vagina. A yeast infection happens when the yeast multiply too fast and cause symptoms. A yeast infection can be treated with medication. 
Bubble baths may be fun, but for women 	  and girls they can cause irritation to the vagina. A common disorder of the ovaries is an ovarian cyst. A cyst is a sac filled with fluid or other material. An ovarian cyst is usually harmless, but it may cause pain. Most cysts slowly disappear and do not need treatment. Very large or painful cysts can be removed with surgery. Many teen girls have painful menstrual periods. They typically have cramping in the lower abdomen. Generally, this is nothing to worry about. Taking a warm bath or using a heating pad often helps. Exercise can help as well. A pain reliever like ibuprofen may also work. If the pain is severe, a doctor can prescribe stronger medicine to relieve the pain. The most common type of cancer in females is breast cancer. The cancer causes the cells of the breast to grow out of control and form a tumor. Breast cancer is rare in teens. It becomes more common as women get older. If breast cancer is found early, it usually can be cured with surgery.

Keeping the  Reproductive  System  Healthy 	  As was discussed in previous concepts, both infectious and noninfectious diseases of the reproductive system can be very serious. But there are ways to keep your reproductive system healthy. What can you do to keep your reproductive system healthy? You can start by making the right choices for overall good health. To be as healthy as you can be, you should: • Eat a balanced diet that is high in fiber and low in fat. • Drink plenty of water. • Get regular exercise. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Get enough sleep. • Avoid using tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs. • Manage stress in healthy ways. Keeping your genitals clean is also very important. A daily shower or bath is all that it takes. Females do not need to use special feminine hygiene products. In fact, using them may do more harm than good because they can irritate the vagina or other reproductive structures. You should also avoid other behaviors that can put you at risk. Do not get into contact with another person’s blood or other body fluids. For example, never get a tattoo or piercing unless you are sure that the needles have not been used before. This is one of the most important ways to prevent an STI. Of course, the only way to be fully protected against STIs is to refrain from sexual activity. If you are a boy, you should always wear a protective cup when you play contact sports. Contact sports include football, boxing, and hockey. Wearing a cup will help protect the testes from injury. You should also do a monthly self-exam to check for cancer of the testes. If you are a girl and use tampons, be sure to change them every four to six hours. Leaving tampons in for too long can put you at risk of toxic shock syndrome. This is a serious condition. Signs and symptoms of toxic shock syndrome develop suddenly, and the disease can be fatal. The disease involves fever, shock, and problems with the function of several body organs. Girls should also get in the habit of doing a monthly self-exam to check for breast cancer. Although breast cancer is rare in teens, it’s a good idea to start doing the exam when you are young. It will help you get to know what is normal for you.

Introduction 	  What do you get when you take energy, nutrients and other resources, biomes and their populations, and all the species and their relationships? You get ecology. Understanding ecology is in part understanding the biology of our planet. And it can easily be argued that this is especially important today. We literally hold the future of our planet in our hands. The lessons in this concept discuss ecology, and all the related aspects that comprise the ecosystem. • Define ecology. • Compare field studies to laboratory studies. • Distinguish between abiotic and biotic factors. Do organisms live in isolation? No, organisms are not separated from their environment or from other organisms. They interact in many ways with their surroundings. For example, these deer may be drinking from this stream or eating nearby plants. Ecology is the study of these interactions. 
Introduction to  Ecology 	  Life Science can be studied at many different levels. You can study small things like cells. Or you can study big things like a group of animals. You can also study the biosphere, which is any area in which organisms live. The study of the biosphere is part of ecology, the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment. 
Research in  Ecology 	  Ecology involves many different fields, including geology, soil science, geography, meteorology, genetics, chemistry, and physics. You can also divide ecology into the study of different organisms, such as animal ecology, plant ecology, insect ecology, and so on. Ecologists also study biomes. A biome is a large community of plants and animals that live in the same place. For example, ecologists can study the biomes as diverse as the Arctic, the tropics, or the desert ( Figure 12.1). They may An example of a biome, Desert, in Chile. the Atacama want to know why different species live in different biomes. They may want to know what would make a particular biome or ecosystem stable. Can you think of other aspects of a biome or ecosystem that ecologists could study? Ecologists do two types of research: Field studies involve collecting data outside in the natural world. An ecologist who completes a field study may travel to a tropical rainforest to study, count, and classify all of the insects that live in a certain area. Laboratory studies involve working inside, usually in a controlled environment. Sometimes, ecologists collect data from the field, and then they analyze that data in the lab. Also, they use computer programs to predict what will happen to organisms that live in a specific area. For example, they may make predictions about what happens to insects in the rainforest after a fire. 
Organisms and  Environments 	  All organisms have the ability to grow and reproduce. To grow and reproduce, organisms must get materials and energy from the environment. Plants obtain their energy from the sun through photosynthesis, whereas animals obtain their energy from other organisms. Either way, these plants and animals, as well as the bacteria and fungi, are constantly interacting with other species as well as the non-living parts of their ecosystem. An organism’s environment includes two types of factors: air. animals, and their remains. Biotic factors also include bacteria, fungi and protists. Ecology studies the interactions between biotic factors, such as organisms like plants and animals, and abiotic factors. For example, all animals (biotic factors) breathe in oxygen (abiotic factor). All plants (biotic factor) absorb carbon dioxide (abiotic factor) and need water (abiotic factor) to survive. Can you think of another way that abiotic and biotic factors interact with each other? 
Summary 	  • Ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment. • Abiotic factors are the parts of the environment that have never been alive, while biotic factors are the parts of the environment that are alive, or were alive and then died. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • A Study in Stream Ecology at USGS URL (6:57) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Define population, community, and biosphere. • Describe the levels of organization in ecology. • Explain the components of an ecosystem. How is your school organized? Your school is organized at several levels. Individual students and teachers are divided into classes. These classes are organized into an entire middle school. Your middle school and other nearby schools are organized into a school district. Just like schools are organized, ecosystems are also organized into several different levels, and an ecosystem can be studied at any one of the various levels of organization. 
Levels of  Ecological  Organization 	  Ecosystems can be studied at small levels or at large levels. The levels of organization are described below from the smallest to the largest: • A species is a group of individuals that are genetically related and can breed to produce fertile young. Individuals are not members of the same species if their members cannot produce offspring that can also have children. The second word in the two word name given to every organism is the species name. For example, in Homo sapiens, sapiens is the species name. • A population is a group of organisms belonging to the same species that live in the same area and interact with one another. • A community is all of the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another. A community is composed of all of the biotic factors of an area. • An ecosystem includes the living organisms (all the populations) in an area and the non-living aspects of the environment ( Figure 12.2). An ecosystem is made of the biotic and abiotic factors in an area. 
Satellite image of  Australia’s  Great  Barrier 	  Reef, an example of a marine ecosystem. • The biosphere is the part of the planet with living organisms ( Figure 12.3). The biosphere includes most of Earth, including part of the oceans and the atmosphere. 
The global biosphere, which includes all 	  areas that contain life, from the sea to the atmosphere. Ecologists study ecosystems at every level, from the individual organism to the whole ecosystem and biosphere. They can ask different types of questions at each level. Examples of these questions are given in Table 12.1, using the zebra (Equus zebra) as an example.

Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Ecology Levels and Populations at URL (5:31) Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Define population. • List ways in which a population can be described. • Explain population density and dispersion. • Explain how population growth is determined. What is a population? When you think of the word population, you might think of the number of people in your town or city. But humans are not the only species to have populations. Every species has a population. Or many populations. This group of penguins, which are all members of the same species and all living together in the same space, is a population. 
What is a  Population 	  A population is a group of organisms of the same species, all living in the same area and interacting with each other. Since they live together in one area, members of the same species reproduce together. Ecologists who study populations determine how healthy or stable the populations are. They also study how the individuals of a species interact with each other and how populations interact with the environment. If a group of similar organisms in the same area cannot reproduce with members of the other group, then they are members of two distinct species and form two populations. Ecologists look at many factors that help to describe a population. First, ecologists can measure the number of individuals that make up the population, known as population size. They can then determine the population density, which is the number of individuals of the same species in an area. Population density can be expressed as number per area, such as 20 mice/acre, or 50 rabbits/square mile. Ecologists also study how individuals in a population are spread across an environment. This spacing of individuals within a population is called dispersion. Some species may be clumped or clustered ( Figure 12.4) in an area. Others may be evenly spaced ( Figure 12.5). Still others may be spaced randomly within an area. The population density and dispersion have an effect on reproduction and population size. What do you think the relationship is between population density, dispersion and size? 
Clumped species are closer 	  This may allow for easier reproduction. together. 
A population of cacti 	  in the Sonoran 
Desert generally shows even dispersion 	  due to competition for water. Ecologists also study the birth and death rates of the population. Together these give the growth rate (the birth rate minus the death rate), which tells how fast (or slow) the population size is changing. The birth rate is the number of births within a population during a specific time period. The death rate is the number of deaths within a population during a specific time period. Knowing the birth and death rates of populations gives you information about a population’s health. For example, when a population is made up of mostly young organisms and the birth rate is high, the population is growing. A population with equal birth and death rates will remain the same size. Populations that are decreasing in size have a higher death rate than birth rate.

What affects population growth in the United States? One way the population of the United States has grown is through the movement of individuals into the United States from other parts of the world. The same effects can be seen in wildlife populations. Individuals move into a population and increase its size. This is just one of the many factors affecting population growth. Of course, individuals may also move away from a population. 
Population  Growth 	  What does population growth mean? You can probably guess that it means the number of individuals in a population is increasing. The population growth rate tells you how quickly a population is increasing or decreasing. What determines the population growth rate for a particular population? 
Births,  Deaths, and  Migration 	  Population growth rate depends on birth rates and death rates, as well as migration. First, we will consider the effects of birth and death rates. You can predict the growth rate by using this simple equation: growth rate = birth rate –death rate. If the birth rate is larger than the death rate, then the population grows. If the death rate is larger than the birth rate, what will happen to the population? The population size will decrease. If the birth and death rates are equal, then the population size will not change. Factors that affect population growth are: For an ecosystem to be stable, populations in that system must be healthy, and that usually means reproducing as much as their environment allows. Do organisms reproduce yearly or every few years? Do organisms reproduce for much of their life, or just part of their life? Do organisms produce many offspring at once, or just a few, or even just one? Do many newborn organisms die, or do the majority survive? All these factors play a role in the growth of a population. Organisms can use different strategies to increase their reproduction rate. Altricial organisms are helpless at birth, and their parents give them a lot of care. This care is often seen in bird species. ( Figure 12.6). Altricial birds are usually born blind and without feathers. Compared to precocial organisms, altricial organisms have a longer period of development before they reach maturity. Precocial organisms, such as the geese shown below, can take care of themselves at birth and do not require help from their parents ( Figure 12.6). In order to reproduce as much as possible, altricial and precocial organisms must use very different strategies. (left) A hummingbird nest with young illustrates an altricial reproductive strategy, with a few small eggs, helpless young, and intensive parental care. (right) The Canada goose shows a precocial reproductive strategy. 
It lays a large number 	  of large eggs, producing well-developed young. 
Migration 	  Migration is the movement of individual organisms into, or out of, a population. Migration affects population growth rate. There are two types of migration: size and growth rate. rate. The earlier growth rate equation can be modified to account for migration: growth rate = (birth rate + immigration rate) –(death rate + emigration rate). One type of migration that you are probably familiar with is the migration of birds. Maybe you have heard that birds fly south for the winter. In the fall, birds fly thousands of miles to the south where it is warmer. In the spring, they return to their homes. ( Figure 12.7). Monarch butterflies also migrate from Mexico to the northern U.S. in the summer and back to Mexico in the winter. These types of migrations move entire populations from one location to another. 
A flock of barnacle geese fly in formation 	  during the autumn migration. 
Exponential  Growth 	  Population growth can be described with two models, based on the size of the population and necessary resources. These two types of growth are known as exponential growth and logistic growth. If a population is given unlimited amounts of resources, such as food and water, land if needed, moisture, oxygen, and other environmental factors, it will grow exponentially. Exponential growth occurs as a population grows larger, dramatically increasing the growth rate. This is shown as a "J-shaped" curve below ( Figure 12.8). You can see that the population grows slowly at first, but as time passes, growth occurs more and more rapidly. In nature, organisms do not usually have ideal environments with unlimited food. In nature, there are limits. Sometimes, there will be plenty of food. Sometimes, a fire will wipe out all of the available nutrients. Sometimes a predator will kill many individuals in a population. How do you think these limits affect the way organisms grow? Usually, populations first grow exponentially while resources are abundant. But as populations increase and resources become less available, rates of growth slow down and slowly level off, reaching the carrying capacity. The carrying capacity is the upper limit to the population size that the environment can support. This type of growth is shown as an "S-shaped" curve below ( Figure 12.8) and is called logistic growth. Why do you think occurs? Growth of populations according to exponential (or J-curve) growth model (left) and logistic (or S-curve) growth model (right). Time is plotted on the x-axis, and population size is plotted on the y-axis. 
Summary 	  • Population growth rate is affected by birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration. • If a population is given unlimited amounts of food, moisture, and oxygen, and other environmental factors, it will show exponential growth. Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow. • Population Growth at URL (2:58) Click image to the left or use the URL below. long it took the human population to reach 1 billion, is this pattern consistent with an exponential growth model? population is experiencing currently? Does this rate represent an increase or decrease from previous growth rates? • Give examples of limiting factors to population growth. • Explain how limiting factors affect population growth. What happened during the Irish Potato Famine? In the 1800s, a disease called potato blight destroyed much of the potato crop in Ireland. Since many Irish people depended on potatoes as their staple food, mass starvation and emigration resulted. This caused Ireland’s population to dramatically decrease. Lack of food is one factor that can limit population growth. 
Limiting  Factors to  Population  Growth 	  For a population to be healthy, factors such as food, nutrients, water and space, must be available. What happens when there are not resources to support the population? Limiting factors are resources or other factors in the environment that can lower the population growth rate. Limiting factors include a low food supply and lack of space. Limiting factors can lower birth rates, increase death rates, or lead to emigration. When organisms face limiting factors, they show logistic growth (S-shaped curve, curve B: Figure 12.9). Competition for resources like food and space cause the growth rate to stop increasing, so the population levels off. This flat upper line on a growth curve is the carrying capacity. The carrying capacity (K) is the maximum population size that can be supported in a particular area without destroying the habitat. Limiting factors determine the carrying capacity of a population. Recall that when there are no limiting factors, the population grows exponentially. In exponential growth (J-shaped curve, curve A: Figure 12.9), as the population size increases, the growth rate also increases. 
A shows exponential growth.  Curve  	  shows logistic growth. Notice that the carrying capacity (K) is also shown. 
Food  Supply as  Limiting  Factor 	  If there are 12 hamburgers at a lunch table and 24 people sit down at a lunch table, will everyone be able to eat? At first, maybe you will split hamburgers in half, but if more and more people keep coming to sit at the lunch table, you will not be able to feed everyone. This is what happens in nature. But in nature, organisms that cannot get food will die or find a new place to live. It is possible for any resource to be a limiting factor, however, a resource such as food can have dramatic consequences on a population. In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. When the population decreases to a certain level where every individual can get enough food and other resources, and the birth and death rates become stable, the population has leveled off at its carrying capacity. 
Other  Limiting  Factors 	  Other limiting factors include light, water, nutrients or minerals, oxygen, the ability of an ecosystem to recycle nutrients and/or waste, disease and/or parasites, temperature, space, and predation. Can you think of some other factors that limit populations? Weather can also be a limiting factor. Whereas most plants like rain, an individual cactus-like Agave americana plant actually likes to grow when it is dry. Rainfall limits reproduction of this plant which, in turn, limits growth rate. Can you think of some other factors like this? Human activities can also limit the growth of populations. Such activities include use of pesticides, such as DDT, use of herbicides, and habitat destruction.

Too many people? In October 2011, the human population passed 7 billion people. What problems could result if the human population continues its rapid rise? One issue is that overpopulation makes many environmental issues more serious. More people on the planet means more food and water is needed and more pollution is generated. Is there a carrying capacity for the human population? 
Human  Population 	  How quickly is the human population growing? If we look at worldwide human population growth from 10,000 BCE through today, our growth looks like exponential growth. It increased very slowly at first, but later grew faster and faster as the population increased in size ( Figure 12.10). And recently, the human population has increased at a faster pace than ever before. It has taken only 12 years for the world’s population to increase from six billion to seven billion. Considering that in the year 1804, there were just one billion people, and in 1927, there were just two billion people (that’s 123 years to increase from 1 to 2 billion), the recent increase in the human population growth rate is characteristic of exponential growth. Does this mean there are unlimited resources? 
Five  Stages 	  On the other hand, if you look at human population growth in specific countries, you may see a different pattern. On the level of a country, the history of human population growth can be divided into five stages, as described in Table 12.2. Some countries have very high birth rates, in some countries the growth rate has stabilized, and in some countries the growth rate is in decline.

Significant drop in death rate, resulting in exponential 	  growth. This occurred in 18thand 19th-century Europe. Population size continues to grow. 
Birth rates equal death rates and populations become 	  stable. Total population size may level off. The United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau predict that by 2050, the Earth will be populated by 9.4 billion people. Other estimates predict 10 to 11 billion. 
Future  Growth 	  There are two different beliefs about what type of growth the human population will undergo in the future: and maybe humans themselves. technology can solve problems caused by limited resources, such as lack of food. The Cornucopians believe that a larger population is good for technology and innovation. The 5-stage model above predicts that when all countries are industrialized, the human population will eventually level out. But many scientists and other Neo-Malthusians believe that humans have already gone over the Earth’s carrying capacity. That means, we may have already reached the maximum population size that can be supported, without destroying our resources and habitat. If this is true, then human overpopulation will lead to a lack of food and other resources. Overpopulation may also lead to increased disease, and/or war. These problems may cause the population of humans to crash. If these issues are not controlled, could the human population go extinct? Which of the above theories makes sense to you? Why? 
Summary 	  • The human population is undergoing exponential growth. • Future outlooks on human population growth differ; some think we will have a limitless amount of resources, while others think we have already reached our carrying capacity.

What does it mean to compete? If you are in competition with someone, it usually means you are in a contest for a prize. The prize might just be bragging rights. In nature, the stakes are higher. Organisms must compete for resources necessary for life. 
Competition 	  Recall that ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment. But how do organisms interact with each other? Organisms interact with each other through various mechanisms, one of which is competition. Competition occurs when organisms strive for limited resources. Competition can be for food, water, light, or space. This interaction can be between organisms of the same species (intraspecific) or between organisms of different species (interspecific). Intraspecific competition happens when members of the same species compete for the same resources. For example, two trees may grow close together and compete for light. One may out-compete the other by growing taller to get more available light. As members of the same species are usually genetically different, they have different characteristics, and in this example, one tree grows taller than the other. The organism that is better adapted to that environment is better able to survive. The other organism may not survive. In this example, it is the taller tree that is better adapted to the environment. Interspecific competition happens when individuals of different species strive for a limited resource in the same area. Since any two species have different traits, one species will be able to out-compete the other. One species will be better adapted to its environment, and essentially "win" the competition. The other species will have lower reproductive success and lower population growth, resulting in a lower survival rate. For example, cheetahs and lions feed on similar prey. If prey is limited, then lions may catch more prey than cheetahs. This will force the cheetahs to either leave the area or suffer a decrease in population. Looking at different types of competition, ecologists developed the competitive exclusion principle. The principle states that species less suited to compete for resources will either adapt, move from the area, or die out. In order for two species within the same area to coexist, they may adapt by developing different specializations. This is known as character displacement. An example of character displacement is when different birds adapt to eating different types of food. They can develop different types of bills, like Darwin’s Finches ( Figure 12.11). Therefore, competition for resources within and between species plays an important role in evolution through natural selection. An example of character displacement, showing different types of bill for eating different types of foods, in Darwin’s or Galapagos Finches.

Explain your answer. this were not the case? • Define predation. • Explain the different types of predation. • Describe how predation affects the community. • Explain the advantages of camouflage and mimicry. Can insects hunt for food? When you think of an animal hunting for its food, large animals such as lions may come to mind. But many tiny animals also hunt for their food. For example, this praying mantis is eating a fly. To eat the fly, the praying mantis first had to catch the fly, which is a form of hunting. 
Predation 	  Predation is another mechanism in which species interact with each other. Predation is when a predator organism feeds on another living organism or organisms, known as prey. The predator always lowers the prey’s fitness. It does this by keeping the prey from surviving, reproducing, or both. Predator-prey relationships are essential to maintaining the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. Examples of predator-prey relationships include the lion and zebra, the bear and fish, and the fox and rabbit. There are different types of predation, including: • true predation. • grazing. • parasitism. True predation is when a predator kills and eats its prey. Some predators of this type, such as jaguars, kill large prey. They tear it apart and chew it before eating it. Others, like bottlenose dolphins or snakes, may eat their prey 
This lion is an example of a predator on 	  the hunt. whole. In some cases, the prey dies in the mouth or the digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of plankton at once. The prey is digested afterward. True predators may hunt actively for prey, or they may sit and wait for prey to get within striking distance. Certain traits enable organisms to be effective hunters. These include camouflage, speed, and heightened senses. These traits also enable certain prey to avoid predators. In grazing, the predator eats part of the prey but does not usually kill it. You may have seen cows grazing on grass. The grass they eat grows back, so there is no real effect on the population. In the ocean, kelp (a type of seaweed) can regrow after being eaten by fish. Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species. These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Prey also have adaptations for avoiding predators. Prey sometimes avoid detection by using camouflage ( Figure background. Mimicry is a related adaptation in which a species uses appearance to copy or mimic another species. For example, a non-poisonous dart frog may evolve to look like a poisonous dart frog. Why do you think this is an adaptation for the non-poisonous dart frog? Mimicry can be used by both predators and prey ( Figure 12.14). Parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship and will be described in the Symbiosis concept. Camouflage by the dead leaf mantis makes it less visible to both its

Is this little fish about to become lunch? Actually, this big fish is not opening his mouth to munch on these little fish. He is opening his mouth to get his teeth cleaned! These small fish eat dead skin and parasites from his body. Both types of fish benefit from this relationship. 
Symbiosis 	  Symbiosis describes a close and long-term relationship between different species. At least one species will benefit in a symbiotic relationship. These relationships are often necessary for the survival of one or both organisms. There are three types of symbiotic relationships: mutualism, communalism, and parasitism. • Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit. • Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other is not affected. • Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which the parasitic species benefits while the host species is harmed. An example of a mutualistic relationship is between herbivores (plant-eaters) and the bacteria that live in their intestines. The bacteria get a place to live. Meanwhile, the bacteria help the herbivore digest food. Both species benefit, so this is a mutualistic relationship. The clownfish and the sea anemones also have a mutualistic relationship. The clownfish protects the anemone from anemone-eating fish, and the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from predators ( Figure 12.15). Another example of this type of symbiotic relationship is the relationship between the plover bird and the African crocodile. The tiny blackbird acts as a toothpick for the fierce crocodile, and helps by removing tiny morsels of food that are stuck between the crocodile’s teeth. These food remains are the source of food for the bird. Another example is between the ostrich and the zebra. The ostrich always moves with the herd of zebras since it has a poor sense of hearing and smell, whereas the zebra has very sharp senses. The ostrich has a keen sense of sight, which the zebra lacks. Hence, these two species depend on each other to warn one another of any nearby imposing dangers. Commensal relationships may involve an organism using another for transportation or housing. For example, spiders build their webs on trees. The spider gets to live in the tree, but the tree is unaffected. Other commensal relationships exist between cattle egrets and livestock. Cattle egrets are mostly found in meadows and grasslands are always seen near cattle, horses and other livestock. These birds feed on the insects that come out of the field due to the movement of the animals. They even eat ticks, fleas, and other insects off the back of animals. The relationship between tigers and golden jackals is also commensalism. The jackal alerts the tiger to a kill and feeds on the remains of the prey left by the tiger. This is not a mutualistic relationship as the tiger does not provide anything to the jackal. Parasites may live either inside or on the surface of their host. An example of a parasite is a hookworm. Hookworms are roundworms that affect the small intestine and lungs of a host organism. They live inside of humans and cause them pain. However, the hookworms must live inside of a host in order to survive. Parasites may even kill the host they live on, but then they also kill their host organism, so this is rare. Parasites are found in animals, plants, and fungi. Hookworms are common in the moist tropic and subtropic regions. There is very little risk of getting a parasite in industrialized nations.

What nonliving things are essential for life? Living organisms cannot exist without the nonliving aspects of the environment. For example: air, water, and sunlight, which are all nonliving, are all essential to living organisms. Both nonliving and living things make up an ecosystem. What is an Ecosystem? Ecology is the study of ecosystems. That is, ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with the nonliving part of their environment. An ecosystem consists of all the nonliving factors and living organisms interacting in the same habitat. Recall that living organisms are biotic factors. The biotic factors of an ecosystem include all the populations in a habitat, such as all the species of plants, animals, and fungi, as well as all the micro-organisms. Also recall that the nonliving factors are called abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include temperature, water, soil, and air. You can find an ecosystem in a large body of fresh water or in a small aquarium. You can find an ecosystem in a large thriving forest or in a small piece of dead wood. Examples of ecosystems are as diverse as the rainforest, the savanna, the tundra, or the desert ( Figure 12.16). The differences in the abiotic factors, such as differences in temperature, rainfall, and soil quality, found in these areas greatly contribute to the differences seen in these ecosystems. Ecosystems can include well known sites, such as the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park, which actually includes a few different ecosystems, some with geothermal features, such as Old Faithful geyser. Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, Arizona. Ecosystems need energy. Many ecosystems get their energy in the form of sunlight, which enters the ecosystem through photosynthesis. This energy then flows through the ecosystem, passed from producers to consumers. Plants are producers in many ecosystems. Energy flows from plants to the herbivores that eat the plants, and then to carnivores that eat the herbivores. The flow of energy depicts interactions of organisms within an ecosystem. Matter is also recycled in ecosystems. Biogeochemical cycles recycle nutrients, like carbon and nitrogen, so they are always available. These nutrients are used over and over again by organisms. Water is also continuously recycled. The flow of energy and the recycling of nutrients and water are examples of the interactions between organisms and the interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem.

What is your niche at school? Are you on the basketball team? Are you a cheerleader? Do you play an instrument in the band? Your niche would be your role or place in the school. Organisms also each have their own niche in the ecosystem. Is an organism a producer or a consumer? How does the organism interact with other organisms? Is the organism involved in any symbiotic relationships? 
Niche 	  Each organism plays a particular role in its ecosystem. A niche is the role a species plays in the ecosystem. In other words, a niche is how an organism “makes a living.” A niche will include the organism’s role in the flow of energy through the ecosystem. This involves how the organism gets its energy, which usually has to do with what an organism eats, and how the organism passes that energy through the ecosystem, which has to do with what eats the organism. An organism’s niche also includes how the organism interacts with other organisms, and its role in recycling nutrients. Once a niche is left vacant, other organisms can fill that position. For example when the Tarpan, a small wild horse found mainly in southern Russia, became extinct in the early 1900s, its niche was filled by a small horse breed, the Konik ( Figure 12.17). Often this occurs as a new species evolves to occupy the vacant niche. The Konik horse. A species’ niche must be specific to that species; no two species can fill the same niche. They can have very similar niches, which can overlap, but there must be distinct differences between any two niches. If two species do fill the same niche, they will compete for all necessary resources. One species will out compete the other, forcing the other species to adapt or risk extinction. This is known as competitive exclusion. When plants and animals are introduced, either intentionally or by accident, into a new environment, they can occupy the existing niches of native organisms. Sometimes new species out-compete native species, and the native species may go extinct. They can then become a serious pest. For example, kudzu, a Japanese vine, was planted in the southeastern United States in the 1870s to help control soil loss. Kudzu had no natural predators, so it was able to out-compete native species of vine and take over their niches ( Figure 12.18). 
Habitat 	  The habitat is the physical area where a species lives. Many factors are used to describe a habitat. The average amount of sunlight received each day, the range of annual temperatures, and average yearly rainfall can all describe a habitat. These and other abiotic factors will affect the kind of traits an organism must have in order to survive there. The temperature, the amount of rainfall, the type of soil and other abiotic factors all have a significant role in determining the plants that invade an area. The plants then determine the animals that come to eat the plants, and so on. A habitat should not be confused with an ecosystem: the habitat is the actual place of the ecosystem, whereas the ecosystem includes both the biotic and abiotic factors in the habitat. Habitat destruction means what it sounds like—an organism’s habitat is destroyed. Habitat destruction can cause a population to decrease. If bad enough, it can also cause species to go extinct. Clearing large areas of land for housing developments or businesses can cause habitat destruction. Poor fire management, pest and weed invasion, and storm damage can also destroy habitats. National parks, nature reserves, and other protected areas all preserve habitats. Kudzu, a Japanese vine introduced intentionally to the southeastern United States, has out-competed the native vegetation.

How do they differ? • Define biome and describe how they are classified. • Explain what determines the differences among biomes. • Distinguish terrestrial biomes from aquatic biomes. Where was this picture taken? This scene is from Anza-Borrago California Desert Park. However, deserts exist around the globe. You might find a similar picture of a desert in Africa. The desert is one type of biome. What are Biomes? Tropical rainforests and deserts are two familiar types of biomes. A biome is an area with similar populations of organisms. This can easily be seen with a community of plants and animals. Remember that a community is all of the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another. Different biomes, such as a forest ( Figure 12.21) or a desert, obviously have different communities of plants and animals. How are the plants and animals different in the rainforest than those in the desert? Why do you think they are so different? The differences in the biomes are due to differences in the abiotic factors, especially climate. Climate is the typical weather in an area over a long period of time. The climate includes the amount of rainfall and the average temperature in the region. Obviously, the climate in the desert is much different than the climate in the rainforest. As a result, different types of plants and animals live in each biome. There are into two major groups of biomes: Tropical rainforest landscape in Hawaii. 
Notice how the plants are different from 	  those in the desert. The abiotic factors, such as the amount of rainfall and the temperature, are going to influence other abiotic factors, such as the quality of the soil. This, in turn, is going to influence the plants that migrate into the ecosystem and thrive in that biome. Recall that migration is the movement of an organism into or out of a population. It can also refer to a whole new species moving into a habitat. The type of plants that live in a biome are going to attract a certain type of animal to that habitat. It is the interaction of the abiotic and biotic factors that describe a biome and ecosystem. In aquatic biomes, abiotic factors such as salt, sunlight and temperature play significant roles. For example, a hot dry biome is going to be completely different from a moderate wet biome. The soil quality will be different. Together, these will result in different plants being able to occupy each biome. Different plants will attract different animals (herbivores) to eat these plants. These animals, in turn, will attract different (carnivores) animals to eat the herbivores. So it is the abiotic factors that determine the biotic factors of an ecosystem, and together these define the biome.

Terrestrial  Biomes 	  A terrestrial biome is an area of land with a similar climate that includes similar communities of plants and animals. Different terrestrial biomes are usually defined in terms of their plants, such as trees, shrubs, and grasses. Factors such as latitude, humidity, and elevation affect biome type: • Latitude means how far a biome is from the equator. Moving from the poles to the equator, you will find (in order) Arctic, boreal, temperate, subtropical, and tropical biomes. • Humidity is the amount of water in the air. Air with a high concentration of water will be called humid. Moving away from the most humid climate, biomes will be called semi-humid, semi-arid, or arid (the driest). • Elevation measures how high land is above sea level. It gets colder as you go higher above sea level, which is why you see snow-capped mountains. Terrestrial biomes include grasslands, forests, deserts, and tundra. Grasslands are characterized as lands dominated by grasses rather than large shrubs or trees and include the savanna and temperate grasslands. Forests are dominated by trees and other woody vegetation and are classified based on their latitude. Forests include tropical, temperate, and boreal forests (taiga). Deserts cover about one fifth of the Earth’s surface and occur where rainfall is less than frost-molded landscapes, extremely low temperatures, little precipitation, poor nutrients, and short growing seasons. There are two main types of tundra, Arctic and Alpine tundras. Terrestrial biomes ( Figure 12.22) lying within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles do not have very much plant or animal life. Biomes with the highest amount of biodiversity, that is the most variation in plant and animal life, are near the equator ( Figure 12.23). 
One of the terrestrial biomes, taiga, is an 	  evergreen forest of the subarctic, covering extensive areas of northern North America and Eurasia. This taiga is along the Denali Highway in Alaska.

How does this affect the animals living in this biome? • Give examples of marine biomes. • Define freshwater biome. • Distinguish the photic zone from the aphotic zone. • Explain dissolved oxygen and nutrient distribution in aquatic biomes. Is there life deep in the ocean? Yes, there is life even at great depths in the ocean. One example of deep ocean life is this deep-sea chimaera. Chimaeras are related to sharks and resemble them somewhat. But most chimaeras are adapted for life thousands of feet under the ocean surface. This is one example of an organism that lives in an aquatic biome. 
Aquatic  Biomes 	  Recall that terrestrial biomes are defined by their climate. That’s because plants and animals are adapted for certain amounts of temperature and moisture. However, would aquatic biomes be classified in the same way? No, that wouldn’t make much sense—all parts of an aquatic environment have plenty of water. Aquatic biomes can be generally classified based on the amount of salt in the water. Freshwater biomes have less than 1% salt and are typical of ponds and lakes, streams and rivers, and wetlands. Marine biomes have more salt and are characteristic of the oceans, coral reefs, and estuaries. Most aquatic organisms do not have to deal with extremes of temperature or moisture. Instead, their main limiting factors are the availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water. 
Marine  Biomes 	  Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called marine biomes. Organisms that live in marine biomes must be adapted to the salt in the water. For example, many have organs for excreting excess salt. Marine biomes include the oceans, coral reefs, and estuaries ( Figure 12.24). The oceans are the largest of all the ecosystems. They can be divided into four separate zones based on the amount of sunlight. Ocean zones are also divided based on their depth and their distance from land. Each zone has a great diversity of species. Within a coral reef, the dominant organisms are corals. Corals consist partially of algae, which provide nutrients via photosynthesis. Corals also extend tentacles to obtain plankton from the water. Coral reefs include several species of microorganisms, invertebrates, fishes, sea urchins, octopuses, and sea stars. Estuaries are areas where freshwater streams or rivers merge with the ocean. An example of a marine biome, a kelp forest, from Anacapa Island in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. 
Freshwater  Biomes 	  Freshwater biomes are defined by their low salt concentration, usually less than 1%. Plants and animals in freshwater regions are adjusted to the low salt content and would not be able to survive in areas of high salt concentration, such as the ocean. There are different types of freshwater biomes: ponds and lakes ( Figure 12.25), streams and rivers, and wetlands. Ponds and lakes range in size from just a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. Streams and rivers are bodies of flowing water moving in one direction. They can be found everywhere. They get their starts at headwaters, which may be springs, melting snow, or even lakes, and then travel all the way to their mouths, emptying into another water channel or the ocean. Wetlands are areas of standing water that support aquatic plants. Wetlands include marshes, swamps, and bogs. 
Lake  Tahoe in  Northern  California is a 	  freshwater biome. 
Aquatic  Biomes and  Sunlight 	  In large bodies of water, such as the ocean and lakes, the water can be divided into zones based on the amount of sunlight it receives: where enough sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur. Algae and other photosynthetic organisms can make food and support food webs. thesis to occur. As a result, producers must make "food" by chemosynthesis, or the food must drift down from the water above. 
Aquatic  Biomes and  Dissolved  Substances 	  Water in lakes and the ocean also varies in the amount of dissolved oxygen and nutrients it contains: is because surface water absorbs oxygen from the air above it. nutrients enter the water from land. They are carried by runoff, streams, and rivers that empty into a body of water. When aquatic organisms die, they sink to the bottom. Decomposers near the bottom of the water break down the dead organisms and release their nutrients back into the water. 
Summary 	  • Aquatic biomes are distinguished by the availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water. • The photic zone extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters, while the aphotic zone is deeper than 200 meters. • Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called marine biomes.

Is Earth a living organism? Most scientists agree that the Earth itself is not a living thing. However, the Earth does have some aspects of life. Some scientists argue that the Earth maintains homeostasis, a stable state, just like a living organisms. 
The  Biosphere 	  The highest level of ecological organization is the biosphere. It is the part of Earth, including the air, land, surface rocks, and water, where life is found. Parts of the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere make up the biosphere. The lithosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth’s crust; essentially land is part of the lithosphere. The hydrosphere is composed of all the areas that contain water, which can be found on, under, and over the surface of Earth. The atmosphere is the layer of gas that surrounds the planet. The biosphere includes the area from about atmosphere. Land plants and animals are found on the lithosphere, freshwater and marine plants and animals are found in the hydrosphere, and birds and other flying animals are found in the atmosphere. Of course, there are countless bacteria, protists, and fungi that are also found in the biosphere. Is the Biosphere Living? The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis. For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention. For a better understanding of how the biosphere works and various dysfunctions related to human activity, scientists have simulated the biosphere in small-scale models. Biosphere 2 ( Figure 12.26) is a laboratory in Arizona that contains 3.15 acres of closed ecosystems. Ecosystems of Biosphere 2 are an ocean ecosystem with a coral reef, mangrove wetlands, a tropical rainforest, a savannah grassland and a fog desert. See URL for additional information. Additional biosphere projects include BIOS-3, a closed ecosystem in Siberia, and Biosphere J, located in Japan. Biosphere 2, in Arizona, contains 3.15 acres of closed ecosystem and is a smallscale model of the biosphere.

Where does all the bear’s energy come from? Bears get their energy from their food. Brown bears eat a varied diet, from nuts and berries to fish and other animals. When bears eat a berry, they are obtaining energy that the plant originally captured from the sun. Even when a bear eats another animal, the energy in that animal ultimately came from eating a producer that captured the sun’s energy. 
Producers 	  Energy is the ability to do work. In organisms, this work can be physical work, like walking or jumping, or it can be the work used to carry out the chemical processes in their cells. Every biochemical reaction that occurs in an organism’s cells needs energy. All organisms need a constant supply of energy to stay alive. Some organisms can get the energy directly from the sun. Other organisms get their energy from other organisms. Through predator-prey relationships, the energy of one organism is passed on to another. Energy is constantly flowing through a community. With just a few exceptions, all life on Earth depends on the sun’s energy for survival. The energy of the sun is first captured by producers ( Figure 12.27), organisms that can make their own food. Many producers make their own food through the process of photosynthesis. The "food" the producers make is the sugar, glucose. Producers make food for the rest of the ecosystem. As energy is not recycled, energy must consistently be captured by producers. This energy is then passed on to the organisms that eat the producers, and then to the organisms that eat those organisms, and so on. Recall that the only required ingredients needed for photosynthesis are sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O). From these simple inorganic ingredients, photosynthetic organisms produce the carbohydrate glucose (C6H12O6), and other complex organic compounds. Essentially, these producers are changing the energy from the sunlight into a usable form of energy. They are also making the oxygen that we breathe. Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis. The survival of every ecosystem is dependent on the producers. Without producers capturing the energy from the sun and turning it into glucose, an ecosystem could not exist. On land, plants are the dominant producers. Phytoplankton, tiny photosynthetic organisms, are the most common producers in the oceans and lakes. Algae, which is the green layer you might see floating on a pond, are an example of phytoplankton. There are also bacteria that use chemical processes to produce food. They get their energy from sources other than the sun, but they are still called producers. This process is known as chemosynthesis, and is common in ecosystems without sunlight, such as certain marine ecosystems. Producers include (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) diatoms. 
Summary 	  • With just a few exceptions, all life on Earth depends on the sun’s energy for survival. • Producers make food for the rest of the ecosystem through the process of photosynthesis, where the energy of the sun is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose.

What is breaking down this leaf? Notice how this leaf is slowly being broken down. This process can be carried out by fungi and bacteria on the ground. Breaking down old leaves is an important process since it releases the nutrients in the dead leaves back into the soil for living plants to use. 
Consumers and  Decomposers 	  Recall that producers make their own food through photosynthesis. But many organisms are not producers and cannot make their own food. So how do these organisms obtain their energy? They must get their energy from other organisms. They must eat other organisms, or obtain their energy from these organisms some other way. The organisms that obtain their energy from other organisms are called consumers. All animals are consumers, and they eat other organisms. Fungi and many protists and bacteria are also consumers. But, whereas animals eat other organisms, fungi, protists, and bacteria "consume" organisms through different methods. The consumers can be placed into different groups, depending on what they consume. • Herbivores are animals that eat producers to get energy. For example, rabbits and deer are herbivores that eat plants. The caterpillar pictured below ( Figure 12.28) is a herbivore. Animals that eat phytoplankton in aquatic environments are also herbivores. • Carnivores feed on animals, either herbivores or other carnivores. Snakes that eat mice are carnivores. Hawks that eat snakes are also carnivores ( Figure 12.28). • Omnivores eat both producers and consumers. Most people are omnivores, since they eat fruits, vegetables, and grains from plants, and also meat and dairy products from animals. Dogs, bears, and raccoons are also omnivores. 
Examples of consumers are caterpillars 	  (herbivores) and hawks (carnivore). 
Decomposers and  Stability 	  Decomposers ( Figure 12.29) get nutrients and energy by breaking down dead organisms and animal wastes. Through this process, decomposers release nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen, back into the environment. These nutrients are recycled back into the ecosystem so that the producers can use them. They are passed to other organisms when they are eaten or consumed. Many of these nutrients are recycled back into the soil, so they can be taken up by the roots of plants. The stability of an ecosystem depends on the actions of the decomposers. Examples of decomposers include mushrooms on a decaying log. Bacteria in the soil are also decomposers. Imagine what would happen if there were no decomposers. Wastes and the remains of dead organisms would pile up and the nutrients within the waste and dead organisms would not be released back into the ecosystem. Producers would not have enough nutrients. The carbon and nitrogen necessary to build organic compounds, and then cells, allowing an organism to grow, would be insufficient. Other nutrients necessary for an organism to function properly would also not be sufficient. Essentially, many organisms could not exist. Examples of decomposers are (a) bacteria and (b) fungi.

How do the grasshopper and the grass interact? Grasshoppers don’t just hop on the grass. They also eat the grass. Other organisms also eat the grass, and some animals even eat the grasshopper. These interactions can be visualized by drawing a food web. 
Food  Webs 	  Energy must constantly flow through an ecosystem for the system to remain stable. What exactly does this mean? Essentially, it means that organisms must eat other organisms. Food chains ( Figure 12.30) show the eating patterns in an ecosystem. Food energy flows from one organism to another. Arrows are used to show the feeding relationship between the animals. The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism that eats it. For example, an arrow from a plant to a grasshopper shows that the grasshopper eats the leaves. Energy and nutrients are moving from the plant to the grasshopper. Next, a bird might prey on the grasshopper, a snake may eat the bird, and then an owl might eat the snake. The food chain would be: plant → grasshopper → bird → snake → owl. A food chain cannot continue to go on and on. For example the food chain could not be: plant → grasshopper → spider → frog → lizard → fox → hawk. 
This food chain includes producers and 	  consumers. How could you add decomposers to the food chain? Food chains only have 4 or 5 total levels. Therefore, a chain has only 3 or 4 levels for energy transfer. In an ocean ecosystem, one possible food chain might look like this: phytoplankton → krill → fish → shark. The producers are always at the beginning of the food chain, bringing energy into the ecosystem. Through photosynthesis, the producers create their own food in the form of glucose, but also create the food for the other organisms in the ecosystem. The herbivores come next, then the carnivores. When these consumers eat other organisms, they use the glucose in those organisms for energy. In this example, phytoplankton are eaten by krill, which are tiny, shrimp-like animals. The krill are eaten by fish, which are then eaten by sharks. Could decomposers be added to a food chain? Each organism can eat and be eaten by many different types of organisms, so simple food chains are rare in nature. There are also many different species of fish and sharks. So a food chain cannot end with a shark; it must end with a distinct species of shark. A food chain does not contain the general category of "fish," it will contain specific species of fish. In ecosystems, there are many food chains. Since feeding relationships are so complicated, we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an ecosystem. A food web ( Figure 12.31) shows the feeding relationships between many organisms in an ecosystem. If you expand our original example of a food chain, you could add deer that eat clover and foxes that hunt chipmunks. A food web shows many more arrows, but still shows the flow of energy. A complete food web may show hundreds of different feeding relationships. For more information on food chains, see A Million Sharks at URL . Food web in the Arctic Ocean.

How much energy could be gained from the warthog? If the cheetah is successful in capturing the warthog, it would gain some energy by eating it. But would the cheetah gain as much energy as the warthog has ever consumed? No, the warthog has used up some of the energy it has consumed for its own needs. The cheetah will only gain a fraction of the energy that the warthog has consumed throughout its lifetime. 
Energy  Pyramids 	  When an herbivore eats a plant, the energy in the plant tissues is used by the herbivore. But how much of that energy is transferred to the herbivore? Remember that plants are producers, bringing the energy into the ecosystem by converting sunlight into glucose. Does the plant use some of the energy for its own needs? Recall the energy is the ability to do work, and the plant has plenty or "work" to do. So of course it needs and uses energy. It converts the glucose it makes into ATP through cellular respiration just like other organisms. After the plant uses the energy from glucose for its own needs, the excess energy is available to the organism that eats the plant. The herbivore uses the energy from the plant to power its own life processes and to build more body tissues. However, only about 10% of the total energy from the plant gets stored in the herbivore’s body as extra body tissue. The rest of the energy is used by the herbivore and released as heat. The next consumer on the food chain that eats the herbivore will only store about 10% of the total energy from the herbivore in its own body. This means the carnivore will store only about 1% of the total energy that was originally in the plant. In other words, only about 10% of energy of one step in a food chain is stored in the next step in the food chain. The majority of the energy is used by the organism or released to the environment. Every time energy is transferred from one organism to another, there is a loss of energy. This loss of energy can be shown in an energy pyramid. An example of an energy pyramid is pictured below ( Figure 12.32). Since there is energy loss at each step in a food chain, it takes many producers to support just a few carnivores in a community. Each step of the food chain in the energy pyramid is called a trophic level. Plants or other photosynthetic organisms ( autotrophs) are found on the first trophic level, at the bottom of the pyramid. The next level will be the herbivores, and then the carnivores that eat the herbivores. The energy pyramid ( Figure 12.32) shows four levels of a food chain, from producers to carnivores. Because of the high rate of energy loss in food chains, there are usually only trophic levels. Heterotrophs are found in all levels of an energy pyramid other than the first level. As illustrated by this ecological pyramid, it takes a lot of phytoplankton to support the carnivores of the oceans. This energy pyramid has four trophic levels, which signify the organisms place in the food chain from the original source of energy.

Could you be drinking the same water as George Washington? Water is recycled constantly through the ecosystem. That means any water you drank today has been around for millions of years. You could be drinking water that was once drunk by George Washington, the first humans, or even the dinosaurs. 
The  Water  Cycle 	  Whereas energy flows through an ecosystem, water and elements like carbon and nitrogen are recycled. Water and nutrients are constantly being recycled through the environment. This process through which water or a chemical element is continuously recycled in an ecosystem is called a biogeochemical cycle. This recycling process involves both the living organisms (biotic components) and nonliving things (abiotic factors) in the ecosystem. Through biogeochemical cycles, water and other chemical elements are constantly being passed through living organisms to non-living matter and back again, over and over. Three important biogeochemical cycles are the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. The biogeochemical cycle that recycles water is the water cycle. The water cycle involves a series of interconnected pathways involving both the biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere. Water is obviously an extremely important aspect of every ecosystem. Life cannot exist without water. Many organisms contain a large amount of water in their bodies, and many live in water, so the water cycle is essential to life on Earth. Water continuously moves between living organisms, such as plants, and non-living things, such as clouds, rivers, and oceans ( Figure The water cycle does not have a real starting or ending point. It is an endless recycling process that involves the oceans, lakes and other bodies of water, as well as the land surfaces and the atmosphere. The steps in the water cycle are as follows, starting with the water in the oceans: is stored in clouds. the water to return again to the Earth’s surface. reserves, also known as groundwater. Much of this underground water is stored in aquifers, which are porous layers of rock that can hold water. 
Run-off 	  Most precipitation that occurs over land, however, is not absorbed by the soil and is called runoff. This runoff collects in streams and rivers and eventually flows back into the ocean. 
Transpiration 	  Water also moves through the living organisms in an ecosystem. Plants soak up large amounts of water through their roots. The water then moves up the plant and evaporates from the leaves in a process called transpiration. The process of transpiration, like evaporation, returns water back into the atmosphere.

Why is Earth getting warmer? What happens if carbon is not removed from the atmosphere? The excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming. Where does this carbon dioxide come from? Burning gas to power our cars and burning coal to generate electricity are two main sources of the excess carbon dioxide. 
The  Carbon  Cycle 	  Carbon is one of the most common elements found in living organisms. Chains of carbon molecules form the backbones of many organic molecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Carbon is constantly cycling between living organisms and the atmosphere ( Figure 12.34). The cycling of carbon occurs through the carbon cycle. Living organisms cannot make their own carbon, so how is carbon incorporated into living organisms? In the atmosphere, carbon is in the form of carbon dioxide gas (CO2). Recall that plants and other producers capture the carbon dioxide and convert it to glucose (C6H12O6) through the process of photosynthesis. Then as animals eat plants or other animals, they gain the carbon from those organisms. The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6+ 6O2. How does this carbon in living things end up back in the atmosphere? Remember that we breathe out carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is generated through the process of cellular respiration, which has the reverse chemical reaction as photosynthesis. That means when our cells burn food (glucose) for energy, carbon dioxide is released. We, like all animals, exhale this carbon dioxide and return it back to the atmosphere. Also, carbon is released to the atmosphere as an organism dies and decomposes. Cellular respiration and photosynthesis can be described as a cycle, as one uses carbon dioxide (and water) and makes oxygen (and glucose), and the other uses oxygen (and glucose) and makes carbon dioxide (and water). The carbon cycle. The cycling of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis and cellular respiration are main components of the carbon cycle. Carbon is also returned to the atmosphere by the burning of organic matter (combustion) and fossil fuels and decomposition of organic matter. 
Formation of  Fossil  Fuels 	  Millions of years ago, there were so many dead plants and animals that they could not completely decompose before they were buried. They were covered over by soil or sand, tar or ice. These dead plants and animals are organic matter made out of cells full of carbon-containing organic compounds (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids). What happened to all this carbon? When organic matter is under pressure for millions of years, it forms fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas. When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure 12.35). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas, since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. 
Human activities like burning gasoline in 	  cars are contributing to a global change in our climate. 
Summary 	  • During the carbon cycle, animals and plants add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through cellular respiration, and plants remove carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. • The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.

What can bean plants do that most other plants can’t? No, they don’t grow giant stalks to the clouds. Bean plants and other legumes (plants that have their seeds in pods) can use the nitrogen in the air to grow. It takes the help of special bacteria friends in the soil, and this relationship is unique to the legumes. 
The  Nitrogen  Cycle 	  Like water and carbon, nitrogen is also repeatedly recycled through the biosphere. This process is called the nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen is one of the most common elements in living organisms. It is important for creating both proteins and nucleic acids, like DNA. The air that we breathe is mostly nitrogen gas (N2), but, unfortunately, animals and plants cannot use the nitrogen when it is a gas. In fact, plants often die from a lack of nitrogen even through they are surrounded by plenty of nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas (N2) has two nitrogen atoms connected by a very strong triple bond. Most plants and animals cannot use the nitrogen in nitrogen gas because they cannot break that triple bond. In order for plants to make use of nitrogen, it must be transformed into molecules they can use. This can be accomplished several different ways ( Figure 12.36). • Lightning: When lightening strikes, nitrogen gas is transformed into nitrate (NO3 • Nitrogen fixation: Special nitrogen-fixing bacteria can also transform nitrogen gas into useful forms. These bacteria live in the roots of plants in the pea family. They turn the nitrogen gas into ammonium (NH4 +) (a process called ammonification). In water environments, bacteria in the water can also fix nitrogen gas into ammonium. Ammonium can be used by aquatic plants as a source of nitrogen. −) that plants can use. • Nitrogen also is released to the environment by decaying organisms or decaying wastes. These wastes release nitrogen in the form of ammonium. Ammonium in the soil can be turned into nitrate by a two-step process completed by two different types of bacteria. In the form of nitrate, nitrogen can be used by plants through the process of assimilation. It is then passed along to animals when they eat the plants. 
Sending  Nitrogen back to the  Atmosphere 	  Turning nitrate back into nitrogen gas, the process of denitrification, happens through the work of denitrifying bacteria. These bacteria often live in swamps and lakes. They take in the nitrate and release it back to the atmosphere as nitrogen gas. Just like the carbon cycle, human activities impact the nitrogen cycle. These human activities include the burning of fossil fuels, which release nitrogen oxide gasses into the atmosphere. Releasing nitrogen oxide back into the atmosphere leads to problems like acid rain.

What will happen to this land? Since this land was clearcut, there is little life left behind. However, that does not mean that this land will stay barren forever. First little seedlings will establish themselves, and with time a forest could thrive here once again. 
Succession 	  When you see an older forest, it’s easy to picture that the forest has been there forever. This is not the case. Ecosystems are "dynamic." This means that ecosystems change over time. That forest may lie on land that was once covered by an ocean millions of years ago. Lightning may have sparked a fire in a forest, destroying much of the plant life there. Or the forest may have been cut down at one point for agricultural use, then abandoned and allowed to re-grow over time. During the ice ages, glaciers once covered areas that are tropical rainforests today. Both natural forces and human actions cause ecosystems to change. If there is a big ecosystem change caused by natural forces or human actions, the plants and animals that live there may be destroyed. Or they may be forced to leave. Over time, a new community will develop, and then that community may be replaced by another. You may see several changes in the plant and animal composition of the community over time. Ecological succession is the constant replacement of one community by another. It happens after a big change in the ecosystem. And, of course, succession occurs on brand new land. 
Primary  Succession 	  Primary succession is the type of ecological succession that happens on new lands—lands where life has not yet existed. Primary succession can take place after lava flow cools and hardens into new land, or a glacier recedes exposing new land. Since the land that results from these processes is completely new land, soil must first be produced. How is soil produced? Primary succession always starts with a pioneer species. This is the species that first lives in the habitat. If life is to begin on barren rock, which is typical of new land, the pioneer species would be an organism such as a lichen ( between a fungus and an algae or cyanobacteria. The lichen is able to thrive as both the fungus and the algae or bacteria contribute to the relationship. The fungus is able to absorb minerals and nutrients from the rock, while algae supplies the fungus with sugars through photosynthesis. Since lichens can photosynthesize and do not rely on soil, they can live in environments where other organisms cannot. As a lichen grows, it breaks down the rock, which is the first step of soil formation. Primary succession on a rock often begins with the growth of lichens. What do lichens help create? The pioneer species is soon replaced by other populations. Abiotic factors such as soil quality, water, and climate will determine the species that continue the process of succession. Mosses and grasses will be able to grow in the newly created soil. During early succession, plant species like grasses that grow and reproduce quickly will take over the landscape. Over time, these plants improve the soil and a few shrubs can begin to grow. Slowly, the shrubs are replaced by small trees. Small trees then are succeeded by larger trees. Since trees are more successful at competing for resources than shrubs and grasses, a forest may be the end result of primary succession. 
Secondary  Succession 	  Sometimes ecological succession occurs in areas where life has already existed. These areas already have soil full of nutrients. Secondary succession is the type of succession that happens after something destroys the habitat, such as a flood or other natural disaster. Abandoning a field that was once used for agriculture can also lead to secondary succession ( Figure 12.38). In this case, the pioneer species would be the grasses that first appear. Lichen would not be necessary as there is already nutrient-rich soil. Slowly, the field would return to its natural state. A forest fire can alter a habitat such that secondary succession occurs ( Figure 12.39 and Figure 12.40). Although 
This land was once used for growing 	  crops. Now that the field is abandoned, secondary succession has begun. Pioneer species, such as grasses, appear first, and then shrubs begin to grow. the area will look devastated at first, the seeds of new plants are underground. They are waiting for their chance to grow. Just like primary succession, the burned forest will go through a series of communities, starting with small grasses, then shrubs, and finally bigger trees. 
Climax  Communities 	  A climax community ( Figure 12.41) is the end result of ecological succession. The climax community is a stable balance of all organisms in an ecosystem, and will remain stable unless a disaster strikes. After the disaster, succession will start all over again. Depending on the climate of the area, the climax community will look different. In the tropics, the climax community might be a tropical rainforest. At the other extreme, in northern parts of the world, the climax community might be a coniferous forest. Though climax communities are stable, are they truly the final community of the habitat? Or is it likely that sometime in the future, maybe a long time in the future, the community of populations will change, and another stable, climax community will thrive? 
Summary 	  • Ecological succession is the constant replacement of one community by another. 
The early stages of succession after a 	  forest fire are shown in these pictures. 
Taken four years after the fire, they show 	  the charred remains of the original forest as well as the small grasses and shrubs that are beginning to grow back in the area. 
In 1988, a forest fire destroyed much of 	  Yellowstone National Park. This photo, taken 17 years later, shows that the forest is gradually growing back. Small grasses first grew here and are now being replaced by small trees and shrubs. This is an example of the later stages of secondary succession. • Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before been colonized by plants and animals, while secondary succession occurs in an established area that was disturbed.

What is this haze? This picture shows a thick layer of smog and dust over a very polluted city (Singapore). Smog in the air is a serious health hazard for people living in many big cities around the globe. Smog is one example of air pollution. 
Outdoor  Air  Pollution 	  Air is all around us. Air is essential for life. Sometimes, humans can pollute the air. For example, releasing smoke and dust from factories and cars can cause air pollution. Air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. This pollution affects entire ecosystems around the world. Pollution can also cause many human health problems, and it can also cause death. Air pollution can be found both outdoors and indoors. Outdoor air pollution is made of chemical particles. When smoke or other pollutants enter the air, the particles found in the pollution mix with the air. Air is polluted when it contains many large toxic particles. Outdoor air pollution changes the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Primary pollutants are added directly to the atmosphere. Fires add primary pollutants to the air. Particles released from the fire directly enter the air and cause pollution ( Figure 12.42). Burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal is a major source of primary pollutants ( Secondary pollutants are formed when primary pollutants interact with sunlight, air, or each other. They do not directly cause pollution. However, when they interact with other parts of the air, they do cause pollution. For example, ozone is created when some pollutants interact with sunlight. High levels of ozone in the atmosphere can cause problems for humans. Wildfires, either natural or human-caused, release particles into the air, one of the many causes of air pollution. A major source of air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels from factories, power plants, and motor vehicles. 
Sources of  Outdoor  Air  Pollution 	  Most air pollutants can be traced to the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are burned during many processes, including in power plants to create electricity, in factories to make machinery run, in power stoves and furnaces for heating, and in waste facilities. Perhaps one of the biggest uses of fossil fuels is in transportation. Fossil fuels are used in cars, trains, and planes. Air pollution can also be caused by agriculture, such as cattle ranching and the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Other sources of air pollution include the production of plastics, refrigerants, and aerosols, in nuclear power and defense, from landfills and mining, and from biological warfare. 
Acid  Rain 	  One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure 12.44). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. 
Czech  Republic shows effects caused by 	  acid rain. What do you observe? 
Global  Warming 	  Pollutants also affect the atmosphere through their contribution to global warming. Global warming is an increase in the Earth’s temperature. It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity. The rest of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is there because of deforestation, or cutting down trees ( Figure 12.45). Trees absorb carbon dioxide during cellular respiration, so when trees are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air. This increase in global temperature will cause the sea level to rise. It is also expected to produce an increase in extreme weather events and change the amount of precipitation. Global warming may also cause food shortages and species extinction.

How do you paint safely? If you are painting indoors, there are more important concerns than just getting messy. You should also be concerned about breathing in the fumes from the paints. Making sure to get plenty of fresh air while painting is very important. Paint fumes can have serious health effects. Paint fumes are just one example of indoor air pollution. 
Indoor  Air  Pollution 	  Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn’t get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. Indoor air pollutants include both chemical and biological pollutants. Chemical pollutants include the following: • Radon, a radioactive gas released from the Earth in certain locations. It can become trapped inside buildings and increase your risk of cancer. • Formaldehyde, a toxic gas emitted from building materials, such as carpeting and plywood. • Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are given off by paint and solvents as they dry. They can cause cause long-term health effects. • Secondhand smoke, which comes from breathing the smoke release from tobacco products. Secondhand smoke is also the smoke exhaled by a cigarette smoker. This smoke is extremely dangerous to human health. • Carbon monoxide (CO), a toxic gas released by burning fossil fuels. It is often released indoors by faulty chimneys, gas-powered generators, or burning charcoal; it can be extremely dangerous. • Dry cleaning fluids, such as tetrachloroethylene, which can be released from clothing days after dry cleaning. • The past use of asbestos in factories and in homes. Asbestos is a very dangerous material, and it was used in many buildings ( Figure 12.46). Asbestos can cause cancer and other lung diseases. The use of asbestos is not allowed today. The use of asbestos in industry and domestic environments in the past, as in the asbestos-covered pipes in the oil-refining plant pictured here, has left a potentially very dangerous material in many businesses. Biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors. These are produced from: • Pet dander. • Dust from tiny skin flakes and decomposed hair. • Dust mites. • Mold from walls, ceilings, and other structures. • Air conditioning systems that can incubate certain bacteria and mold. • Pollen, dust, and mold from houseplants, soil, and surrounding gardens. 
Limiting  Exposure 	  Can you avoid indoor air pollution? You can’t go to school outside. But it is possible to reduce your exposure to air pollution. Some tips to decrease your exposure to indoor air pollution include: • Using less toxic chemicals when possible. • Limiting your exposure to pesticides and cleaning fluids by keeping them in a garage or shed. • When using toxic chemicals, allowing fresh air to circulate through open windows and doors. • Having detectors for radon and carbon monoxide in your home. What else could you do to reduce your exposure to air pollution? 
Summary 	  • Sources of indoor air pollution can include radon gas, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compound (VOCs). • Biological sources of air pollution include molds, pollen, and pet dander.

Why is this woman wearing a mask? In many cities around the world, the air quality is so poor that people are often told to stay indoors when possible. When there is poor air quality in a city, some people choose to wear face masks when they have to be outdoors. Lowering exposure to air pollutants with a face mask is especially important for people with existing heart or lung conditions. 
Health  Hazards of  Air  Pollution 	  The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 2.4 million people die each year from causes directly related to air pollution. This includes both outdoor and indoor air pollution. Worldwide, there are more deaths linked to air pollution each year than to car accidents. Research by the WHO also shows that the worst air quality is in countries with high poverty and population rates, such as Egypt, Sudan, Mongolia, and Indonesia. Respiratory system disorders are directly related to air pollution. These disorders have severe effects on human health, some leading to death directly related to air pollution. Air pollution related respiratory disorders include asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Asthma is a respiratory disorder characterized by wheezing, coughing, and a feeling of constriction in the chest. Bronchitis is inflammation of the membrane lining of the bronchial tubes of the lungs. Emphysema is a deadly lung disease characterized by abnormal enlargement of air spaces in the lungs and destruction of the lung tissue. Additional lung and heart diseases are also related to air pollution, as are respiratory allergies. Air pollution can also indirectly cause other health issues and even deaths. Air pollutants can cause an increase in cancer including lung cancer, eye problems, and other conditions. For example, using certain chemicals on farms, such as the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), can cause cancer. Indoors, pollutants such as radon or asbestos can also increase your cancer risk. Lastly, air pollution can lead to heart disease, including heart attack and stroke. 
Air  Pollution in  Cities 	  Certain respiratory conditions can be made worse in people who live closer to or in large cites. Some studies have shown that people in urban areas suffer lower levels of lung function and more chronic bronchitis and emphysema. If you live in a city, you have seen smog. It is a low-hanging, fog-like cloud that seems to never leave the city ( eye irritation and respiratory problems. A layer of smog is typical for Cairo, Egypt. 
Protecting  Yourself from  Air  Pollution 	  After reading about the effects of air pollution, both indoors and outdoors, you may wonder how you can avoid it. As for outdoor air pollution, if you hear in the news that the outdoor air quality is particularly bad, then it might make sense to wear a mask outdoors or to stay indoors. Because you have more control over your indoor air quality than the outdoor air quality, there are some simple steps you can take indoors to make sure the air quality is less polluted. These include: Are there any other ways you can think of to protect yourself from air pollution? 
Summary 	  • Air-pollution can directly cause deaths due to illnesses like asthma and emphysema or indirectly cause deaths by increasing your risk of cancer. • There are steps you can take to decrease your exposure to indoor air pollution, such as having carbon monoxide detectors in your home and keeping your home as clean as possible from pet dander, dust, dust mites, and mold.

Is the ocean a good dumping ground? Unfortunately some people think so. A lot of garbage ends up washing ashore, and some garbage stays floating out in the ocean. Animals can be strangled by floating trash or mistake inedible trash for food. Not only is the pollution of our oceans a problem, but also our precious freshwater resources are often polluted. 
Sources of  Water  Pollution 	  While to many people clean water may seem limitless and everywhere, to many others this is not so. Water pollution is a serious issue facing hundreds of millions of people world-wide, having harmful effects on the lives of those people. Water is not in unlimited supply and cannot just be made fresh when it is wanted. Water is actually a limited resource, and for many people, fresh, unpolluted water is hard to find. A limited resource is one that we use faster than we can remake it. It is a resource that can be used up. Water pollution happens when contaminants enter water bodies. Contaminants are any substances that harm the health of the environment or humans. Most contaminants enter the water because of humans. Surface water (river or lake) can be exposed to and contaminated by acid rain, storm water runoff, pesticide runoff, and industrial waste. This water is cleaned somewhat by exposure to sunlight, aeration, and microorganisms in the water. Groundwater (private wells and some public water supplies) generally takes longer to become contaminated, but the natural cleaning process also may take much longer. Groundwater can be contaminated by disease-producing pathogens, careless disposal of hazardous household chemical-containing products, agricultural chemicals, and leaking underground storage tanks. Water pollution can cause harmful effects to ecology and human health. Shown is the pollution in Jakarta, Indonesia. Natural events, like storms, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes can cause major changes in water quality. But human-caused contaminants have a much greater impact on the quality of the water supply. Water is considered polluted either when it does not support a human use, like clean drinking water, or a use for other animals and plants. The overgrowth of algae, known as an algal bloom, can result from the runoff of fertilizer into bodies of water. This excess of nutrients allows the algae to grow beyond control, bring harm to the rest of the ecosystem. The main sources of water pollution can be grouped into two categories: • Point source pollution results from the contaminants that enter a waterway or water body through a single site. Examples of this include untreated sewage, wastewater from a sewage treatment plant, and leaking underground tanks. • Nonpoint source pollution is contamination that does not come from a single point source. Instead, it happens when there is a buildup of small amounts of contaminants that collect from a large area. Examples of this include fertilizer runoff from many farms flowing into groundwater or streams. 
Summary 	  • Water is a limited resource, but it is often polluted by humans. • Sources of water pollution can be grouped as point source pollution (large amounts entering through a single site) or nonpoint source pollution (small amounts entering from many sites.)

Can water have too many nutrients? Excess nutrients can cause algae to grow like crazy. Too much algae causes the green slime on the water that you see in this picture. These excess nutrients come from fertilizers that were carried by the runoff from farmland. This type of water pollution can have serious consequences for the other forms of life trying to survive here. 
Effects of  Water  Pollution 	  Water pollutants can have an effect on both the ecology of ecosystems and on humans. As a result of water pollution, humans may not be able to use a waterway for recreation and fishing. Drinking water can also be affected if a toxin enters the groundwater. 
Eutrophication 	  In a marine ecosystem, algae are the producers. Through photosynthesis, they provide glucose for the ecosystem. So, can too much algae be a bad thing? Eutrophication is an over-enrichment of chemical nutrients in a body of water. Usually these nutrients are the nitrogen and phosphorous found in fertilizers. Run-off from lawns or farms can wash fertilizers into rivers or coastal waters. Plants are not the only things that grow more quickly with added fertilizers. Algae like the excess nutrients in fertilizers too. When there are high levels of nutrients in the water, algae populations will grow large very quickly. This leads to overgrowths of algae called algal blooms. However, these algae do not live very long. They die and begin to decompose. This process uses oxygen, removing the oxygen from the water. Without oxygen, fish and shellfish cannot live, and this results in the death of these organisms ( Figure 12.49). Certain types of algal blooms can also create toxins. These toxins can enter shellfish. If humans eat these shellfish, then they can get very sick. These toxins cause neurological problems in humans.

Ocean  Acidification 	  Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. 
Aquatic  Debris 	  Aquatic debris is trash that gets into freshand saltwater waterways. It comes from shipping accidents, landfill erosion, or the direct dumping of trash. Debris can be very dangerous to aquatic wildlife. Some animals may swallow plastic bags, mistaking them for food. Other animals can be strangled by floating trash like plastic six-pack rings. Wildlife can easily get tangled in nets ( Figure 12.50). 
Marine trash can harm different types of 	  aquatic life. Pictured here is a marine turtle entangled in a net. How can you keep this from happening? 
Waterborne  Diseases 	  Unsafe water supplies have drastic effects on human health. Waterborne diseases are diseases due to microscopic pathogens in fresh water. These diseases can be caused by protozoa, viruses, bacteria, and intestinal parasites. In many parts of the world there are no water treatment plants. If sewage or animal manure gets into a river, then people downstream will get sick when they drink the water. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal disease is responsible for the deaths of 1.8 million people every year. It was estimated that 88% of the cases of diarrheal disease are caused by unsafe water supplies. 
Summary 	  • High levels of nutrients, called eutrophication, can cause conditions that deprive fish of oxygen. • Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic, which harms corals and shellfish. • Debris can be dangerous to aquatic wildlife.

Do we have an infinite supply of drinkable water? No. In fact, in many parts of the world, finding clean drinkable water is difficult. This can lead to various serious health issues. Hundreds of millions of people world-wide are thought to live in areas where obtaining safe water is difficult. This makes preserving water resources an important global issue. 
Preserving  Water  Sources 	  It might seem like there is plenty of water on Earth, but that’s not really the case. Water is a limited resource. That means that it is used faster than it is replaced. Theoretically, at some point in time, the supply of fresh water could run out. Though this is unlikely, it is possible. But it is a significant issue in parts of the world with large populations. As these populations continue to grow, the supply of water becomes an increasingly important issue. Even though we have lots of water in our oceans, we cannot use that water whenever we want. It takes special equipment, such as a desalination plant, and a lot of energy (and money) to convert salt water into fresh water. Of all the water on Earth, only about 1% can be used for drinking water. Almost all of the rest of the water is either salt water in the ocean or ice in glaciers and ice caps. As a result, there are water shortages many places in the world. Since we have such a limited supply of water, it is important to preserve our water supplies. Therefore, steps have been taken to prevent water pollution. Technologies have also been developed to conserve water and prevent water pollution. Sub-Saharan African countries have the most vulnerable water supplies. Some scientists believe of a potential future crisis in both Asia and Africa from pollution and depletion of natural water resources. Many countries in the Middle East are at an extreme risk of water shortages. Diminished water supplies could increase the risk of both internal conflicts or wars between countries. 
Preventing  Water  Pollution 	  In the U.S., concern over water pollution has resulted in many federal laws. Some of these laws go all the way back to the 1800s! The laws prohibit the disposal of any waste into the nation’s rivers, lakes, streams, and other bodies of water, unless a person first has a permit. Growing concern for controlling water pollutants led to the enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1972. The Clean Water Act set water quality standards. It also limits the pollution that can enter the waterways. Other countries are also actively preventing water pollution and purifying water ( Figure A water purification station in France. 
Contaminants are removed to make clean 	  water. 
Wastewater  Treatment 	  Fresh water is also preserved by purifying wastewater. Wastewater is water that has been used for cleaning, washing, flushing, or manufacturing. It includes the water that goes down your shower drain and that is flushed down your toilet. Instead of dumping wastewater directly into rivers, wastewater can be purified at a water treatment plant ( Figure 12.52). When wastewater is recycled, waterborne diseases caused by pathogens in sewage can be prevented. What are some ways you can save water in your own house?

Can we use up all of our sunlight? No, we have a limitless supply of sunlight. That makes it a renewable resource. Products derived from fossil fuels, like the gasoline we use to drive our cars, are not renewable resources. We will eventually run out of fossil fuels. 
Renewable  Resources and  Alternative  Energy  Sources 	  A resource is renewable if it is remade by natural processes at the same rate that humans use it up. Sunlight and wind are renewable resources because they will not be used up ( Figure 12.53). The rising and falling of ocean tides is another example of a resource in unlimited supply. A sustainable resource is a resource that is used in a way that meets the needs of the present without keeping future generations from meeting their needs. People can sustainably harvest wood, cork, and bamboo. Farmers can also grow crops sustainably by not planting the same crop in their soil year after year. Planting the same crop each year can remove nutrients from the soil. This means that wood, cork, bamboo, and crops can be sustainable resources. 
Alternative  Energy  Sources 	  A nonrenewable resource is one that cannot be replaced as easily as it is consumed. Fossil fuels are an example of nonrenewable resources. They take millions of years to form naturally, and so they cannot be replaced as fast as they are consumed. To take the place of fossil fuel use, alternative energy resources are being developed. These Wind power, a renewable resource, shown here in a modern wind energy farm. The wind is used to turn turbines that generate electricity. alternative energy sources often utilize renewable resources. The following are examples of sustainable alternative energy resources: • Solar power, which uses solar cells to turn sunlight into electricity ( Figure 12.54). The electricity can be used to power anything that uses normal coal-generated electricity. 
These solar panels convert sunlight into 	  electricity. • Wind power, which uses windmills to transform wind energy into electricity. It is used for less than 1% of the world’s energy needs. But wind energy is growing fast. Every year, 30% more wind energy is used to create electricity. • Hydropower ( Figure 12.55), which uses the energy of moving water to turn turbines (similar to windmills) or water wheels, that create electricity. This form of energy produces no waste or pollution. It is a renewable resource. Hydropower plant. • Geothermal power, which uses the natural flow of heat from the Earth’s core to produce steam. This steam is used to turn turbines which create electricity. • Biomass is the mass of biological organisms. It is usually used to describe the amount of organic matter in a trophic level of an ecosystem. Biomass production involves using organic matter ("biomass") from plants to create electricity. Using corn to make ethanol fuel is an example of biomass generated energy. Biomass is generally renewable. • Tides in the ocean can also turn a turbine to create electricity. This energy can then be stored until needed (

Could we all run out of gasoline? Yes, we will use up all our gasoline eventually. Gasoline is derived from oil. Oil deposits were formed over hundreds of millions of years. They cannot be quickly replenished. Oil is an example of a nonrenewable resource. 
Nonrenewable  Resources 	  A nonrenewable resource is a natural resource that is consumed or used up faster than it can be made by nature. Two main types of nonrenewable resources are fossil fuels and nuclear power. Fossil fuels, such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas, formed from plant and animal remains over periods from 50 to 350 million years ago. They took millions of years to form. Humans have been consuming fossil fuels for less than 200 years, yet remaining reserves of oil can supply our needs only until around the year 2055. Natural gas can only supply us until around 2085. Coal will last longer, until around the year 2250. That is why it is so important to develop alternate forms of energy, especially for our cars. Today, electric cars are becoming more and more common. Considering the year 2055 is not that far away, what would happen if we ran out of gasoline? Alternative use of energy, especially in transportation, must become a standard feature of all cars and trucks and planes by the middle of the century. Nuclear power is the use of nuclear energy ( nuclear fission) to create energy inside of a nuclear reactor ( Figure uranium fuel supplies, which will last to about the year 2100 (or longer) at current rates of use. However, new technologies could make some uranium fuel reserves more useful. Population growth, especially in developing countries, should make people think about how fast they are consuming resources. Governments around the world should seriously consider these issues. Developing nations will also Aerial photo of the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station near Kincardine, Ontario. increase demands on natural resources as they build more factories ( Figure 12.58). Improvements in technology, conservation of resources, and controls in population growth could all help to decrease the demand on natural resources. Per capita energy consumption (2003) shows the unequal distribution of wealth, technology, and energy use.

How can you help conserve our natural resources? Reduce, reuse, and recycle. There are steps that you personally can take to conserve our natural resources and reduce waste. The waste that an individual creates is small in proportion to all the waste produced by society. Yet all small contributions, when added up, make a difference. 
Reduce,  Reuse, and  Recycle 	  Why conserve resources? During your lifetime, it is possible that the world may run out of some nonrenewable resources, especially as the population passes 8 then 9 billion people. So it is necessary to try to make these resources last as long as possible. You may have heard people say, "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle." You may know that this is the slogan of the campaign to conserve resources. But what do each one of those words truly mean? 
Reduce 	  What exactly does it mean to reduce? Reducing means decreasing the amount of waste we create. That could also mean cutting down on use of natural resources. In addition, many ways to reduce also result in saving money. Minimizing of waste may be difficult to achieve for individuals and households, but here are some starting points that you can include in your daily routine to reduce the use of resources: • Turn lights off when not using them. • Turn the television off when no one is watching. • Replace burned out bulbs with ones that are more energy-efficient ( Figure 12.59). • Reduce water use by turning off faucets when not using water. • Use low-flow shower heads, which save on water and use less energy. • Use low-flush and composting toilets. • Put kitchen and garden waste into a compost pile. • In the summer, change filters on your air conditioner and use as little air conditioning as possible. The use of air conditioning uses a lot of energy. • In winter, make sure your furnace is working properly and make sure there is enough insulation on windows and doors. • Mend broken or worn items instead of buying new ones. • When you go shopping for items, buy quantities you know you will use without waste. • Walk or bicycle instead of using an automobile, in order to save on fuel usage and costs, and to cut down on pollution. • When buying a new vehicle, check into hybrid, semi-hybrid, or electric models to cut down on gas usage and air pollution. 
These fluorescent light bulbs are much 	  more energy efficient than standard light bulbs. 
Reuse 	  Let’s now look at what we can reuse. Reusing includes using the same item again for the same function and also using an item again for a new function. Reuse can have both economic and environmental benefits. New packaging regulations are helping society to move towards these goals. Water is a resource that can be reused for numerous purposes. You may not drink used water, but it is quite useful for other purposes. Some ways of reusing resources include: • Use reusable bags when shopping. • Use gray water. Water that has been used for laundry, for example, can be used to water the garden or flush toilets. • At the town level, purified sewage water can be used for fountains, watering public parks or golf courses, fire fighting, and irrigating crops. • Rain can be caught in rain barrels and used to water your garden. What are some other ways to reuse resources? 
Recycle 	  Now we move on to recycle. Sometimes it may be difficult to understand the differences between reusing and recycling. Recycling involves processing used materials in order to make them suitable for other uses. That usually means taking a used item, breaking it down, and reusing the pieces. Even though recycling requires extra energy, it does often make use of items which are broken, worn out, or cannot be reused. The things that are commonly recycled include: • Batteries. • Biodegradable waste. • Electronics. • Iron and steel. • Aluminum ( Figure 12.60). • Glass. • Paper. • Plastic. • Textiles, such as clothing. • Timber. • Tires. These aluminum cans are packed together in a recycling plant to be reused. Each type of recyclable requires a different recycling technique. Here are some things you can do to recycle in your home, school, or community: • If you have recycling in your community, make sure you separate aluminum, plastics, glass, and paper products. • See if your school recycles. If not, you and some friends could start a recycling club, or organize efforts to better recycling goals. Laws can also be created to make sure people and companies reduce, reuse, and recycle. Individuals can vote for leaders who stand for sustainable ecological practices. They can also tell their leaders to make wise use of natural resources. You can also influence companies. If you and your family only buy from companies and restaurants that support recycling or eco-friendly packaging, then other companies will also change to be more environmentally friendly.

What’s happening to this land? This picture, taken in southern Mexico, shows land being cleared for agriculture. The forest has been cut down and burned to make room for a a farm. In the process, homes to many plants and animals were destroyed. This is an example of habitat destruction. 
Habitat  Destruction 	  From a human point of view, a habitat is where you live, go to school, and go to have fun. Your habitat can be altered, and you can easily adapt. Most people live in a few different places and go to a number of different schools throughout their life. But a plant or animal may not be able to adapt to a changed habitat. A habitat is the natural home or environment of an organism. Humans often destroy the habitats of other organisms. Habitat destruction can cause the extinction of species. Extinction is the complete disappearance of a species. Once a species is extinct, it can never recover. Some ways humans cause habitat destruction are by clearing land and by introducing non-native species of plants and animals. 
Land  Loss 	  Clearing land for agriculture and development is a major cause of habitat destruction. Within the past 100 years, the amount of total land used for agriculture has almost doubled. Land used for grazing cattle has more than doubled. Agriculture alone has cost the United States half of its wetlands ( Figure 12.61) and almost all of its tallgrass prairies. Native prairie ecosystems, with their thick fertile soils, deep-rooted grasses, diversity of colorful flowers, burrowing prairie dogs, and herds of bison and other animals, have virtually disappeared ( Figure 12.63). 
May,  New  Jersey, filter water and protect 	  coastal lands from storms and floods. The Flint Hills contain some of the largest remnants of tallgrass prairie habitat remaining in North America. 
Slash-and- Burn  Agriculture 	  Other habitats that are being rapidly destroyed are forests, especially tropical rainforests. The largest cause of deforestation today is slash-and-burn agriculture (shown in the opening image). This means that when people want to turn a forest into a farm, they cut down all of the trees and then burn the remainder of the forest. This technique is used by over 200 million people in tropical forests throughout the world. As a consequence of slash-and-burn agriculture, nutrients are quickly lost from the soil. This often results in people abandoning the land within a few years. Then the top soil erodes and desertification can follow. Desertification 
Herds of bison also made up part of the 	  tallgrass prairie community. turns forest into a desert, where it is difficult for plants to grow. Half of the Earth’s mature tropical forests are gone. At current rates of deforestation, all tropical forests will be gone by the year 2090. 
Non-native  Species 	  One of the main causes of extinction is introduction of exotic species into an environment. These exotic and new species can also be called invasive species or non-native species. These non-native species, being new to an area, may not have natural predators in the new habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow. Invasive species out-compete the native species for resources. Sometimes invasive species are so successful at living in a certain habitat that the native species go extinct ( Figure 12.64). Recently, cargo ships have transported zebra mussels, spiny waterfleas, and ruffe (a freshwater fish) into the Great Lakes ( Figure 12.65). These invasive species are better at hunting for food. They have caused some of the native species to go extinct. Invasive species can disrupt food chains, carry disease, prey on native species directly, and out-compete native species for limited resources, like food. All of these effects can lead to extinction of the native species. 
Other  Causes 	  Other causes of habitat destruction include poor fire management, overfishing, mining ( Figure 12.66), pollution, and storm damage. All of these can cause irreversible changes to a habitat and ecosystem. 
Examples of  Habitat  Destruction 	  A habitat that is quickly being destroyed is the wetland. By the 1980s, over 80% of all wetlands in parts of the U.S. were destroyed. In Europe, many wetland species have gone extinct. For example, many bogs in Scotland have been lost because of human development. Another example of species loss due to habitat destruction happened on Madagascar’s central highland plateau. From 1970 to 2000, slash-and-burn agriculture destroyed about 10% of the country’s total native plants. The area turned into a wasteland. Soil from erosion entered the waterways.

Why are these polar bears threatened? These polar bears are threatened because of global warming. They depend on the sea ice for their hunting grounds, and this ice is melting away. Plus bears have to make a longer and more hazardous journey to get to the remaining ice. 
Other  Causes of  Extinction 	  In addition to habitat destruction, other human-caused problems are also threatening many species. These include issues associated with climate change, pollution, and over-population. 
Global  Warming 	  Another major cause of extinction is global warming, which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth’s average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. 
Pollution 	  Pollution adds chemicals, noise, heat, or even light to an environment. This can have many different harmful effects on all kinds of organisms. For example, the pesticide DDT nearly eliminated the peregrine falcon in some parts of the world. This pesticide caused falcons to lay eggs with thinner shells. As a result, fewer falcon eggs survived to hatching. Populations of peregrine falcons declined rapidly. DDT was then banned in the U.S. and peregrine falcon populations have recovered. Water pollution threatens vital freshwater and marine resources throughout the world ( Figure 12.67). Specifically, industrial and agricultural chemicals, waste, and acid rain threaten water. As water is essential for all ecosystems, water pollution can result in the extinction of species.

Francisco- Oakland  Bay  Bridge in dense 	  fog in November, 2007. Finally, soil contamination can also result in extinction. Soil contamination can come from toxic industrial and municipal wastes ( Figure 12.68), salts from irrigation, and pesticides from agriculture. These all degrade the soil as well. As soil is the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems, this can result in extinction. 
Human  Overpopulation 	  Human populations are on the rise. The human population passed the 7 billion mark in October of 2011, and will pass 8 and 9 billion probably before the middle of the century. All these people will need resources such as places to live, food to eat, and water to drink, and they will use energy and create waste. Essentially, human population growth can effect all other causes of extinction. For example, more people on the Earth means more people contributing to global warming and pollution. More people also means more clearing of land for agriculture and development. Recall that development by humans often causes habitats to be destroyed. This destruction can force species to go extinct, or move somewhere else.

Why is preserving the rainforest important? Preserving the rainforest is important for many reasons. But one reason conservation efforts have focused here is that the rainforest is home to more species of insects, amphibians, and birds than anywhere else on the planet. This wide diversity of life is called biodiversity. 
Importance of  Biodiversity 	  Biodiversity is a measurement of the amount of variation of the species in a given area. More specifically, biodiversity can be defined as the variety of life and its processes, including the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the communities and ecosystems in which they occur. A place such as a coral reef has many different species of plants and animals. That means the coral reef is a ecosystem with high biodiversity ( Figure 12.69). Because of its biodiversity, the rainforest shown above is an ecosystem with extreme importance. Why is biodiversity so important? In addition to maintaining the health and stability of the ecosystem, the diversity of life provides us with many benefits. Extinction is a threat to biodiversity. Does it matter if we are losing thousands of species each year? The answer is yes. It matters even if we consider not only the direct benefits to humans, but also the benefits to the ecosystems. The health and survival of ecosystems is related to that ecosystem’s biodiversity. 
Coral reefs are one of the biomes with the 	  highest biodiversity on Earth. 
Economic  Importance 	  Economically, there are many direct benefits of biodiversity. As many as 40,000 species of fungi, plants, and animals provide us with many varied types of clothing, shelter, medicines and other products. These include poisons, timber, fibers, fragrances, papers, silks, dyes, adhesives, rubber, resins, skins, furs, and more. According to one survey, 57% of the most important prescription drugs come from nature. Specifically, they come from bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals ( Figure 12.70). But only a small amount of species with the ability to give us medicines have been explored. The loss of any species may mean the loss of new medicines, which will have a direct effect on human health. 
Aspirin originally came from the bark of 	  the white willow tree, pictured here. 
Biodiversity and  Technology 	  Nature has inspired many technologies in use today. Bionics, also known as biomimetics or biomimicry, uses organisms to inspire technology or engineering projects. By studying animals and their traits, we are able to gain valuable information that we can put to use to help us. For example, rattlesnake heat-sensing pits helped inspire the development of infrared sensors. Zimbabwe’s Eastgate Centre ( Figure 12.71) was inspired by the air-conditioning efficiency of a termite mound ( Figure 12.72). the Eastgate Centre (brown 
Design of 	  building), in Zimbabwe, which requires just 10% of the energy needed for a conventional building of the same size, was inspired by a biological design. 
Ecological  Importance 	  Biodiversity also has many benefits to ecosystems. High biodiversity makes ecosystems more stable. What can happen to an ecosystem if just one species goes extinct? What if that one species was a producer or decomposer? Would the loss of a producer have an effect on all the organisms that relied on that producer? If a decomposer vanishes, are there other decomposers to fill the void? Maybe the resulting species will adapt. Other species may fill in the niche left by the extinct species. But the extinction of one species could have a "domino" effect, resulting in the extinction of other species. This could greatly effect the stability of the whole ecosystem. The air-conditioning efficiency of this termite mound was the inspiration for the Eastgate Centre. One important role of biodiversity is that it helps keep the nutrients, such as nitrogen, in the soil. For example, a diversity of organisms in the soil allows nitrogen fixation and nutrient recycling to happen. Biodiversity also allows plants to be pollinated by different types of insects. And of course, different species of fungi are necessary to recycle wastes from dead plants and animals. These are just a few of the many examples of how biodiversity is important for ecosystems.

Summary 	  Ecology is the study of ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues. areas that contain life .
