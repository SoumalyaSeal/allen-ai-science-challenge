Guidance 	  Every answer to a physics problem must include units. Even if a problem explicitly asks for a speed in meters per second (m/s), the answer is 5 m/s, not 5. If a unit is named after a person, it is capitalized. So you write 10 Newtons, or 10 N, but 10 meters, or 10 m. Metric units use a base numbering system of 10. Thus a centimeter is ten times larger than a millimeter. A decimeter is 10 times larger than a centimeter and a meter is 10 times larger than a decimeter. Thus a meter is 100 times larger than a centimeter and 1000 times larger than a millimeter. Going the other way, one can say that there are 100 cm contained in a meter. 
Question:  Convert 2500 m/s into km/s 	  Solution: A km (kilometer) is 1000 times bigger than a meter. Thus, one simply divides by 1000 and arrives at 2.5 km/s 
Example 2 	  Question: The lengths of the sides of a cube are doubling each second. At what rate is the volume increasing? Solution: The cube side length, x, is doubling every second. Therefore after 1 second it becomes 2x. The volume of the first cube of side x is xxx = x3. The volume of the second cube of side 2x is 2x2x2x = 8x3. The ratio of the second volume to the first volume is 8x3/x3 = 8. Thus the volume is increasing by a factor of 8 every second. 
Answers 	  Convert units from metric to English system and vice versa using dimensional analysis. Students will learn how to convert units from metric to English system and vice versa using dimensional analysis. 
Guidance 	  The key to converting units is to multiply by a clever factor of one. You can always multiply by 1, because it does not change the number. Since 1 in. is equal to 2.54 cm, then 1 = 2.541 incm = 2.541 incm. Thus, one can multiply by this form of 1 in order to cancel units (see video below). Write out every step and show all your units cancelling as you go. When converting speeds from metric to American units, remember the following rule of thumb: a speed measured in mi/hr is about double the value measured in m/s (i.e., 10m/s is equal to about 20 MPH). Remember that the speed itself hasnt changed, just our representation of the speed in a certain set of units. When youre not sure how to approach a problem, you can often get insight by considering how to obtain the units of the desired result by combining the units of the given variables. For instance, if you are given a distance (in meters) and a time (in hours), the only way to obtain units of speed (meters/hour) is to divide the distance by the time. This is a simple example of a method called dimensional analysis, which can be used to find equations that govern various physical situations without any knowledge of the phenomena themselves. 
Example 1 	  Question: 20 m/s = ? mi/hr Solution: .0125 mi/s (60 s/min) = .75 mi/min .75 mi/min (60 min/hr) = 45 mi/hr

The  Big  Idea 	  One dimensional motion describes objects moving in straight lines. Speed is a scalar measure of how quickly an object is moving along this line. Velocity is speed with a direction, making it a vector. If an objects velocity changes with time, the object is said to be accelerating. When restricted to one dimension, there are only two possible directions for the velocity and acceleration vectors to point in. As well see in the next chapters, understanding an objects acceleration is the key to understanding its motion. Explain the meaning of an objects position and the difference between distance and displacement. Create and understand basic position vs. time graphs. Students will learn the meaning of an objects position, the difference between distance and displacement and some basic graphing of position vs. time.

Vectors 	  ?x = xf ?xi	Displacement When beginning a one dimensional problem, define a positive direction. The other direction is then taken to be negative. Traditionally, "positive" is taken to mean "to the right"; however, any definition of direction used consistently throughout the problem will yield the right answer. 
Guidance 	  Position is the location of the object (whether its a person, a ball or a particle) at a given moment in time. Displacement is the difference in the objects position from one time to another. Distance is the total amount the object has traveled in a certain period of time. Displacement is a vector quantity (direction matters), where as distance is a scalor (only the amount matters). Distance and displacement are the same in the case where the object travels in a straight line and always moving in the same direction. 
Example 1 	  Problem: An indecisive car goes 120 m North, then 30 m south then 60m North. What is the cars distance and displacement? Solution: Distance is the total amount traveled. Thus distance = 120 + 30 + 60 m = 210 m Displacement is the amount displaced from the starting position. Thus displacement = 120 30 + 60 m = 150 m.

Answers 	  Explain the meaning of acceleration and how it differs from velocity. Calculate average acceleration. Students will learn the meaning of acceleration, how it is different than velocity and how to calculate average acceleration. 
Key  Equations 	  v = velocity (m/s) vi = initial velocity vf = final velocity ?v = change in velocity = vf ?vi vavg = ??xt a = acceleration (m/s2) aavg = ??vt 
Guidance 	  Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. So in other words, acceleration tells you how quickly the velocity is increasing or decreasing. An acceleration of 5 m/s2 indicates that the velocity is increasing by 5m/s in the positive direction every second. Gravity near the Earth pulls an object downwards toward the surface of the Earth with an acceleration of 9.8 m/s2(? 10 m/s2). In the absence of air resistance, all objects will fall with the same acceleration. The letter g is used as the symbol for the acceleration of gravity. When talking about an objects acceleration, whether it is due to gravity or not, the acceleration of gravity is sometimes used as a unit of measurement where 1g = 9.8m/s2. So an object accelerating at 2gs is accelerating at 2?9.8m/s2 or 19.6m/s2 Deceleration is the term used when an objects speed (i.e. magnitude of its velocity) is decreasing due to acceleration in the opposite direction of its velocity. 
Example 1 	  A Top Fuel dragster can accelerate from 0 to 100 mph (160 km/hr) in 0.8 seconds. What is the average acceleration in m/s2?

Answers 	  Graph motion vs. time and relate the slope to the instantaneous velocity or acceleration for position or velocity graphs, respectively. Use the area of a velocity vs. time graph in order to calculate the displacement. Students will learn how to graph motion vs time. Specifically students will learn how to take the slope of a graph and relate that to the instantaneous velocity or acceleration for position or velocity graphs, respectively. Finally students will learn how to take the area of a velocity vs time graph in order to calculate the displacement. 
Key  Equations 	  For a graph of position vs. time. The slope is the rise over the run, where the rise is the displacement and the run is the time. thus, 
Slope = vavg = ??xt 	  Note: Slope of the tangent line for a particular point in time = the instantaneous velocity For a graph of velocity vs. time. The slope is the rise over the run, where the rise is the change in velocity and the run is the time. thus, 
Slope = aavg = ??vt 	  Note: Slope of the tangent line for a particular point in time = the instantaneous acceleration 
Guidance 	  One must first read a graph correctly. For example on a position vs. time graph (thus the position is graphed on the y-axis and the time on the x-axis) for a given a data point, go straight down from it to get the time and straight across to get the position. If there is constant acceleration the graph x vs. t produces a parabola. The slope of the x vs. t graph equals the instantaneous velocity. The slope of a v vs. t graph equals the acceleration. The slope of the graph v vs. t can be used to find acceleration; the area of the graph v vs. t can be used to find displacement. Welcome to calculus!

The  Big  Three 	  x(t) = x0 +v0t +at2 v(t) = v0 +at vf 2 = v02 +2a?x 
Guidance 	  When beginning a one dimensional problem, define a positive direction. The other direction is then taken to be negative. Traditionally, "positive" is taken to mean "up" for vertical problems and "to the right" for horizontal problems; however, any definition of direction used consistency throughout the problem will yield the right answer. Gravity near the Earth pulls an object toward the surface of the Earth with an acceleration of 9.8 m/s2(? 10 m/s2). In the absence of air resistance, all objects will fall with the same acceleration. Air resistance can cause low-mass, large area objects to accelerate more slowly. The Big Three equations define the graphs of position and velocity as a function of time. When there is no acceleration (constant velocity), position increases linearly with time  distance equals rate times time. Under constant acceleration, velocity increases linearly with time but distance does so at a quadratic rate. The slopes of the position and velocity graphs will give instantaneous velocity and acceleration, respectively.

Summary 	  In these lessons students will learn the fundamentals of motion in one dimension, graphing position, velocity and acceleration vs time and using the kinematic equations to solve problems. 
The  Big  Idea 	  In this chapter, we explore the motion of projectiles under the influence of gravity  fired cannonballs, thrown basketballs, and other objects that have no way of propelling themselves and do not experience significant air resistance. We know that vectors can be separated into components (see first lesson); if they are separated into perpendicular components the motion along each component can be treated independently. This is the insight that allows us to solve two dimensional projectile motion problems: we break any initial velocity vector into a component parallel to the ground and a component perpendicular to it. The force of gravity  which will be explained in more detail later  accelerates any object near the surface of the earth toward its center at a rate of g = 9.8m/s2. This acceleration is in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the earth, conventionally labeled y. Since in projectile motion under the sole influence of gravity any acceleration the object experiences is in the y direction, its horizontal, or x, velocity remains constant throughout its flight (at least in the absence of air resistance, which we ignore for the time being). To solve two dimensional motion problems, we apply the kinematics equations of one-dimensional motion to each of the two directions. In the y direction, we can use the uniform acceleration equations to solve for time in flight. Using this time, we can find how far the object traveled in the x direction also. Solve two dimensional problems by breaking all vectors into their x and y components. In order to solve two dimensional problems it is necessary to break all vectors into their x and y components. Different dimensions do not talk to each other. Thus one must use the equations of motion once for the x-direction and once for the y-direction. For example, when working with the x-direction, one only includes the x-component values of the vectors in the calculations. Note that if an object is launched horizontally, then the full value is in the x-direction and there is no component in the y-direction. 
Vectors 	  The first new concept introduced here is that of a vector: a scalar magnitude with a direction. In a sense, we are almost as good at natural vector manipulation as we are at adding numbers. Consider, for instance, throwing a ball to a friend standing some distance away. To perform an accurate throw, one has to figure out both where to throw and how hard. We can represent this concept graphically with an arrow: it has an obvious direction, and its length can represent the distance the ball will travel in a given time. Such a vector (an arrow between the original and final location of an object) is called a displacement: 
Vector  Components 	  From the above examples, it should be clear that two vectors add to make another vector. Sometimes, the opposite operation is useful: we often want to represent a vector as the sum of two other vectors. This is called breaking a vector into its components. When vectors point along the same line, they essentially add as scalars. If we break vectors into components along the same lines, we can add them by adding their components. The lines we pick to break our vectors into components along are often called a basis. Any basis will work in the way described above, but we usually break vectors into perpendicular components, since it will frequently allow us to use the Pythagorean theorem in time-saving ways. Specifically, we usually use the x and y axes as our basis, and therefore break vectors into what we call their x and y components: A final reason for breaking vectors into perpendicular components is that they are in a sense independent: adding vectors along a component perpendicular to an original component one will never change the original component, just like changing the y-coordinate of a point can never change its x-coordinate.

The river is 9 m wide. Answer: First solve for the time it takes you to reach the other side. Lets let north be the y-direction and the direction across the river be the x-direction. ?x = vxt 9m = 1.5m/st thus, t = 6s Now, use the time you are in the water to find how far the river has carried you north. ?y = vyt ?y = 2m/s6s ?y = 12m

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Explain the parabolic motion of a thrown object. The aim here is to understand and explain the parabolic motion of a thrown object, known as projectile motion. Motion in one direction is unrelated to motion in other perpendicular directions. Once the object has been thrown, the only acceleration is in the y (up/down) direction due to gravity. The x (right/left) direction velocity remains unchanged.

Summary 	  Breaking vectors into components, relative velocity and projectile motion are all covered in this chapter. 
The  Big  Idea 	  Applied forces may cause objects to accelerate. All forces come in pairs because they arise in the interaction of two objects you cant push without being pushed back! The more force applied, the greater the acceleration that is produced. Objects with high masses are difficult to accelerate without a large force. In the absence of applied forces, objects move in a straight line at a constant speed (or remain at rest). In formal language: 
Newtons  First  Law 	  Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right (straight) line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it. 
Newtons  Second  Law 	  The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right (straight) line in which that force is impressed. 
Newtons  Third  Law 	  To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. (Taken from the Principia in modern English, Isaac Newton, University of California Press, 1934). Understanding motion comes in two stages. The first stage youve already seen: you can figure out where something will go, and how fast it will get there, if you know its acceleration. The second stage is much more interesting: where did the acceleration come from? How can you predict the amount of acceleration? Mastering both stages is the key to understanding motion. Describe Newtons first law. The First Law is about inertia; objects at rest stay at rest unless acted upon and objects in motion continue that motion in a straight line unless acted upon. Prior to Newton and Galileo, the prevailing view on motion was still Aristotles. According to his theory the natural state of things is at rest; force is required to keep something moving at a constant rate. This made sense to people throughout history because on earth, friction and air resistance slow moving objects. When there is no air resistance (or other sources of friction), a situation approximated in space, Newtons first law is much more evident. The amount of inertia an object has is simply related to the mass of the object. Mass and Weight are two different things. Mass (typically in units of kg or grams) is basically a measure of what comprises an object. Weight is the measure of how much the force of gravity is pulling on you. In fact, instead of saying I weigh 80 lb., one could say that the force of gravity is pulling on me with a force of 80 lb. The metric unit for weight (and force) is the Newton. 
Fg = mg 	  ; The force of gravity (i.e. your weight) is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration of gravity for that planet. 
Example 1 	  Question: What is the weight of a 90 kg person on Earth? What about the moon? Answers: On Earth, 
Fg = mg = (90 kg)(9.8 m/s2) = 882  	  On moon, 
Simulation 	  Try the following simulation to apply these principles. URL 
Answers 	  Describe Newtons Second Law and explain the relationship between acceleration, applied force, and mass. Determine the net force when multiple forces act on an object. The acceleration experienced by an object will be proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to its mass. If there are multiple forces, they can be added as vectors and it is the net force that matters. 
Key  Equations 	  Newtons Second Law describes his famous equation for the motion of an object The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right (straight) line in which that force is impressed. ~F = ?(m~v) = m?~v = m~a ?t	?t [1] The "motion" Newton mentions in the Second Law is, in his language, the product of the mass and velocity of an object  we call this quantity momentum  so the Second Law is actually the famous equation : m~a	Net force is the vector sum of all the forces ?

Students will learn that Newtons 3rd law holds that for every force there is an equal but opposite reaction force. Important to note that the force and reaction force act on different objects. 
Guidance 	  Newtons 3rd Law states for every force there is an equal but opposite reaction force. To distinguish a third law pair from merely oppositely directed pairs is difficult, but very important. Third law pairs must obey three rules: (1) Third law force pairs must be of the same type of force. (2) Third law force pairs are exerted on two different objects. (3) Third law force pairs are equal in magnitude and oppositely directed. Example: A block sits on a table. The Earths gravity on the block and the force of the table on the block are equal and opposite. But these are not third law pairs, because they are both on the same object and the forces are of different types. The proper third law pairs are: (1) earths gravity on block/blocks gravity on earth and (2) table pushes on block/ block pushes on table. 
Example 1 	  Question: Tom and Mary are standing on identical skateboards. Tom and Mary push off of each other and travel in opposite directions. a) If Tom (M) and Mary (m) have identical masses, who travels farther? b) If Tom has a bigger mass than Mary, who goes farther? c) If Tom and Mary have identical masses and Tom pushes twice as hard as Mary, who goes farther? 
Solution 	  a) Neither. Both Tom and Mary will travel the same distance. The forced applied to each person is the same(Newtons Third Law). So 
Ma =ma 	  which cancels to a = a Therefore both people will travel the same distance because the acceleration controls how far someone will travel and Tom and Mary have equal acceleration. b) Mary will go farther. Again, the same force is applied to both Mary and Tom so 
Ma = ma 	  Since Tom has the larger mass, his acceleration must be smaller (acceleration and mass are inversely proportional). Finally, because Marys acceleration is greater, she will travel farther. c) Neither. Newtons Third Law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore if Tompushes twice as hard as Mary, Mary will essentially be pushing back with the same strength. They will therefore travel the same distance.

Key  Equations 	  ( fs ? s|FN|	Opposes potential motion of surfaces in contact Static and Kinetic Friction fk = k|FN|	Opposes motion of surfaces in contact 
Guidance 	  The force of friction can actually be described in terms of the coefficient of friction, . It is determined experimentally and varies depending upon the two surfaces in contact. Static friction (s) acts between two surfaces that are in contact but not in motion with respect to each other. This force prevents objects from sliding. It always opposes potential motion, and it rises in magnitude to a maximum value given by the formula below.2 Kinetic friction (k) acts between two surfaces that are in contact and in motion with respect to each other. This force reduces the acceleration and it always opposes the direction of motion.2 
Example 1 	  Calculate the force necessary to slide a 4.7-kg chair across a room at a constant speed if the coefficient of kinetic friction between the chair and the floor is 0.68. 
Question:  F =?[ N] 	  Given: m = 4.7 kg k = 0.68 g = 10.0 m/s2 
Equations: ? F = ma 	  ?Fy = N ?mg = 0,so N = mg ?Fx = max Fpull ? fk = 0 (because the chair is moving at constant speed, so a = 0) 
Fpull = k 	  Plug n Chug: The force necessary to move the chair at a constant speed is equal to the frictional force between the chair and the floor. However in order to calculate the frictional force you must first determine the normal force which is (in this case) equal to the weight (i.e. Fg) of the chair.

Answers 	  List and describe types of common forces. The various types of common forces are discussed and analyzed. Key Equations mg	Gravity ??FN	Normal force: acts perpendicular to surfaces 
Common  Forces 	  ??FT	Force of tension in strings and wires x	Force of spring stretched a distance ?x from equilibrium 
Normal  Force 	  Often, objects experience a force that pushes them into another object, but once the objects are in contact they do not any move closer together. For instance, when you stand on the surface of the earth you are obviously not accelerating toward its center. According to Newtons Laws, there must be a force opposing the earths gravity acting on you, so that the net force on you is zero. The same also applies for your gravity acting on the earth. We call such a force the Normal Force. The normal force acts between any two surfaces in contact, balancing what ever force is pushing the objects together. It is actually electromagnetic in nature (like other contact forces), and arises due to the repulsion of atoms in the two objects. Here is an illustration of the Normal force on a block sitting on earth: 
Tension 	  Another force that often opposes gravity is known as tension. This force is provided by wires and strings when they hold objects above the earth. Like the Normal Force, it is electromagnetic in nature and arises due to the intermolecular bonds in the wire or string: If the object is in equilibrium, tension must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to gravity. This force transfers the gravity acting on the object to whatever the wire or string is attached to; in the end it is usually a Normal Force  between the earth and whatever the wire is attached to  that ends up balancing out the force of gravity on the object. 
Friction 	  Friction is a force that opposes motion. Any two objects in contact have what is called a mutual coefficient of friction. To find the force of friction between them, we multiply the normal force by this coefficient. Like the forces above, it arises due to electromagnetic interactions of atoms in two objects. There are actually two coefficients of friction: static and kinetic. Static friction will oppose initial motion of two objects relative to each other. Once the objects are moving, however, kinetic friction will oppose their continuing motion. Kinetic friction is lower than static friction, so it is easier to keep an object in motion than to set it in motion. fs	[5] Static friction opposes potential motion of surfaces in contact fk = k|F~N|	[6] Kinetic frictions opposes motion of surfaces in contact There are some things about friction that are not very intuitive: The magnitude of the friction force does not depend on the surface areas in contact. The magnitude of kinetic friction does not depend on the relative velocity or acceleration of the two objects. Friction always points in the direction opposing motion. If the net force (not counting friction) on an object is lower than the maximum possible value of static friction, friction will be equal to the net force in magnitude and opposite in direction. 
Spring  Force 	  Any spring has some equilibrium length, and if stretched in either direction it will push or pull with a force equal to: 
Example 1 	  Question: A woman of mass 70.0 kg weighs herself in an elevator. a) If she wants to weigh less, should she weigh herself when accelerating upward or downward? b) When the elevator is not accelerating, what does the scale read (i.e., what is the normal force that the scale exertson the woman)? c) When the elevator is accelerating upward at 2.00 m/s2, what does the scale read? Answer a) If she wants to weigh less, she has to decrease her force (her weight is the force) on the scale. We will use the equation 
F = ma 	  to determine in which situation she exerts less force on the scale. If the elevator is accelerating upward then the acceleration would be greater. She would be pushed toward the floor of the elevator making her weight increase. Therefore, she should weigh herself when the elevator is going down. b) When the elevator is not accelerating, the scale would read 70.0kg. c) If the elevator was accelerating upward at a speed of 2.00m/s2, then the scale would read 
F = ma = 70kg(9.8m/s2 +2m/s2) = 826 	  which is 82.6kg. 
Example 2 	  Question: A spring with a spring constant of k = 400N/m has an uncompressed length of .23m and a fully compressed length of .15m. What is the force required to fully compress the spring? Solution: We will use the equation 
F = kx 	  to solve this. We simply have to plug in the known value for the spring and the distance to solve for the force.

Problem  Solving for  Newtons  Laws,  Step- By- Step 	  a. If youre looking for the motion of a rolling cart, the cart is the object of interest. b. If the object of interest is not moving, thats OK, dont panic yet. c. Draw a sketch! This may help you sort out which object is which in your problem. a. If the object has mass and is near the Earth, the easiest (and therefore, first) force to write down is the force of gravity, pointing downward, with value mg. b. If the object is in contact with a flat surface, it means there is a normal force acting on the object. This normal force points away from and is perpendicular to the surface. c. There may be more than one normal force acting on an object. For instance, if you have a bologna sandwich, remember that the slice of bologna feels normal forces from both the slices of bread! d. If a rope, wire, or cord is pulling on the object in question, youve found yourself a tension force. The direction of this force is in the same direction that the rope is pulling. e. Dont worry about any forces acting on other objects. For instance, if you have a bologna sandwich as your object of interest, and youre thinking about the forces acting on the slice of bologna, dont worry about the force of gravity acting on either piece of bread. f. Remember that Newtons 3rd Law, calling for equal and opposite forces, does not apply to a single object. None of your forces should be equal and opposite on the same object in the sense of Newtons 3rd Law. Third law pairs act on two different objects. g. Recall that scales (like a bathroom scale you weigh yourself on) read out the normal force acting on you, not your weight. If you are at rest on the scale, the normal force equals your weight. If you are accelerating up or down, the normal force had better be higher or lower than your weight, or you wont have an unbalanced force to accelerate you. h. Never include m a as a force acting on an object. m a is the result of the net force Fnet which is found by summing all the forces acting on your object of interest. a. A good rule to generally follow is that you want one axis (usually the x-axis) to be parallel to the surface your object of interest is sitting on. b. If your object is on a ramp, tilt your axes so that the x-axis is parallel to the incline and the y-axis is perpendicular. In this case, this will force you to break the force of gravity on the object into its components. But by tilting your axes, you will generally have to break up fewer vectors, making the whole problem simpler. a. If a force is upward, make it in the y?direction and give it a positive sign. If it is downward, make it in the y?direction and give it a negative sign. b. Same thing applies for right vs. left in the x?direction. Make rightward forces positive. c. If forces are at an angle, draw them at an angle. A great example is that when a dog on a leash runs ahead, pulling you along, its pulling both forward and down on your hand. d. Draw the free body diagram (FBD). e. Remember that the FBD is supposed to be helping you with your problem. For instance, if you forget a force, itll be really obvious on your FBD. a. Use right triangle trigonometry b. Remember that these components arent new forces, but are just what makes up the forces youve already identified. c. Consider making a second FBD to do this component work, so that your first FBD doesnt get too messy. a. Remember that all the rightward forces add with a plus (+) sign, and that all the leftward forces add with a minus (?) sign. b. Dont forget about the x?components of any forces that are at an angle! c. When youve added them all up, call this "the sum of all x forces" or "the net force in the x?direction." a. Remember that all the upward forces add with a (+) sign, all the downward forces add with a (?) sign. b. Dont forget about the y?components of any forces that are at an angle! c. When youve added them all up, call this "the sum of all y forces" or "net force in the y?direction." a. The sum of all x?forces, divided by the mass, is the objects acceleration in the x?direction. b. The sum of all y?forces, divided by the mass, is the objects acceleration in the y?direction. c. If you happen to know that the acceleration in the x?direction or y?direction is zero (say the object is just sitting on a table), then you can plug this in to Newtons 2nd Law directly. d. If you happen to know the acceleration, you can plug this in directly too. a. Draw a separate FBD for each body. b. Set up a sum of forces equation based on the FBD for each body. c. Newtons Third Law will tell you which forces on different bodies are the same in magnitude. d. Your equations should equal your unknown variables at this point. 
Example 1 	  Question: Using the diagram below, find the net force on the block. The block weighs 3kg and the inclined plane has a coefficient of friction of .6. Answer: The first step to solving a Newtons Laws problem is to identify the object in question. In our case, the block on the slope is the object of interest. Next, we need to draw a free-body diagram. To do this, we need to identify all of the forces acting on the block and their direction. The forces are friction, which acts in the negative x direction, the normal force, which acts in the positive y direction, and gravity, which acts in a combination of the negative y direction and the positive x direction. Notice that we have rotated the picture so that the majority of the forces acting on the block are along the y or x axis. This does not change the answer to the problem because the direction of the forces is still the same relative to each other. When we have determined our answer, we can simply rotate it back to the original position. Now we need to break down gravity (the only force not along one of the axises) into its component vectors (which do follow the axises). 
The y component of gravity : 9.8m/s2 sin60 = 8.5m/s2 	  Yet these are only the acceleration of gravity so we need to multiply them by the weight of the block to get the force. F = ma = 3kg4.9m/s2 = 14.7NF = ma = 3kg8.5m/s2 = 25.5N Now that we have solved for the force of the y-component of gravity we know the normal force (they are equal). Therefore the normal force is 25.5N. Now that we have the normal force and the coefficient of static friction, we can find the force of friction. 
Fs = s N = .625.5 N = 15.3 	  The force of static friction is greater than the component of gravity that is forcing the block down the inclined plane. Therefore the force of friction will match the force of the x-component of gravity. So the net force on the block is x?component of gravity	force of friction net force in the y?direction :	25	25.5 N 	= 0N net force in the x?direction :	z14}.|	?	z14}.|7N{	= 0N | {z } y?component of gravity Therefore the net force on the block is 0N.

What is the coefficient of kinetic friction K between the box and the floor? Heres the situation: both springs are compressed by an amount xo. The rod of length L is fixed to both the top plate and the bottom plate. The two springs, each with spring constant k, are wrapped around the rod on both sides of the middle plate, but are free to move because they are not attached to the rod or the plates. The middle plate has negligible mass, and is constrained in its motion by the compression forces of the top and bottom springs. The medical implementation of this device is to screw the top plate to one vertebrae and the middle plate to the vertebrae directly below. The bottom plate is suspended in space. Instead of fusing broken vertebrates together, this implant allows movement somewhat analogous to the natural movement of functioning vertebrae.

Summary 	  In this chapter students will gain an understanding of force and what causes changes in motion. In addition, students will learn how to solve many different types of problems involving vectors, incline planes, friction, etc. 
The  Basics 	  An object will not change its state of motion (i.e., accelerate) unless an unbalanced force acts on it. Equal and oppositely directed forces on the same object do not produce acceleration. The force of gravity is called weight. Near the surface of a planet, it has magnitude mg and is directed perpendicular to its surface. This g is different from the Gravitational Constant, and differs from planet to planet. Your mass does not change when you move to other planets  although your weight does  because mass is a measure of how much matter your body contains, and not how much gravitational force you feel. To calculate the net force on an object, you need to calculate all the individual forces acting on the object and then add them as vectors. Newtons Third Law states for every force there is an equal but opposite reaction force. To distinguish a third law pair from merely oppositely directed pairs is difficult, but very important. Third law pairs must obey three rules: (1) Third law force pairs must be of the same type of force. (2) Third law force pairs are exerted on two different objects. (3) Third law force pairs are equal in magnitude and oppositely directed. Example: A block sits on a table. The Earths gravity on the block and the force of the table on the block are equal and opposite. But these are not third law pairs, because they are both on the same object and the forces are of different types. The proper third law pairs are: (1) earths gravity on block/blocks gravity on earth and (2) table pushes on block/ block pushes on table. 
The  Big  Idea 	  In the absence of a net force, objects move in a straight line. If they turn that is, if their velocity changes, even only in direction there must be an applied force. Forces which cause objects to turn around continuously in a circle are known as centripetal forces. When an object moves in a circle its velocity at any particular instant points in a direction tangent to the circle. The acceleration points towards the center of the circle, and so does the force acting on it. This is only natural, when you think about it if you feel a force pushing you towards your left as you walk forward, you will walk in a circle, always turning left. Describe the velocity, speed and acceleration in circular motion. Students will learn that in circular motion there is always an acceleration (and hence a force) that points to the center of the circle defined by the objects motion. This force changes the direction of the velocity vector of the object but not the speed. Students will also learn how to calculate that speed using the period of motion and the length of its path (circumference of the circle it traces out).

Guidance 	  When something rotates in a circle, it moves through a position angle ? that runs from 0 to 2? radians and starts over again at 0. The physical distance it moves is called the path length. If the radius of the circle is larger, the path length traveled is longer. According to the arc length formula s = r?, the path length ?s traveled by something at radius r through an angle ? is: ?s = r?? [1] Just like the linear velocity is the rate of change of distance, angular velocity, usually called ?, is the rate of change of ?. The direction of angular velocity is either clockwise or counterclockwise. Analogously, the rate of change of ? is the angular acceleration ?. For an object moving in a circle, the objects tangential speed is directly proportional to the distance it is from the rotation axis. the tangential speed (as shown in the key equations) equals this distance multiplied by the angular speed (in radians/sec).

Guidance 	  Any force can be a centripetal force. Centripetal force is the umbrella term given to any force that is acting perpendicular to the motion of an object and thus causing it to go in a circle. Keep the following in mind when solving centripetal force type problems: The speed of the object remains constant. The centripetal force is changing the direction but not the speed of the object. Although the object feels an outward pull, this is not a true force, but merely the objects inertia. Remember, Newtons first law maintains that the natural state of an object is to go in a straight line at constant speed. Thus, when you make a right turn in your car and the basketball in the back seat flies to the left, that is because the car is moving right and the basketball is maintaining its position and thus from your point of view moves to the left. Your point of view in this case is different from reality because you are in a rotating reference frame. 
Applications 	  To find the maximum speed that a car can take a corner on a flat road without skidding out, set the force of friction equal to the centripetal force. To find the tension in the rope of a swinging pendulum, remember that it is the sum of the tension and gravity that produces a net upward centripetal force. A common mistake is just setting the centripetal force equal to the tension. To find the speed of a planet or satellite in an orbit, set the force of gravity equal to the centripetal force. Banked turns (the road is not flat, but rather at an angle) allow for a greater speed before skidding out. In this case the normal force aids the force of friction in creating a larger centripetal force than that which can be obtained by friction alone on a flat road. Its not as simple as adding them together, one must consider the components of these two forces in the direction to the center of the circle.

Summary 	  In this chapter students will learn about circular motion, centripetal acceleration and how to think about and solve problems on centripetal forces and motion. 
The  Big  Idea 	  Over 2500 years ago Aristotle proposed two laws of physics governing motion. One for Earthly bodies (objects on Earth) that states objects naturally go in straight lines and one for Heavenly bodies (objects in space) that states objects naturally go in circles. This idea held steady for 2,000 years until Isaac Newton, in a triumph of brilliance, declared that there is one law of physics that governs motion and he unified earthly bodies and heavenly bodies with the The Universal Law of Gravitation. Newton used the universal law of gravity to prove that the moon is accelerating towards Earth just as a body on Earth is falling towards it. The acceleration of both the moon and the object on Earth is calculated using the same formula. This theory is so well regarded that it has been used to hypothesize the existence of black holes and dark matter, later verified by observation. The search to unify the laws of physics into one theory continues today and is often referred to as the yet undiscovered Grand Unified Theory (GUT). Use Newtons Universal Law of Gravity equation to solve problems. Explain how the acceleration of gravity on Earth is calculated. Students will learn to use Newtons Universal Law of Gravity equation to solve problems. They will also learn how the acceleration of gravity on Earth is calculated and a bit about gravitational fields in general. 
Key  Equations 	  FG = Gmr12m2 ; the force of gravity between an object with mass m1 and another object of mass m2 and a distance between them of r. 
G = 6.6710?11  Nm2/kg2 ; the universal constant of gravity 	  g = Gmr2 ; gravitational field strength or gravitational acceleration of a planet with mass m and radius r. Note that this is not really a separate equation but comes from Newtons second law and the law of universal gravitation. Some data needed for the problems: 
Guidance 	  When using the Universal Law of Gravity formula and the constant G above, make sure to use units of meters and kilograms. The direction of the force of gravity is in a straight line between two objects. It is always attractive. Newton invented calculus in order to prove that for a spherical object (like Earth) one can assume all of its mass is at the center of the sphere (thus in his formula, one can use the radius of Earth for the distance between a falling rock and Earth). Newtons Laws apply to all forces; but when he developed them only one was known: gravity. Newtons major insight  and one of the greatest in the history of science  was that the same force that causes objects to fall when released is also responsible for keeping the planets in orbit. 
Universal  Gravity 	  Any two objects in the universe, with masses m1 and m2 with their centers of mass at a distance r apart will experience a force of mutual attraction along the line joining their centers of mass equal to: F~G = Gm12m2	Universal Gravitation, r where G is the Gravitational constant: 
G = 6.6730010?11m3kg?1s?2 	  Here is an illustration of this law for two objects, for instance the earth and the sun: 
Gravity on the  Earths  Surface 	  On the surface of a planet  such as earth  the r in formula [3] is very close to the radius of the planet, since a planets center of mass is  usually  at its center. It also does not vary by much: for instance, the earths radius is about 6,000 km, while the heights we consider for this book are on the order of at most a few kilometers  so we can say that for objects near the surface of the earth, the r in formula [3] is constant and equal to the earths radius. This allows us to say that gravity is more or less constant on the surface of the earth. Heres an illustration: For any object a height h above the surface of the earth, the force of gravity may be expressed as: 
Gmearthmobj 	  (rearth +h)2 
Now we make the approximation that 	  rearth +h ? rearth then, we can rewrite the force of gravity equation as 
F~ G =mobj = mobj ~g  gearth 	  We can do this because the quantity in braces only has constants; we can combine them and call their product g. Remember, this is an approximation that holds only when the r in formula [3] is more or less constant. We call the quantity mg an objects weight. Unlike an objects mass, an objects weight can change and depends on the gravitational force it experiences. In fact, an objects weight is the magnitude of the gravitational force on it. To find the weight of an object on another planet, star, or moon, use the appropriate values in the formula for the force of gravity.

Guidance 	  When can Gravity Act as a Centripetal Force? We saw last chapter that the force of Gravity causes an attraction between two objects of mass m1 and m2 at a distance r of 
Gm1m2 	  . [4] r2 By Newtons Third Law, both objects experience the force: equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, and both will move as an effect of it. If one of the objects is much lighter than the other (like the earth is to the sun, or a satellite is to earth) we can approximate the situation by saying that the heavier mass (the sun) does not move, since its acceleration will be far smaller due to its large mass. Then, if the lighter mass remains at a relatively constant absolute distance from the heavier one (remember, centripetal force needs to be constant in magnitude), we can say that the lighter mass experiences an effectively centripetal force and thus has a centripetal acceleration. 
Math of  Centripetal  Gravity 	  Gravity is not always a centripetal force. This is a really important point. It only acts as a centripetal force when conditions approximate those listed above  very much like it isnt constant near the surface of the earth, but very close to it. If gravity provides centripetal force and acceleration, we can set [2] equal to [4]. Its important to remember that in [2] m refers to the lighter mass, since that is the one traveling. Then, Gm1m2 m1v2 r = r72	r So, the relationship between velocity and radius for a circular orbit of a light object around an heavy mass (note the mass of the lighter object cancels) is: 
Geosynchronous orbit 	  This is the orbit where a satellite completes one orbit of the Earth every 24 hours, staying above the same spot (longitude) on Earth. This is a very important orbit for spy satellites and TV satellites among others. You force the speed of the satellite to be a value such that the satellite makes one rotation every 24 hours.

Summary 	  In this chapter students will learn about the Universal Law of Gravity and how to solve gravitational problems in space. 
The  Big  Idea 	  The universe has many remarkable qualities, among them a rather beautiful symmetry: the total amount of motion in the universe is constant. This law only makes sense if we measure motion in a specific way: as the product of mass and velocity. This product, called momentum, can be transferred from one object to another in a collision. The rapidity with which momentum is exchanged over time is determined by the forces involved in the collision. This is the second of the five fundamental conservation laws in physics. The other four are conservation of energy, angular momentum, charge, and CPT. (See Feynmans Diagrams for an explanation of CPT.) Describe what momentum is. Calculate the momentum of objects and use conservation of momentum to solve basic problems. Students will learn what momentum is and how to calculate momentum of objects. In addition, students will learn how to use conservation of momentum to solve basic problems. 
Key  Equations 	  p = mv Momentum is equal to the objects mass multiplied by its velocity ? pinitial = ? pfinal The total momentum does not change in closed systems 
Guidance 	  Momentum is a vector that points in the direction of the velocity vector. The magnitude of this vector is the product of mass and speed. The total momentum of the universe is always the same and is equal to zero. The total momentum of an isolated system never changes. Momentum can be transferred from one body to another. In an isolated system in which momentum is transferred internally, the total initial momentum is the same as the total final momentum. Momentum conservation is especially important in collisions, where the total momentum just before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision. 
Example 1 	  A truck with mass 500 kg and originally carrying 200 kg of dirt is rolling forward with the transmission in neutral and shooting out the dirt backwards at 2 m/s (so that the dirt is at relative speed of zero compared with the ground). If the truck is originally moving at 2 m/s, how fast will it be moving after it has shot out all the dirt. You may ignore the effects of friction. 
Solution 	  To solve this problem we will apply conservation of momentum to the truck when it is full of dirt and when it has dumped all the dirt. vf =solve for the final velocity mt (500 kg+200 kg)?2 m/s vf = vf = 2.8 m/s plug in the numerical values 
Example 2 	  mivi = mf vf start by setting the initial momentum equal to the final momentum (mt +md)vi = mtvf (mt +md)vi substitute the mass of the truck plus the mass of the dirt in the truck at the initial and John and Bob are standing at rest in middle of a frozen lake so there is no friction between their feet and the ice. Both of them want to get to shore so they simultaneously push off each other in opposite directions. If Johns mass is 50 kg and Bobs mass is 40 kg and John moving at 5 m/s after pushing off Bob, how fast is Bob moving? 
Solution 	  For this problem, we will apply conservation of momentum to the whole system that includes both John and Bob. Since both of them are at rest to start, we know that the total momentum of the whole system must always be zero. Therefore, we know that the sum of Johns and Bobs momentum after they push off each other is also zero. We can use this to solve for Bobs velocity. ?mbvb = mjvj vb = ?mjvj mb vb = ?6.25 m/s The answer is negative because Bob is traveling in the opposite direction to John.

Key  Equations 	  ~pi t 
Guidance 	  The force imparted on an object is equal to the change in momentum divided by the time interval over which the objects are in contact. Internal forces are forces for which both Newtons Third Law force pairs are contained within the system. For example, consider a two-car head-on collision. Define the system as just the two cars. In this case, internal forces include that of the fenders pushing on each other, the contact forces between the bolts, washers, and nuts in the engines, etc. External forces are forces that act on the system from outside. In our previous example, external forces include the force of gravity acting on both cars (because the other part of the force pair, the pull of gravity the Earth experiences coming from the cars, is not included in the system) and the forces of friction between the tires and the road. If there are no external forces acting on a system of objects, the initial momentum of the system will be the same as the final momentum of the system. Otherwise, the final momentum will change by ?~p = ~F?t. We call such a change in momentum ?~p an impulse.

Example 2 	  Question: Chris and Ashley are playing pool. Ashley hits the cue ball into the 8 ball with a velocity of 1.2m/s. The cue ball (c) and the 8 ball (e) react as shown in the diagram. The 8 ball and the cue ball both have a mass of .17kg. What is the velocity of the cue ball? What is the direction (the angle) of the cue ball? Answer: We know the equation for conservation of momentum, along with the masses of the objects in question as well two of the three velocities. Therefore all we need to do is manipulate the conservation of momentum equation so that it is solved for the velocity of the cue ball after the collision and then plug in the known values to get the velocity of the cue ball. mcvic +mevie = mcvfc +mevfe mcvic +mevie ?mevfe vfc = mc .17kg2.0m/s+.17kg0m/s?.17kg1.2m/s vfc = .17kg vfc = .80m/s Now we want to find the direction of the cue ball. To do this we will use the diagram below. We know that the momentum in the y direction of the two balls is equal. Therefore we can say that the velocity in the y direction is also equal because the masses of the two balls are equal. mcvcy = mevey ? vcy = vey Given this and the diagram, we can find the direction of the cue ball. After 1 second, the 8 ball will have traveled 1.2m. Therefore we can find the distance it has traveled in the y direction. sin25o =	opposite	=	x	? x = sin251.2m = .51m hypotenuse	1.2m Therefore, in one second the cue ball will have traveled .51m in the y direction as well.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Solve problems involving inelastic collisions. 
Key  Equations 	  ? pinitial = ? pfinal The total momentum does not change in closed systems 
Guidance 	  In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved within the system but kinetic energy is not; energy from the collision is turned into other forms besides kinetic energy. For example, some of the kinetic energy goes into producing heat and deforming the objects. You can find the change in kinetic energy by calculating the kinetic energy of all the objects before and after the collision, but you must first use conservation of momentum to solve for the unknown values. In a perfectly inelastic collision, the objects will stick together and combine into a single mass. This means that when you calculate the final momentum of the system, you should consider there to be only one object with a larger total mass. Remember: you can only use conservation of momentum to solve a problem involving an inelastic collision 
Example 1 	  Question: Two blocks collide on a frictionless surface. Afterwards, they have a combined mass of 10kg and a speed of 2.5m/s. Before the collision, block A, which has a mass of 8.0kg, was at rest. What was the mass and initial speed of block B? Solution: To find mass of block B we have a simple subtraction problem. We know that the combined mass is 10kg and the mass of block A is 8.0kg. Now that we know the mass of both blocks we can find the speed of block B. We will use conservation of momentum. This was a completely inelastic collision. We know this because the blocks stuck together after the collision. This problem is one dimensional, because all motion happens along the same line. Thus we will use the equation (mA +mB)vf = mA vA +mB vB and solve for the velocity of block B. (mA +mB)(vf )?(mA)(vA) (mA +mB)vf = mA vA +mBvB ?	 = vB mB

Summary 	  In this chapter students learn how to analyze and solve momentum questions and problems. Specifically, they will learn about momentum conservation in the context of collisions and also about impulse and impulse force. 
The  Big  Idea 	  The law of conservation of momentum states that in any closed system (including the universe) the total quantity of momentum is constant. Momentum can be transferred from one body to another, but none is lost or gained. If a system has its momentum changed from the outside it is caused by an impulse, which transfers momentum from one body to another. When any two bodies in the universe interact, they can exchange energy, momentum, or both. The law of conservation of energy states that in any closed system (including the universe) the total quantity of energy remains fixed. Energy is transferred from one form to another, but not lost or gained. If energy is put into a system from the outside or vice versa it is often in the form of work, which is a transfer of energy between bodies. Describe potential energy and how to calculate it.

That is, if you add up all the energy of an object(s) at one time it will equal all the energy of said object(s) at a later time. A closed system is a system where no energy is transferred in or out. The total energy of the universe is a constant (i.e. it does not change). The problems below do not consider the situation of energy transfer (called work). So friction and other sources where energy leaves the system are not present. Thus, one simply adds up all the potential energy and kinetic energy before and sets it equal to the addition of the total potential energy and kinetic energy after.

Solution 	  The potential energy of the puck when it stops at the top of its path will be equal to the kinetic energy that it was initially rolled with. We can use this to determine the how high above the ground the puck will be above the ground when it stops, and then use trigonometry to find out how far up the ramp the puck will be when it stops. v2 = gh	simplify the equation v2 h = (4 m/s)2 = solve for h h		substitute in the known values ?9.8 m/s2 2 h = 0.82 m Now we can find the distance up the ramp the ball traveled since we know the angle of the ramp and the height of the ball above the ground. h sin(30) = x h x sin(30) x = 1.6 m

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Define work and calculate the amount of work done. Students will learn that work is simply the transfer of energy into or out of a system. Students will learn how to calculate the work done and how to incorporate it into energy conservation. 
Key  Equations 	  W = Fx?x = Fd cos ; Work is equal to the distance an object moves multiplied by the component of the force in the direction that object is moving. W = work (in Joules; work is just energy being transferred) 
Guidance 	  When an object moves in the direction of an applied force, we say that the force does work on the object. Note that the force may be slowing the object down, speeding it up, maintaining its velocity  any number of things. In all cases, the net work done is given by this formula: W 	Work is the dot product of force and displacement. In other words, if an object has traveled a distance d under force ~F, the work done on it will equal to d multiplied by the component of ~F along the objects path. Consider the following example of a block moving horizontally with a force applied at some angle: Here the net work done on the object by the force will be Fdcos?. 
Example 1 	  A 1kg ball has been attached to a 2m string and is at rest on a frictionless surface. If you exert a constant force of 10N on the string and pull the ball over the course of 5m and then begin spinning the ball in a circle, after 3 revolutions, what is the total amount of work you have done on the ball? 
Solution 	  Since the centripetal force you exert on the ball in order to make it spin is perpendicular to the balls path, you do not work on the ball while spinning it in a circle. Therefore, the only work you do on the ball is when you are pulling it in a straight line. 
Example 2 	  A block of mass 5kg is sliding down a ramp inclined at 45 degrees. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the ramp and the block is 0.3, how much work does the force of friction do as the block slides 3m down to the bottom of the ramp. 
Solution 	  In order to find the work done by friction, we first want to find out the magnitude of the force of friction. f = kN	start with the equation for the force of friction f = kmgcos(30)	substitute the y-component of the weight of the block for the normal force Now that we have the magnitude of the force of friction, we can plug that into the equation for work. 
W =  Fd 	  W = kmgcos(45) W = 0.3?5kg?9.8m/s2 ?cos(45)

Esp = 21 kx2;  Potential energy of a spring 	  W = Fx?x = Fd cos? ; Work is equal to the distance multiplied by the component of the force in the direction it is moving. 
Guidance 	  The main thing to always keep prescient in your mind is that the total energy before must equal the total energy after. If some energy has transferred out of or into the system via work, you calculate that work done and include it in the energy sum equation. Generally work done by friction is listed on the after side and work put into the system, via a jet pack for example, goes on the before side. Another important point is that on turns or going over hills or in rollercoaster loops, one must include the centripetal motion equations -for example to insure that you have enough speed to make the loop.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Solve problems involving both energy and momentum conservation. Students will learn how to solve problems involving both energy and momentum conservation and where one is allowed to use either momentum conservation or energy conservation or both. 
Key  Equations 	  ?Einitial = ?Efinal ; The total energy does not change in closed systems ? pinitial = ? pfinal ; The total momentum does not change in closed systems 
Guidance 	  When attacking these problems remember that in a collision, energy is transferred out of the system to the environment, via heat, sound, breaking of molecular bonds, etc. Thus this is not a closed system during a collision of two objects. Thus you cannot use energy conservation immediately before the collision to immediately after the collision. However, momentum is conserved during the collision. Thus break the problem into two parts. For the collision part use momentum conservation. You can use energy conservation for the other parts, where it is conserved.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Define and calculate power and efficiency. Students will learn how to calculate power and efficiency. Students will also learn the true meaning of both. 
Key  Equations 	  P = W?t ; Power is equal to the energy released per second and has units of Watts ( 1 Watt = J/s). Eff = PPoutin ; The efficiency equals the output power divided by the input power 
Guidance 	  Power is the rate at which energy is being transferred. Power tells you how many Joules per second of energy is being used to drive something. Thus power is simply the change in energy divided by the time. Since work is by definition the transfer of energy (in or out of a system), power is also equal to the work divided by the time. Efficiency tells you how efficient something is and gives a number between 0 and 1. If the efficiency is equal to 1, then the machine is perfectly efficient (that is all the power used to drive it goes to the out put of the machine with no energy losses). If the efficiency is zero, then all of the input power is lost in the machine and the machine can not output any energy. 
Example 1 	  Question: A pile driver lifts a 500 kg mass a vertical distance of 20 m in 1.1 sec. It uses 225 kW of supplied power to do this. a) How much work was done by the pile driver? b) How much power was used in actually lifting the mass? c) What is the efficiency of the machine? (This is the ratio of power used to power supplied.) d) The mass is dropped on a pile and falls 20 m. If it loses 40,000 J on the way down to the ground due to airresistance, what is its speed when it hits the pile? Answer: a) We will use the equation for work (which gives us the amount of energy transferred) and plug in the known valuesto get the amount of work done by the pile driver. 
W =  Fd = mgd = 500kg9.8m/s2 20m = 9.8104 	  b) We will use the power equation and plug in the known values and then convert to kW at the end. 
P = = = 89000 W  = 89k W ?t 1.1s 1000 	  c) Efficiency is defined as the Power out divided by the Power in. Thus, this is simply a division problem. power used	89kW 
E f f =	=	= .40 	  power supplied	225kW d) We have already solved for the amount of energy the mass has after the pile driver performs work on it (it has9.8104J). If on the way down it loses 40000J due to air resistance, then it effectively has of energy. So we will set the kinetic energy equation equal to the total energy and solve for v. This will give us the velocity of the mass when it hits the ground because right before the mass hits the ground, all of the potential energy will have been converted into kinetic energy. s

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Define mechanical advantage and calculate it for various tools. Students will learn about mechanical advantage and how to find the mechanical advantage of various tools. 
Key  Equations 	  Mechanical Advantage (MA) MA = dd12 = FFoutin d1 is the distance of effort and d2 is the distance the object is moved 
Guidance 	  Mechanical Advantage is the ability to lift or move objects with great force while utilizing only a little force. The trade-off is that you must operate the smaller input force for a large distance. This is all seen through the work Equation. Work equals force times distance. Energy is conserved. Thus one can get a large force for a small distance equal to a small force for a large distance. Mechanical advantage equals the distance of effort divided by the distance the object moves. It is also equal to the output force divided by the input force. 
Example 1 	  You need to push a 500 kg grand piano onto a stage that is 3 m above the ground. If you can only apply a maximum force of 1000 N, what is the minimum distance from the stage that you should begin building your ramp? 
Solution 	  We should start this problem by determining the mechanical advantage required to move the piano based on the weight of the piano and the force you can apply. Well define Fout to be the force it would take to lift the piano straight up and Fin to be the force you can apply. 
Fout 	  MA = 
Fin 	  MA = MA = 
A = 4.9 	  Now we can use this to find how long the ramp needs to be. din MA = dout din = MAdout din = 4.9?3 m din = 14.7 m Now we can just use the Pythagorean theorem to determine how far away from the stage the ramp should start. a2 +b2 = c2 p b = q b =	(14.7 m)2 ?(3 m)2 b = 14.4 m

Summary 	  In these lessons students explore types of energy and the law of energy conservation. Students will also investigate and calculate power, work and efficiency. 
The  Big  Idea 	  The third conservation law is conservation of angular momentum. This vector quantity is the product of rotational velocity and rotational inertia. In any closed system (including the universe) the quantity of angular momentum is fixed. Angular momentum can be transferred from one body to another, but cannot be lost or gained. If a system has its angular momentum changed from the outside it is caused by a torque. Torque is a force applied at a distance from the center of rotation. Apply the kinematic equations for rotation. Students will learn how to apply the kinematic equations for rotation. Key Equations v = r? linear speed v is equal to the angular speed ? multiplied by the radius of the rotating object. a = r? linear acceleration a is equal to the angular acceleration ? multiplied by the radius of the rotating object. ?(t) = ?0 +?0t +1/2?t2 
Rotational equivalent of 	  x(t) = xi +vit +1/2at2 ?(t) = ?0 +?t 
Rotational equivalent of 	  vf = vi +at 
Rotational equivalent of 	  v2f = v2i +2a?x 
Guidance 	  These equations work in the case of constant angular acceleration. Use them just as you would use the linear kinematic equations studied in the One-Dimensional Motion lessons. Just replace displacement with the change in angle, the velocity with the angular velocity and the acceleration with the angular acceleration. When something rotates in a circle, it moves through a position angle ? that runs from 0 to 2? radians and starts over again at 0. The physical distance it moves is called the path length. If the radius of the circle is larger, the path length traveled is longer. The angular velocity ? tells you how quickly the angle ? changes. In more formal language, the rate of change of ?, the angular position, is called the angular velocity ?. The direction of angular velocity is either clockwise or counterclockwise. Analogously, the rate of change of ? is the angular acceleration ?. The linear velocity and linear acceleration of rotating object also depend on the radius of rotation, which is called the moment arm (See figure below.) If something is rotating at a constant angular velocity, it moves more quickly if it is farther from the center of rotation. For instance, people at the Earths equator are moving faster than people at northern latitudes, even though their day is still 24 hours long this is because they have a greater circumference to travel in the same amount of time. 
Example 1 	  A 2 kg mass is attached to a .5 m long string. Starting from rest, the mass is given a constant angular acceleration of 2 rad/s2. If the string breaks when the tension exceeds 50 N, how long will it be before the string breaks and what will the objects angular displacement be? 
Solution 	  To start, we first want to find the objects linear speed when the string breaks. v = 3.53m/s Now, we can find the angular speed. v ? = 7.06rad/s Now we can begin finding the values asked in the problem based on this information using the equations from the section above. Well start by finding the time before the string breaks. ? = ??t t Lastly, well find the angular displacement of the mass. (7.06 rad/s)2 ?? =	?2rad/s2 ?? = 12.5 rad

Answers 	  Define and calculate momentum of inertia. Students will learn what is momentum of inertia, what determines a large or small moment of inertia for an object and how to calculate moment of inertia. 
Guidance 	  Moment of inertia tells you how difficult it is to rotate an object. It is equivalent to the mass in linear problems. Moment of inertia is proportional to an objects mass and to its distance from the rotational axis squared. The distance from the rotational axis dominates over the objects mass due to the square power. Thus the more mass an object has at its edges the more moment of inertia it has. Thus if you grab a big long pole and hold it at the center, it is fairly easy to rotate. However, if you hold the same pole at the end and try to rotate it -not so easy! Finally, moment of inertias can be added as long as the rotating parts in question are rotating around the same axis. For example, the moment of inertia of a pole with a mass at its end is the sum of the individual moment of inertias of each object involved. See example 2 for another problem where the moment of inertias are added together. 
Example 2 	  Two 2 kg masses is placed at either end of a rod that has a mass of .5 kg and a length of 3 m. What is the moment of inertia if the system it is rotated about (a) one end of the rod and (b) the center of the rod? 
Solution 	  For both parts of this problem we will be summing the moment of inertias for each component of the system based on the table above. We will treat the masses as satellites when calculating their moment of inertias. (a): For this part, well only add the value for the rod being rotated about one end and one of the masses because one of the masses is at the axis of rotation. 
I = 19.5 kg*m2 	  (b):For the second part, well sum the moment of inertias of both masses and the rod being rotated about its center. 
Watch this  Explanation 	  Even though they have the same mass, the plug on the right has a higher moment of inertia (I), than the plug on the left, since the mass is distributed at greater radius. a.

Answers 	  Calculate torque in various situations. Students will learn to calculate Torque in various situations. 
Key  Equations 	  ~? =~r~F = r?F = rF? Individual torques are determined by multiplying the force applied by the perpendicular component of the moment arm 
Guidance 	  Torque is equal to the cross product as stated above. In general, one can simplify by saying that the torque is equal to the force acting on the object multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the application of the force to the rotational axis. Say you had a seesaw. It is easier to exert torque, get the seesaw to move, if you pushed on the board near the end rather than near the middle. It is the rotational version of Force. 
Example 2 	  A 1 m long 2 kg rod is attached to the side of a building with a hinge at one end. The rod is held level by a cable that makes an angle of 45 degrees with the rod and is also attached to the building above the rod. What is the tension in the cable? The situation is illustrated in a diagram below. 
Solution 	  There will be multiple steps to this problem. First well make a free body diagram for the rod; making free body diagrams in torque problems is just as important as in Newtons Laws problems. In the diagram, the force of tension from the cable, the rods weight, and the forces from the hinge are shown. For the purposes of calculating torque, an objects weight acts from its center of mass (half way along the rod in this case). In the diagram below, the force on the rod from the hinge is already broken into its components to make it easier to visualize. Now, in order to find the tension in the cable, well sum the torques on the rod with the hinge as the axis of rotation. Notice that the sign of the torque due to tension in the cable and the torque due to the rods weight will be opposite signs because they would cause the rod to rotate in opposite directions. ?? = 0 r mgT sin(?)r = 0 mgr

Answers 	  Apply Newtons 2nd law in the case of rotational dynamics. Students will learn to apply Newtons 2nd law in the case of rotational dynamics. 
Key  Equations 	  ? = ?net/I Angular accelerations are produced by net torques,with inertia opposing acceleration; because ? is the rotational version of a, linear acceleration, ? is the rotational version of F, force, and I is the rotational version of mass. This is the rotational analog of Newtons 2nd law a = Fnet/m ?net = ??i = I? The net torque is the vector sum of all the torques acting on the object. When adding torques it is necessary to subtract CW from CCW torques. 
Guidance 	  Use this law just as you did in the Newtons Laws lessons. First choose a pivot point to take all torques around, and then add up all the torques acting on an object and that will equal the moment of inertia multiplied by the angular acceleration. Torques produce angular accelerations, but just as masses resist acceleration (due to inertia), there is an inertia that opposes angular acceleration. The measure of this inertial resistance depends on the mass, but more importantly on the distribution of the mass in a given object. The moment of inertia, I, is the rotational version of mass. Values for the moment of inertia of common objects are given above. Torques have only two directions: those that produce clockwise (CW) and those that produce counterclockwise (CCW) rotations. The angular acceleration or change in ? would be in the direction of the torque. Many separate torques can be applied to an object. The angular acceleration produced is ? = ?net/I 
Example 2 	  Some old doors have the door knob in the center of the door like in the picture below. If you had a door of mass 20 kg and 1.5 m wide, what would be the angular acceleration if you pushed at the center of the door with a force of 50 N? What would the angular acceleration be if you pushed at the far end of the door with the same force? Where should you push the door if you want to open it the fastest? 
Solution 	  To solve this problem, we will plug in the known values into Newtons second law for rotation and solve for ?. When calculating the moment of inertia of the door, well consider it a rod being rotated about one end. Well first calculate the angular acceleration when pushing from the center of the door. ?? = I? Fr = I? 
Fr 	  Now well calculate the angular acceleration when pushing from the end of the door. mr2 Clearly, it is much faster and easier to open doors when pushing from the point farthest from the hinge.

Answers 	  Solve Yo-Yo type problems, where an object is rotating in free fall yet attached to a string (or some other similar restraint). Students will learn to solve Yo-Yo type problems. That is problems where an object is rotating in free fall yet attached to a string (or some other similar restraint). Key Equations ? = ?net/I angular accelerations are produced by net torques,with inertia opposing acceleration; this is the rotational analog of a = Fnet/m ?net = ??i = I? the net torque is the vector sum of all the torques acting on the object. When adding torques it is necessary to subtract CW from CCW torques. ? = rF = r?F = rF? individual torques are determined by multiplying the force applied by the perpendicular component of the moment arm 
Guidance 	  In these types of problems it is very important to realize where the application of the force is acting. Remember that Torque is equal to the Force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the rotation axis. So if the CM is the rotation axis then there is not torque from gravity, as the distance from the rotation axis is zero. Also, in these types of problems, make sure to use Newtons laws in the linear form (i.e. ?F = ma) and also in the rotation form (i.e. ??i = I?). Then you can substitute in for one of the unknowns and solve for the other. 
Example 1 	  A wooden disk of mass m and radius r has a string of negligible mass is wrapped around it. If the the disk is allowed to fall and the string is held so that it unravels without sliding as the disk is falling, what will be the wooden disks acceleration? 
Solution 	  First well draw a free body diagram for the situation. In the diagram below the force of gravity and the tension from the string have been labeled and are drawn from they points they are acting. Lets start by applying Newtons second law to this object and well let the positive direction be downward. ?F = ma mg?T = ma As you can see, we have two unknowns in this equation(T and a), so were going to use Newtons second law for rotation as our second equation and solve for T. The rotation axis is at the cm of the cylinder, thus there is no torque from gravity. ?? = I? Tr = I? I? T = r Now we will substitute in values for I and ?. In order to calculate the moment of inertia of the wooden disk, we use the known formula for a disk being rotated about its center.

Key Equations ?net = ??i = I? = FFrictionRRollingRadius = FnormalRRollingRadius ( fs ? s|FN|	Opposes potential motion of surfaces in contact Static and Kinetic Friction fk = k|FN|	Opposes motion of surfaces in contact 
Guidance 	  When an object is rolling without slipping this means that v = r? and a = r?. This is also true in the situation of a rope on a pulley that is rotating the pulley without slipping. Using this correspondence between linear and angular speed and acceleration is very useful for solving problems, but is only true if there is no slipping. Also, know that when the object is sliding, kinetic friction is in play. When it is rolling, then static friction. Often, an object will start out rolling and sliding (kinetic friction) until it slows enough that it is rolling without sliding (static friction). One can set up a condition by forcing v = r? and a = r? in order to find the point where it stops sliding. Finally, when this rolling object rolls down the incline, it gains kinetic energy and loses potential energy, just like any object going down an incline. However, for rolling objects the kinetic energy is split between two forms: rotational and kinetic: 
Rolling Object = mv2 + 12 I?2 	  Remember, if the object isnt sliding but perfectly rolling: v = ?r 
Example 1 	  You throw a bowling ball of mass m and radius r with an initial speed vo down a flat bowling lane with a coefficient of kinetic friction k. Initially, the ball slides down the lane not rotating at all, but after a time ?t, it begins to roll perfectly without sliding. Find ?t in terms of the values given above.

Solutions 	  Use energy conservation in situations that include rotating objects. Students will learn how to use energy conservation in situations that include rotating objects. Remember, conservation of energy still holds. A rolling object has two parts to its kinetic energy: the linear kinetic energy that youve already done, and this rotational kinetic energy. The method to calculate the rotational energy from the moment of inertia and rotational velocity is shown below. 
Key  Equations 	  ?Einitial = ?Efinal The total energy does not change in closed systems

Key  Equations 	  L = I? ~L =~r~p = r?p = rp? The angular momentum of a spinning object can be found in two equivalent ways. Just like linear momentum, one way, shown in the first equation, is to multiply the moment of inertia, the rotational analog of mass, with the angular velocity. The other way is simply multiplying the linear momentum by the radius, as shown in the second equation. ? = ??Lt Just the same as linear momentum, the torque required to change the momentum L in t time (L/t) can be compared to the force required to change the momentum p in t time. (p/t) Torques produce a change in angular momentum with time.

Summary 	  The lessons here cover rotational motion, including important problem solving techniques. 
The  Big  Idea 	  The development of devices to measure time, like the pendulum, led to the analysis of periodic motion. Such motion repeats itself in equal intervals of time (called periods) and is also referred to as harmonic motion. When an object moves back and forth over the same path in harmonic motion it is said to be oscillating. If the distance such an object travels in one oscillation remains constant, it is called simple harmonic motion (SHM). A grandfather clocks pendulum and the quartz crystal in a modern watch are examples of SHM. Describe the concepts of period and frequency. Read the period and frequency off a graph and calculate them for systems in harmonic motion. Students will learn the concepts of period and frequency and how to read them off a graph and how to calculate them for systems in harmonic motion. In addition, students will learn how to graph simple harmonic motion.

Example 2 	  Question: The effective k of a diving board is 800N/m (we say effective because it bends in the direction of motion instead of stretching like a spring, but otherwise behaves the same). A pudgy diver is bouncing up and down at the end of the diving board. The y vs. t graph is shown below. a) What is the distance between the lowest and the highest point of oscillation? b) What is the Period and frequency of the diver? c) What is the divers mass? d) Write the sinusoidal equation of motion for the diver. Solution: a) As we can see from the graph the highest point is 2m and the lowest point is ?2m. Therefore the distance is |2m?(?2m)|= 4m b)We know that 
 	  From the graph we know that the period is 2 seconds, so the frequency ishz. c) To find the divers mass we will use the equation rm T = 2? k and solve for m. Then it is a simple matter to plug in the known values to get the mass.

Then wemust find the amplitude (A), vertical shift (D), horizontal shift (C), and period (B). Cosine is easier in this case so we will work with it instead of sine. As we can see from the graph, the amplitude is 2, the vertical shift is 0, and the horizontal shift is ?.4. We solved for the period already. Therefore, we can write the sinusoidal equation of this graph. AcosB(x?C)+D = 2cos?(x+.4)

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Calculate periods, frequencies, etc. of spring systems in harmonic motion. Students will learn to calculate periods, frequencies, etc. of spring systems in harmonic motion. 
T = 1f ;  Period is the inverse of frequency 	  rm Tspring = 2?	 ; Period of mass m on a spring with constant k k Fsp = ?kx ; the force of a spring equals the spring constant multiplied by the amount the spring is stretched or compressed from its equilibrium point. The negative sign indicates it is a restoring force (i.e. direction of the force is opposite its displacement from equilibrium position. Usp = 21kx2 ; the potential energy of a spring is equal to one half times the spring constant times the distance squared that it is stretched or compressed from equilibrium 
Guidance 	  The oscillating object does not lose any energy in SHM. Friction is assumed to be zero. In harmonic motion there is always a restorative force, which attempts to restore the oscillating object to its equilibrium position. The restorative force changes during an oscillation and depends on the position of the object. In a spring the force is given by Hookes Law: F = ?kx The period, T, is the amount of time needed for the harmonic motion to repeat itself, or for the object to go one full cycle. In SHM, T is the time it takes the object to return to its exact starting point and starting direction. The frequency, f, is the number of cycles an object goes through in 1 second. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 cycle per sec. The amplitude, A, is the distance from the equilibrium (or center) point of motion to either its lowest or highest point (end points). The amplitude, therefore, is half of the total distance covered by the oscillating object. The amplitude can vary in harmonic motion, but is constant in SHM.

Key  Equations 	  s

Example 1 	  You have a mass swinging on the end of 1 m pendulum. If the maximum linear velocity of the mass is 2 m/s, (a) calculate the period of the pendulum and (b) calculate the amplitude of the pendulum. 
Solution 	  To calculate the period of the pendulum, we can just plug in the given length into the equation above. s l T = 2? g 
T = 2s 	  To find the amplitude, well use the equation given in the Period and Frequency lesson that gives us the velocity as a function of time. Since the problem says that the given velocity is the maximum velocity, we know that the pendulum is at the bottom of its arc and 1/4th (or 3/4ths) of its way through one period. Based on this knowledge, we can plug in 1/4 of the period for the change in time. We also know the frequency because we just found the period, so all we have to do is solve for the amplitude. v(t) = ?2?fAcos(2?f?t)	start with the equation for velocity v	put in the terms we know vmax

Investigation 	  We have explored two examples of simple harmonic motion: the pendulum and the mass-spring system in the previous lesson. The purpose of this investigation is to get you to notice the connections between the two systems. Your task: Match the period of the pendulum system with that of the spring system. You are only allowed to change the mass involved in the spring system. Consider the effective length of the pendulum to be fixed at 2m because that is the distance between the center of mass and the pivot. The spring constant(13.5N/m) is also fixed. You may use any relationships you have learned about to help you. You should view the charts to check whether you have succeeded. Instructions: To alter the mass, simply click on the select tool in the menu, and select the mass. Then use the tab at the bottom of your screen to change the density or dimensions of the block to get the mass that you want. To view chart legend, click on Settings and you can plot velocity or position of the pendulum or mass on the spring. The mass and the spring constant have now been changed. What is the new period of the mass-spring system? Can you change the length of the pendulum to match the periods now? 
Summary 	  In these lessons students will learn the concepts of frequency and period. In addition students will learn how to graph harmonic motion and how to calculate the periods of a spring mass system and a pendulum system. 
The  Big  Idea 	  Objects in motion that return to the same position after a fixed period of time are said to be in harmonic motion. Objects in harmonic motion have the ability to transfer some of their energy over large distances. They do so by creating waves in a medium. Imagine pushing up and down on the surface of a bathtub filled with water. Water acts as the medium that carries energy from your hand to the edges of the bathtub. Waves transfer energy over a distance without direct contact with the initial source. Since waves are disturbances in an existing medium, they are considered phenomena and not actual objects. Compare and contrast a longitudinal wave and a transverse wave. Describe general wave properties. Students will learn the difference between a longitudinal wave a transverse wave. Students will also learn some general wave properties. 
Guidance 	  The period, T, is the amount of time for the harmonic motion to repeat itself, or for the object to go one full cycle. In SHM, T is the time it takes the object to return to its exact starting point and starting direction. The period of a wave depends on the period of oscillation of the object creating the wave. The frequency, f, is the number of cycles an object or wave goes through in 1 second. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 cycle per sec. The amplitude, A, is the distance from the equilibrium (or center) point of motion to either its lowest or highest point (end points). The amplitude, therefore, is half of the total distance covered by the oscillating object. The amplitude can vary in harmonic motion but is constant in SHM. The amplitude of a wave often determines its strength or intensity; the exact meaning of "strength" depends on the type of wave. For example, a sound wave with a large amplitude is a loud sound and a light wave with a large amplitude is very bright. A medium is the substance through which the wave travels. For example, water acts as the medium for ocean waves, while air molecules act as the medium for sound waves. When a wave passes through a medium, the medium is only temporarily disturbed. When an ocean wave travels from one side of the Mediterranean Sea to the other, no actual water molecules move this great distance. Only the disturbance propagates (moves) through the medium. An object oscillating with frequency f will create waves which oscillate with the same frequency f. The speed v and wavelength ? of a wave depend on the nature of the medium through which the wave travels. There are two main types of waves we will consider: longitudinal and transverse waves. In longitudinal waves, the vibrations of the medium are in the same direction as the wave motion. A classic example is a wave traveling down a line of standing dominoes: each domino will fall in the same direction as the motion of the wave. A more physical example is a sound wave. For sound waves, high and low pressure zones move both forward and backward as the wave moves through them. In transverse waves, the vibrations of the medium are perpendicular to the direction of motion. A classic example is a wave created in a long rope: the wave travels from one end of the rope to the other, but the actual rope moves up and down, and not from left to right as the wave does. Water waves act as a mix of longitudinal and transverse waves. A typical water molecule pretty much moves in a circle when a wave passes through it. Most wave media act like a series of connected oscillators. For instance, a rope can be thought of as a large number of masses (molecules) connected by springs (intermolecular forces). The speed of a wave through connected harmonic oscillators depends on the distance between them, the spring constant, and the mass. In this way, we can model wave media using the principles of simple harmonic motion. The speed of a wave on a string depends on the material the string is made of, as well as the tension in the string. This fact is why tightening a string on your violin or guitar will increase the frequency, or pitch, of the sound it produces. sound waves water waves in the wake of a boat a vibrating string on a guitar a swinging jump rope the vibrating surface of a drum the wave done by spectators at a sports event slowly moving traffic jams a.

Answers 	  Explain the concept of destructive and constructive interference in the context of beat frequencies. Students will learn the concept of destructive and constructive interference in the context of beat frequencies. 
Key  Equations 	  fbeat =|f1 ? f2| ; two interfering waves create a beat wave with frequency equal to the difference in their frequencies 
Example 1 	  You want to find out the frequency of a tuning fork. When you strike the unknown fork and a fork which is known to create a sound at 100 Hz at the same time, you hear a beat frequency of 3 Hz. You strike the unknown fork a second time, but this time with a tuning fork rated for 105 Hz and you hear a beat frequency of 2 Hz. What is the frequency of the unknown fork? 
Solution 	  Each test gives us two possibilities for a frequency. Based on the first test, the unknown fork could either be rated for 97 Hz or 103 Hz. Based on the second test, the frequency of the unknown fork could either be 103 Hz or 107 Hz. The two tests agree on 103 Hz, so that must be the frequency of the unknown tuning fork. 
Answers 	  Describe the Doppler effect and use the Doppler shift equations to determine frequencies and speeds. Students will learn what the Doppler effect is and how to determine frequencies and speeds using the Doppler shift equations. 
Key  Equations 	  Doppler Shifts: v+vo fo = ffo (observed frequency) is shifted up when source and observer moving closer v?vs v?vo fo = ffo (observed frequency) is shifted down when source and observer moving apart,where v+vs v is the speed of sound, vs is the speed of the source, and vo is the speed of the observer 
Guidance 	  The Doppler Effect occurs when either the source of a wave or the observer of a wave (or both) are moving. When a source of a wave is moving towards you, the apparent frequency of the wave you detect is higher than that emitted. For instance, if a car approaches you while playing a note at 500 Hz, the sound you hear will be slightly higher frequency. The opposite occurs (the frequency observed is lower than emitted) for a receding wave or if the observer moves away from the source. Its important to note that the speed of the wave does not change its traveling through the same medium so the speed is the same. Due to the relative motion between the source and the observer the frequency changes, but not the speed of the wave. Note that while the effect is similar for light and electromagnetic waves the formulas are not exactly the same as for sound. 
Example 1 	  Question: How fast would a student playing an A note (440Hz) have to move towards you in order for you to hear a G note (784Hz)? Answer: We will use the Doppler shift equation for when the objects are getting closer together and solve for the speed of the student (the source). v+vo	f (v+vo)?vfo fo = f( ) ? fo (v?vs) = f (v+vo) ? vfo ?vs fo = f (v+vo) ? vs = ?( ) v?vs	fo Now we plug in the known values to solve for the velocity of the student. vs = ?( f (v+vo)?vfo ) = ?(440Hz(343m/s+0m/s)?343m/s784Hz) = 151m/s fo	784Hz 
Answers 	  Describe how sound is produced and how it travels through the air to then register a signal in the brain. Students will learn how sound is produced and how it travels through the air to then register a signal in the brain. 
Key  Equations 	  T = 1f ; period and frequency are inversely related v ? 331.4 m/s+0.6 T ; The speed of sound in air, where T is the temperature of the air in Celsius 
Example 1 	  Describe the pressure changes in the air as a sound wave passes a given point, then explain why a very loud sound can damage your tympanic membrane (ear drum). 
Answer 	  As a sound wave passes a certain point, the air pressure at that point alternates between high and low pressure. When sound waves pass into the ear, the alternating pressures cause a pressure difference on either side of the tympanic membrane. The pressure differences between the inside and outside of the membrane cause the membrane to move back and forth with the same frequency as the changes in pressure. What we perceive as very loud sounds are sound waves with very large amplitudes, meaning that the differences in pressure are very large. The larger changes in pressure could cause damage to the membrane by causing it to vibrate too violently. 
Simulation 	  Sound (PhET Simulation) 
Answers 	  Analyze and solve problems where standing waves are produced in a tube. Students will learn how to analyze and solve problems where standing waves (and hence sound) is produced in a tube. 
Key  Equations 	  v = ?f for a tube closed at one end f = nv/4L, where n is always odd for a tube open at both ends f = nv/2L, where n is an integer Question The objects A, B, and C below represent graduated cylinders of length 50 cm which are filled with water to the depths of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively as shown. a) If you blow in each of these tubes, which (A,B,C) will produce the highest frequency sound? b) What is the wavelength of the 1st harmonic (i.e. fundamental) of tube B? c) The speed of sound at room temperature is about 343 m/s. What is the frequency of the 1st harmonic for tube B? 
Solution 	  a) The water forms the bottom of the tube and thus where the node of the wave will be. Thus the air column is wherethe sound wave can exist. The larger the air column, the larger the wavelength. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, thus the tube with the smallest air column will have the highest frequency. So the answer is tube C. b) The air column is 50 cm 20 cm = 30 cm. The first harmonic has a quarter wavelength in the tube. Thus ?= 4L. 
Thus, ? = 430cm = 120cm 	  c) Using the wave equation for the first harmonic (thus, n = 1) of a tube open at one end we get f 286Hz

(b) Calculate the frequencies of the first three harmonics played in this tube, if the speed of sound in the tube is 340 m/s. (c) The speed of sound in carbon dioxide is lower than in air.

Knowing that the pitch of your voice gets higher when you inhale helium, what can we say about the speed of sound in He. Answers: Describe how standing waves form through constructive interference. Solve standing wave problems where either both ends are constrained or neither of the ends are constrained. Students will learn how standing waves form through constructive interference and how to solve standing wave problems where either both ends are constrained or neither of the ends are constrained. 
Key  Equations 	  Standing waves for a string restricted at both ends or unrestricted at both ends fn = 2nvL ; n is an integer 
Guidance 	  A typical standing wave is shown below. This is the motion of a simple jump-rope. Nodes are the places where the rope doesnt move at all; antinodes occur where the motion is greatest. For this wave, the wavelength is . Since , the frequency of oscillation is . Higher harmonics can also form. Note that each end, where the rope is attached, must always be a node. Below is an example of a rope in a 5th harmonic standing wave. In general, the frequency of oscillation is , where n is the number of antinodes. The thick, dotted lines represent the wave envelope: these are the upper and lower limits to the motion of the string. Importantly, each of the above standing wave examples can also apply to sound waves in a closed tube, electromagnetic waves in a wire or fiber optic cable, and so on. In other words, the standing wave examples can apply to any kind of wave, as long as nodes are forced at both ends by whatever is containing/reflecting the wave back on itself. Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when something that has a natural frequency of vibration (pendulum, guitar, glass, etc.) is shaken or pushed at a frequency that is equal to its natural frequency of vibration. The most dramatic example is the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge due to wind causing vibrations at the bridges natural frequency. The result is the dramatic collapse of a very large suspension bridge. 
Example 1 	  You want to create a 4th harmonic standing wave standing wave of frequency 10 Hz on a rope. Prior to conducting your experiment, you are able to create a 1st harmonic standing wave with the exact same kind of rope at the same tension and you measure the frequency to be 3 Hz. What length of rope will you need to use in order to create your 4th harmonic standing wave at 10 Hz? 
Solution 	  This is a two step problem. Well start by finding how fast waves travel along the rope using the information from the prior test. v = 6m/s Now that we have the speed of waves on the rope, we can use that to find the length we need. nv f4 =

The  Big  Idea 	  Conservation of charge is the fourth of the five conservation laws in physics. There are two charges, positive and negative, and the conservation of electric charge indicates that the total charge in the universe remains the same. In any closed system charge can be transferred from one body to another or can move within the system but the total electric charge remains constant. Electromagnetism is associated with charge and is a fundamental force of nature, like gravity. If charges are static, the only manifestation of electromagnetism is the Coulomb electric force. In the same way that gravitational force depends on mass, the Coulomb electric force depends on the property known as electric charge. Like gravity, the Coulomb electric Force decreases with the square of the distance. The Coulomb electric force is responsible for many of the forces we discussed previously: the normal force, contact forces such as friction, and so on all of these forces arise in the mutual attraction and repulsion of charged particles. The law determining the magnitude of the Coulomb electric force has the same form as the law of gravity. However the electric constant is 20 orders of magnitude greater than the gravitational constant. That is why electricity normally dominates gravity at the atomic and molecular level. Since there is only one type of mass but two types of charge, gravity will dominate in large bodies unless there is a separation of charge. Describe the basics of electrostatics. Students will learn the inner workings of electrostatics: Why certain objects repulse, why certain objects attract and how to calculate the number of excess electrons or protons in an object. 
Key  Equations 	  q = Ne Any objects charge is an integer multiple of an electrons charge.

Guidance 	  The electric constant, k = 8.987109 Nm2C?2. Magnitude of the charges, units of Coulombs (C) 
Key  Equations 	  The Coulomb Force Law states that any two charged particles (q1,q2)  with charge measured in units of Coulombs  at a distance r from each other will experience a force of repulsion or attraction along the line joining them equal to: 
F~e = kq12q2	 The  Coulomb  Force [1] 	  r 
Where 	  k = 8.987109 Nm2 C?2	The Electric Constant This looks a lot like the Law of Universal Gravitation, which deals with attraction between objects with mass. The big difference is that while any two masses experience mutual attraction, two charges can either attract or repel each other, depending on whether the signs of their charges are alike: Like gravitational (and all other) forces, Coulomb forces add as vectors. Thus to find the force on a charge from an arrangement of charges, one needs to find the vector sum of the force from each charge in the arrangement. 
Example 1 	  Question: Two negatively charged spheres (one with ?12C; the other with ?3C) are 3m apart. Where could you place an electron so that it will be suspended in space between them with a net force of zero (for this problem we will ignore the force of repulsion between the two charges because they are held in place)? Answer: Consider the diagram above; here rs?e is the distance between the electron and the small charge, while ~Fs?e is the force the electron feels due to it. For the electron to be balanced in between the two charges, the forces of repulsion caused by the two charges on the electron would have to be balanced. To do this, we will set the equation for the force exerted by two charges on each other equal and solve for a distance ratio. We will denote the difference between the charges through the subscripts "s" for the smaller charge, "e" for the electron, and "l" for the larger charge. kqsqe	kqlqe = rs2?e	re2?l Now we can cancel. The charge of the electron cancels. The constant k also cancels. We can then replace the large and small charges with the numbers. This leaves us with the distances. We can then manipulate the equation to produce a ratio of the distances. Given this ratio, we know that the electron is twice as far from the large charge (?12C) as from the small charge (?3C). Given that the distance between the small and large charges is 3m, we can determine that the electron must be located 2m away from the large charge and 1m away from the smaller charge.

Answers 	  Describe the concept of Voltage and apply it in energy conservation problems. Students will learn the concept of Voltage and how to apply it in energy conservation problems. 
Key  Equations 	  E  Electric field vs electric potential. ?UE = q?V Change in potential energy due to travel through changing voltage. V = kqr	Electric potential of a single charge. 
Guidance 	  Like gravity, the electric force can do work and has a potential energy associated with it. But like we use fields to keep track of electromagnetic forces, we use electric potential, or voltage to keep track of electric potential energy. So instead of looking for the potential energy of specific objects, we define it in terms of properties of the space where the objects are. The electric potential difference, or voltage difference (often just called voltage) between two points (A and B) in the presence of an electric field is defined as the work it would take to move a positive test charge of magnitude 1 from the first point to the second against the electric force provided by the field. For any other charge q, then, the relationship between potential difference and work will be: 
 	  ?VAB =		[4] Electric Potential q Rearranging, we obtain: 
Work	 Potential  Difference 	  The potential of electric forces to do work corresponds to electric potential energy: ?UE,AB = q?VAB [5] Potential energy change due to voltage change The energy that the object gains or loses when traveling through a potential difference is supplied (or absorbed) by the electric field  there is nothing else there. Therefore, it follows that electric fields contain energy. To summarize: just as an electric field denotes force per unit charge, so electric potential differences represent potential energy differences per unit charge. Voltage is by definition the electric potential energy per Coulomb. So it is the electrical potential energy value divided by the charge. Thus, voltage difference is the potential value for potential energy. A 12V battery can not produce energy without charge flowing (i.e. you must connect the two ends). Electric potential is measured in units of Volts (V) thus electric potential is often referred to as voltage. Electric potential is the source of the electric potential energy. You can read the electric potential lines (that is the voltage lines) just like you would a contour map while backpacking in the mountains. Positive charges move towards lower electric potential; negative charges move toward higher electric potential. Thus, positive charges go downhill and negative charges go uphill. 
Example 1 	  You have a negative charge of unknown value and a positive charge of magnitude q1 and mass m. After fixing the negative charge in place, you place the positive charge a distance ri away from the negative charge and then release it. If the speed of the positive charge when it is a distance rf away from the negative charge is v, what was the magnitude of the negative charge in terms of the given values? 
Solution 	  There are multiple ways to do this problem, we will solve it using conservation of energy and the change in voltage to determine the magnitude of the negative charge. When working through this problem, well call the positive charge q1 and the negative charge q2. To start well say that the charge had zero potential energy when it was .5m from the negative charge; this will help us as we work through the problem. Using this assertion, we will apply conservation of energy to the positive charge. mv2 ?V = solve for V ?Ue = KEf	start with conservation of energy q1?V = mv1	substitute the equations for each energy term Now, since we know the voltage difference, we will express it using the equation for voltage at a certain distance from a point charge. ?V =start with the equation for voltage at a certain distance ?V =express the change in radius in terms of the initial and final radius of the positive charge ?V = kq2(	)	factor the equation rf	ri substitute in the value from the first step mv2 q2 =	1	1 solve for q2

Key  Equations 	  E = kqr2	; Electric field due to charge q at a distance r from the charge. F = qE	; Force due to an electric field. 
Guidance 	  Gravity and the Coulomb force have a nice property in common: they can be represented by fields. Fields are a kind of bookkeeping tool used to keep track of forces. Take the electromagnetic force between two charges given above: 
F~e = kqr12q2 	  If we are interested in the acceleration of the first charge only  due to the force from the second charge  we can rewrite this force as the product of q1 and kqr22 . The first part of this product only depends on properties of the object were interested in (the first charge), and the second part can be thought of as a property of the point in space where that object is. In fact, the quantity kqr22 captures everything about the electromagnetic force on any object possible at a distance r from q2. If we had replaced q1 with a different charge, q3, we would simply multiply q3 by kqr22 to find the new force on the new charge. Such a quantity, kqr22 here, is referred to as the electric field from charge q2 at that point: in this case, it is the electric field due to a single charge: kq 
E~f = r2 	  The electric field is a vector quantity, and points in the direction that a force felt by a positive charge at that point would. If we are given the electric field at some point, it is just a matter of multiplication  as illustrated above  to find the force any charge q0 would feel at that point: 
Force on charge q0	 Field  Charge 	  Note that this is true for all electric fields, not just those from point charges. In general, the electric field at a point is the force a positive test charge of magnitude 1 would feel at that point. Any other charge will feel a force along the same line (but possibly in the other direction) in proportion to its magnitude. In other words, the electric field can be thought of as "force per unit charge". In the case given above, the field was due to a single charge. Such a field is shown in the figure below. Notice that this a field due to a positive charge, since the field arrows are pointing outward. The field produced by a point charge will be radially symmetric i.e., the strength of the field only depends on the distance, r, from the charge, not the direction; the lengths of the arrows represent the strength of the field. 
Example 1 	  Question: Calculate the electric field a distance of 4.0mm away from a ?2.0C charge. Then, calculate the force on a ?8.0C charge placed at this point. Answer: To calculate the electric field we will use the equation kq E = r2 Before we solve for the electric field by plugging in the values, we convert all of the values to the same units. ?2.0C= ?2.010	C Now that we have consistent units we can solve the problem. kq	9109Nm2/C2 ?2.010?6C	?1.1	9 
E = =	= 10  N/ C r2	(.004m)2 	  To solve for the force at the point we will use the equation 
F =  Eq 	  . We already know all of the values so all we have to do is convert all of the values to the same units and then plug in the values. ?8.0C	 = ?8.010	C

R 13  Electric  Circuits:  Batteries 	  and Resistors 
The  Big  Ideas 	  The name electric current is given to the phenomenon that occurs when an electric field moves down a wire at close to the speed of light. Voltage is the electrical energy density (energy divided by charge) and differences in this density (voltage) cause electric current. Resistance is the amount a device in the wire resists the flow of current by converting electrical energy into other forms of energy. A device, the resistor, could be a light bulb, transferring electrical energy into heat and light or an electric motor that converts electric energy into mechanical energy. The difference in energy density across a resistor or other electrical device is called voltage drop. In electric circuits (closed loops of wire with resistors and constant voltage sources) energy must be conserved. It follows that changes in energy density, the algebraic sum of voltage drops and voltage sources, around any closed loop will equal zero. In an electric junction there is more than one possible path for current to flow. For charge to be conserved at a junction the current into the junction must equal the current out of the junction. Describe voltage, current and the relationship between current and charge. Students will learn the concepts of voltage and current and the relationship between current and charge. 
Key  Equations 	  I = ??qt ; current is the rate at which charge passes by; the units of current are Amperes (1 A = 1 C/s) 
Guidance 	  Conductors have an effectively infinite supply of charge, so when they are placed in an electric field, a separation of charge occurs. A battery with a potential drop across the ends creates such an electric field; when the ends are connected with a wire, charge will flow across it. The term given to the flow of charge is electric current, and it is measured in Amperes (A)  Coulombs per second. Current is analogous to a river of water, but instead of water flowing, charge does. Current is the number of Coulombs that flow by per second. Thus 1 Amp of current is equivalent to saying that 1 C of electric charge is passing every second (i.e. the rate of change of charge is 1 C/s). Voltage is the electrical energy density (energy divided by charge) and differences in this density (voltage) cause electric current in the circuit. Batteries and power supplies often provide a voltage difference across the ends of a circuit, but other voltage sources exist. Using the water analogy that current is a river, then differences in voltage can be thought of as pipes coming out of a water dam at different heights. The lower the pipe along the dam wall, the larger the water pressure, thus the higher the voltage. If that pipe is connected then current will flow. Current will be larger for the pipe with the greatest pressure (i.e. the lowest pipe on the dam wall). 
Example 1 	  Somehow, you are able to see the electrons passing through a wire as current flows. Over the course of 5 seconds, you count 1.5?1020 electrons pass a single point in the wire. How much charge passed you and the current in the wire? 
Solution 	  We can use the known charge of an electron to answer the first part of this problem. q = 1.5?1020 electrons?1.6?10?19 C/electron q = 24C 
Now we use the equation above to determine the current 	  ?q I = ?t

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Describe the parts of a basic electric circuit and apply Ohms law. Students will learn a basic understanding of electric circuits and how to apply Ohms law. 
Ohms  Law 	  V = IR ; Voltage drop equals current multiplied by resistance. 
Power 	  P = IV ; Power released is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current. 
Guidance 	  Ohms Law is the main equation for electric circuits but it is often misused. In order to calculate the voltage drop across a light bulb use the formula: Vlightbulb = IlightbulbRlightbulb. For the total current flowing out of the power source, you need the total resistance of the circuit and the total voltage: Vtotal = ItotalRtotal. The equations used to calculate the power dissipated in a circuit is P = IV. As with Ohms Law, one must be careful not to mix apples with oranges. If you want the power of the entire circuit, then you multiply the total voltage of the power source by the total current coming out of the power source. If you want the power dissipated (i.e. released) by a light bulb, then you multiply the voltage drop across the light bulb by the current going through that light bulb. Power is the rate that energy is released. The units for power are Watts (W), which equal Joules per second [W] = [J]/[s]. Therefore, a 60 W light bulb releases 60 Joules of energy every second. 
Example 2 	  A small flash light uses a single AA battery which provides a voltage of 1.5 V. If the bulb has a resistance of 2 ?, how much power is dissipated by the light bulb. 
Solution 	  Since the light bulb is the only object in the circuit, we know the voltage drop across the light bulb is equal to that of the battery. Therefore, we can use Ohms law to solve for the current in the resistor. 
V  	  I = Now we can determine the power of the bulb.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Analyze and solve problems involving circuits with resistors in series. Students will learn how to analyze and solve problems involving circuits with resistors in series. Key Equations Rtotal = R1 +R2 +R3 +... 
Guidance 	  Resistors in Series: All resistors are connected end to end. There is only one river, so they all receive the same current. But since there is a voltage drop across each resistor, they may all have different voltages across them. The more resistors in series the more rocks in the river, so the less current that flows. 
Example 1 	  A circuit is wired up with two resistors in series. Both resistors are in the same river, so both have the same current flowing through them. Neither resistor has a direct connection to the power supply so neither has 20V across it. But the combined voltages across the individual resistors add up to 20V. Question: What is the total resistance of the circuit? Answer: The total resistance is Rtotal = R1 +R2 = 90 ?+10 ? = 100 ? Question: What is the total current coming out of the power supply? Answer: Use Ohms Law (V = IR) but solve for current (I =V/R). 
Itotal  	  Question: How much power does the power supply dissipate? Answer: P=IV, so the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total current. Thus, Ptotal =ItotalVtotal = (0.20 A)(20V) = 4.0W. So the Power Supply is outputting 4W (i.e. 4 Joules of energy per second). Question: How much power does each resistor dissipate? Answer: Each resistor has different voltage across it, but the same current. So, using Ohms law, convert the power formula into a form that does not depend on voltage. P = IV = I(IR) = I2R. 
 	  ?Note: If you add up the power dissipated by each resistor, it equals the total power outputted, as it shouldEnergy is always conserved. Question: How much voltage is there across each resistor? Answer: In order to calculate voltage across a resistor, use Ohms law.

Further note that with the voltages we can use the original form of the Power equation (P = IV), and we should get the same results as above.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Analyze and solve problems involving circuits with resistors in parallel. Students will learn how to analyze and solve problems involving circuits with resistors in parallel. Key Equations =	+	+	+... 
Guidance 	  Resistors in Parallel: All resistors are connected together at both ends. There are many rivers (i.e. The main river branches off into many other rivers), so all resistors receive different amounts of current. But since they are all connected to the same point at both ends they all receive the same voltage. 
Example 1 	  A circuit is wired up with 2 resistors in parallel. Both resistors are directly connected to the power supply, so both have the same 20V across them. But they are on different rivers so they have different current flowing through them. Lets go through the same questions and answers as with the circuit in series. Question: What is the total resistance of the circuit? Answer: The total resistance is Rtotal1	= R11 + R12 =  +	 =	 +	 =	 thus, Rtotal =	 = 9? ?Note: Total resistance for a circuit in parallel will always be smaller than smallest resistor in the circuit. Question: What is the total current coming out of the power supply? Answer: Use Ohms Law (V = IR) but solve for current (I =V/R). 
Itotal  	  Question: How much power does the power supply dissipate? Answer: P=IV, so the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total current. Thus, Ptotal =ItotalVtotal = (2.2A)(20V) = 44.4W. So the Power Supply outputs 44W (i.e. 44 Joules of energy per second). Question: How much power is each resistor dissipating? Answer: Each resistor has different current across it, but the same voltage. So, using Ohms law, convert the power formula into a form that does not depend on current. P = IV R VR2 Substituted I = V/R into the power formula. P90? W;P10?

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Apply knowledge on Ohms law, resistors in series and resistors in parallel to understand and solve more complicated resistor circuits. Students will use what they have learned from the previous lessons (ohms law, resistors in series and resistors in parallel) and apply that knowledge to understand and solve more complicated resistor circuits. 
V =  	  P = IV. Rtotal = R1 +R2 +R3 +... =	+	+	+... 
Example 1 	  A more complicated circuit is analyzed. Question: What is the total resistance of the circuit? Answer: In order to find the total resistance we do it in steps (see pictures. First add the 90? and 10? in series to make one equivalent resistance of 100? (see diagram at below). Then add the 100? to the 10? in parallel to get one resistor of 9.1?. Now we have two resistors in series, simply add them to get the total resistance of 29.1?. Question: What is the total current coming out of the power supply? Answer: Use Ohms Law (V = IR) but solve for current (I =V/R). Itotal = RVtotaltotal = 20V/2.91? = 0.69 Amps Question: What is the power dissipated by the power supply? Answer: P=IV, so the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total current. Thus, Ptotal =ItotalVtotal = (0.69A)(20V) = 13.8W. Question: How much power is the 20? resistor dissipating? Answer: The 20? has the full 0.69Amps running through it because it is part of the main river (this is not the case for the other resistors because the current splits). PW Question: If these resistors are light bulbs, order them from brightest to least bright. Answer: The brightness of a light bulb is directly given by the power dissipated. So we could go through each resistor as we did the 20? guy and calculate the power then simply order them. But, we can also think it out. For the guys in parallel the current splits with most of the current going through the 10? path (less resistance) and less going through the 90?+10? path. Well the second path is ten times the resistance of the first, so it will have one tenth of the total current. Thus, there is approximately and 0.069 Amps going through the 90? and 10? path and 0.621Amps going through the 10? path. 
 	  We now know that the 20? is the brightest, 10? is second and then the 90? and last the 10? (-these last two have same current flowing through them, so 90? is brighter due to its higher resistance). ?Note: Adding up these two plus the 9.5W from the 20? resistor gives us 13.8W, which is the total power previously calculated, so we have confidence everything is good.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Define and calculate the efficiency of electrical devices. Students will learn how to properly think about efficiency and how to calculate the efficiency of electrical devices. 
Key  Equations 	  P =V I ; Power in electricity is the voltage multiplied by the current E = P?t ; the electrical energy used is equal to the power dissipated multiplied by the time the circuit is running E f f = PPoutin ; Efficiency is the Power out divided by the Power input Assuming same time periods: E f f = EEoutin = WorkEin 
Guidance 	  Conservation of Energy Electrical Efficiency: Electrical energy is useful to us mostly because it is easy to transport and can be easily converted to or from other forms of energy. Of course, conversion involves waste, typically as heat. Electrical energy consumed can be determined by multiplying power by time (E = P?t). Recall the equations for mechanical and thermal energy/work (PE = mgh,KE = 1/2mv2,Q = mc?T). An important idea is the efficiency of an electrical device: the fraction of electrical energy consumed that goes into doing useful work (Eout/Ein), expressed as a percentage. 
Example 1 	  You use a 100 W electric motor to lift a 10 kg mass 5 m, and it takes 20 s. The electrical energy consumed is Eelec = Pt = (100 W)(20 s) = 2000 J The work done is against gravity, so we use PE = mgh = (10 kg)(10 m/s2)(5 m) = 500 J The efficiency is Eout/Ein = (500 J)/(2000 J) = 0.25 = 25% efficient

Vterminal =  Emf ? Ir 	  The terminal voltage (or output voltage) is equal to the emf (its ideal voltage) minus the voltage drop across the internal resistance. 
Guidance 	  A battery is a voltage source. A battery can be thought of as a perfect voltage source with a small resistor (called internal resistance) in series. The electric energy density produced by the chemistry of the battery is called emf, but the amount of voltage available from the battery is called terminal voltage. The terminal voltage equals the emf minus the voltage drop across the internal resistance (current of the external circuit times the internal resistance). In practice, if you short circuit a battery and measure its voltage you will see the voltage is less than what is marked on it and what it can produce when outputting smaller currents. The short circuit of the battery, makes it pump out a lot of current and then the voltage drop over the internal resistance gets large ( V = Ir ) which in turn reduces the terminal voltage. 
Example 1 	  You have a battery with an EMF of 5 V and an unknown internal resistance. You hook the battery up to a circuit with one 3 ? resistor and measure the current through the resistor to be 1.5 A. What is the internal resistance of the batter and how much power is the batterys resistance dissipating. 
Solution 	  To start this problem well first find the terminal voltage of the battery using the information we know about the resistor. We know the voltage drop across the resistor must be equal to the terminal voltage because there the total change in voltage must be over the whole circuit. 
V =  	  V = 1.5A?3? 
V = 4.5 	  We can plug this value into the equation given above to find the internal resistance. 
Emf ? 	  r =

The  Big  Idea 	  For static electric charges, the electromagnetic force is manifested by the Coulomb electric force alone. If charges are moving, an additional force emerges, called magnetism. The 19th century realization that electricity and magnetism are dual aspects of the same force completely changed our understanding of the world we live in. Insights due to Ampere, Gauss, and Maxwell led to the understanding that moving charges electric currents create magnetic fields. Varying magnetic fields create electric fields. Thus a loop of wire in a changing magnetic field will have current induced in it. This is called electromagnetic induction. Magnetic fields are usually denoted by the letter B and are measured in Teslas, in honor of the Serbian physicist Nikola Tesla. Describe magnetic field lines and how they behave in the situation of permanent magnets and current carrying wires. Calculate the magnetic field at an arbitrary distance from the wire. Students will learn the idea of magnetic field lines, how they behave in the situation of permanent magnets and current carrying wires and also how to calculate the magnetic field at an arbitrary distance from the wire.

Guidance 	  Permanent magnets (like refrigerator magnets) consist of atoms, such as iron, for which the magnetic moments (roughly electron spin) of the electrons are lined up all across the atom. This means that their magnetic fields add up, rather than canceling each other out. The net effect is noticeable because so many atoms have lined up. The magnetic field of such a magnet always points from the north pole to the south. The magnetic field of a bar magnet, for example, is illustrated below: If we were to cut the magnet above in half, it would still have north and south poles; the resulting magnetic field would be qualitatively the same as the one above (but weaker). Charged particles in motion also generate magnetic fields. The most frequently used example is a current carrying wire, since current is literally moving charged particles. The magnitude of a field generated by a wire depends on distance to the wire and strength of the current (I) (see Key Equations section) : Meanwhile, its direction can be found using the so called first right hand rule: point your thumb in the direction of the current. Then, curl your fingers around the wire. The direction your fingers will point in the same direction as the field. Be sure to use your right hand! Sometimes, it is necessary to represent such three dimensional fields on a two dimensional sheet of paper. The following example illustrates how this is done. In the example above, a current is running along a wire towards the top of your page. The magnetic field is circling the current carrying wire in loops which are perpendicular to the page. Where these loops intersect this piece of paper, we use the symbol J to represent where the magnetic field is coming out of the page and the symbol N to represent where the magnetic field is going into the page. This convention can be used for all vector quantities: fields, forces, velocities, etc. 
Example 1 	  You are standing right next to a current carrying wire and decide to throw your magnetic field sensor some distance perpendicular to the wire. When you go to retrieve your sensor, it shows the magnetic field where it landed to be 4?10?5 T. If you know the wire was carrying 300A, how far did you throw the sensor? 
Solution 	  To solve this problem, we will just use the equation given above and solve for the radius. r = 1.5m

B = qv Bsin?	 Force on a  Charged  Particle 	  where q is the charge of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, B is the magnetic field value and ? is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector. Note that for problems where the direction of the particle and the direction of the magnetic field are perpendicular then 
B = qv 	  also, recall that 
Guidance 	  As moving charges create magnetic fields, so they experience forces from magnetic fields generated by other materials. The magnitude of the force experienced by a particle traveling in a magnetic field depends on the charge of the particle (q), the velocity of the particle (v), the strength of the field (B), and, importantly, the angle between their relative directions (?): There is a second right hand rule that will show the direction of the force on a positive charge in a magnetic field: point your index finger along the direction of the particles velocity . If your middle finger points along the magnetic field, your thumb will point in the direction of the force. NOTE: For negative charge reverse the direction of the force (or use your left hand) For instance, if a positively charged particle is moving to the right, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it feels a force going out of the page, while if a positively charged particle is moving to the left, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it feels a force going into the page: 
Example 1:  Find the  Magnetic  Field 	  Question: An electron is moving to the east at a speed of 1.8106 m/s. It feels a force in the upward direction with a magnitude of 2.210?12 N. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field this electron just passed through? Answer: There are two parts to this question, the magnitude of the electric field and the direction. We will first focus on the magnitude. 
To find the magnitude we will use the equation 	  FB = qvBsin? We were given the force of the magnetic field (2.2  10?12 N) and the velocity that the electron is traveling (1.8106 m/s). We also know the charge of the electron (1.610?19 C). Also, because the electrons velocity is perpendicular to the field, we do not have to deal with sin? because sin? of 90 degrees is 1. Therefore all we have to do is solve for B and plug in the known values to get the answer. FB = qvBsin? Solving for B: 
 	  B = qvsin? Now, plugging the known values we have: 
B = qvsin? = 1.610?19  C1.8106 m/s1 = 7.6 	  Now we will find the direction of the field. We know the direction of the velocity (east) and the direction of the force due to the magnetic field (up, out of the page). Therefore we can use the second right hand rule (we will use the left hand, since an electrons charge is negative). Point the pointer finger to the right to represent the velocity and the thumb up to represent the force. This forces the middle finger, which represents the direction of the magnetic field, to point south. Alternatively, we could recognize that this situation is illustrated for a positive particle in the right half of the drawing above; for a negative particle to experience the same force, the field has to point in the opposite direction: south. 
Example 2:  Circular  Motion in  Magnetic  Fields 	  Consider the following problem: a positively charged particle with an initial velocity of, charge q and mass m traveling in the plane of this page enters a region with a constant magnetic field ~B pointing into the page. We are interested in finding the trajectory of this particle. Since the force on a charged particle in a magnetic field is always perpendicular to both its velocity vector and the field vector (check this using the second right hand rule above), a constant magnetic field will provide a centripetal force  that is, a constant force that is always directed perpendicular to the direction of motion. Two such force/velocity combinations are illustrated above. According to our study of rotational motion, this implies that as long as the particle does not leave the region of the magnetic field, it will travel in a circle. To find the radius of the circle, we set the magnitude of the centripetal force equal to the magnitude of the magnetic force and solve for r: mv2 
Fc =	 =  B = qv Bsin? = qv 	  r Therefore, mv2 r = qvB In the examples above, ? was conveniently 90 degrees, which made sin? = 1. But that does not really matter; in a constant magnetic fields a different ? will simply decrease the force by a constant factor and will not change the qualitative behavior of the particle.

Example 2 	  A wire loop and an infinitely long current carrying cable are placed a distance r apart. The infinitely long wire is carrying a current I1 to the left and the loop is carrying a current I2 CCW. The dimensions of the wire loop are shown in the diagram illustrating the situation below. What is the magnitude and direction of the net force on the loop (the mass of the wires are negligible)? 
Solution 	  In this problem, it is best to start by determining the direction of the force on each segment of the loop. Based on the first right hand rule, the magnetic field from the infinite cable points into the page where the loop is. This means that the force on the top segment of the loop will be down toward the bottom of the page, the force on the left segment will be to right, the force on the bottom segment will be toward the top of the page, and the force on the right segment will be to the left. The forces on the left and right segments will balance out because both segments are the same distance from the cable. The forces from the top and bottom section will not balance out because the wires are different distances from the cable. The force on the bottom segment will be stronger than the one on the top segment because the magnetic field is stronger closer to the cable, so the net force on the loop will be up, toward the top of the page. Now we will begin to calculate the forces magnitude by first determining the strength of the magnetic field at the bottom and top segments. All we really have to do is plug in the distances to each segment into the equation we already know for the magnetic field due to a current carrying wire. oI B = oI1 Bbottom = oI1 Btop = Now we will calculate the net force on the loop using the equation given above.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Describe the concept of flux and calculate the induced voltage. Apply Lenz law to determine the direction of the induced current in a loop of wire. Students will learn how to determine the flux and how to calculate the induced voltage. In addition, Students will learn Lenz law and how to use it to determine the direction of the induced current in a loop of wire. Key Equations ?? emf = ? ?t 
Electromagnetic  Flux 	  To understand induction, we need to introduce the concept of electromagnetic flux. If you have a closed, looped wire of area A (measured in m2) and N loops, and you pass a magnetic field B through, the magnetic flux ? is given by the formula below. Again, the relative direction of the loops and the field matter; this relationship is preserved by creating an area vector: a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. The directions influence can then be conveniently captured through a dot product: ? = N~B~A	Electromagnetic Flux The units of magnetic flux are Tm2, also known as Webers(Wb). In the example above, there are four loops of wire (N = 4) and each has area ?r2 (horizontally hashed). The magnetic field is pointing at an angle ? to the area vector. If the magnetic field has magnitude B, the flux through the loops will equal 4cos?B?r2. Think of the magnetic flux as the part of the bundle of magnetic field lines held by the loop that points along the area vector. If the magnetic flux through a loop or loops changes, electrons in the wire will feel a force, and this will generate a current. The induced voltage (also called electromotive force, or emf) that they feel is equal to the change in flux 4? divided by the amount of time 4t that change took. This relationship is called Faradays Law of Induction: ?? emf = ?		Faradays Law of Induction ?t The direction of the induced current is determined as follows: the current will flow so as to generate a magnetic field that opposes the change in flux. This is called Lenzs Law. Note that the electromotive force described above is not actually a force, since it is measured in Volts and acts like an induced potential difference. It was originally called that since it caused charged particles to move  hence electromotive  and the name stuck (its somewhat analogous to calling an increase in a particles gravitational potential energy difference a gravitomotive force). For practical (Ohms Law, etc) purposes it can be treated like the voltage from a battery. Since only a changing flux can produce an induced potential difference, one or more of the variables in equation [5] must be changing if the ammeter in the picture above is to register any current. Specifically, the following can all induce a current in the loops of wire: Changing the direction or magnitude of the magnetic field. Changing the loops orientation or area. Moving the loops out of the region with the magnetic field. 
Example 1 	  You are dragging a circular loop of wire of radius .25 m across a table at a speed of 2 m/s. There is a 2 m long region of the table where there is a constant magnetic field of magnitude 5 T pointed out of the table. As you drag the loop across the table, what will be the induced Emf (a) as the loop enters the field (b) while it is in the field and (c) as it exits the field. 
Solution 	  (a): As the loop enters the field, the flux will start at zero and begin to increase until the loop is entirely inside the field. The flux will increase from 0 Tm2 to some maximum value in the time it takes for the loop to move into the field. We can find this maximum value using the dimensions of the loop and the strength of the magnetic field. The dot product will be equal to one since the area and magnetic field vectors are parallel. ?f = NBA ?f = 1?5T??(.25m)2 ?f = .98Tm2 Since we also know the radius of the loop and the speed at which it is being pulled, we also can find out how long it will take for the loop to move within the magnetic field. d = vt d t = v Now we can find the induced Emf in the loop. ?? Emf = ?t .98Tm2 ?0Tm2 Emf = .25s 
Emf = 3.92 	  (b): There will be no inuduced Emf in the loop once the entire loop is inside the magnetic field because the magnetic flux will not be changing. (c): As the loop exits the magnetic field, the induced Emf will have the same magntiude as when it entered the field except that this time it will be negative because the flux is decreasing.

Key  Equations 	  ?? emf = ?

Example 2 	  To create a simple generator, you are holding a single coil of wire in place on a table. You hold a bar magnet directly above the center of the wire and move it toward the wire and away from the wire repeatedly to create a current in loop. (a) As you bring the bar magnet toward the loop, which direction does the current flow? (b) As you move the magnet away from the loop, which direction does the current flow? 
Solution 	  (a): As you bring the magnet closer to the loop, the magnetic field will increase in strength thus increasing the magnetic flux going into the table through the loop. In order to oppose this change in flux, the induced current will need to create a magnetic field that will point out of the table through the loop. We can use the first right hand rule, starting with the direction of them magnetic field instead of the direction of the current, to determine that the current will need to move in the CCW direction. (b): When you move the magnet away from the loop, the magnetic field will be decreasing thus decreasing the magnetic flux going into the table through the loop. The induced current will need to create a magnetic field that is also pointed into the table through the loop to oppose this change in flux. Again, we use the second right hand rule to find that the current must go in the CW direction.

The  Big  Idea 	  When current flows through wires and resistors in a circuit as a result of a difference in electric potential, charge does not build up significantly anywhere on its path. Capacitors are devices placed in electric circuits where charge can build up. The amount of charge a capacitor can store before it fills up depends on its shape and how much electric potential is applied. The ratio of charge stored in a capacitor to the voltage applied is called its capacitance, measured in Farads (F). The larger the electric potential in volts, the stronger the electric field that is used to cram the charge into the device. Any capacitor will fill up with enough charge. Capacitors store energy when charged, and release it when they discharge. Describe how a capacitor works. Solve basic problems involving the classic two plate capacitor.

 	  For two parallel metal plates, area A, separation d,dielectric ? 
Guidance 	  A capacitor is a device that stores charge. It is typically two very large flat plates wrapped in a cylinder with a dielectric substance in between the two. The dielectric allows the plates to be at a high voltage (and thus store more charge) without arcing between them. The capacitance, literally tells you how much charge it can hold. The capacitance of a capacitor only depends on its geometry. Here some important things to keep in mind in regards to capacitors: Q refers to the amount of positive charge stored on the high voltage side of the capacitor; an equal and opposite amount, ?Q, of negative charge is stored on the low voltage side of the capacitor. Current can flow into a capacitor from either side, but current doesnt flow across the capacitor from one plate to another. The plates do not touch, and the substance in between is insulating, not conducting. One side of the capacitor fills up with negative charge, and the other fills up with positive charge. The reason for the thin, close plates is so that you can use the negative charge on one plate to attract and hold the positive charge on the other plate. The reason for the plates with large areas is so that you can spread out the charge on one plate so that its self-repulsion doesnt stop you from filling it with more charge. Typical dielectric constants ? are roughly 5.6 for glass and 80 for water. What these dielectric substances do is align their electric polarity with the electric field in a capacitor (much like atoms in a magnetic material) and, in doing so, reduces the electric field for a given amount of charge. Thereby allowing for more charge to be stored for a given Voltage. The electrical circuit symbol for a capacitor is two flat plates, mimicking the geometry of a capacitor, which typically consists of two flat plates separated by a small distance. The plates are normally wrapped around several times to form a cylindrical shape. 
Example 1 	  You create a simple capacitor by placing two .25m square metal plates .01m apart and then connecting each plate to one end of a battery. (a) If the battery can create a voltage drop of 12V, how much charge can be stored in the capacitor. (b) If you immersed the whole system in water, how much more charge could you store on the capacitor? 
Solution 	  (a): To solve this problem, we can use the equations give above. First well find the capacitance of the two plates based on their dimensions. Since there is not dielectric between the plates to start, the dielectric constant is 1. ??oA C = d C = .01m C = 5.5?10?11 F Now we can find out how much charge can be stored on the capacitor. 
Q = 6.63?10?10  	  (b): The new capacitance will just be 80x the original capacitance because that is the dielectric constant of water. We can use this to calculate how much charge can be stored on the submerged capacitor. 
Q = 5.31?10?8  	  As you can see, the capacitance of these plates is pretty small. Most capacitors have very thin, but very long metal sheets that are rolled up into a cylinder and separated by only a few millimeters; this provides a much greater capacitance in a much smaller volume.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Describe how energy is stored in a capacitor and calculate said energy. Students learn how energy is stored in a capacitor and how to calculate said energy. 
Key  Equations 	  The electric potential energy, UC, stored in the capacitor is given by 
Guidance 	  Suppose we have two parallel metal plates set a distance d from one another. We place a positive charge on one of the plates and a negative charge on the other. In this configuration, there will be a uniform electric field between the plates pointing from, and normal to, the plate carrying the positive charge. The magnitude of this field is given by 
 	  E = d where V is the potential difference (voltage) between the two plates. The amount of charge, Q, held by each plate is given by 
Q = 	  where again V is the voltage difference between the plates and C is the capacitance of the plate configuration. Capacitance can be thought of as the capacity a device has for storing charge . In the parallel plate case the capacitance is given by ?0A C = d where A is the area of the plates, d is the distance between the plates, and ?0 is the permittivity of free space whose value is 8.8410?12C/V m. The electric field between the capacitor plates stores energy. Where does this energy come from? Recall, that in our preliminary discussion of electric forces we assert that "like charges repel one another". To build our initial configuration we had to place an excess of positive and negative charges, respectively, on each of the metal plates. Forcing these charges together on the plate had to overcome the mutual repulsion that the charges experience; this takes work. The energy used in moving the charges onto the plates gets stored in the field between the plates. It is in this way that the capacitor can be thought of as an energy storage device. This property will become more important when we study capacitors in the context of electric circuits in the next several Concepts. Note: Many home-electronic circuits include capacitors; for this reason, it can be dangerous to mess around with old electronic components, as the capacitors may be charged even if the unit is unplugged. For example, old computer monitors (not flat screens) and TVs have capacitors that hold dangerous amounts of charge hours after the power is turned off. 
Example 1 	  You have a capacitor with capacitance 100nF. If you connected it to a 12V battery, how much energy is stored in the capacitor when it is fully charged? If you were to submerge this capacitor in water, how much energy could be stored in it? 
Solution 	  Well just use the equation given above to calculate the energy stored on the capacitor. 
Uc = 6?10?7  	  By adding a dielectric, we increase the capacitance of the capacitor by a factor of the dielectric constant. The dielectric constant of water is 80, so the new capacitance will be 80 times the original capacitance.

Guidance 	  Capacitors in parallel have the same voltage, but different charge stored. Capacitors in series have the same charge stored, but different voltages. Remember that if a capacitor are hooked up to the battery they will have the same voltage as the battery. If the capacitor is unhooked from a battery and other capacitors are attached to it, then the voltage can change but the total amount of charge must remain constant. Charge conservation holds that charge can not be created or destroyed. When solving problems involving capacitor circuits, we use the equation for the charge on a capacitor much like we use Ohms Law.

Solution 	  (a): To find the total capacitance, well use the equation give above for determining the equivalent capacitance of capacitors in series. =	+ =	+ 
Ctotal = 37.5 	  (b): Since charge is the same across capacitors in series, we can use the charge found using the total capacitance and the total voltage drop to find the charge in the C1 capacitor.

Solution 	  (a): To find the total capacitance, well us the equation given above for capacitors in parallel.

Example 1 	  In the circuit diagram shown above, the resistor has a value of 100 ? and the capacitor has a capacitance of 500 F.

Capacitors in parallel add like resistors in series 	  =	+	+	+... 
Guidance 	  When a capacitor is placed in a circuit, current does not actually travel across it. Rather, equal and opposite charge begins to build up on opposite sides of the capacitor  mimicking a current  until the electric field in the capacitor creates a potential difference across it that balances the voltage drop across any parallel resistors or the voltage source itself (if there are no resistors in parallel with the capacitor). The ratio of charge on a capacitor to potential difference across it is called capacitance. It is important to break down a complicated circuit into the equivalent capacitance using the rules for capacitors in series and capacitors in parallel. Also remember that capacitors in parallel have the same voltage while capacitors in series have the same charge. 
Example 1 	  In the circuit shown below, determine (a) the total capacitance and (b) the total charge stored. 
Solution 	  (a): In solving this problem, well call the 20 F capacitor C1, the 60 F capacitor C2, the 40 F capacitor C3, and the 100 F capacitor C4. Our first step will be to find the equivalent capacitance of C2 and C3. Next, well combine the capacitance of C2,3 and C4. 
C2,3,4 = 24  F+100  	  C2,3,4 = 124 F Finally, we can combine C2,3,4 with C1 to find the total capacitance.

The  Big  Idea 	  Light is a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields. Light waves are caused by disturbances in an electromagnetic field, like the acceleration of charged particles (such as electrons). Light has a dual nature; at times, it acts like waves, while at other times it acts like particles, called photons. Light travels through space at the maximum speed allowed by the laws of physics, called the speed of light. Light has no mass, but it carries energy and momentum. Fermats principle states that light will always take the path that takes the least amount of time (not distance). Fermats Principle governs the paths light will take and explains the familiar phenomena of reflection, refraction, diffraction, scattering and color absorption and dispersion. Light rarely travels in a straight line path. When photons interact with electrons in matter, the time it takes for this interaction determines the path. For example, higher frequency blue light is refracted more than red because blue interacts more frequently with electrons. Also, the path of least time is achieved when blue light bends more than red light so that it gets out of the slow region faster. Fermats Principle explains the many fascinating phenomena of light from rainbows to sunsets to the halos around the moon. Define the speed of light and a light year. Solve problems involving light. Students will gain an understanding of the speed of light and work problems involving light. The distance of a light year is also explained and practiced. 
Key  Equations 	  D = ct; distance is equal to the speed of light multiplied by the time it has traveled 
Guidance 	  Light travels at 3108m/s. We call this value c. Light can never travel at any other speed. Although when light travels through materials, due to scattering and absorption it appears that light is going slightly slower (see refraction lesson for more detail). A light year is the amount of distance light covers in a time of one year. The value of one light year is simply the speed of light multiplied by the number of seconds in a year and is roughly equal to 9.41015m . Viewing distant stars is looking back in time. The stars we see are many thousands of light years away, which means the light takes many thousands of years to reach us. Thus the stars we see in the sky are how they looked thousands of years ago. 
Example 1 	  Question How long after texting your friend on Mars will he receive it? Answer Mars is a distance of 3.11011m. Thus, using the equation t	= 1033 seconds or about 17 minutes. a. Using the speed of light as c calculate the earth-sun distance in m, then convert it to miles (one mile = b. The nearest galaxy to our Milky Way is the Andromeda Galaxy, 2 million light years away. How far away is the Andromeda Galaxy in miles? a. How far is it in light years? b. If the galaxy were to disappear, how long until we notice it vanish on Earth? Centauri, 4 LY away. Some distant quasars are 2 billion LY away. Why do astronomers say that to look at these distant objects is to look back in time? Explain briefly. 
Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Describe how our eye detects color and how color addition works. Students will learn how our eye detects color and how color addition works. Reflection and transmission of color in various situations is also covered. 
Color  Addition 	  TABLE 16.1: 
Guidance 	  White light consists of a mixture of all the visible colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (ROYGBIV). Our perception of the color black is tied to the absence of light. Our eyes include color-sensitive and brightness-sensitive cells. The three different color-sensitive cells (cones) can have sensitivity in three colors: red, blue, and green. Our perception of other colors is made from the relative amounts of each color that the cones register from light reflected from the object we are looking at. Our brightness-sensitive cells (rods) work well in low light. This is why things look black and white at night. The chemical bonds in pigments and dyes like those in a colorful shirt absorb light at frequencies that correspond to certain colors. When you shine white light on these pigments and dyes, some colors are absorbed and some colors are reflected. We only see the colors that objects reflect. Beautiful sunsets are another manifestation of Rayleigh scattering that occurs when light travels long distances through the atmosphere. The blue light and some green is scattered away, making the sun appear red. 
Example 1 	  Question: In a dark room a blue light is shined on a magenta shirt what color does it appear? How about a yellow shirt? Answer: Since magenta is the combination of red and blue and only blue light is available to be reflected, the shirt will appear blue. As for the yellow shirt, there is no blue light in yellow (yellow is the combination of red and green), thus the shirt will appear black since no light is reflected off it.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Define what an electromagnetic wave is. Solve problems involving basic properties of electromagnetic waves. Students will learn what an electromagnetic wave is, gain a feel for the main parts of the spectrum and work problems involving basic properties of electromagnetic waves. Key Equations c = f? ; Wave equation for light c = 3108m/s The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation can be roughly broken into the following ranges: TABLE 16.2: 
Comparison size 	  gamma-ray (?? ray) atomic nucleus x?ray hydrogen atom ultraviolet (UV) small molecule violet (visible) ? 410?7 m(400 nm)? typical molecule blue (visible) ? 450 nm typical molecule green (visible) ? 500 nm typical molecule red (visible) ? 650 nm typical molecule infrared (IR) human hair microwave human finger radio 
Larger than 10 cm 	  car antenna 
Example 1 	  Which has a higher frequency, green light or microwaves? 
Answer 	  Green light has a higher frequency than microwaves. It is possible to calculate it, but since the speed of an electromagnetic wave is constant we know that waves with higher wavelengths must have a lower frequency based on the wave equation. 
Example 2 	  Calculate the frequency for an ultraviolet wave of wavelength 10?7 m and compare it to the frequency of a radio wave (about 3?109 Hz). Which type of wave do you think takes more energy to generate? 
Solution 	  Well use the wave equation to determine the wave length of ultraviolet light. c = f? c f f =	10?7 m f = 3?1014 Hz The oscillating charged particles that create UV light are vibrating much more violently than the ones that create radio waves so they take more energy to generate.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Describe total internal reflection and the critical angle. Derive the critical angle and solve for it in real life applications. Students will learn about total internal reflection. More specifically, they will learn what the critical angle is, how it is derived and how to solve for it in real life applications. Key Equations ?C = sin?1 nn12 ; where ?C is the critical angle, n1 is the index of refraction of the material where the light emanates from and n2 is the index of the material outside. 
Example 1 	  You have some unknown material and you would like to determine its index of refraction. You find that you are able to create total internal reflection when the material submerged in water, but not when submerged in cooking oil. (a) Can you give a range for the index of refraction? (b) you are able to determine the critical angle in water to be 71.8 degrees; what is the index of refraction of this material? 
Solution 	  (a): Since it is not possible to create total internal refraction when going from a material with a higher index of refraction to a lower index of refraction, we know that the index of refraction of this material must be between 1.33 (water) and 1.53 (cooking oil). (b): We can use the equation given above to determine the index of refraction of the unknown material. ?1	2 ?c = sin	(	) n1 = sin(?c) n n1 = 1.40

Answers 	  a. 49.7? b. No such angle c. 48.8? Describe how light reflects off various types of mirrors. Students will learn how light reflects off mirrors. Flat mirrors, concave mirrors and convex mirrors are all covered. Key Equations =	+ f	do	di ; The lens makers equation Where f is the focal length of the mirror, do is the distance of the object from the mirror and di is the distance the image is formed from the mirror. ?di M = d0 The size of an objects image is larger (or smaller) than the object itself by its magnification, M. The level of magnification is proportional to the ratio of di and do. An image that is double the size of the object would have magnification M = 2. 
R = 2f 	  The radius of curvature of a mirror is twice its focal length 
Guidance 	  Mirrors are made from highly reflective metal that is applied to a curved or flat piece of glass. Converging mirrors can be used to focus light headlights, telescopes, satellite TV receivers, and solar cookers all rely on this principle. Converging mirrors (also known as concave mirrors) are curved towards the incoming light and focus parallel rays at the focal point. Diverging mirrors (also known as convex mirrors) are curved away from the incoming light and do not focus, but scatter the light instead. The focal length, f, of a lens or mirror is the distance from the surface of the lens or mirror to the place where the light is focused. This is called the focal point or focus. For diverging mirrors, there is no true focal point (i.e. real light does not focus), so the focal length is negative. When light rays converge in front of a mirror, a real image is formed. Real images are useful in that you can place photographic film at the physical location of the real image, expose the film to the light, and make a two-dimensional representation of the world, a photograph. When light rays diverge in front of a mirror, a virtual image is formed. A virtual image is formed by your brain tracing diverging rays backwards and is kind of a trick, like the person you see behind a mirrors surface when you brush your teeth (theres obviously no real light focused behind a mirror!). Since virtual images arent actually anywhere, you cant place photographic film anywhere to capture them. Real images are upside-down, or inverted. You can make a real image of an object by putting it farther from a mirror or lens than the focal length. Virtual images are typically right-side-up. You can make virtual images by moving the mirror or lens closer to the object than the focal length. In the problems below that consider converging or diverging mirrors, you will do a careful ray tracing with a ruler (including the extrapolation of rays for virtual images). It is best if you can use different colors for the three different ray tracings. When sketching diverging rays, you should use dotted lines for the extrapolated lines behind a mirror in order to produce the virtual image. When comparing measured distances and heights to calculated distances and heights, values within 10% are considered good. Use the Table (16.5) as your guide. TABLE 16.4: 
Converging mirrors 	  ( concave) Ray #1: Leaves tip of candle, travels parallel to optic axis, reflects back through focus. Ray #2: Leaves tip, travels through focus, reflects back parallel to optic axis. Ray #3: Leaves tip, reflects off center of mirror with an angle of reflection equal to the angle of incidence. 
Diverging mirrors 	  ( convex) Ray #1: Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, reflects OUTWARD by lining up with focus on the OPPOSITE side as the candle. Ray #2: Leaves tip, heads toward the focus on the OPPOSITE side, and emerges parallel to the optic axis. Ray #3: Leaves tip, heads straight for the mirror center, and reflects at an equal angle. 
Example 1 	  In the situation illustrated below, the object is set up .5 m away from a converging mirror. If the focal length of the lens is .2 m, determine (a) the location of the real image, and (b) the magnification of the image. 
Solution 	  (a): In order to determine the location of the image, well use the lens makers equation. 1 di = .33 m (b): Now that we have the location of the image, we can find the magnification. ?di M = do ?.33 m M = .5 m

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Describe how light behaves when passing through converging and diverging lenses. Use ray tracing diagrams and calculate image distances and magnification using the lens makers equation. Students will learn how light behaves when passing through converging and diverging lenses. Students will also learn how to do ray tracing diagrams and calculate image distances and magnification using the lens makers equation. Key Equations =	+ f	do	di ; The lens makers equation Where f is the focal length of the lens, do is the distance of the object from the lens and di is the distance the image is formed from the lens. ?di M = d0 The size of an objects image is larger (or smaller) than the object itself by its magnification, M. The level of magnification is proportional to the ratio of di and do. An image that is double the size of the object would have magnification M = 2. 
Guidance 	  For lenses, the distance from the center of the lens to the focus is f. Focal lengths for foci behind the lens are positive in sign. The distance from the center of the lens to the object in question is d0, where distances to the left of the lens are positive in sign. The distance from the center of the lens to the image is di. This number is positive for real images (formed to the right of the lens), and negative for virtual images (formed to the left of the lens). Lenses, made from curved pieces of glass, focus or de-focus light as it passes through. Lenses that focus light are called converging lenses, and these are the ones used to make telescopes and cameras. Lenses that de-focus light are called diverging lenses. Lenses can be used to make visual representations, called images. The focal length, f, of a lens or mirror is the distance from the surface of the lens to the place where the light is focused. This is called the focal point or focus. For diverging lenses, the focal length is negative. For converging lens, one can find the focal point by simply holding a piece of paper near the lens until a distant image is formed. The distance from the paper to the lens is the focal point. When light rays converge behind a lens, a real image is formed. Real images are useful in that you can place photographic film at the physical location of the real image, expose the film to the light, and make a two-dimensional representation of the world, a photograph. When light rays diverge behind a lens, a virtual image is formed.

Converging lenses 	  ( convex) Ray #1: Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, refracts and travels through to the focus. Ray #2: Leaves tip, travels through focus on same side, travels through lens, and exits lens parallel to optic axis on opposite side. Ray #3: Leaves tip, passes straight through center of lens and exits without bending. 
Diverging lenses 	  ( concave) Ray #1: Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, refracts OUTWARD by lining up with focus on the SAME side as the candle. Ray #2: Leaves tip, heads toward the focus on the OPPOSITE side, and emerges parallel from the lens. Ray #3: Leaves tip, passes straight through the center of lens and exits without bending. 
Example 1 	  You have a converging lens of focal length 2 units. If you place an object 5 units away from the lens, (a) draw a ray diagram of the situation to estimate where the image will be and (b) list the charactatistics of the image. Finally (c) calculate the position of the image. A diagram of the situation is shown below. 
Solution 	  (a): To draw the ray diagram, well follow the steps laid out above for converging lenses. First we draw the a ray that travels parallel to the principle axis and refracts through the focus on the other side (the red ray). Next we draw a ray through the focus on the same side that refracts out parallel (the green ray). Finally we draw the ray that travels straight through the center of the lens without refracting (the blue ray). The result is shown below. (b): Based on the ray diagram and the initial position of the object, we know that the image is a real, inverted, and smaller than the original object. (c): To calculate the exact position of the object, we can use the lens makers equation. 1 di = 3.33 units

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Explain the diffraction of light and the interference patterns that are produced through constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Calculate diffraction pattern spacing or work backwards to calculate the wavelength of light emitted. Students will learn about diffraction of light and the interference patterns that are produced through constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Students will also learn to calculate diffraction pattern spacing or work backwards to calculate the wavelength of light emitted. Key Equations m? = dsin? Double slit interference maxima. m is the order of the interference maximum in question, d is the distance between slits. and ? is the angular position of the maximum. m? = dsin? Single slit interference maxima. m and ? are defined as above and d is the width of the slit. m? = dsin? Diffraction grating interference maxima. m and ? are defined as above and d is the distance between the lines on the grating. m? = 2nd Thin film interference: n is the index of refraction of the film, d is the thickness of the film, and m is an integer. In the film interference, there is a ?/2 delay (phase change) if the light is reflected from an object with an index of refraction greater than that of the incident material. =	+ f	d0	di 
Example 1 	  A typical experimental setup for an interference experiment will look something like this: Recall: for constructive interference we require a path difference of m? = dsin? d = spacing of slits m = number of maximum (i.e. m = 0 is the central maximum, m = 1 is the 1st maximum and thus the first dot to the right and lef L = distance form diffraction grating to screen ?y = distance from nth spot out from the center (if m = 1 then it is the 1st spot) Definitions: 
Minimum = place where waves destructively interfere 	  Because the screen distance L is much larger than the slit distance d, one can see that ?y L = tan? ? sin?. Thus, the condition for a first maximum becomes ? = dsin? = d?Ly One can now easily calculate where the first maximum should appear if given the wavelength of the laser light, the distance to the screen and the distance between slits. First Maximum: ?y = Ld? 
Example 2 	  White light (which is comprised of all wavelengths and thus all colors) separates into a rainbow pattern as shown below. Each wavelength of light has a unique interference pattern given by the equation above. Thus all the wavelengths (i.e. colors) have a unique ?y based on the equation given at the end of Example 1. This is how white light separates out into its individual wavelengths producing a rainbow after going through a diffraction grating.

The  Big  Idea 	  In studying fluids we apply the concepts of force, momentum, and energy which we have learned previously to new phenomena. Since fluids are made from a large number of individual molecules, we have to look at their behavior as an ensemble and not individually. For this reason, we use the concept of conservation of energy density in place of conservation of energy. Energy density is energy divided by volume. Newtonian fluids (the normal type and only type we deal with here) are non-compressible. This leads to Pascals and Archimedes Principles discussed below. Define the Buoyant force and calculate problems involving buoyancy and Archimedes principle. Students will learn about the Buoyant force, how to calculate problems involving buoyancy and Archimedes principle. 
Guidance 	  Archimedes Principle states that the upward buoyant force on an object in the water is equal to the weight of the displaced volume of water. The reason for this upward force is that the bottom of the object is at lower depth, and therefore higher pressure, than the top. If an object has a higher density than the density of water, the weight of the displaced volume will be less than the objects weight, and the object will sink. Otherwise, the object will float. The ratio of an object or substances density to the density of water is called its specific gravity. 
Example 1 	  A simple boat (really a metal box with an open top) is floating at rest in a pond. The boat is 3 m long, 2 m wide, and has walls 1.5 m high and has an empty mass of 500 kg. If you begin filling the boat with gravel of density 1922 kg/m3 at a constant rate of .1 m3/s, how long will it be before your boat sinks? 
Solution 	  To solve this problem, were going to start out by determining the maximum mass that the boat can support. The weight of the maximum mass is equal to the buoyant force when the boat is submerged all the way up the the edge of the side wall. mg = Fbuoy mg = ?watergV m = ?waterV m = 1000 kg/m3 ?3 m?2 m?1.5 m m = 9000 kg Now we need to convert the rate at which sand is being added from m3/s to kg/s. m3	kg .1  ?1922  = 192.2 kg/s s	m3 Now, we can set up something that resembles a linear equation where the 192.2 kg/s is m, t is x, the empty weight of the boat is b, and the maximum weight of the boat is y. t =

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Define pressure and solve pressure problems in the context of fluids. Students will learn about pressure and solving pressure problems in the context of fluids. F P = 
Guidance 	  The pressure of a fluid is a measure of the forces exerted by a large number of molecules when they collide and bounce off its boundary. The unit of pressure is the Pascal (Pa). In a fluid at rest, pressure increases linearly with depth  this is due to the weight of the water above it. Pascals Principle reminds us that, for a fluid of uniform pressure, the force exerted on a small area in contact with the fluid will be smaller than the force exerted on a large area. Thus, a small force applied to a small area in a fluid can create a large force on a larger area. This is the principle behind hydraulic machinery. Liquids obey a continuity equation which is based on the fact that liquids are very difficult to compress. This means that the total volume of a fluid will remain constant in most situations. Imagine trying to compress a filled water balloon! 
Example 1 	  A weather balloon is ascending through the atmosphere. If the density of air is 1.2 kg/m3 and atmospheric pressure at sea level is 101.3 kPa, then what is the pressure on the balloon at (a) 100 m above the ground, (b) 500 m above the ground, and (c) 1000 m above the ground? 
Solution 	  For all parts of these problems, well be using the equation for pressure given above where the atmospheric pressure at sea level is Po. (a): 
P = 100.12 k Pa 	  (b): 
P = 95.4 k Pa 	  (c):

The  Big  Ideas 	  Heat is a form of energy transfer. It can change the kinetic energy of a substance. For example, the average molecular kinetic energy of gas molecules is related to temperature. A heat engine turns a portion of the input heat (thermal energy) into mechanical work. A second portion of the input heat must be exhausted in order for the engine to have repetitive motion. Therefore, in a practical engine it is impossible for all the input heat to be converted to work. Entropy is a measure of disorder, or the variety of ways in which a system can organize itself with the same total energy. The entropy of any isolated system always tends to disorder (i.e. entropy is always increasing). In the universe, the entropy of a subset (like evolution on Earth) can decrease (i.e. more order) but the total entropy of the universe is increasing (i.e. more disorder). Thermodynamics is the study of heat engines. Any engine or power plant obeys the laws of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics is a statement of conservation of energy. Total energy, including heat, is conserved in any process and in the complete cycle of a heat engine. The second law of thermodynamics as it applies to heat engines gives an absolute limit on the efficiency of any heat engine that goes through repetitious cycles. Explain the concept of temperature, where it comes from and how it relates to our everyday world. Students will learn the concept of temperature, where it comes from and how it relates to our everyday world. 
Eavg =mv2avg = k 	  The average kinetic energy of atoms (each of mass m and average speed v) in a gas is related to the temperature T of the gas, measured in Kelvin. The Boltzmann constant k is a constant of nature, equal to 1.3810?23 J/K 
Guidance 	  When an object feels cold to the touch, it is because heat is flowing from you to the object. When an object feels hot to the touch, it is because heat is flowing from the object to you. Some objects (like metals) conduct heat better than others (like wood). Thus if you stick a metal rod in the fireplace and hold the other end, the heat is conducted well and you get burned. On the other hand, if you place a wood stick in the fire and hold the other end youll be OK. The temperature of a gas is a measure of the amount of average kinetic energy that the atoms in the gas possess. If you heat something, you increase its internal energy, so you increase the movement of molecules that make up this thing, thus it expands. This is called heat expansion; most everything expands as heated and contracts as cooled. Most materials expand as they are heated. This can cause bridges to collapse if they are not designed to have a place to expand in the summer months (like the placing of metal teeth at intervals on the Golden Gate Bridge). Water contracts from 0?C to 4?C and then expands from 4?C to 100?C. Remembering that density is mass divided by volume explains why water at 4?C is more dense than water below and above 4?C. This also explains why lakes freeze on the top first and not throughout. As the water on the top of the lake drops below 4?C, it is now more dense than the water below it, thus it sinks to the bottom, allowing the warmer water to rise up to the top and cool down in the winter weather. Only when the entirety of the lake is at 4?C, then the lake can start to freeze. It freezes from the top down, because water below 4?C is less dense than water at 4?C. More than 50% of the water rise expected from global warming is due to the thermal expansion of water There are 3 different temperature scales you should know-the Kelvin scale, the Celsius scale and the Fahrenheit scale. The Kelvin scale (K) is the one used in most scientific equations and has its zero value set at absolute zero (the theoretical point at which all motion stops). The Celsius scale (?C) is the standard SI temperature scale. It is equal to the Kelvin scale if you minus 273 from the Celsius reading. Water has a boiling point of 100?C and a freezing point of 0?C. The Fahrenheit scale (?F) is the English system and the one we are familiar with. Newtons Law of Cooling: The rate of heat transfer is proportional to the difference in temperature between the two objects. For example, hot liquid that is put in the freezer will cool much faster than a room temperature liquid that is put in the same freezer. 
Kinetic  Theory of  Gases 	  According to classical kinetic theory, temperature is always proportional to the average kinetic energy of molecules in a substance. The constant of proportionality, however, is not always the same. Consider: the only way to increase the kinetic energies of the atoms in a mono-atomic gas is to increase their translational velocities. Accordingly, we assume that the kinetic energies of such atoms are stored equally in the three components (x,y, and z) of their velocities. On the other hand, other gases  called diatomic  consist of two atoms held by a bond. This bond can be modeled as a spring, and the two atoms and bond together as a harmonic oscillator. Now, a single molecules kinetic energy can be increased either by increasing its speed, by making it vibrate in simple harmonic motion, or by making it rotate around its center of mass. This difference is understood in physics through the concept of degrees of freedom: each degree of freedom for a molecule or particle corresponds to a possibility of increasing its kinetic energy independently of the kinetic energy in other degrees. It might seem that monatomic gases should have one degree of freedom: their velocity. They have three because their velocity can be altered in one of three mutually perpendicular directions without changing the kinetic energy in other two  just like a centripetal force does not change the kinetic energy of an object, since it is always perpendicular to its velocity. These are called translational degrees of freedom. Diatomic gas molecules, on the other hand have more: the three translational explained above still exist, but there are now also vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Monatomic and diatomic degrees of freedom can be illustrated like this: Temperature is an average of kinetic energy over degrees of freedom, not a sum. Lets try to understand why this is in reference to our monoatomic ideal gas. In the derivation above, volume was constant; so, temperature was essentially proportional to pressure, which in turn was proportional to the kinetic energy due to translational motion of the molecules. If the molecules had been able to rotate as well as move around the box, they could have had the same kinetic energy with slower translational velocities, and, therefore, lower temperature. In other words, in that case, or assumption that the kinetic energy of the atoms only depends on their velocities, implied between equations [2] and [3], would not have held. Therefore, the number of degrees of freedom in a substance determines the proportionality between molecular kinetic energy and temperature: the more degrees of freedom, the more difficult it will be to raise its temperature with a given energy input. This is why it takes so long to boil water but so little time to heat up a piece of metal with the same mass. A note about the above discussion: Since the objects at the basis of our understanding of thermodynamics are atoms and molecules, quantum effects can make certain degrees of freedom inaccessible at specific temperature ranges. Unlike most cases in your current physics class, where these can be ignored, in this case, quantum effects can make an appreciable difference. For instance, the vibrational degrees of freedom of diatomic gas molecules discussed above are, for many gases, inaccessible in very common conditions, although we do not have the means to explain this within our theory. In fact, this was one of the first major failures of classical physics that ushered in the revolutionary discoveries of the early 20th century.

Solution 	  To do this conversion, well just use the equation given above. 
Example 2 	  The mass of a neon atom is 3.34?10?26 kg. If the temperature of the neon atom 100 K, what is its average velocity?

Students will also learn to solve problems involving specific heat and phase change. 
Key  Equations 	  Q = mc?T ; the heat gained or lost is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its specific heat multiplied by the change of its temperature.

Guidance 	  The amount of heat capacitance (and thus its specific heat value) is related to something called degrees of freedom, which basically says how free is the object to move in different ways (and thus how much kinetic energy can it store inside itself without breaking apart). For example, solids have a more fixed structure, so they cannot rotate and jostle as much, so they cant store as much internal energy so they have lower heat capacitance then liquids. Specific heat is similar to heat capacitance, but is a specific number. The specific heat tells you how much energy one must put in per unit mass in order to raise the temperature 1?C. Phase changes: it takes energy to changes phases from a solid to a liquid and from a liquid to a gas. The substance releases energy when changing phase from gas to liquid or from liquid to solid. How much energy per unit mass depends on the substance in question. When you get out of the shower you often feel cold. This is because the water on you is evaporating, and heat is flowing from you to the water droplets in order for them to change phase from water to gas. You are losing heat and thus feel cold. A calorie is a unit of energy. The food Calorie, with a capital C, is actually 1,000 calories (a kcal). Thus, for example, a snicker bar labeled with 200 Cal is actually 200,000 cal. Food calories are determined by burning the food and measuring the heat released. During a phase change, the number of degrees of freedom changes, and so does the specific heat capacity. Heat capacity can also depend on temperature within a given phase, but many substances, under constant pressure, exhibit a constant specific heat over a wide range of temperatures. For instance, look at the graph of temperature vs heat input for a mole (6.02214151023 molecules) of water at URL e:Energy_thru_phase_changes.png . Note that the x-axis of the graph is called relative heat energy because it takes a mole of water at 0 degrees Celsius as the reference point. The sloped segments on the graph represent increases in temperature. The flat segments represent phase transitions, governed by equation for latent heat. Notice that the sloped segments have constant, though different, slopes. According to this equation, the heat capacity at any particular phase would be the slope of the segment that corresponds to that phase on the graph. The fact that the slopes are constant means that, within a particular phase, the heat capacity does not change significantly as a function of temperature. Heat capacity is the amount of internal energy that the substance can store. A large heat capacitance means the substance can store a lot of internal energy and thus the temperature changes slowly. Aluminum foil has a small heat capacitance and water has a large one. 
Example 1 	  A 500 g piece of aluminum metal of unknown temperature is thrown into a cup containing 500 g of water which had an initial temperature of 20?C. If the final temperature of both the aluminum and the water was 25?C, what was the starting temperature of the metal? Use the table above to find the specific heat of water and aluminum. 
Solution 	  The key to this problem is connecting it with conservation of energy. The energy that went into heating up the water must have come from heat stored in the metal. Therefore, we know that the change in energy of the water is equal to however much energy the aluminum lost when it was put into the water. When solving this problem, well call the energy of the aluminum QA and the energy of the water Qw. ??QA = ?Qw	start with conservation of energy ?mAcA?TA = mwcw?Tw	substitute in the values for each energy term based on the equation giv mwcw?Tw

Answers 	  Explain the basics of pressure and force, how pressure varies with altitude in our atmosphere, and the ideal gas law. Students will learn the basics of pressure and force, how pressure varies with altitude in our atmosphere, and the ideal gas law, which connects the concepts of volume, pressure, temperature, and the number of particles that compose a gas. 
Key  Equations 	  P = F/A	pressure equals the force divided by the area of application ?h 
V =  Nk T	 Ideal  Gas  Law 	  An ideal gas is a gas where the atoms are treated as point-particles and assumed to never collide or interact with each other. If you have N molecules of such a gas at temperature T and volume V, the pressure can be calculated from this formula. Note that k = 1.3810?23 J/K 
Guidance 	  The pressure of a gas is the force the gas exerts on a certain area. For a gas in a container, the amount of pressure is directly related to the number and intensity of atomic collisions on a container wall. An ideal gas is a gas for which interactions between molecules are negligible, and for which the gas atoms or molecules themselves store no potential energy. For an ideal gas, the pressure, temperature, and volume are simply related by the ideal gas law. Atmospheric pressure (1 atm = 101,000 Pascals) is the pressure we feel at sea level due to the weight of the atmosphere above us. As we rise in elevation, there is less of an atmosphere to push down on us and thus less pressure. 
Example 1 	  How many molecules of gas does it take to equalize the pressure inside a 1 liter box, that originally starts with no gas inside, with the atmospheric pressure at room temperature (300 K)? 
Solution 	  To solve this problem, we just plug in the given values into the ideal gas law.

Guidance 	  Heat engines transform input heat into work in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, as we learned in the previous Concept, increasing the temperature of a gas at constant volume will increase its pressure. This pressure can be transformed into a force that moves a piston. The mechanics of various heat engines differ but their fundamentals are quite similar and involve the following steps: A single cycle of such an engine can be illustrated as follows: In effect, such an engine allows us to siphon off part of the heat flow between the heat source and the heat sink. The efficiency of such an engine is define as the ratio of net work performed to input heat; this is the fraction of heat energy converted to mechanical energy by the engine: 
 	  e =		Efficiency of a heat engine 
Qi 	  If the engine does not lose energy to its surroundings (of course, all real engines do), then this efficiency can be rewritten as 
Qi ? Qo 	  e =		Efficiency of a lossless heat engine 
Qi 	  An ideal engine, the most efficient theoretically possible, is called a Carnot Engine. Its efficiency is given by the following formula, where the temperatures are, respectively, the temperature of the exhaust environment and the temperature of the heat input, in Kelvins. In a Carnot engine heat is input and exhausted in isothermal cycles, and the efficiency is ? = 1?

The Stirling engine is a real life heat engine that has a cycle similar to the theoretical Carnot cycle. The Stirling engine is very efficient compared to a gasoline engine and could become an important player in todays world where green energy and efficiency will reign supreme. 
Example 1 	  Question:A heat engine operates at a temperature of 650K. The work output is used to drive a pile driver, which is a machine that picks things up and drops them.

The  Big  Ideas 	  Einstein believed that the laws of physics do not depend on the how fast you are moving through space: every reference frame sees the same world of physics. In other words, if you are on a moving train and drop a ball or if you are standing on a farm and drop a ball, the physics that describe the motion of that ball will be the same. Einstein realized that the speed of light, c, should depend only on the laws of physics that describe light as electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, Einstein made the bold assertion that light always travels at the same speed, no matter how fast you are moving with respect to the source of light. Consider for a moment how counterintuitive this concept really is. This is the theoretical underpinning of Einsteins theory of Special Relativity, one of the most successfully predictive theories of physics ever formulated. The most important consequence of this new understanding is that our intuition that time moves at the same rate for everyone (whether standing still or moving at a fast speed) is WRONG. In fact, the rate at which time passes depends on your speed. Since Einsteins work in the early part of the 20th century, this fact has been demonstrated many times by experiments in particle accelerators and through the use of atomic clocks aboard fast moving jet airplanes. The effect is only noticeable at extremely fast speeds, thus the normal laws of motion apply in all but the most extreme cases. Einstein was finally led to believe that the very fabric of space and time must have a more active and influential role in the laws of physics than had previously been believed. Eventually, Einstein became convinced that gravity itself amounted to no more than a curvature in spacetime. This theory is called General Relativity. Describe what is meant by time dilation in relativity theory. Solve relative time problems. Students will learn what is meant by time dilation in relativity theory and how to solve relative time problems. Key Equations v ? = c An object moving with speed v has a dimensionless speed ? calculated by dividing the speed v by the speed of light (c = 3108 m/s). 0 ? ? ? 1. The dimensionless Lorentz gamma factor ? can be calculated from the speed, and tells you how much time dilation or length contraction there is. 1 ? ? ? ?. 
T0 = ? 	  If a moving object experiences some event which takes a period of time T (say, the amount of time between two heart beats), and the object is moving towards or away from you with Lorentz gamma factor ?, the period of time T0 measured by you will appear longer. 
Guidance 	  The speed of light will always be measured to be the same (about 3108 m/s) regardless of your motion towards or away from the source of light. In order for this bizarre fact to be true, we must reconsider what we mean by space, time, and related concepts, such as the concept of simultaneous events. (Events which are seen as simultaneous by one observer might appear to occur at different times to an observer moving with a different velocity. Note that both observers see the same laws of physics, just a different sequence of events.) Clocks moving towards or away from you run more slowly, and objects moving towards or away from you shrink in length. These are known as Lorentz time dilation and length contraction; both are real, measured properties of the universe we live in.

Summary 	  In these lessons students will learn why time is not a constant in relativity theory and how this gives bizarre phenomenon like the famous twin paradox. Students will learn to calculate gamma factors, time dilation and length contraction in relativistic situations. 
The  Big  Idea 	  The nuclei of atoms are affected by three forces: the strong nuclear force, which causes protons and neutrons to bind together, the electric force, which is manifested by repulsion of the protons and tends to rip the nucleus apart, and the weak nuclear force, which causes neutrons to change into protons and vice versa. The strong force predominates and can cause nuclei of complex atoms with many protons to be stable. The electric force of repulsion is responsible for fission, the breaking apart of nuclei, and therefore also for atom bombs and nuclear power. A form of fission where a helium nucleus is a product, is called alpha radiation. The actions of the weak force give rise to beta radiation. A change in nuclear energy can also give rise to gamma radiation, high energy electromagnetic waves. Particles that emit alpha radiation, beta radiation, and gamma radiation go through the process of radioactive decay, which causes the heating of the molten core of the earth, and has even played a role in the mutations in our evolutionary history. Fission and fusion, the latter occurring when light nuclei combine to form new elements, are accompanied by copious amounts of gamma radiation. These processes often produce radioactive nuclei; in nature these radioactive nuclei were forged in the explosive deaths of ancient stars. Give an overview of radioactive decay. Write nuclear equations. Students will learn about radioactive decay and how to write nuclear equations. 
Key  Equations 	  Atomic symbols like AZX are interpreted in the following way: X is the symbol for the element involved. For example, U is the symbol for the element uranium. Z is the atomic number. A is the atomic mass number, the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons). A would be 235 for uranium. The nuclear process is largely random in direction. Therefore, radiation strength decreases with distance by the inverse square of the distance (the 1/r2 law, which also holds for gravity, electric fields, light intensity, sound intensity, and so on.) 
Guidance 	  Alpha decay is the process in which an isotope releases a helium nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons,He) and thus decays into an atom with two less protons. 
Beta  Decay 	  Beta decay is the process in which one of the neutrons in an isotope decays, leaving a proton, electron and anti-neutrino. As a result, the nucleus decays into an atom that has the same number of nucleons, with one neutron replaced by a proton. (Beta positive decay is the reverse process, in which a proton decays into a neutron, anti-electron and neutrino.) 
Gamma  Decay 	  Gamma decay is the process in which an excited atomic nucleus kicks out a photon and releases some of its energy. The makeup of the nucleus doesnt change, it just loses energy. (It can be useful to think of this as energy of motion think of a shuddering nucleus that only relaxes after emitting some light.) 
Fission and  Fusion 	  Fission is the process in which an atomic nucleus breaks apart into two less massive nuclei. Energy is released in the process in many forms, heat, gamma rays and the kinetic energy of neutrons. If these neutrons collide with nuclei and induce more fission, then a runaway chain reaction can take place. Fission is responsible for nuclear energy and atom-bomb explosions: the fission of uranium acts as a heat source for the Earths molten interior. Example: 1 n+ 235 U ? 141 Ba+ 92 Kr+31 n Fusion is the process in which two atomic nuclei fuse together to make a single nucleus. Energy is released in the form of nuclear particles, neutrons, and gamma-rays.

Solve problems involving radioactive decay. Students will learn what is meant by half life and how to solve problems involving radioactive decay. Key Equations t 
M =  M0()t 	  The amount of mass M of the substance surviving after an original M0n uclei decay for time t with a half-life of tH. ln MM0 t = tH 1 ln 2 The amount of time t it takes a set of nuclei to decay to a specified amount. 
N =  N0exp??t 	  The number N of nuclei surviving after an original N0n uclei decay for time t with a half-life of tH. 
Guidance 	  Some of the matter on Earth is unstable and undergoing nuclear decay. Alpha decay is the emission of a helium nucleus and causes the product to have an atomic number 2 lower than the original and an atomic mass number 4 lower than the original. Beta minus decay is the emission of an electron, causing the product to have an atomic number 1 greater than the original Beta plus decay is the emission of a positron, causing the product to have an atomic number 1 lower than the original. When an atomic nucleus decays, it does so by releasing one or more particles. The atom often (but not always) turns into a different element during the decay process. The amount of radiation given off by a certain sample of radioactive material depends on the amount of material, how quickly it decays, and the nature of the decay product. Big, rapidly decaying samples are most dangerous. The measure of how quickly a nucleus decays is given by the half-life of the nucleus. One half-life is the amount of time it will take for half of the radioactive material to decay. The type of atom is determined by the atomic number (i.e. the number of protons). The atomic mass of an atom is approximately the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. Typically, the atomic mass listed in a periodic table is an average, weighted by the natural abundances of different isotopes. The atomic mass number in a nuclear decay process is conserved. This means that you will have the same total atomic mass number on both sides of the equation. Charge is also conserved in a nuclear process. It is impossible to predict when an individual atom will decay; one can only predict the probability. However, it is possible to predict when a portion of a macroscopic sample will decay extremely accurately because the sample contains a vast number of atoms.

Answers to  Selected  Problems 	  Describe how carbon dating works. Solve for the age of an artifact using the carbon dating technique. Students will develop an understanding of how carbon dating works and also learn to solve for the age of an artifact using the carbon dating technique. Key Equations t 
M =  M0()t 	  The amount of mass M of the substance surviving after an original M0 nuclei decay for time t with a half-life of tH. 
Guidance 	  Radioactive carbon dating is a technique that allows scientists to determine the era in which a sample of biological material died. A small portion of the carbon we ingest every day is actually the radioactive isotope 14C rather than the usual 12C. Since we ingest carbon every day until we die (we do this by eating plants; the plants do it through photosynthesis), the amount of 14C in us should begin to decrease from the moment we die. By analyzing the ratio of the number of 14C to 12C atoms in dead carbon-based life forms (including cloth made from plants!), we can determine how long ago the life form died. 
Example 1 	  Question: The half-life of 239Pu is 24,119 years. You have 31.25 micrograms left, and the sample you are studying started with 2000 micrograms. How long has this rock been decaying? Answer: We will use the equation for time and simply plug in the known values. ln NN	ln 312000.25gg t = tH  24119y	700years 
Watch this  Explanation 	  a. Do a graph of quantity remaining (vertical axis) vs. time for both isotopes on the same graph. b. Using the graph determine at what time the quantities remaining of both isotopes are exactly equal and what that quantity is. c. Micol can detect no quantities less than 3.00 mg. Again, using the graph, determine how long she will wait until each of the original isotopes will become undetectable. d. The Pm goes through ?? decay and the Ce decays by means of electron capture. What are the two immediate products of the radioactivity? e. It turns out both of these products are themselves radioactive; the Pm product goes through ?? decay before it becomes stable and the Ce product goes through ?+ decay before it reaches a stable isotope. When all is said and done, what will Micol have left in her lab? 
Summary 	  In these lessons students will develop a deep understanding of radiation and how to solve problems involving the half life and decay constant equations. In addition, the lesson on carbon dating covers an understanding and also develops the skills to solve carbon dating problems.
