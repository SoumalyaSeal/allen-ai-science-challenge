Definition of  Physics 	  What is physics? Physics is the branch of science that studies the physical world, including objects as small as subatomic particles and as large as galaxies. It studies the nature of matter and energy and how they interact. Physicists are inquisitive people who want to know the causes of what they see. How does the moon move? Why does the moon move? Why do the stars shine? Why do your hands get warm when you rub them together? Physicists, like all scientists, hope to find explanations that describe more than one phenomenon and offer a better understanding of how the universe works. 
Common  Misconceptions 	  People commonly believe that physics is all about solving word problems and memorizing equations. While it is true that many physics classes focus on the equations, it is important to remember that the purpose of physics is less about the problems and more about using equations, laws, and theories to understand the world we live in.

Questions 	  • physics: Physics is the science of matter and energy and of interactions between the two, grouped in traditional fields such as acoustics, optics, mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism, as well as in modern extensions including atomic and nuclear physics, cryogenics, solid-state physics, particle physics, and plasma physics. • Understand the steps in the scientific method. • Define hypothesis. • Differentiate between a theory and a law. Don Frazier, a NASA chemist, conducting an experiment using a laser imaging system. In science, we need to make observations on various phenomena to form and test hypotheses. Some phenomena can be found and studied in nature, but scientists often need to create an experiment. Experiments are tests under controlled conditions designed to demonstrate something scientists already know or to test something scientists wish to know. Experiments vary greatly in their goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. The process of designing and performing experiments is a part of the scientific method. 
The  Scientific  Method 	  The scientific method is the process used by scientists to acquire new knowledge and improve our understanding of the universe. It involves making observations on the phenomenon being studied, suggesting explanations for the observations, and testing these possible explanations, also called hypotheses, by making new observations. A hypothesis is a scientist’s proposed explanation of a phenomenon which still must be tested. 
Introduction to  Physics 	  The scientific method is employed by scientists around the world, but it is not always conducted in the order above. Sometimes, hypothesis are formulated before observations are collected; sometimes observations are made before hypothesis are created. Regardless, it is important that scientists record their procedures carefully, allowing others to reproduce and verify the experimental data and results. After many experiments provide results supporting a hypothesis, the hypothesis becomes a theory. Theories remain theories forever, and are constantly being retested with every experiment and observation. Theories can never become fact or law. In science, a law is a mathematical relationship that exists between observations under a given set of conditions. There is a fundamental difference between observations of the physical world and explanations of the nature of the physical world. Hypotheses and theories are explanations, whereas laws and measurements are observational. 
Summary 	  • The scientific method consists of making observations, formulating a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis with new observations, making a new hypothesis if the new observations contradict the old hypothesis, or continuing to test the hypothesis if the observations agree. • A hypothesis is a tentative explanation that can be tested by further observation. • A theory is a hypothesis that has been supported with repeated testing. • A scientific law is a statement that summarizes the results of many observations. • Experimental data must be verified by reproduction from other scientists. • Theories must agree with all observations made on the phenomenon under study. • Theories are continually tested, forever.

We use the experiment to help verify or falsify the validity of a hypothesis. • Distinguish between qualitative and quantitative observations. • Distinguish between fundamental and derived quantities. • State the SI units for length, mass, and time. • Understand unit conversions in the SI system. Measurements are a basic necessity in science. Scientists have designed thousands of different tools to help in the vital process of measuring. In this image of the control panel of the space shuttle Atlantis, we see dozens of readouts from measuring systems. 
Measurement 	  We already know that observations are an important part of the scientific method. Hypotheses are accepted or rejected based on how well they explain observations. Some observations, such as "the plant turned brown" are qualitative; these observations have no associated numbers. A quantitative observation includes numbers, and is also called a measurement. A measurement is obtained by comparing an object to some standard. Any observation is useful to a scientist, but quantitative observations are commonly considered more useful. Even if the measurement is an estimate, scientists usually make quantitative measurements in every experiment. Consider the following pair of observations. A great deal more information, and more useful information, is available in the second observation. Since accurate measurement is a vital tool for doing science, a consistent set of units for measurement is necessary. Physicists throughout the world use the International System of Units (also called the SI system). The SI system 
Introduction to  Physics 	  is basically the metric system, which is convenient because units of different size are related by powers of 10. The system has physical standards for length, mass, and time. These are called fundamental units because they have an actual physical standard. The standard SI unit for length is the meter, and is denoted by "m". Originally, the meter was defined as the length between two scratches on a piece of metal which was stored in a secure vault under controlled conditions. The meter’s definition has changed over time, but it is now accepted to be the distance light travels in a vacuum over The standard unit of time, the second, was once defined as a fraction of the time it takes the earth to complete an orbit around the sun, but has now been redefined in terms of the frequency of one type of radiation emitted by a cesium-133 atom. Seconds are denoted by "s" or, less commonly, "sec." The standard unit for mass is the kilogram. The kilogram’s standard is a block of platinum-iridium metal kept near Paris, France. Other countries, of course, keep copies. A kilogram is denoted "kg" and is a multiple of the smaller unit of mass, the gram ("g"). Meters, seconds, and kilograms are not the only unit entities. Take, for example, speed. Speed is a derived unit, measured in meters per second (m/s). Derived units are units that are expressed using combinations of the fundamental units. As mentioned earlier, the SI system is a decimal system. Prefixes are used to change SI units by powers of ten. Thus, one hundredth of a meter is a centimeter and one thousandth of a gram is a milligram. The metric units for all quantities use the same prefixes. One thousand meters is a kilometer and one thousand grams is a kilogram. The common prefixes are shown in the Table 1.1. 
Prefix 	  pico nano micro milli centi deci tera giga mega kilo hecto deka 
Symbol 	  p n µ m c d 
 	  k h da 
Example 	  picometer (pm) nanometer (nm) microgram (µg) milligram (mg) centimeter (cm) decimeter (dm) terameter (Tm) gigameter (Gm) megagram (Mg) kilogram (kg) hectogram (hg) dekagram (dag) These prefixes are defined using scientific notation. This notation is explained in the Mathematics Tools for Physics section. Numbers with different prefixes can be shown as equalities when they are equivalent measurements. For example, 1 meter = 100 centimeters. Similarly, 0.01 meters = 1 centimenter. These equivalencies are used as conversion factors when units need to be converted. Example: Convert 500. millimeters to meters. Solution: The equivalency statement for millimeters and meters is 1000 mm = 1 m. To convert 500. mm to m, we multiply 500. mm by a conversion factor that will cancel the millimeter units and generate the meter units. This requires that the conversion factor has meters in the numerator and millimeters in the denominator. Example: Convert 11 µg to mg. Solution: When converting from one prefix to another, such as in this problem, it is usually easiest to convert through the base unit. In this case, the base unit is grams, so we use the two following equivalency statements: The first conversion factor converts from micrograms to grams and the second conversion factor converts from grams to milligrams. (cid:16) 1 g (11 µg) (cid:17)(cid:16) 1000 mg (cid:17) = 1.1× 10−2 mg 
Summary 	  • Measurements (quantitative observations) are often more useful than qualitative observations. • The system of units for measurements in physics is the SI system. • The fundamental quantities in the SI system are length, mass, and time. • The SI unit for length is the meter, for time is the second, and for mass is the kilogram. • Prefixes are used to change SI units by powers of ten. • Equivalencies are used as conversion factors when units need to be converted.

Questions 	  • measurement: The process or the result of determining the ratio of a physical quantity, such as a length, time, temperature etc., to a unit of measurement, such as the meter, second or degree Celsius. • the SI system of units: A complete metric system of units of measurement for scientists; fundamental quantities are length (meter) and mass (kilogram) and time (second) and electric current (ampere) and temperature (kelvin) and amount of matter (mole) and luminous intensity (candela). • fundamental quantity vs derived quantity: In the language of measurement, quantities are quantifiable aspects of the world, such as time, distance, velocity, mass, temperature, energy, and weight, and units are used to describe their measure. Many of these quantities are related to each other by various physical laws, and as a result the units of some of the quantities can be expressed as products (or ratios) of powers of other units (e.g., momentum is mass times velocity and velocity is measured in distance divided by time). Those quantities whose units are expressed in terms of other units are regarded as derived quantities. Those that cannot be so expressed in terms of other units are regarded as “fundamental” quantities. • conversion factor: A numerical factor used to multiply or divide a quantity when converting from one system of units to another. • Convert given numbers from expanded form to scientific notation, and vice versa. • Carry out mathematical operations in scientific notation. • Identify the number of significant figures in given measurements. • Carry proper significant figures through math operations.

A modern laptop has more computing power than this room-filling computer did. 
Mathematics  Tool  Kit 	  What Is the Place of Mathematics in Physics? There is certainly a lot of math in physics, but the concepts and theories of physics cannot be derived from only mathematics. If you wish to build a complex mechanical structure, it is pointless to begin without wrenches and screwdrivers. To build mechanical structures, you must have tools. One of the primary tools for working in physics is mathematics. This particular physics resource requires algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, but higher-level physics courses also require calculus. In fact, calculus was invented by Isaac Newton specifically to solve physics problems; most advanced calculus problems are actually physics problems. 
Scientific  Notation 	  In the "Definition of Physics," it was noted that physics deals with objects as small as sub-atomic particles and as large as galaxies. It should be clear that physicists deal with extremely small numbers like the mass of a lead atom: 
Introduction to  Physics 	  galaxy: 2.5 million light years, which is approximately 25,000,000,000,000,000,000 km! These numbers are difficult to write and even more difficult to calculate with. It is much more convenient to write and calculate with such extreme numbers if they are written in scientific notation. In scientific notation, the mass of a lead atom is 3.4 × 10−34 g, and the distance from our galaxy to the Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 × 1019 km. A number is expressed in scientific notation by moving the decimal so that exactly one non-zero digit is on the left of the decimal and the exponent of 10 will be the number of places the decimal was moved. If the decimal is moved to the left, the exponent is positive and if the decimal was moved to the right, the exponent is negative. All significant figures are maintained in scientific notation. Significant figures are explained below. Example: Express 13,700,000,000 in scientific notation. Solution: Since the decimal will be moved to the left 10 places, the exponent will be 10. So, the correct notation is Example: Express 0.000000000000000074 in scientific notation. Solution: Since the decimal will be moved to the right 17 places, the exponent will be -17. So the correct scientific notation is 7.4 × 10−17. Example: Express the number 8.43 × 105 in expanded form. Solution: 105 is 100,000 so 8.43 × 105 is 8.43 × 100,000 or 843,000. 
Operations with  Exponential  Numbers 	  In order to add or subtract numbers in scientific notation, the exponents must be the same. If the exponents are not the same, one of the numbers must be changed so that the exponents are the same. Once the exponents are the same, the numbers are added and the same exponents are carried through to the answer. Example: Add 5.0 × 105 and 4.0 × 104. Solution: In order to add these numbers, we can change 4.0 × 104 to 0.40 × 105 and then add 0.40 × 105 to 5.0 × When you multiply exponential numbers, the numbers multiply and the exponents add. Example: Multiply 5.0 × 105 and 4.0 × 104. Solution: (5.0× 105)(4.0× 104) = (5.0)(4.0)× 105+4 = 20× 109 = 2× 1010 Example: Multiply 6.0 × 103 and 2.0 × 10−5. Solution: (6.0× 103)(2.0× 10−5) = 12× 103−5 = 12× 10−2 = 1.2× 10−1 = 0.12 When you divide exponential numbers, the numbers are divided and the exponent of the divisor is subtracted from the exponent of the dividend. Example: Divide 6.0 × 103 by 2.0 × 10−5. 
Significant  Figures 	  The numbers you use in math class are considered to be exact numbers. These numbers are defined, not measured. Measured numbers cannot be exact the specificity with which we can make a measurement depends on how precise our measuring instrument is. In the case of measurements, we can only read our measuring instruments to a limited number of subdivisions. We are limited by our ability to see smaller and smaller subdivisions, and we are limited by our ability to construct smaller and smaller subdivisions on our measuring devices. Even with the use of powerful microscopes to construct and read our measuring devices, we eventually reach a limit. Therefore, although the actual measurement of an object may be a perfect 12 inches, we cannot prove it to be so. Measurements do not produce perfect numbers; the only perfect numbers in science are defined numbers, such as conversion factors. It is very important to recognize and report the limitations of a measurement along with the magnitude and unit of the measurement. Many times, the measurements made in an experiment are analyzed for regularities. Since the reported numbers show the limits of the measurements (how specific these measurements really are), it is possible to determine how regular these measurements are. Consider the Table 1.2 of the pressures (P) and volumes (V) of a gas sample and the calculated PV product. 
Pressure 	  TABLE 1.2: 
Volume 	  Pressure × Volume (P × V) Now, in the Table 1.3, significant figures and all the numbers must be rounded to two places. look at this same set of data when we are told that all the measurements have only two 
Pressure 	  TABLE 1.3: 
Volume 	  Pressure × Volume (P × V) When the numbers are expressed with proper number of significant figures, a regularity appears that was not apparent before. 
Rules for  Determining  Significant  Figures 	  Significant figures are all of the digits that can be known with certainty in a measurement plus an estimated last digit. Significant figures provide a system to keep track of the limits of the original measurement. To record a measurement, you must write down all the digits actually measured, including measurements of zero, and you must not write down any digit not measured. The only real difficulty with this system is that zeros are sometimes used as measured digits, while other times they are used to locate the decimal point. In the sketch shown above, the correct measurement is greater than 1.2 inches but less than 1.3 inches. It is proper to estimate one place beyond the calibrations of the measuring instrument. This ruler is calibrated to 0.1 inches, so we can estimate the hundredths place. This reading should be reported as 1.25 or 1.26 inches. 
Introduction to  Physics 	  In this second case (sketch above), it is apparent that the object is, as nearly as we can read, 1 inch. Since we know the tenths place is zero and can estimate the hundredths place to be zero, the measurement should be reported as are significant figures. This measurement is read as 1.15 or 1.16 inches. This measurement is read as 1.50 inches. In all of these examples, the measurements indicate that the measuring instrument had subdivisions of a tenth of an inch and that the hundredths place is estimated. There is some uncertainty about the last, and only the last, digit. In our system of writing measurements to show significant figures, we must distinguish between measured zeros and place-holding zeros. Here are the rules for determining the number of significant figures in a measurement. Rules for Determining the Number of Significant Figures: understood decimal (the decimal point is not written in). Examples of the Significant Figure Rules: understood decimal. 
Addition and  Subtraction 	  The answer to an addition or subtraction operation must not have any digits further to the right than the shortest addend. In other words, the answer should have as many decimal places as the addend with the smallest number of decimal places. Example: + 3.22 cm Notice that the top addend has a 3 in the last column on the right, but neither of the other two addends have a number in that column. In elementary math classes, you were taught that these blank spaces can be filled in with zeros and the answer would be 17.6163 cm. In the sciences, however, these blank spaces are unknown numbers, not zeros. Since they are unknown numbers, you cannot substitute any numbers into the blank spaces. As a result, you cannot know the sum of adding (or subtracting) any column of numbers that contain an unknown number. When you add the columns of numbers in the example above, you can only be certain of the sums for the columns with known numbers in each space in the column. In science, the process is to add the numbers in the normal mathematical process and then round off all columns that contain an unknown number (a blank space). Therefore, the correct answer for the example above is 17.62 cm and has only four significant figures. 
Introduction to  Physics 	  The answer for a multiplication or division operation must have the same number of significant figures as the factor with the least number of significant figures. 
Example: (3.556 cm)(2.4 cm) = 8.5344 cm2 = 8.5 cm2 	  The factor 3.556 cm has four significant figures, and the factor 2.4 cm has two significant figures. Therefore the answer must have two significant figures. The mathematical answer of 8.5344 cm2 must be rounded back to 8.5 cm2 in order for the answer to have two significant figures. 
Example: (20.0 cm)(5.0000 cm) = 100.00000 cm2 = 100. cm2 	  The factor 20.0 cm has three significant figures, and the factor 5.0000 cm has five significant figures. The answer must be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the decimal must be written in to show that the two ending zeros are significant. If the decimal is omitted (left as an understood decimal), the two zeros will not be significant and the answer will be wrong. 
Example: (5.444 cm)(22 cm) = 119.768 cm2 = 120 cm2 	  In this case, the answer must be rounded back to two significant figures. We cannot have a decimal after the zero in figures. 
Summary 	  • Mathematics is a major tool for doing physics. • The very large and very small measurements in physics make it useful to express numbers in scientific notation. • There is uncertainty in all measurements. • The use of significant figures is one way to keep track of uncertainty. • Measurements must be written with the proper number of significant figures and the results of calculations must show the proper number of significant figures. • Rules for Determining the Number of Significant Figures: – All non-zero digits are significant. – All zeros between non-zero digits are significant. – All beginning zeros are not significant. – Ending zeros are significant if the decimal point is actually written in but not significant if the decimal point is an understood decimal (the decimal point is not written in).

Questions 	  • exponential notation: A method of writing or displaying numbers in terms of a decimal number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10. The scientific notation of 10,492, for example, is 1.0492× 104. • significant digits: The significant figures (also known as significant digits, and often shortened to sig figs) of a number are those digits that carry meaning contributing to its precision. This includes all digits except: – leading and trailing zeros which are merely placeholders to indicate the scale of the number. – spurious digits introduced, for example, by calculations carried out to greater precision than that of the original data, or measurements reported to a greater precision than the equipment supports. Physics is the branch of science that primarily studies matter, energy, and their interactions. Using the scientific method, physicists hypothesize relationships, design experiments, and complete tests to turn those hypotheses into theories. Physicists around the world not only work from the same body of knowledge—the same laws and theories—but they also use standard units and the SI system of measurement to ensure that the replication of their experiments is possible. Physics is more than numbers and equations; it is about asking how and why things work and questioning everything we see in the natural world. 
Introduction to  Physics 	  terstock.com; Tower: URL . 
 	  Everything in our universe moves. People, planets, and even galaxies are in constant motion. Physics gives us ways to explain motion using not only words, but also equations and graphs. This description of motion, called “kinematics,” involves properties such as position, speed, velocity, and acceleration. In this chapter, you will explore kinematics in one dimension. • Understand an object’s frame of reference. • Describe the difference between distance and displacement. • Identify the position, distance, and displacements in various descriptions of motions. In stockcar races, drivers often travel 500 miles or more, but their final displacement is only a few feet. Why? 
Position,  Distance, and  Displacement 	  In order to study how something moves, we must know where it is. This location is an object’s position. To visualize position for objects moving in a straight line, you can imagine the object is on a number line. It may be placed at any point on the number line in the positive numbers or the negative numbers. It is common to choose the original position of the object to be on the zero mark. In making the zero mark the reference point, you have chosen a frame of reference. The exact position of an object is the separation between the object and the reference point. When an object moves, we often refer to the amount it moves as the distance. Distance does not need a reference point and does not need a direction. If an automobile moves 50 kilometers, the distance traveled is 50 kilometers regardless of the starting point or the direction of movement. If we wish to find the final position of the automobile, however, just having the distance traveled will not allow us to determine the final position. We need to know the starting point and the direction of the motion. The change in the position of the object is called its displacement. The displacement must include a direction because the final position may be either in the positive or negative direction along the number line from the initial position. The displacement is a vector quantity and vectors are discussed in the chapter "Vectors". To return to the first image, these cars travel a distance of 500 miles over the course of the race. However, they are traveling in a circle, and the start and finish line are the same. Therefore, when the car finishes the race, it is in essentially the same position it was when it started. The car’s total displacement is only a few feet. 
Summary 	  • The length traveled by an object moving in any direction or even changing direction is called distance. • The location of an object in a frame of reference is called position. • For straight line motion, positions can be shown using a number line. • The separation between original and final position is called displacement.

The distance travelled cannot be negative and can never get smaller –in this sense, distance is the total length of path traversed by the moving body irrespective of direction. • displacement: The vector from the initial position to a subsequent position assumed by a body. • Explain the difference between speed and velocity. • Define the concept of average velocity. • Determine how to calculate average velocity using the equation, vav = ∆x ∆t Test Pilot Neil Armstrong (later to become a famous astronaut) is seen here next to the X-15 ship after a research flight. The servo-actuated ball nose, seen at Armstrong’s right hand, provided accurate measurement of air speed at hypersonic speeds. The X-15 was flown over a period of nearly 10 years, and set the world’s unofficial speed record of 4,250 mph. 
Average  Velocity 	  In ordinary language, the words speed and velocity both refer to how fast an object is moving, and are often used In physics, however, they are fundamentally different. Speed is the magnitude of an object’s interchangeably. motion, with no regard for the direction. Velocity, on the other hand, includes direction. It is a vector, and thus must have a magnitude and a direction. Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance travelled by the time interval. For example, someone who takes 40 minutes to drive 20 miles north and then 20 miles south (to end up at the same place), has an average speed of 40 miles divided by 40 minutes, or 1 mile per minute (60 mph). Average velocity, however, involves total displacement, instead of distance. It is calculated by dividing the total displacement by the time interval. In this example, the driver’s displacement is zero, which makes the average velocity zero mph. Neither average speed nor average velocity implies a constant rate of motion. That is to say, an object might travel at 10 m/s for 10 s and then travel at 20 m/s for 5 s and then travel at 100 m/s for 5 s. This motion would cover a distance of 700 m in 20 s and the average speed would be 35 m/s. We would report the average speed during this 20 s interval to be 35 m/s and yet at no time during the interval was the speed necessarily 35 m/s. Constant velocity is very different from average velocity. If an object traveled at 35 m/s for 20 s, it would travel the same distance in the same time as the previous example but in the second case, the object’s velocity would always be 35 m/s. Example: The position of a runner as a function of time is plotted as moving along the x-axis of a coordinate system. During a 3.00 s time interval, the runner’s position changes from x1 = 50.0 m to x2 = 30.5 m. What was the runner’s average velocity? Solution: Displacement = 30.5 m− 50.0 m = −19.5 m (the object was traveling back toward zero) ∆t = 3.00 s vave = ∆x ∆t = −19.5 m 
Summary 	  • Average speed is distance divided by time. • Average velocity is displacement divided by time.

Questions 	  for all the motion was 10 s. What was the average velocity of the object? time of 100 seconds. • speed: Distance travelled per unit time. • velocity: A vector measurement of the rate and direction of motion or, in other terms, the rate and direction of the change in the position of an object. • Define instantaneous velocity. • Plot and interpret position vs time graphs. • Determine the slope of a curve on a position vs time graph. • Understand the difference between position vs time and velocity vs time graphs. In a footrace such as the one shown here, the initial velocity of a runner is zero. The runner increases his velocity out of the starting blocks and his velocity continues to increase as the race proceeds. For the well-trained athlete, his highest velocity is maintained through the finish line. 
Instantaneous  Velocity 	  The instantaneous velocity of an object is the velocity of the object at a given moment. If the object is moving with constant velocity, then the instantaneous velocity at every moment, the average velocity, and the constant velocity are all the same. 
Position vs  Time  Graphs 	  Consider a position versus time graph for an object starting at t = 0 and x = 0 that has a constant velocity of 80. m/s. The velocity of an object can be found from a position vs time graph. On a position vs time graph, the displacement is the vertical separation between two points and the time interval is the horizontal separation. The ratio of displacement to time interval is the average velocity. This ratio is also the slope of the line. Therefore, the slope of the straight line is the average velocity. For the motion pictured above, slope = rise For accelerated motion (the velocity is constantly changing), the position vs time graph will be a curved line. The slope of the curved line at any point is the instantaneous velocity at that time. If we were using calculus, the slope of a curved line could be calculated. Without calculus, we approximate the instantaneous velocity at a particular point by laying a straight edge along the curved line and estimating the slope. run = ∆d ∆t = 400. m In the image above, the red line is the position vs time graph and the blue line is an approximated slope for the line at t = 2.5 seconds. The rise for this slope is approximately 170 m and the time interval (run) is 4.0 seconds. Therefore, the approximated slope is 43 m/s. 
Summary 	  • The slope of a position versus time graph is the velocity. • For constant velocity motion, the slope gives the constant velocity, the average velocity, and the instantaneous velocity at every point. • For constant acceleration motion, the slope of the position versus time curve at a particular point gives the instantaneous velocity at that point.

Average  Acceleration 	  An object whose velocity is changing is said to be accelerating. Average acceleration, a is defined as the rate of change of velocity, or the change in velocity per unit time. The units of acceleration are distance over time squared. A symbol with a bar over it is read as average – so a-bar is average acceleration. Example: A car accelerates along a straight road from rest to +60.0 km/h in 5.00 s. What is the magnitude of its average acceleration? Solution: The acceleration in this problem is read as kilometers per hour per second. In general, it is undesirable to have two different units for the same quantity in a unit expression. In this case, it is undesirable to have both hours and seconds. To eliminate this problem, we convert the hour units to seconds. Converting the original 60.0 km/h to m/s, gives 17.0 m/s. The acceleration is 3.40 m/s2. Example: An automobile is moving along a straight highway in the positive direction and the driver steps on the brakes. If the initial velocity is +15.0 m/s and 5.0 s is required to slow down to +5.0 m/s, what was the car’s acceleration? ∆t = −10.0 m/s Solution: a = ∆v Note that an acceleration is merely a change in velocity. This change can be either positive or negative. A negative change, such as that in the example problem above, is sometimes called negative acceleration or deceleration.

Uniform  Acceleration 	  If an automobile with a velocity of 4.0 m/s accelerates at a rate of 4.0 m/s2 for 2.5 s, what is the final Acceleration that does not change in time is called uniform or constant acceleration. The velocity at the beginning of the time interval is called initial velocity, vi, and the velocity at the end of the time interval is called final velocity, v f . In a velocity versus time graph for uniform acceleration, the slope of the line is the acceleration. The equation that describes the curve is v f = vi + at. Example: velocity? Solution: v f = vi + at = 4.0 m/s + (4.0 m/s2)(2.5 s) = 4.0 m/s + 10. m/s = 14 m/s Example: If a cart slows from 22.0 m/s with an acceleration of -2.0 m/s2, how long does it require to get to 4 m/s? Solution: v f−vi a = −18 m/s t = −2.0 m/s2 = 9.0 s

Displacement  During  Constant  Acceleration 	  When acceleration is constant, there are three equations that relate displacement to two of the other three quantities we use to describe motion –time, velocity, and acceleration. These equations only work when acceleration is constant, but there are, fortunately, quite a few cases of motion where the acceleration is constant. One of the most common, if we ignore air resistance, are objects falling due to gravity. When an object is moving with constant velocity, the displacement can be found by multiplying the velocity by the time interval, as shown in the equation below d = vt If the object is moving with constant acceleration, but not a constant velocity, we can use a derivation of this equation. Instead of using v, as velocity, we must calculate and use the average velocity using this equation: vave = 1 The distance, then, for uniformly accelerating motion can be found by multiplying the average velocity by the time. d = 1 (Equation 1) We know that the final velocity for constantly accelerated motion can be found by multiplying the acceleration times time and adding the result to the initial velocity, v f = vi + at. The second equation that relates displacement, time, initial velocity, and final velocity is generated by substituting this equation into equation 1. Start by distributing the 1/2 in equation 1 through: d = (v f + vi)(t) = v f t + vit We know that v f = vi + at. Therefore: = 1 (Equation 2) = vit + 1 The third equation is formed by combining v f = vi + at and d = 1 and then substitute into the second equation, we get d =(cid:0) 1 (cid:1) (v f + vi) (cid:16) v f−vi (cid:17) a (cid:1)(cid:18) v2 =(cid:0) 1 f−v2 a i (cid:19) 
And solving for v f 	  v f (Equation 3) Keep in mind that these three equations are only valid when acceleration is constant. In many cases, the initial velocity can be set to zero and that simplifies the three equations considerably. When acceleration is constant and the initial velocity is zero, the equations can be simplified to: d = v f t at2 and d = v f Example: Suppose a planner is designing an airport for small airplanes. Such planes must reach a speed of 56 m/s before takeoff and can accelerate at 12.0 m/s2. What is the minimum length for the runway of this airport? Solution: we can use the equation v f The acceleration in this problem is constant and the initial velocity of the airplane is zero. Therefore, d = v f (2)(12.0 m/s2 = 130 m ) Example: How long does it take a car to travel 30.0 m if it accelerates from rest at a rate of 2.00 m/s2? Solution: The acceleration in this problem is constant and the initial velocity is zero, therefore, we can use d = 1 solved for t. (cid:114)2d (cid:115) t = a = (2)(30.0 m) Example: A baseball pitcher throws a fastball with a speed of 30.0 m/s. Assume the acceleration is uniform and the distance through which the ball is accelerated is 3.50 m. What is the acceleration? Solution: Since the acceleration is uniform and the initial velocity is zero, we can use v f v2 f (2)(3.50 m) = 900. m2/s2 a = Suppose we plot the velocity versus time graph for an object undergoing uniform acceleration. In this first case, we will assume the object started from rest. If the object has a uniform acceleration of 6.0 m/s2 and started from rest, then each succeeding second, the velocity will increase by 6.0 m/s. Here is the table of values and the graph. In displacement versus time graphs, the slope of the line is the velocity of the object. In this case of a velocity versus time graph, the slope of the line is the acceleration. If you take any segment of this line and determine the ∆y to ∆x ratio, you will get 6.0 m/s2 which we know to be the constant acceleration of this object. We know from geometry that the area of a triangle is calculated by multiplying one-half the base times the height. The area under the curve in the image above is the area of the triangle shown below. The area of this triangle would be calculated by area =(cid:0) 1 (cid:1) (6.0 s)(36 m/s) = 108 m. displacement of this object in the first 6 seconds of travel is displacement =(cid:0) 1 By going back to equation 2, we know that displacement = 1 (cid:1) (6.0 m/s2)(6.0 s)2 = 108 m. the It is not coincidental that this number is the same as the area of the triangle. In fact, the area underneath the curve in a velocity versus time graph is always equal to the displacement that occurs during that time interval. 
Summary 	  • There are three equations we can use when acceleration is constant to relate displacement to two of the other three quantities we use to describe motion –time, velocity, and acceleration: – d =(cid:0) 1 – d =(cid:0) 1 (cid:1) (v f + vi)(t) (Equation 1) (cid:1) (v f )(t) (Equation 1’) – d = vit + 1 – v f – d = 1 – v f • When the initial velocity of the object is zero, these three equations become: • The slope of a velocity versus time graph is the acceleration of the object. • The area under the curve of a velocity versus time graph is the displacement that occurs during the given time interval.

Questions 	  during this acceleration was 535 m, what is the final velocity? velocity of the car when the acceleration first began? time? • Describe the acceleration of falling objects due to gravity. • Explain why falling objects with different masses accelerate at the same rate. It’s a good thing this mountain climber’s safety gear is working, because it’s a long way down to the ground! If he were to fall, he’d be moving really fast by the time he got there. The higher any object starts falling from above Earth’s surface, the faster it’s traveling by the time it reaches the ground. Do you know why? The reason is gravity. 
Speeding up  While  Falling  Down 	  Gravity is a force that pulls objects down toward the ground. When objects fall to the ground, gravity causes them to accelerate. Acceleration is a change in velocity, and velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion. Gravity causes an object to fall toward the ground at a faster and faster velocity the longer the object falls. In fact, its velocity increases by 9.8 m/s2, so by 1 second after an object starts falling, its velocity is 9.8 m/s. By 2 seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 19.6 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s), and so on. The acceleration of a falling object due to gravity is illustrated in the Figure 2.1. For a more detailed explanation of acceleration due to gravity, watch this video: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. You can compare the acceleration due to gravity on Earth, the moon, and Mars with the interactive animation called “Freefall” at this URL: URL Q: In this diagram, the boy drops the object at time t = 0 s. By t = 1 s, the object is falling at a velocity of 9.8 m/s. What is its velocity by t = 5 s? What will its velocity be at t = 6 s if it keeps falling? A: Its velocity at t = 5 s is 49.0 m/s, and at t = 6 s, it will be 58.8 m/s (49.0 m/s + 9.8 m/s). 
Mass and  Acceleration  Due to  Gravity 	  What if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the same distance above the ground? The bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball, so the pull of gravity on it is greater. Would it fall to the ground faster? No, the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time. The reason? The more massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass, so it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the soccer ball. This is true of all falling objects. They all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity, unless air resistance affects one object more than another. For example, a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling acorn because of the leaf’s greater surface area. You can simulate the effect of air resistance on acceleration due to gravity by doing the interactive animation at this URL: URL pport-files/freefall.swf Q: If a leaf and an acorn were to fall to the ground in the absence of air (that is, in a vacuum), how would this affect their acceleration due to gravity? A: They would both accelerate at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time. 
Summary 	  • When gravity pulls objects toward the ground, it always causes them to accelerate at a rate of 9.8 m/s2. • Regardless of differences in mass, all objects accelerate at the same rate due to gravity unless air resistance affects one more than another.

Forces 	  What is a force? A force is a push or a pull. The movement experienced by the man above can be explained as a combination of forces. Though gravitational force pulls him downward, the water shooting out of his jet pack provides a force pushing him up. Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was the first to study forces as the cause for acceleration. The connections he understood are known as Newton’s Laws of Motions, and are explained in this chapter. • Define force. • State the fundamental units for the Newton. • State Newton’s First Law of Motion. • Given two of the three values in F = ma, calculate the third. This image is of Buzz Aldrin, one of the first men to walk on the moon. Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first humans, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, on the moon on July 20, 1969. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface 6 hours later on July 21. As you probably already know, men weigh less on the moon than on Earth; this is because the force of gravity is less on the moon than on Earth. 
Newton’s  First and  Second  Laws of  Motion 	  A force is a push or a pull on an object. When you place a book on a table, the book pushes downward on the table and the table pushes upward on the book. The two forces are equal and there is no resulting motion of the book. If, on the other hand, you hold the book in the air and let go, the force of gravity will pull the book to the ground. If you slide a book across the floor or a table, the book will experience a frictional force, which acts in the opposite direction of the motion. This force will slow down the motion of the book and eventually bring it to rest. A smoother surface has a smaller force of friction, which will allow the book to slide further before coming to rest. If a perfectly smooth floor could be created, there would be no friction and the book would slide forever at constant speed. Newton’s First Law of Motion states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion. It describes a phenomenon called inertia. Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist change in its state of motion. In the absence of any force, an object will continue to move at the same constant speed and in the same straight line. If the object is at rest, in the absence of any force, it will remain at rest. Newton’s First Law states that an object with no force acting on it moves with constant velocity. (The constant velocity could, of course, be 0 m/s.) m or more commonly, F = ma Newton’s First Law is equivalent to saying that “if there is no net force on an object, there will be no acceleration.” In the absence of acceleration, an object will remain at rest or will move with constant velocity in a straight line. The acceleration of an object is the result of an unbalanced force. If an object undergoes two forces, the motion of the object is determined by the net force. The magnitude of the acceleration is directly proportional to the magnitude of the unbalanced force. The direction of the acceleration is the same direction as the direction of the unbalanced force. The magnitude of the acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the object; the more massive the object, the smaller the acceleration produced by the same force. These relationships are stated in Newton’s Second Law of Motion: "the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force on the object and inversely proportional to the mass of the object." Newton’s Second Law can be summarized in an equation: a = F According to Newton’s Second Law, a new force on an object causes it to accelerate. However, the larger the mass, the smaller the acceleration. We say that a more massive object has a greater inertia. The units for force are defined by the equation for Newton’s Second Law. Suppose we wish to express the force that will give a 1.00 kg object an acceleration of 1.00 m/s2. F = ma = (1.00 kg)(1.00 m/s2) = 1.00 kg· m/s2 This unit is defined as 1.00 newton or 1.00 N. kg·m s2 = newton Example Problem: What force is required to accelerate a 2000. kg car at 2.000 m/s2? Solution: F = ma = (2000. kg)(2.000 m/s2) = 4000. N Example Problem: A net force of 150 N is exerted on a rock. The rock has an acceleration of 20. m/s2 due to this force. What is the mass of the rock? 
Solution: m =  	  = 7.5 kg a = (150 N) (20. m/s2 ) Example Problem: A net force of 100. N is exerted on a ball. If the ball has a mass of 0.72 kg, what acceleration will it undergo? 
Solution: a =  	  = 140 m/s2 m = (100. N) (0.72 kg) 
Summary 	  • A force is a push or pull on an object. • Newton’s First Law states that an object with no net force acting on it remains at rest or moves with constant velocity in a straight line. • Newton’s Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force on the object and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. • Newton’s Second Law is expressed as an equation, F = ma.

Newton’s  Third  Law of  Motion 	  Where do forces come from? Observations suggest that a force applied to an object is always applied by another object. A hammer strikes a nail, a car pulls a trailer, and a person pushes a grocery cart. Newton realized that forces are not so one-sided. When the hammer exerts a force on the nail, the nail also exerts a force on the hammer—after all, the hammer comes to rest after the interaction. This led to Newton’s Third Law of Motion, which states that whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object also exerts a force on the first object, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This law is sometimes paraphrased as: “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.” A very important point to remember is that the two forces are on different objects—never on the same object. It is frequently the case that one of the objects moves as a result of the force applied but the motion of the other object in the opposite direction is not apparent. Consider the situation where an ice skater is standing at the edge of the skating rink holding on to the side rail. If the skater exerts a force on the rail, the rail is held in place with tremendous friction and therefore, will not move in any noticeable way. The skater, on the other hand, had little friction with the ice, and therefore will be accelerated in the direction opposite of her original push. This is the process people use to jump up into the air. The person’s feet exert force on the ground and the ground exerts an equal and opposite force on the person’s feet. The force on the feet is sufficient to raise the person off the ground. The force on the ground has little effect because the Earth is so large. One of the accelerations is visible but the other is not visible. A case where the reaction motion due to the reaction force is visible is the case of a person throwing a heavy object out of a small boat, such as a kayak. The object is accelerated in one direction and the boat is accelerated in the opposite direction. In this case, both the motion of the object is visible and the motion of the boat in the opposite direction is also visible. Rockets also work in this manner. It is a misconception that the rocket moves forward because the escaping gas pushes on the ground or the surrounding air to make the rocket go forward. Rockets work in outer space where there is no ground or surrounding air. The rocket exerts a force on the gases causing them to be expelled and the gases exert a force on the rocket causing it to be accelerated forward. 
Summary 	  • A force applied to an object is always applied by another object. • Newton’s Third Law of Motion states, “Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object also exerts a force on the first object, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.”

When you are standing on the ground, you have no trouble jumping 4 feet horizontally. If you are standing in a canoe, however, and you need to jump 4 feet to reach the pier, you will surely fall into the lake. Why is it that you cannot jump 4 feet out of a canoe when you can easily do this when on land? • Newton’s Third Law of Motion: Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object also exerts a force on the first object, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. • Distinguish between mass and weight. • Understand the relationship between mass and weight due to the acceleration of gravity. • Know how to determine if a number gives mass or weight based on the units. Astronauts in training often fly in the KC-135 training aircraft to experience near-weightlessness. Three Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronauts—Akihiko Hoshide, Satoshi Furukawa, and Naoko Yamazaki—are shown here during such an exercise. Though they experience near-weightlessness, we can see that their mass has not changed. What is the relationship between mass and weight? 
Mass and  Weight 	  The mass of an object is defined as the amount of matter in the object. The amount of mass an object has does not change; a moon rock that has been returned to Earth has the same mass on the Earth’s surface as it had on the moon. The amount of mass in an object is measured by comparing the object to known masses on an instrument called a balance. Using the balance shown here, the object would be placed in one pan and known masses would be placed in the other pan until the pans were exactly balanced. When balanced, the mass of the object would be equal to the sum of the known masses in the other pan. A balance will work in any location; whether on the moon or on Earth, the moon rock mentioned earlier will have the same mass. The weight of an object is the force pulling the object downward. On Earth, this would be the gravitational force of the Earth on the object. On the moon, this would be the gravitational force of the moon on the object. The gravitational force of the moon is one-sixth the magnitude of the gravitational force of the Earth; the weight of the moon rock on the moon will be one-sixth the weight of the moon rock on the Earth’s surface. Weight is measured in force units—newtons—by a calibrated spring scale as shown here. The force of gravity is given by Newton’s Second Law, F = ma, where F is the force of gravity in newtons, m is the mass of the object in kilograms, and a is the acceleration due to gravity, 9.81 m/s2. When the formula is used specifically for finding weight from mass or vice versa, it may appear as W = mg. Example Problem: What is the weight of an object sitting on the Earth’s surface if the mass of the object is 43.7 kg? Solution: W = mg = (43.7 kg)(9.81 m/s2) = 429 N Example Problem: What is the mass of an object whose weight sitting on the Earth is 2570 N? m = W a = 2570 N 
Summary 	  • The mass of an object is measured in kilograms and is defined as the amount of matter in an object. • Mass is determined by comparing an object to known masses on a balance. • The weight of an object on the Earth is defined as the force acting on the object by the Earth’s gravity. • Weight is measured by a calibrated spring scale. • The formula relating mass and weight is W = mg.

We also know that F = ma is true on both the Earth and the moon. Will the man be able to jump higher on the moon than the Earth?

Tennis is played on a variety of court surfaces: grass, clay, hardcourt, and even carpet. Players know that matches on different surfaces are distinctly different games. The ball bounces differently, and shoes slip on some surfaces but stick on others. These differences are a result of friction. 
Friction 	  Friction is the force that resists motion. In most beginning physics classes, friction is ignored. Concepts can be understood and calculations made assuming friction to be nonexistent. Whenever physics intersects with the real world, however, friction must be taken into account. Friction exists between two touching surfaces because even the smoothest looking surface is quite rough on a microscopic scale. Every surface has microscopic bumps, lumps, and imperfections, emphasized as in the image above. If we try to slide the top block over the lower block, there will be numerous collisions as the bumps impact each other. The forward motion causes the collisions with bumps which then exert a force in opposite way the block is moving. The force of friction always opposes whatever motion is causing the friction. The force of friction between these two blocks is related to two factors. The first factor is the roughness of the surfaces that are interacting, which is called the coefficient of friction, µ (Greek letter mu). The second factor is the magnitude of the force pushing the top block down onto the lower block. It is reasonable that the more forcefully the blocks are pushed together, the more difficult it will be for one to slide over the other. The force pushing these blocks together is the result of gravity acting on the top block and pressing it against the bottom block, which resists the weight with an equal and opposite force called the normal force. The force of friction can be calculated by Ffriction = µ× Fnormal and the normal force will be equal to the force of gravity on the object, if the object is on a flat surface (one parallel to the ground). This is an approximate but reasonably useful and accurate relationship. It is not exact because µ depends on a variety of factors, including whether the surface is wet or dry. The frictional force we have been discussing is referred to as sliding friction; it is involved when one surface is sliding over another. If you have ever tried to slide a heavy object across a rough surface, you may be aware that it is a great deal easier to keep an object sliding than it is to start the object sliding in the first place. When the object to slide is resting on a surface with no movement, the force of friction is called static friction and it is somewhat greater than sliding friction. Surfaces that move against one another will have both a coefficient of static friction and a coefficient of sliding friction, and the two values will not be the same. For example, the coefficient of sliding friction for ice on ice is 0.03 whereas the coefficient of static friction for ice on ice is 0.10—more than three times as great. Example Problem: A box weighing 2000. N is sliding across a cement floor. The force pushing the box is 500. N, and the coefficient of sliding friction between the box and the floor is 0.20. What is the acceleration of the box? Solution: In this case, the box is sliding along the ground, so the normal force for the box is equal to its weight. Using the normal force and the coefficient of friction, we can find the frictional force. We can also find the mass of the box from its weight since we know the acceleration due to gravity. Then we can find the net force and the acceleration. 
F = µ N = (0.20)(2000.  N) = 400.  	  weight g = 2000. N mass of box = FNET = pushing force− frictional force = 500. N− 400. N = 100. N a = FN m = 100. N Example Problem: Two boxes are connected by a rope running over a pulley, as shown in the figure below. The coefficient of sliding friction between box A and the table is 0.20. (Ignore the masses of the rope and the pulley and any friction in the pulley.) The mass of box A is 5.0 kg and the mass of box B is 2.0 kg. The entire system (both boxes) will move together with the same acceleration and velocity. Find the acceleration of the system. Solution: The force acting to move the system is the weight of box B, and the force resisting the movement is the force of friction between the table and box A. The mass of the system is the sum of the masses of both boxes. The acceleration of the system can be found by dividing the net force by the total mass. FN(box A) = mg = (5.0 kg)(9.8 m/s2) = 49 N 
Ffriction = µ N = (0.20)(49  N) = 9.8  	  Weight of box B = mg = (2.0 kg)(9.8 m/s2) = 19.6 N

To understand physics, it is necessary to understand how objects move. Acted on by forces, objects are subject to Newton’s Three Laws of Motion. The most widespread force is gravity, which has the same effect on all objects all over the world; it is the force of gravity that gives an object of some mass its weight. Finally, a significant force often overlooked in elementary physics courses is friction, but understanding friction equations and friction’s influence on an object’s motion is necessary to properly calculate its trajectories. -40-5873.html . tml . _Family_Circle_Cup.JPG . 
Vectors 	  Drifting is a driving technique in which the driver intentionally over-steers while cornering—causing loss of traction in the rear wheels—but still maintains control. Though the wheels indicate the car is traveling in one direction, it is actually traveling a different way. Regardless, the car’s motion can be described by its speed and direction. Some quantities do not have a direction associated with them. Mass, for example, is a measured number but has no associated direction. The quantities that do require direction are called vectors. All forces that act on objects are vector quantities, and most objects are acted upon by multiple forces. To understand how the object moves under influence of multiple forces, it is often necessary to sum up different vectors. This chapter explains vectors, as well as how to break them down and add them together. • Differentiate between scalars and vectors. • Graphically add vectors in one dimension by placing the vectors head to toe on a number line. • Graphically add vectors in two dimensions by placing them head to toe on a two-dimensional coordinate system. Successfully shooting a basketball requires a subconscious understanding of the vectors involved in how the basketball moves through the air. The vertical and horizontal vectors must be perfectly organized if the ball is to pass through the basket. 
Graphical  Methods  Vector  Addition 	  In physics, a quantity, such as mass, length, or speed that is completely specified by its magnitude and has no direction is called a scalar. A vector, on the other hand, is a quantity possessing both magnitude and direction. A vector quantity is typically represented by an arrow-tipped line segment. The length of the line, drawn to scale, represents the magnitude of the quantity. The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the vector. Not only can vectors be represented graphically, but they can also be added graphically. For one dimensional vector addition, the first vector is placed on a number line with the tail of the vector on the origin. The second vector is placed with its tail exactly on the arrow head of the first vector. The sum of the two vectors is the vector that begins at the origin and ends at the arrow head of the final added vector. Consider the following two vectors. The red vector has a magnitude of 11 in the positive direction on the number line. The blue vector has a magnitude of -3, indicating 3 units in the negative direction on the number line. In order to add these two vectors, we place one of the vectors on a number line and then the second vector is placed on the same number line such that its origin is on the arrow head of the first vector. The sum of these two vectors is the vector that begins at the origin of the first vector (the red one) and ends at the arrow head of the second (blue) vector. So the sum of these two vectors is the purple vector, as shown below. The vector sum of the first two vectors is a vector that begins at the origin and has a magnitude of 8 units in the positive direction. If we were adding three or four vectors all in one dimension, we would continue to place them head to toe in sequence on the number line. The sum would be the vector that begins at the beginning of the first vector and goes to the ending of the final vector. 
Adding  Vectors in  Two  Dimensions 	  In the following image, vectors A and B represent the two displacements of a person who walked 90. m east and then 50. m north. We want to add these two vectors to get the vector sum of the two movements. The graphical process for adding vectors in two dimensions is to place the tail of the second vector on the arrow head of the first vector as shown above. The sum of the two vectors is the vector that begins at the origin of the first vector and goes to the ending of the second vector, as shown below. If we are using totally graphic means of adding these vectors, the magnitude of the sum would be determined by measuring the length of the sum vector and comparing it to the original standard. We would also use a compass to measure the angle of the summation vector. If we are using calculation means, we can divide 50. m by 90. m and determine inverse tangent of the dividend. The result of 29.05 indicates the angle of 29° north of east. The length of the sum vector can also be determined mathematically by the Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2. In this case, the length of the hypotenuse would be the square root of (8100 + 2500) or 103 m. If three or four vectors are to be added by graphical means, we would continue to place each new vector head to toe with the vectors to be added until all the vectors were in the coordinate system. The sum vector is the vector from the origin of the first vector to the arrowhead of the last vector. The magnitude and direction of the sum vector can be measured.

Resolving  Vectors into  Axial  Components 	  We know that when two vectors are in the same dimension, they can be added arithmetically. Suppose we have two vectors that are on a north-south, east-west grid, as shown below. One of the methods we can use to add these vectors is to resolve each one into a pair of vectors that lay on the north-south and east-west axes. The two vectors we are to add is a force of 65 N at 30° north of east and a force of 35 N at 60° north of west. We can resolve each of the vectors into two components on the axes lines. Each vector is resolved into a component on the north-south axis and a component on the east-west axis. Using trigonometry, we can resolve (break down) each of these vectors into a pair of vectors that lay on the axial lines (shown in red above). The east-west component of the first vector is (65 N)(cos 30° ) = (65 N)(0.866) = 56.3 N east The north-south component of the first vector is (65 N)(sin 30°) = (65 N)(0.500) = 32.5 N north The east-west component of the 2nd vector is (35 N)(cos 60°) = (35 N)(0.500) = 17.5 N west The north-south component of the 2nd vector is (35 N)(sin 60°) = (35 N)(0.866) = 30.3 N north

Adding  Vectors in  Two  Dimensions 	  In the following image, vectors A and B represent the two displacements of a person who walked 90. m east and then 50. m north. We want to add these two vectors to get the vector sum of the two movements. The graphical process for adding vectors in two dimensions is to place the tail of the second vector on the arrow head of the first vector as shown above. The sum of the two vectors is the vector that begins at the origin of the first vector and goes to the ending of the second vector, as shown below. If we are using totally graphic means of adding these vectors, the magnitude of the sum can be determined by measuring the length of the sum vector and comparing it to the original standard. We then use a compass to measure the angle of the summation vector. If we are using calculation, we first determine the inverse tangent of 50 units divided by 90 units and get the angle of 29° north of east. The length of the sum vector can then be determined mathematically by the Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2. In this case, the length of the hypotenuse would be the square root of (8100 + 2500), or 103 units. If three or four vectors are to be added by graphical means, we would continue to place each new vector head to toe with the vectors to be added until all the vectors were in the coordinate system. The resultant, or sum, vector would be the vector from the origin of the first vector to the arrowhead of the last vector; the magnitude and direction of this sum vector would then be measured. 
Mathematical  Methods of  Vector  Addition 	  We can add vectors mathematically using trig functions, the law of cosines, or the Pythagorean theorem. If the vectors to be added are at right angles to each other, such as the example above, we would assign them to the sides of a right triangle and calculate the sum as the hypotenuse of the right triangle. We would also calculate the direction of the sum vector by using an inverse sin or some other trig function. Suppose, however, that we wish to add two vectors that are not at right angles to each other. Let’s consider the vectors in the following images. The two vectors we are to add are a force of 65 N at 30° north of east and a force of 35 N at 60° north of west. We know that vectors in the same dimension can be added by regular arithmetic. Therefore, we can resolve each of these vectors into components that lay on the axes as pictured below. The resolution of vectors reduces each vector to a component on the north-south axis and a component on the east-west axis. After resolving each vector into two components, we can now mathematically determine the magnitude of the components. Once we have done that, we can add the components in the same direction arithmetically. This will give us two vectors that are perpendicular to each other and can be the legs of a right triangle. The east-west component of the first vector is (65 N)(cos 30°) = (65 N)(0.866) = 56.3 N north (cid:112) The north-south component of the first vector is (65 N)(sin 30°) = (65 N)(0.500) = 32.5 N north The east-west component of the second vector is (35 N)(cos 60°) = (35 N)(0.500) = 17.5 N west The north-south component of the second vector is (35 N)(sin 60°) = (35 N)(0.866) = 30.3 N north The sum of the two east-west components is 56.3 N 17.5 N = 38.8 N east The sum of the two north-south components is 32.5 N + 30.3 N = 62.8 N north We can now consider those two vectors to be the sides of a right triangle and find the length and direction of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean Theorem and trig functions. c = sin x = 62.8 The direction of the sum vector is 74 N at 58° north of east. Perpendicular vectors have no components in the other direction. For example, if a boat is floating down a river due south, and you are paddling the boat due east, the eastward vector has no component in the north-south direction and therefore, has no effect on the north-south motion. If the boat is floating down the river at 5 mph south and you paddle the boat eastward at 5 mph, the boat continues to float southward at 5 mph. The eastward motion has absolutely no effect on the southward motion. Perpendicular vectors have NO effect on each other. Example Problem: A motorboat heads due east at 16 m/s across a river that flows due north at 9.0 m/s. (a) What is the resultant velocity of the boat? (b) If the river is 135 m wide, how long does it take the boat to reach the other side? (c) When the boat reaches the other side, how far downstream will it be? Solution: Sketch: (a) Since the two motions are perpendicular to each other, they can be assigned to the legs of a right triangle and the hypotenuse (resultant) calculated. (cid:112)a2 + b2 = (cid:113) c = (16 m/s)2 + (9.0 m/s)2 = 18 m/s sinθ = 9.0 The resultant is 18 m/s at 30° north of east. (b) The boat is traveling across the river at 16 m/s due to the motor. The current is perpendicular and therefore has no effect on the speed across the river. The time required for the trip can be determined by dividing the distance by the velocity. v = 135 m t = d (c) The boat is traveling across the river for 8.4 seconds and therefore, it is also traveling downstream for 8.4 seconds. We can determine the distance downstream the boat will travel by multiplying the speed downstream by the time of the trip. ddownstream = (vdownstream)(t) = (9.0 m/s)(8.4 s) = 76 m

This photograph was taken by Apollo 8 crewmember Bill Anders on December 24, 1968, showing the Earth rising above the lunar surface. Gravitational forces keep the moon orbiting the Earth. 
Gravitational  Force and  Inclined  Planes 	  Every object has a center of gravity. The center of gravity is the point at which the entire weight of a body may be considered to be concentrated; if supported at this point, the body would remain in equilibrium in any position. For example, if we were discussing a 12-inch ruler, the center of gravity for the ruler would be at the center of the or right. If you placed your finger underneath any other place on the ruler, it would fall off to one side or the other. The force of gravity acting on an object is directed through this center of gravity and toward the center of the Earth. The object’s weight, W , can be represented by a vector directed down (along the line the object would fall if it were dropped). When this object is resting on a level surface, its weight acts perpendicularly to the surface and will be equal to the normal force, which is the force keeping the object from falling through the table. The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface; when the surface is not level, the normal force will be equal to some subset of the weight. This is seen in the image below, which shows a box on an inclined plane. The weight of the box acts through the center of gravity and directly towards the center of the Earth. The weight vector in the sketch is red and labeled W. The normal force acts perpendicular to the surface of the inclined plane to keep the box from falling through the plane. The force of the box on the plane is equal to the normal force (as specified in Newton’s Third Law). Since the normal force and the force of the box acting on the plane are the same, we can reference the force against the plane as the normal force. That force, FN, is purple in the image above. In addition, there is a force acting on the box parallel to the surface of the plane and pushing the box down the plane. This force is drawn in blue and is called the parallel force. The normal force and the parallel force add to give the weight. The triangle of the black inclined plane and the yellow triangle are similar triangles; the corresponding sides are mutually perpendicular. Therefore, the angle at the top of the yellow triangle is also 30◦. For a right triangle, if we know one other angle (the 30◦ angle) and one side (the weight), we can calculate the other two sides. Therefore, we can calculate the parallel force pushing the box down the incline and we could also calculate the acceleration of the box. Example Problem: A 500. N box is resting on a plane inclined at 30◦ with the horizontal. (a) Find the normal force and the parallel force acting on this box. (b) Find the acceleration of the box. Solution: (a) FN = W cos30◦ = (500. N)(0.866) = 433 N 
Fparallel =  W sin30◦ = (500.  N)(0.500) = 250.  	  (b) mass of the box = 500. N a = 
Fparallel 	  mass = 250. N 
Summary 	  • Each object has a center of gravity, which is the point at which the weight can be considered to be concentrated when balancing the object. • The weight of an object is a vector that is directed toward the center of the Earth. • When an object is placed on an inclined plane, its weight vector can be resolved into the normal force, which is equal to the force of the object perpendicular to the plane, and a parallel force, which pushes the object down the inclined plane.

 	  To create this photograph, a camera shutter was opened eighteen times, producing eighteen consecutive images of the snowboarder as he jumped. You can clearly see that there are both vertical and horizontal components to his overall parabolic motion. To complete calculations on this sort of two-dimensional motion, it is necessary to consider the vertical and horizontal vectors separately. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to accurately estimate the time elapsed over the course of this image and between shutter openings, knowing only the maximum vertical height attained by the snowboarder. You will also know how to accurately estimate his maximum vertical height using only the time he spent in the air. 
Horizontally 	  • State the relationship between the vertical and horizontal velocities of a projectile launched horizontally. • Find the time for a horizontally launched projectile to strike the ground. • Calculate the range of a horizontally launched projectile. The activity of bike jumping, like other sports that involve vector motions in perpendicular directions, requires more physical practice than mathematical analysis. The laws of physics apply to the activity, however, whether the biker is aware of them or not. 
Projectile  Motion for an  Object  Launched  Horizontally 	  Objects that are launched into the air are called projectiles. The path followed by a projectile in motion is called a trajectory. The image of the snowboarder in the chapter introduction showed his trajectory; every object has a trajectory even when we cannot see it. Projectile motion, or the object’s trajectory, is described in terms of position, velocity, and acceleration. Even with only an object’s current location, velocity, and acceleration, we can calculate when and where the object will land. Our knowledge that perpendicular components of vectors do not affect each other allow us to easily analyze the motion of projectiles. In the diagram, two balls (one red and one blue) are dropped at the same time. The red ball is released with no horizontal motion and the blue ball is dropped but also given a horizontal velocity of 10 m/s. As the balls fall to the floor, a photograph is taken every second so that in 5 seconds, we have 5 images of the two balls. Each vertical line on the diagram represents 5 m. Since the blue ball has a horizontal velocity of 10 m/s, you will see that for every second, the blue ball has moved horizontally 10 m. That is, in each second, the blue ball has increased its horizontal distance by 10 m. This horizontal motion is due to the ball’s constant velocity. The red ball was dropped straight down with no horizontal velocity and therefore, in each succeeding second, the red ball falls straight down with no horizontal motion. The increasing distances between seconds in the red ball’s motion indicates that this motion is accelerating. A very important point here is that the vertical motion of these two balls is identical. That is, they each fall exactly the same distance vertically in each succeeding second. The constant horizontal velocity of the blue ball has no effect on its accelerated vertical motion. Therefore, the vertical motion of the blue ball can be analyzed exactly the same as the vertical motion of the red ball. Example Problem: If an arrow is fired from a bow with a perfectly horizontal velocity of 60.0 m/s and the arrow was 2.00 m above the ground when the it was released, how far will the arrow fly horizontally before it strikes the ground? Solution: This problem is solved by determining how long it takes the arrow to fall to the ground in exactly the same manner as if the arrow was dropped with no horizontal velocity. The time required for the arrow to fall to the ground will be the same time that the arrow flies horizontally at 60.0 m/s, so (cid:114)2d (cid:115) d = 1 a = (2)(2.00 m) The time required for the fall is multiplied by the horizontal velocity to get the horizontal distance. dhorizontal = (vhorizontal)(time) = (60.0 m/s)(0.639 s) = 38.3 m Example Problem: A rock was thrown horizontally from a 100.0 m high cliff. It strikes the ground 90.0 m from the base of the cliff. At what speed was it thrown? Solution: We can calculate how long it takes for a rock to free fall 100.0 m and then divide this time into the horizontal distance to get the horizontal velocity. (cid:114)2d (cid:115) a = d t = t = v = (2)(100.0 m) = 19.9 m/s 
Summary 	  • Perpendicular components of vectors do not influence each other. • The horizontal motion of a projectile does not influence its free fall.

Projectile  Motion for an  Object  Launched at an  Angle 	  When an object is projected from rest at an upward angle, its initial velocity can be resolved into two components. These two components operate independently of each other. The upward velocity undergoes constant downward acceleration which will result in it rising to a highest point and then falling backward to the ground. The horizontal motion is constant velocity motion and undergoes no changes due to gravity.The analysis of the motion involves dealing with the two motions independently. Example Problem: A cannon ball is fired with an initial velocity of 100. m/s at an angle of 45° above the horizontal. What maximum height will it reach and how far will it fly horizontally? Solution: The first step in the analysis of this motion is to resolve the initial velocity into its vertical and horizontal components. vi−up = (100. m/s)(sin45◦) = (100. m/s)(0.707) = 70.7 m/s vi−horizontal = (100. m/s)(cos45◦) = (100. m/s)(0.707) = 70.7 m/s We will deal with the vertical motion first. The vertical motion is symmetrical. As the object rises to its highest point and then falls back down, it will travel the same distance in each direction, and take the same amount of time. This is often hard to accept, but the amount of time the object takes to come to a stop at its highest point is the same amount of time it takes to return to where it was launched from. Similarly, the initial velocity upward will be the same magnitude (opposite in direction) as the final velocity when it returns to its original height. There are several ways we could approach the upward motion. We could calculate the time it would take gravity to bring the initial velocity to rest. Or, we could calculate the time it would take gravity to change the initial velocity from +70.7 m/s to -70.0 m/s. Yet another way would be to calculate the time it takes for the object to return to its original height. v f = vi + at If we calculate the time required for the ball to rise up to its highest point and come to rest, the initial velocity is 70.7 m/s and the final velocity is 0 m/s. Since we have called the upward velocity positive, then the acceleration must be negative or -9.80 m/s2. so t = v f−vi a t = v f−vi a = 0 m/s−70.7 m/s −9.80 m/s2 = 7.21 s Since this is the time required for the cannon ball to rise up to its highest point and come to rest, then the time required for the entire trip up and down would be double this value, or 14.42 s. The maximum height reached can be calculated by multiplying the time for the upward trip by the average vertical velocity. Since the object’s velocity at the top is 0 m/s, the average upward velocity during the trip up is one-half the initial velocity. vup−ave =(cid:0) 1 (cid:1) (70.7 m/s) = 35.3 m/s height = (vup−ave)(tup) = (35.3 m/s)(7.21 s) = 255 m The horizontal distance traveled during the flight is calculated by multiplying the total time by the constant horizontal velocity. dhorizontal = (14.42 s)(70.7 m/s) = 1020 m Example Problem: A golf ball was hit into the air with an initial velocity of 4.47 m/s at an angle of 66° above the horizontal. How high did the ball go and how far did it fly horizontally? Solution: vi−up = (4.47 m/s)(sin66◦) = (4.47 m/s)(0.913) = 4.08 m/s vi−hor = (4.47 m/s)(cos66◦) = (4.47 m/s)(0.407) = 1.82 m/s tup = v f−vi a = 0 m/s−4.08 m/s −9.80 m/s2 = 0.416 s (cid:1) (4.08 m/s) = 2.04 m/s vup−ave =(cid:0) 1 height = (vup−ave)(tup) = (2.04 m/s)(0.416 s) = 0.849 m ttotal trip = (2)(0.416 s) = 0.832 s dhorizontal = (0.832 s)(1.82 m/s) = 1.51 m Example Problem: Suppose a cannon ball is fired downward from a 50.0 m high cliff at an angle of 45° with an initial velocity of 80.0 m/s. How far horizontally will it land from the base of the cliff? Solution: In this case, the initial vertical velocity is downward and the acceleration due to gravity will increase this downward velocity. vi−down = (80.0 m/s)(sin45◦) = (80.0 m/s)(0.707) = 56.6 m/s vi−hor = (80.0 m/s)(cos45◦) = (80.0 m/s)(0.707) = 56.6 m/s d = vi−downt + 1 Changing to standard quadratic form yields 4.9t2 + 56.6t − 50.0 = 0 This equation can be solved with the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula will produce two possible solutions for t: t = −b+ √ b2 − 4ac and t = −b− (cid:112)(56.6)2 − (4)(4.9)(−50) √ b2 − 4ac −56.6+ (2)(4.9) = 0.816 s t = The other solution to the quadratic formula is -12.375 s. Clearly, the cannon ball doesn’t take -12 seconds to fly. Therefore, we take the positive answer. Using the quadratic formula will give you two answers; be careful to think about the answer you get does it make sense? To solve the problem, we plug the speed and time into the equation for distance: dhorizontal = (0.816 s)(56.6 m/s) = 46.2 m 
Summary 	  • To calculate projectile motion at an angle, first resolve the initial velocity into its horizontal and vertical components. • Analysis of projectile motion involves dealing with two motions independently. • Vertical components will always have the acceleration of gravity acting on them. • Vertical motion is symmetrical the distance and time are the same in the rise as in the fall; the final velocity will have the same magnitude as the initial velocity but in the opposite direction. • Horizontal components will never be effected by gravity; it is constant velocity motion. 
Questions 	  The following video shows the famous "shoot the monkey" demonstration. The idea is that if a cannon aimed at a monkey, and fired at exactly the moment the monkey drops, the monkey will always be hit by the cannon ball.

Weather satellites, like the one shown above, are found miles above the earth’s surface. Satellites can be polar orbiting, meaning they cover the entire Earth asynchronously, or geostationary, in which they hover over the same spot on the equator. 
Circular  Motion 	  The earth is a sphere. If you draw a horizontal straight line from a point on the surface of the earth, the surface of the earth drops away from the line. The distance that the earth drops away from the horizontal line is very small –so small, in fact, that we cannot represent it well in a drawing. In the sketch below, if the blue line is 1600 m, the amount of drop (the red line) would be 0.20 m. If the sketch were drawn to scale, the red line would be too short to see. When an object is launched exactly horizontally in projectile motion, it travels some distance horizontally before it strikes the ground. In the present discussion, we wish to imagine a projectile fired horizontally on the surface of the earth such that while traveling 1600 m horizontally, the object would fall exactly 0.20 m. If this could occur, then the object would fall exactly the amount necessary during its horizontal motion to remain at the surface of the earth, but not touching it. In such a case, the object would travel all the way around the earth continuously and circle the earth, assuming there were no obstacles, such as mountains. What initial horizontal velocity would be necessary for this to occur? We first calculate the time to fall the 0.20 m: (cid:114)2d (cid:115) t = a = (2)(0.20 m) The horizontal velocity necessary to travel 1600 m in 0.20 s is 8000 m/s. Thus, the necessary initial horizontal velocity is 8000 m/s. In order to keep an object traveling in a circular path, there must be an acceleration toward the center of the circle. This acceleration is called centripetal acceleration. In the case of satellites orbiting the earth, the centripetal acceleration is caused by gravity. If you were swinging an object around your head on a string, the centripetal acceleration would be caused by your hand pulling on the string toward the center of the circle. It is important to note that the object traveling in a circle has a constant speed but does not have a constant velocity. This is because direction is part of velocity; when an object changes its direction, it is changing its velocity. Hence the object’s acceleration. The acceleration in the case of uniform circular motion is the change in the direction of the velocity, but not its magnitude. For an object traveling in a circular path, the centripetal acceleration is directly related to the square of the velocity of the object and inversely related to the radius of the circle. ac = v2 r Taking a moment to consider the validity of this equation can help to clarify what it means. Imagine a yo-yo. Instead of using it normally, let it fall to the end of the string, and then spin it around above your head. If we were to increase the speed at which we rotate our hand, we increase the velocity of the yo-yo it is spinning faster. As it spins faster, it also changes direction faster. The acceleration increases. Now let’s think about the bottom of the equation: the radius. If we halve the length of the yo-yo string (bring the yo-yo closer to us), we make the yo-yo’s velocity greater. Again, it moves faster, which increases the acceleration. If we make the string longer again, this decreases the acceleration. We now understand why the relationship between the radius and the acceleration is an inverse relationship as we decrease the radius, the acceleration increases, and visa versa. t = (2)(2)(3.14)(1.15 m) Example Problem: A ball at the end of a string is swinging in a horizontal circle of radius 1.15 m. The ball makes exactly 2.00 revolutions per second. What is its centripetal acceleration? Solution: We first determine the velocity of the ball using the facts that the circumference of the circle is 2πr and the ball goes around exactly twice per second. v = (2)(2πr) We then use the velocity and radius in the centripetal acceleration equation. ac = v2 Example Problem: The moon’s nearly circular orbit around the earth has a radius of about 385,000 km and a period of 27.3 days. Calculate the acceleration of the moon toward the earth. Solution: v = 2πr = 14.4 m/s r = (14.4 m/s)2 T = (2)(3.14)(3.85×108 m) r = (1020 m/s)2 (27.3 d)(24.0 h/d)(3600 s/h) = 1020 m/s ac = v2 As shown in the previous example, the velocity of an object traveling in a circle can be calculated by v = 
 	  Where r is the radius of the circle and T is the period (time required for one revolution). This equation can be incorporated into the equation for centripetal acceleration as shown below. ac = v2 r = ( 2πr 
T )2 	  r = 4π2r 
Summary 	  • In order to keep an object traveling in a circular path, there must be an acceleration toward the center of the circle. This acceleration is called centripetal acceleration . • The acceleration in the case of uniform circular motion changes the direction of the velocity but not its magnitude. • Formulas for centripetal acceleration are ac = v2 r and ac = 4π2r T 2 .

Questions 	  is necessary to keep the car on the curve? once in 1.18 s, what is the centripetal acceleration? • circular motion: A movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. • centripetal acceleration: The acceleration toward the center that keeps an object following a circular path. • Define centripetal force. • Solve problems involving centripetal force. • Explain the difference between centripetal and centrifugal forces. Jupiter’s moons and ring materials follow all the laws of physics, including centripetal force and centripetal acceleration. 
Centripetal  Force 	  Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration. Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain. Newton’s second law shows the relationship between force and acceleration, F = ma. Since we have formulas expressing the relationships for centripetal acceleration, they can easily be altered to show the relationships for centripetal force. ac = v2 and ac = 4π2r r and F = ma so Fc = mv2 r 
Common  Misconceptions 	  Many people incorrectly use the term centrifugal force instead of centripetal force. Often, you will hear the term centrifugal force used to describe the outward force pushing an object away from the center of a circle. In reality, however, centrifugal forces are inertial, or fictional, forces. They only exist in the frame of reference of the object that is moving and, even then, are theoretical. Physicists dealing in a moving frame of reference use centrifugal forces to ease calculations. For a great explanation of the difference between centrifugal and centripetal force, see this video: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Questions 	  needed to keep this runner on the curve and what supplies this force? string is 1.00 m and the maximum force the string can withstand without breaking is 25.0 N. What is the maximum speed the object may be swung without breaking the string? • centripetal force: The component of force acting on a body in curvilinear motion that is directed toward the center of curvature or axis of rotation. • State the relationships that exist between velocity, acceleration, and displacement in simple harmonic motion. • Calculate any of the variables in the equation F = kx, when given the other two. • Understand the relationship between simple harmonic motion and circular motion. A Foucault pendulum is a pendulum suspended from a long wire, that is sustained in motion over long periods. Due to the axial rotation of the Earth, the plane of motion of the pendulum shifts at a rate and direction dependent on its latitude: clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. At the poles the plane rotates once per day, while at the equator it does not rotate at all. 
Simple  Harmonic  Motion 	  Many objects vibrate or oscillate –an object on the end of a spring, a tuning fork, the balance wheel of a watch, a pendulum, the strings of a guitar or a piano. When we speak of a vibration or oscillation, we mean the motion of an object that repeats itself, back and forth, over the same path. This motion is also known as simple harmonic motion, often denoted as SHM. A useful design for examining SHM is an object attached to the end of a spring and laid on a surface. The surface supports the object so its weight (the force of gravity) doesn’t get involved in the forces. The spring is considered to be weightless. The position shown in the illustration is the equilibrium position. This position is the middle, where the spring is not exerting any force either to the left or to the right. If the object is pulled to the right, the spring will be stretched and exert a restoring force to return to the weight to the equilibrium position. Similarly, if the object is pushed to the left, the spring will be compressed and will exert a restoring force to return the object to its original position. The magnitude of the restoring force, F, in either case must be directly proportional to the distance, x, the spring has been stretched or compressed. (A spring must be chosen that obeys this requirement.) 
F = −kx 	  In the equation above, the constant of proportionality is called the spring constant. The spring constant is represented by k and its units are N/m. This equation is accurate as long as the spring is not compressed to the point that the coils touch nor stretched beyond elasticity. Suppose the spring is compressed a distance x = A, and then released. The spring exerts a force on the mass pushing it toward the equilibrium position. When the mass is at the maximum displacement position, velocity is zero because the mass is changing direction. At the position of maximum displacement, the restoring force is at its greatest the acceleration of the mass will be greatest. As the mass moves toward the equilibrium position, the displacement decreases, so the restoring force decreases and the acceleration decreases. When the mass reaches the equilibrium position, there is no restoring force. The acceleration, therefore, is zero, but the mass is moving at its highest velocity. Because of its inertia, the mass will continue past the equilibrium position, and stretch the string. As the spring is stretched further, the displacement increases, the restoring force increases, the acceleration toward the equilibrium position increases, and the velocity decreases. Eventually, when the mass reaches its maximum displacement on this side of the equilibrium position, the velocity has returned to zero and the restoring force and acceleration have returned to the maximum. In a frictionless system, the mass would oscillate forever, but in a real system, friction gradually reduces the motion until the mass returns to the equilibrium position and motion stops. Imagine an object moving in uniform circular motion. Remember the yo-yo we spin over our heads? In your mind, turn the circle so that you are looking at it on edge; imagine you are eight feet tall, and the yo-yo’s circle is exactly at eye level. The object will move back forth in the same way that a mass moves in SHM. It moves consistently from the far left to the far right until you stop spinning the yo-yo. Another example is to imagine a glowing light bulb riding a merry-go-round at night. You are sitting in a chair at some distance from the merry-go-round so that the only part of the system that is visible to you is the light bulb. The movement of the light will appear to you to be back and forth in simple harmonic motion. Circular motion and simple harmonic motion have a lot in common. The greatest displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position is called the amplitude of the motion. One cycle refers to the complete to-and-fro motion that starts at some position, goes all the way to one side, then all the way to the other side, and returns to the original position. The period , T, is the time required for one cycle and the frequency, f , is the number of cycles that occur in exactly 1.00 second. The frequency, in this case, is the reciprocal of the period. f =

Using kinematic equations and the understanding that vertical acceleration does not affect horizontal velocity, it is easy to calculate the height from which an object is launched or the location at which it will land. These equations can also be used to understand how satellites maintain a consistent orbit; circular motion and centripetal acceleration equations can also serve this purpose. Perhaps most interestingly, everything that undergoes periodic motion—including springs, pendulums, rotating disks, and orbiting satellites—can be understood using the simple harmonic motion equations. .jpg.html . ageGallery.html . 
 	  We know that gravity is the force that keeps us from falling away from the surface of the Earth. The force of gravity reaches a significant distance, though as the distance increases, the force decreases by the square of the distance. However, Earth’s mass is so large, and its gravity so strong, that the force reaches beyond the surface and atmosphere into space. The Gemini 4 flight of June 1965, NASA’s second manned space flight, circled the planet 66 times in four days. Astronaut Edward H. White II was the first American to take a space walk, held in place in Earth’s orbit because of the force of gravity. • Describe Kepler’s three laws. • Calculate satellite periods given average radius and vice versa. Though a drawing, not an accurate portrayal of the solar system, the elliptical appearance of the orbits is correct. The elliptical orbits around the sun are not limited to the planets; comets, asteroids, and other orbiting objects also follow elliptical paths. 
Kepler’s  Laws 	  Fifty years before Newton proposed his three laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation, Johannes Kepler (1571 –1630) published a number of astronomical papers with detailed descriptions of the motions of the planIncluded in those papers were the findings that we now refer to as Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion. These ets. are summarized below. Kepler’s First Law: The path of each planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus. Though it seems at first glance that this law is incorrect (the sun appears to be in the center of our orbit), remember that a perfect circle is an ellipse with the foci in the same place. Since the Earth’s orbit is nearly circular, the sun appears to stay in the center. Kepler’s Second Law: As a planet moves in its orbit, a line from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. The image above illustrates this relationship. Though the green wedges may appear significantly different in area, Kepler’s Second Law states that the areas are equal if the planet travels along the perimeter of the segments in equal periods of time. From this, we can clearly see that the planet moves with greater speed when it is near the sun and slower when it is far away. Kepler’s Third Law: The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets revolving around the sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average distance from the sun. (cid:18)T1 (cid:19)2 
T2 	  (cid:18)r1 (cid:19)3 r2 = This is the only one of Kepler’s three laws that deals with more than one planet at a time. This equation can be reworked to reveal that the ratio between the period and the radius of the planet’s orbit is always the same: (T1)2 (r1)3 = (T2)2 (r2)3 In truth, it has been calculated that this ratio holds for all the planets in our solar system, in addition to moons and other satellites. Example Problem: The planet Venus has a mean distance from the sun of 108.2 ×106 km and a period of 0.615 years. The planet Mars has an average mean distance from the sun of 227.9 ×106 km and a period of 1.88 years. Do these planets follow Kepler’s third law? Solution: The average mean distance of Venus divided by the average mean distance of Mars = 0.475. The period of Venus divided by the period of Mars = 0.327. The square of the period ratio is 0.107 and the cube of the mean distance ratio is 0.107. planets follow Kepler’s third law. 
Summary 	  • Kepler’s First Law: The path of each planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus. • Kepler’s Second Law: Each planet moves such that an imaginary line drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal periods of time. • Kepler’s Third Law: The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets revolving around the sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average distance from the sun.

In 1798, Henry Cavendish designed and created an apparatus and experiment to determine the density of the planet and the value of the gravitational constant, G. His apparatus involved a light, rigid rod about 2-feet long with two small lead spheres attached to the ends. The rod was suspended by a thin wire. When the rod rotated, the twisting of the wire pushed backwards to restore the rod to the original position. 
Force of  Gravity 	  In the mid-1600’s, Newton wrote that the sight of a falling apple made him think of the problem of the motion of the planets. He recognized that the apple fell straight down because the earth attracted it and thought this same force of attraction might apply to the moon. It further occured to him that motion of the planets might be controlled by the gravity of the sun. He eventually proposed the universal law of gravitational attraction as 
F =  	  m1m2 d2 where m1 and m2 are the masses being attracted, d is the distance between the centers of the masses, G is the universal gravitational constant, and F is the force of attraction. The formula for gravitational attraction applies equally to two rocks resting near each other on the earth and to the planets and the sun. The value for the universal gravitational constant, G, was determined by Henry Cavendish (using the apparatus described in the introduction) to be 6.67 × The moon is being pulled toward the earth and the earth toward the moon with the same force but in the opposite direction. The force of attraction between the two bodies produces a greater acceleration of the moon than the earth because the moon has smaller mass. Even though the moon is constantly falling toward the earth, it never gets any closer. This is because the velocity of the moon is perpendicular to the radius of the earth (as shown in the image above) and therefore the moon is moving away from the earth. The distance the moon moves away from the orbit line is exactly the same distance that the moon falls in the time period. This is true of all satellites and is the reason objects remain in orbit. In the case of orbiting bodies, the centripetal force is the gravitational force, and they undergo imperfect circular motion. Example Problem: Since we know the force of gravity on a 1.00 kg ball resting on the surface of the earth is 9.80 N, and we know the radius of the earth is 6380 km, we can use the equation for gravitational force to calculate the mass of the earth.

Orbital  Motion 	  We commonly talk about satellites orbiting Earth. But what does that really mean? When a satellite, space shuttle, or some other object is orbiting a planet, it maintains a circular orbit around the planet a constant distance off the surface. Manmade satellites typically orbit between 200 and 400 miles. For example, the International Space Station (ISS) orbits at 370 km, or 230 miles. The ISS has an average velocity of 7.66 km/sec tangential to its orbit. An orbiting satellite is close enough to be acted upon by Earth’s gravity. This force is constantly pulling the satellite in toward the center of the earth –it is a centripetal force and causes a centripetal acceleration. At this height, however, Earth’s gravity is only about 8.7 m/s2. As was discussed in Motion in Two Dimensions: Circular Motion, the velocity and centripetal acceleration are perpendicular. NASA scientists, in designing this and all other satellites, must carefully calculate the velocity necessary to keep the satellite orbiting. To keep the satellite from falling back to Earth, the horizontal velocity must be large enough. The satellite must travel far enough horizontally that it follows the curve of the planet, as shown below. When the satellite is orbiting in this way, it is falling straight down towards Earth. Imagine standing in an elevator when the bottom drops out from under you. The elevator, you, and anything you might have had with you all fall straight down. If you had a backpack on your back, the weight of the books can no longer be felt because the books are in free fall as well. A similar thing is happening in the space shuttle or orbiting satellite, where objects are weightless. For a full description of weight, look at Forces: Mass versus Weight. In sum, weight is the result of the force of gravity being opposed by the normal force. As we just learned, objects in orbit are in freefall; they have nothing exerting a normal force against them and thus no weight. Sample Problem: Consider a satellite of the earth orbiting at 225 km above the surface of the earth. Keep in mind that this is NOT the radius of the satellite’s orbit. The satellite’s orbit is measured from the center of the earth, so its radius will be the radius of the earth, 6.37 × 106 m, plus the 225,000 m. The mass of the earth is 5.98 × 1024 kg. What is the velocity of the satellite? Solution: Since the centripetal force keeping this satellite traveling in orbit is provided by the gravitational force of the earth, we can set the formula for centripetal force equal to the formula for gravitational force.

Summary 	  • A satellite in a circular orbit accelerates toward the object it is orbiting at a rate equal to the acceleration of gravity at its orbital radius. • As in a falling elevator, objects in orbit are in constant freefall. • Objects in free fall have no normal force acting upon them, and thus no weight.

The orbital radius of a geosynchronous satellite is 4.23 × 107m (measured from the center of the earth). Kepler described the motion of the planets back in the 17th century, but it wasn’t until Isaac Newton created his Law of Universal Gravitation that we had a solid explanation of the reason for planetary motion. This chapter explained Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion and the fact that all objects, regardless of size or distance, exert a gravitational pull on each other. Incorporating the lessons of circular motion from earlier, we explored satellite orbits and the sensation of weightlessness in space. _Diagram.svg . 
Momentum 	  We use the terms “momentum” and “impulse” in daily life, but they have more specific meanings when used in physics. Nonetheless, we can understand the ideas without proper definitions. If a speeding car comes to a rapid stop, we understand that the people in the car have a forward momentum: after the car stops, they continue to go forward. We usually use the word “impact” to refer to a result: cars have a negative impact on the environment, airbags can impact us by saving our lives. In physics, however, “impact” refers to the time over which a force is applied. Airbags do save lives, but they do so by reducing the impact of the passenger hitting the wheel or dash, by increasing the time over which the force of the crash affects the passenger. • Define momentum. • Define impulse. • Given mass and velocity of an object, calculate momentum. • Calculate the change in momentum of an object. • State the relationship that exists between the change in momentum and impulse. • Using the momentum-impulse theorem and given three of the four variables, calculate the fourth. Rachel Flatt performs a layback spin at the 2011 Rostelecom Cup in Moscow, Russia. When an ice skater spins, angular momentum must be conserved. When her arms or feet are far away from her body, her spin slows; when she brings her arms and feet close in to her body, she spins faster. 
Momentum and  Impulse 	  If a bowling ball and a ping-pong ball are each moving with a velocity of 5 mph, you intuitively understand that it will require more effort to stop the bowling ball than the ping pong ball because of the greater mass of the bowling ball. Similarly, if you have two bowling balls, one moving at 5 mph and the other moving at 10 mph, you know it will take more effort to stop the ball with the greater speed. It is clear that both the mass and the velocity of a moving object contribute to what is necessary to change the motion of the moving object. The product of the mass and velocity of an object is called its momentum. Momentum is a vector quantity that has the same direction as the velocity of the object and is represented by a lowercase letter p. p = mv The momentum of a 0.500 kg ball moving with a velocity of 15.0 m/s will be p = mv = (0.500 kg)(15.0 m/s) = 7.50 kg· m/s You should note that the units for momentum are kg·m/s. According to Newton’s first law, the velocity of an object cannot change unless a force is applied. If we wish to change the momentum of a body, we must apply a force. The longer the force is applied, the greater the change in momentum. The impulse is the quantity defined as the force multiplied by the time it is applied. It is a vector quantity that has the same direction as the force. The units for impulse are N·s but we know that Newtons are also kg·m/s2 and so N·s = (kg·m/s2)(s) = kg·m/s. Impulse and momentum have the same units; when an impulse is applied to an object, the momentum of the object changes and the change of momentum is equal to the impulse. 
Example  Problem:  Calculating  Momentum 	  A 0.15 kg ball is moving with a velocity of 35 m/s. Find the momentum of the ball. Solution: p = mv = (0.15 kg)(35 m/s) = 5.25 kg· m/s Example Problem: If a ball with mass 5.00 kg has a momentum of 5.25 kg· m/s, what is its velocity? 
Solution: v = p 	  m = 5.25 kg·m/s = 14,000 N t = (100. kg)(7.0 m/s) It should be clear from the equation relating impulse to change in momentum, Ft = ∆mv, that any amount of force would (eventually) bring a moving object to rest. If the force is very small, it must be applied for a long time, but a greater force can bring the object to rest in a shorter period of time. If you jump off a porch and land on your feet with your knees locked in the straight position, your motion would be brought to rest in a very short period of time and thus the force would need to be very large –large enough, perhaps, to damage your joints or bones. Suppose that when you hit the ground, your velocity was 7.0 m/s and that velocity was brought to rest in 0.05 seconds. If your mass is 100. kg, what force was required to bring you to rest? 
F = ∆mv 	  If, on the other hand, when your feet first touched the ground, you allowed your knees to flex so that the period of time over which your body was brought to rest is increased, then the force on your body would be smaller and it would be less likely that you would damage your legs. Suppose that when you first touch the ground, you allow your knees to bend and extend the stopping time to 0.50 seconds. What force would be required to bring you to rest this time? 
F = ∆mv 	  With the longer period of time for the force to act, the necessary force is reduced to one-tenth of what was needed before. Extending the period of time over which a force acts in order to lessen the force is a common practice in design. Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase. The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop. Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time. These changes all serve to decrease the amount of force it takes to stop the momentum in a car crash, which consequently saves lives. Example Problem: An 0.15 kg baseball is thrown horizontally at 40. m/s and after it is struck by a bat, it is traveling at -40. m/s. t = (100. kg)(7.0 m/s) = 1400 N (a) What impulse did the bat deliver to the ball? (b) If the contact time of the bat and bat was 0.00080 seconds, what was the average force the bat exerted on the ball? (c) Calculate the average acceleration of the ball during the time it was in contact with the bat. Solution: We can calculate the change in momentum and give the answer as impulse because we know that the impulse is equal to the change in momentum. (a) p = m∆v = (0.15 kg)(−40. m/s− 40. m/s) = (0.15 kg)(−80. m/s) = −12 kg· m/s The minus sign indicates that the impulse was in the opposite direction of the original throw. (b) F = ∆mv Again, the negative sign indicates the force was in the opposite direction of the original throw. (c) a = F −12 kg·m/s t = m = −15000 N

For this whale to leap out of the water, something underwater must be moving in the opposite direction, and intuition tells us it must be moving with relatively high velocity. The water that moves downward is pushed downward by the whale’s tail, and that allows the whale to rise up. 
Conservation of  Momentum in  One  Dimension 	  When impulse and momentum were introduced, we used an example of a batted ball to discuss the impulse and momentum change that occurred with the ball. At the time, we did not consider what had happened to the bat. According to Newton’s third law, however, when the bat exerted a force on the ball, the ball also exerted an equal and opposite force on the bat. Since the time of the collision between bat and ball is the same for the bat and for the ball, then we have equal forces (in opposite directions) exerted for equal times on the ball AND the bat. That means that the impulse exerted on the bat is equal and opposite (-Ft) to the impulse on the ball (Ft) and that also means that there was a change in momentum of the bat [−∆(mv)BAT] that was equal and opposite to the change in momentum of the ball [∆(mv)BALL]. The change in momentum of the ball is quite obvious because it changes direction and flies off at greater speed. However, the change in momentum of the bat is not obvious at all. This occurs primarily because the bat is more massive than the ball. Additionally, the bat is held firmly by the batter, so the batter’s mass can be combined with the mass of the bat. Since the bat’s mass is so much greater than that of the ball, but they have equal and opposite forces, the bat’s final velocity is significantly smaller than that of the ball. Consider another system: that of two ice skaters. If we have one of the ice skaters exert a force on the other skater, the force is called an internal force because both the object exerting the force and the object receiving the force are inside the system. In a closed system such as this, momentum is always conserved. The total final momentum always equals the total initial momentum in a closed system. Conversely, if we defined a system to contain just one ice skater, putting the other skater outside the system, this is not a closed system. If one skater pushes the other, the force is an external force because the receiver of the force is outside the system. Momentum is not guaranteed to be conserved unless the system is closed. In a closed system, momentum is always conserved. Take another example: if we consider two billiard balls colliding on a billiard table and ignore friction, we are dealing with a closed system. The momentum of ball A before the collision plus the momentum of ball B before collision will equal the momentum of ball A after collision plus the momentum of ball B after collision. This is called the law of conservation of momentum and is given by the equation pAbefore + pBbefore = pAafter + pBafter Example Problem: Ball A has a mass of 2.0 kg and is moving due west with a velocity of 2.0 m/s while ball B has a mass of 4.0 kg and is moving west with a velocity of 1.0 m/s. Ball A overtakes ball B and collides with it from behind. After the collision, ball A is moving westward with a velocity of 1.0 m/s. What is the velocity of ball B after the collision? Solution: Because of the law of conservation of momentum, we know that pAbefore + pBbefore = pAafter + pBafter A + mBv(cid:48) 
 	  (cid:48) m/s) (cid:48) kg· m/s (cid:48) = 8.0− 2.0 = 6.0 (cid:48) = 1.5 m/s . mAvA + mBvB = mAv(cid:48) (2.0 kg)(2.0 m/s) + (4.0 kg)(1.0 m/s) = (2.0 kg)(1.0 m/s) + (4.0 kg)(vB vB After the collision, ball B is moving westward at 1.5 m/s. Example Problem: A railroad car whose mass is 30,000. kg is traveling with a velocity of 2.2 m/s due east and collides with a second railroad car whose mass is also 30,000. kg and is at rest. If the two cars stick together after the collision, what is the velocity of the two cars? Solution: Note that since the two trains stick together, the final mass is mA+mB, and the final velocity for each object is the same. Thus the conservation of momentum equation, mAvA + mBvB = mAv(cid:48) 
B, can be rewritten m Av A + 	  mBvB = (mA + mB)v(cid:48) (30,000. kg)(2.2 m/s) + (30,000. kg)(0 m/s) = (60,000. kg)(v(cid:48) m/s) v(cid:48) = 66000 After the collision, the two cars move off together toward the east with a velocity of 1.1 m/s. A + mBv(cid:48) 
Summary 	  • A closed system is one in which both the object exerting a force and the object receiving the force are inside the system. • In a closed system, momentum is always conserved.

In a game of billiards, it is important to be able to visualize collisions in two dimensions –the best players not only know where the target ball is going but also where the cue ball will end up. 
Conservation of  Momentum in  Two  Dimensions 	  Conservation of momentum in all closed systems is valid, regardless of the directions of the objects before and after they collide. Most objects are not confined to a single line, like trains on a rail. Rather, many objects, like billiard balls or cars, can move in two dimensions. Conservation of momentum for these objects can also be calculated; momentum is a vector and collisions of objects in two dimensions can be represented by axial vector components. To Example Problem: A 2.0 kg ball, A, is moving with a velocity of 5.00 m/s due west. It collides with a stationary ball, B, also with a mass of 2.0 kg. After the collision, ball A moves off at 30° south of west while ball B moves off at 60° north of west. Find the velocities of both balls after the collision. Solution: Since ball B is stationary before the collision, then the total momentum before the collision is equal to momentum of ball A. The momentum of ball A before collision is shown in red below, and can be calculated to bep = mv = (2.00 kg)(5.00 m/s) = 10.0 kg m/s west Since momentum is conserved in this collision, the sum of the momenta of balls A and B after collsion must be 10.0 kg m/s west. pAafter = (10.0 kg m/s)(cos30◦) = (10.0 kg m/s)(0.866) = 8.66 kg m/s pBafter = (10.0 kg m/s)(cos60◦) = (10.0 kg m/s)(0.500) = 5.00 kg m/s To find the final velocities of the two balls, we divide the momentum of each by its mass. Therefore, vA = 4.3 m/s and vB = 2.5 m/s. Example Problem: A 1325 kg car moving north at 27.0 m/s collides with a 2165 kg car moving east at 17.0 m/s. The two cars stick together after the collision. What is the speed and direction of the two cars after the collision? Solution: 
Eastward momentum = (2165 kg)(17.0 m/s) = 36800 kg m/s 	  (cid:113) R = (35800)2 + (36800)2 = 51400 kg· m/s θ = sin−1 35800 velocity = p m = Example Problem: A 6.00 kg ball, A, moving at velocity 3.00 m/s due east collides with a 6.00 kg ball, B, at rest. After the collision, A moves off at 40.0° N of E and ball B moves off at 50.0° S of E. a. What is the momentum of A after the collision? b. What is the momentum of B after the collision? c. What are the velocities of the two balls after the collision? Solution: pinitial = mv = (6.00 kg)(3.00 m/s) = 18.0 kg m/s This is a right triangle in which the initial momentum is the length of the hypotenuse and the two momenta after the collision are the legs of the triangle. a. pA = (18.0 kg m/s)(cos40.0◦) = (18.0 kg m/s)(0.766) = 13.8 kg m/s b. pB = (18.0 kg m/s)(cos50.0◦) = (18.0 kg m/s)(0.643) = 11.6 kg m/s c. vA = 2.30 m/s vB = 1.93 m/s

What is the speed of ball B? each. One piece flies due south at 10 m/s while another pieces flies due north at 10 m/s. three of the resultant particles were moving to the right from the point of collision. The physicists conducting the experiment concluded there was at least one unseen particle moving to the left after the collision. Why did they conclude this? The momentum of an object, in physics terms, is mass multiplied by velocity. The impact of an object in a collision is the force it applies multiplied by the amount of time that impact is applied for. Whether movement is in one or two dimensions, the momentum of objects in a closed system is always conserved. The equations for this relationship were presented in this chapter. 
 	  If you push against a wall with all your strength for a full minute, how much work have you done? You might think you’ve worked very hard, but you actually haven’t completed any work, as defined by physics. Completing work from a physics standpoint requires not only force but also movement of an object. Imagine trying to lift a 400-pound object, such as the orange box shown above. Could you do that by yourself? If you simply leaned over and tried to pick it up, you’d never be able to. However, a series of pulleys such as the system shown above would allow a single person to lift a 400-pound object without any other assistance. This chapter examines physics’ definition of work, the relationship between work, force, and power, and the mechanical assistance provided by simple machines. • Define work. • Identify forces that are doing work. • Given two of the three variables in the equation, W = Fd, calculate the third. For some, the exciting part of a roller coaster is speeding down; for others it is the anticipation of climbing up. While the coaster is being towed up, it is having work done on it. The work done towing it to the top of the hill becomes potential energy stored in the coaster and that potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the coaster runs down from the top of the hill to the bottom. 
Work 	  The word work has both an everyday meaning and a specific scientific meaning. In the everyday use of the word, work would refer to anything which required a person to make an effort. In physics, however, work is defined as the force exerted on an object multiplied by the distance the object moves due to that force. 
W =  Fd 	  In the scientific definition of the word, if you push against an automobile with a force of 200 N for 3 minutes but the automobile does not move, then you have done no work. Multiplying 200 N times 0 meters yields zero work. If you are holding an object in your arms, the upward force you are exerting is equal to the object’s weight. If you hold the object until your arms become very tired, you have still done no work because you did not move the object in the direction of the force. When you lift an object, you exert a force equal to the object’s weight and the object moves due to that lifting force. If an object weighs 200. N and you lift it 1.50 meters, then your work is W = Fd = (200. N)(1.50 m) = 300. N m. One of the units you will see for work is shown above: the Newton meter (Nm). More often, however, units of work are given as the Joule (pronounced "jool") in honor of James Prescott Joule, a nineteenth century English physicist. A Joule is a kg·m2/s2. Example Problem: A boy lifts a box of apples that weighs 185 N. The box is lifted a height of 0.800 m. How much work did the boy do? Solution: W = Fd = (185 N)(0.800 m) = 148 N m = 148 Joules Work is done only if a force is exerted in the direction of motion. If the motion is perpendicular to the force, no work has been done. If the force is at an angle to the motion, then the component of the force in the direction of the motion is used to determine the work done. Example Problem: Suppose a 125 N force is applied to a lawnmower handle at an angle of 25° with the ground and the lawnmower moves along the surface of the ground. 
If the lawnmower moves 56 m, how much work was 	  done? Solution: The solution requires that we determine the component of the force that was in the direction of the motion of the lawnmower because the component of the force that was pushing down on the ground does not contribute to the work done. 
Summary 	  • Work is the force exerted on an object multiplied by the distance the object moves due to that force. • The unit for work is called the joule, which is a kg m2/s2. • If the force is at an angle to the motion, then the component of the force in the direction of the motion is used to determine the work done.

N, and the barge is pulled 100. m, how much work did the horse do? • work: A force is said to do work when it acts on a body so that there is a displacement of the point of application, however small, in the direction of the force. Thus a force does work when it results in movement. The work done by a constant force of magnitude F on a point that moves a distance d in the direction of the force is the product, W = Fd. • joule: The SI unit of work or energy, equal to the work done by a force of one Newton when its point of application moves through a distance of one meter in the direction of the force. • Define power. • Given two of the three variables in P = W t , calculate the third. Typical Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR), a type of nuclear power reactor originally built in the 1970s, produce individual windmills produces about 5 megawatts (5,000,000 Joules/second). 
Power 	  Power is defined as the rate at which work is done, or the rate at which energy is transformed. Power = 
Time 	  In SI units, power is measured in Joules per second, which is given a special name: the watt , W. Another unit for power that is fairly common is horsepower. Example Problem: A 70.0 kg man runs up a long flight of stairs in 4.0 s. The vertical height of the stairs is 4.5 m. Calculate the power output of the man in watts and horsepower. t = Fd t = F d t = Fv t = 3090 J t and W = Fd, we can use these formulas to derive a formula relating power to the speed of the object Solution: The force exerted must be equal to the weight of the man:mg = (70.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 686 N W = Fd = (686 N)(4.5 m) = 3090 N m = 3090 J 
Since  P =  	  that is produced by the power. 
P =  	  The velocity in this formula is the average speed of the object during the time interval. Example Problem: Calculate the power required of a 1400 kg car if the car climbs a 10◦ hill at a steady 80. km/h. Solution: First convert 80. km/h to m/s: 22.2 m/s. In 1.00 s, the car would travel 22.2 m on the road surface but the distance traveled upward would be (22.2 m)(sin 10◦) = (22.2 m)(0.174) = 3.86 m. The force in the direction of the upward motion is the weight of the car: (1400 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 13720 N. 
W =  Fd = (13720  N)(3.86 m) = 53,000  	  Since this work was done in 1.00 second, the power would be 53,000 W. This problem can be solved a different way; by calculating the upward component of the velocity of the car. The process would be similar, and start with finding the vertical component of the velocity vector: (22.2 m/s)(sin 10◦) = (22.2 m/s)(0.174) = 3.86 m/s. Again, calculate the weight of the car: (1400 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 13720 N. Finally, we could use the formula relating power to average speed to calculate power.

A "Rube Goldberg Machine" is a complex construction of many simple machines connected end-to-end in order to accomplish a particular activity. By design, Rube Goldberg Machines are far more intricate than necessary, and may be quite entertaining. Although this kind of construction may be extremely inefficient, simple machines commonly make work easier, and can be found all around us. 
Machines 	  A machine is an object or mechanical device that receives an input amount of work and transfers the energy to an output amount of work. For an ideal machine , the input work and output work are always the same. Remember that work is force times distance; even though the work input and output are equal, the input force does not necessarily equal the output force, nor does the input distance necessarily equal the output distance. Machines can be incredibly complex (think of robots or automobiles), or very simple, such as a can opener. A simple machine is a mechanical device that changes the magnitude or direction of the force. There are six simple machines that were first identified by Renaissance scientists: lever, pulley, inclined plane, screw, wedge, and wheel and axle. These six simple machines can be combined together to form compound machines. We use simple machines because they give us a mechanical advantage. Mechanical advantage is a measurement of the force amplification of a machine. In ideal machines, where there is no friction and the input work and output work are the same, (Effort Force)(Effort Distance) = (Resistance Force)(Resistance Distance) The effort is the work that you do. It is the amount of force you use times the distance over which you use it. The resistance is the work done on the object you are trying to move. Often, the resistance force is the force of gravity, and the resistance distance is how far you move the object. The ideal mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the ratio between the distances: 
A = effort distance 	  Again, the IMA assumes that there is no friction. In reality, the mechanical advantage is limited by friction; you must overcome the frictional forces in addition to the resistance force. Therefore, the actual mechanical advantage is the ratio of the forces: 
A = resistance force 	  When simple machines are combined to form compound machines, the product of each simple machine’s IMA gives the compound machine’s IMA. resistance distance effort force 
Lever 	  A lever consists of an inflexible length of material placed over a pivot point called a fulcrum. The resistance is the object to be moved (shown here in red), and is placed to one side of the fulcrum. The resistance distance in a lever is called the resistance arm. The effort is exerted elsewhere on the lever, and the effort distance is called the effort arm or effort lever arm. The lever shown here is the most common type of lever, a Class One Lever, but there are two other types of levers. If you would like to learn about the other types of levers, visit this website: URL The effort work is the effort force times the effort lever arm. Similarly, the resistance work is the resistance force times the resistance lever arm. If we ignore any friction that occurs where the lever pivots over the fulcrum, this is an ideal machine. Suppose the resistance force is 500. N, the resistance arm is 0.400 m, and the effort arm is 0.800m. We can calculate exactly how much effort force is required to lift the resistance in this system: 
Output  Work =  Input  Work 	  (Resistance Force)(Resistance Arm) = (Effort Force)(Effort Arm) (500. N)(0.400 m) = (x)(0.800 m) x = 250. N In this case, since the effort arm is twice as long as the resistance arm, the effort force required is only half the resistance force. This machine allows us to lift objects using only half the force required to lift the object directly against the pull of gravity. The distance the effort force is moved is twice as far as the resistance will move. Thus, the input work and the output work are equal. Example Problem: (a) How much force is required to lift a 500. kg stone using an ideal lever whose resistance arm is 10.0 cm and whose effort arm is 2.00 m? (b) What is the IMA? (c) If the actual effort force required to lift the stone was 305 N, what was the AMA? Solution: (a) (resistance force)(resistance arm) = (effort force)(effort arm) effort force = (resistance force)(resistance arm) = (4900 N)(0.100 m) (b) IMA = effort arm (c) AMA = resistance force (effort arm) resistance arm = 2.00 m effort force = 4900 N (2.00 m) = 245 N 
Pulley 	  A pulley is a wheel on an axle that is designed to rotate with movement of a cable along a groove at its circumference. Pulleys are used in a variety of ways to lift loads, apply forces, and to transmit power, but the simplest of pulleys serves only to reverse the direction of the effort force. It consists of a single pulley attached directly to a non-moving surface with a rope or cable through it. As a downward force is applied to one side of the pulley, the other side of the pulley, with the attached resistance force, is pulled upward. This type of pulley is called a fixed pulley, and is labeled A in the image below. Another type of pulley is shown above as B. This type of pulley is called a movable pulley. A set of pulleys assembled so they rotate independently on the same axle form a block. It is shown below in a system called a block and tackle. A block and tackle consists of two blocks, in which one block is fixed and the other is movable; the movable block is attached to the load. The IMA of a pulley system can be determined by counting the number of supporting strands of rope in the system. Be careful though, because in some systems the rope to which the effort force is applied will be a supporting strand, but in others it is not. For example, in the image above with the five pulley systems, the rope to which the effort force is applied (the one with the arrowhead) in A is not a supporting strand because it does not hold up any of the weight of the load. The IMA of A is 1. In B, however, the effort rope is supporting half of the weight of the load and is therefore a supporting strand. B has 2 supporting strands and an IMA of 2. Example Problem: Determine the IMA for C, D, and E in the image above. Solution: 
E = 3 supporting strands;  A = 3 	  If the direction of the effort force is in the same direction and the movement of the load, the effort strand will be a supporting strand. If the direction of the effort force is in the same direction as the resistance force, the effort strand is not a supporting strand. Look again at the five pulley systems to ensure this is true. Example Problem: Consider the pulley system sketched above. Given that the resistance force is 8500. N, find (a) the IMA. (b) the ideal effort force required to list this weight. (c) the distance the weight will rise if the effort force moves 1.0 m. (d) the AMA if the actual effort force is 2000. N. Solution: (a) Since the effort strand moves in the opposite direction of the resistance, it is not a supporting strand. Therefore, there are 5 supporting strands and that makes the IMA = 5. (b) Effort force = resistance force (c) Since the IMA is 5, the resistance distace will be 1/5 of the effort distance: the resistance distance is 1.0m/5 = (d) AMA = resistance force = 8500 N 
 	  effort force = 8500 N 
Wheel and  Axle 	  Just like it sounds, a wheel and axle is composed of two connected cylinders of different diameters. Since the wheel has a larger radius (distance) than the axle, the axle will always have a larger force than the wheel. The ideal mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle is dependent on the ratio between the radii: 
A =  Radius 	  wheelRadius axle 
Inclined  Plane 	  An inclined plane is also a simple machine. The resistance is the weight of the box resting on the inclined plane. In order to lift this box straight up, the effort force would need to be equal to its weight. However, assuming no friction, less effort (a smaller effort force) is required to slide the box up the incline. We know this intuitively; when movng boxes into a truck or onto a platform, we use angled platforms instead of lifting it straight up. The red triangle that hangs below the yellow box is a similar triangle to the inclined plane. The vector perpendicular to the inclined surface is the normal force and this normal force is equal to the portion of the weight of the box that is supported by the surface of the plane. The parallel force is the portion of the weight pushing the box down the plane and is, therefore, the effort force necessary to push the box up the plane. The effort distance, in the case of an inclined plane, is the length of the incline and the resistance distance is the vertical height the box would rise when it is pushed completely up the incline. The mechanical advantages for an inclined plane are 
A = effort distance 	  length resistance distance = vertical height = 1 sinθ weight applied force effort force = 
A = resistance force 	  Example Problem: Suppose, in the sketch above, the weight of the box is 400. N, the angle of the incline is 35°, and the surface is frictionless. Find the normal force (by finding the portion of the weight acting perpendicular to the plane), the parallel force, and the IMA for the box on this incline. Solution: Normal force = (400. N)(cos35◦) = (400. N)(0.82) = 330 N Parallel force = (400. N)(sin35◦) = (400. N)(0.57) = 230 N 
A = 1 	  sinθ = 1 sin35◦ = 1 
Wedge 	  A wedge is essentially two inclined planes back to back. Like an inclined plane, the IMA of a wedge is the ratio between the length of the wedge and the width of the wedge. Unlike an inclined plane, a wedge does not have a right angle; the IMA of a wedge cannot be found with sines. 
Screw 	  A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. When on a screw, inclined planes are called threads, which can be seen in the image above. The mechanical advantage of a screw increases with the density of the threads. The calculations to determine the IMA for a screw involve the circumference of the head of the screw and the thread width. When the screw is turned completely around one time, the screw penetrates by one thread width. So, if the circumference of the head of a screw is 3.0 cm and the thread width is 0.60 cm, then the IMA would be calculated by 
A = effort distance 	  When simple machines are joined together to make compound machines, the ideal mechanical advantage of the compound machine is found by multiplying the IMA’s of the simple machines. resistance distance = 3.0 cm

Work, measured in joules, is the measurement of the force exerted on an object in the direction it moves multiplied by the distance the object moved. Power, measured in joules per second, is the amount of work done divided by the time it took. Machines are devices that transform input work into equivalent amounts of output work in a different form; a small force over a large distance may become a large force over a small distance.

 	  The roller coaster shown here is a perfect example of different types of energy. Energy is either “potential,” meaning that it is stored and not yet in use, or “kinetic,” meaning that it is energy in motion or in use. Common sources of energy include gravity, chemicals, temperature differences, and solar energy. Energy continually surrounds us and can easily be converted from one form to another. The chemical energy of the food in your last meal, for example, has been transformed into a different form of chemical energy in your body, and may become kinetic energy at your soccer practice this afternoon. This roller coaster converts kinetic to potential energy, and vice versa. You will learn about several forms of energy and how they change from one to another in this chapter. • Define energy. • Define kinetic energy. • Given the mass and speed of an object, calculate its kinetic energy. • Solve problems involving kinetic energy. This military jet, like all jets, requires a large amount of work to get into the air; unlike most jets, this one is taking off from the deck of aircraft carrier. This requires careful coordination of the plane’s engines and the ship’s catapults and harnesses to accelerate the jet to about 270 km per hour in just two seconds. This incredible feat requires huge energy conversions. 
Kinetic  Energy 	  Energy is the capacity of an object to do work, and like work, energy’s unit is the joule (J). Energy exists in many different forms, but the one we think of most often when we think of energy is kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is often thought of as the energy of motion because it is used to describe objects that are moving. Remember, though, that energy is the ability of an object to do work. Any moving object has the capacity to cause another object to move if they collide. This ability is what we mean when we refer to an object’s kinetic energy: the ability to change another object’s motion or position simply by colliding with it. The equation of an object’s kinetic energy depends on its mass and velocity: 
E = 1 	  The kinetic energy of a moving object is directly proportional to its mass and directly proportional to the square of its velocity. This means that an object with twice the mass and equal speed will have twice the kinetic energy while an object with equal mass and twice the speed will have quadruple the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of an object can be changed by doing work on the object. The work done on an object equals the kinetic energy gain or loss by the object. This relationship is expressed in the work-energy theorem WNET = ∆KE. Example Problem: A farmer heaves a 7.56 kg bale of hay with a final velocity of 4.75 m/s. (a) What is the kinetic energy of the bale? (b) The bale was originally at rest. How much work was done on the bale to give it this kinetic energy? Solution: (a) KE = 1 (b) Work done = ∆KE = 85.3 Joules Example Problem: What is the kinetic energy of a 750. kg car moving at 50.0 km/h? Solution: (cid:1) (7.56 kg)(4.75)2 = 85.3 Joules (cid:17)(cid:16) 1000 m (cid:1) (750. kg)(13.9 m/s)2 = 72,300 Joules (cid:17)(cid:16) 1 h (cid:16) 50.0 km h = 13.9 m/s (cid:17) km 
E = 1 	  Example Problem: How much work must be done on a 750. kg car to slow it from 100. km/h to 50.0 km/h? Solution: From the previous example problem, we know that the KE of this car when it is moving at 50.0 km/h If the same car is going twice as fast, its KE will be four times as great because KE is is 72,300 Joules. proportional to the square of the velocity. Therefore, when this same car is moving at 100. km/h, its KE is (72,300 Joules) = 217,000 Joules. 
Summary 	  • Energy is the ability to change an object’s motion or position. • The energy of motion is called kinetic energy. • The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 1 • The work done on an object equals the kinetic energy gain or loss by the object, WNET = ∆KE.

Questions 	  force bringing it to rest? • energy: An indirectly observed quantity that is often understood as the ability of a physical system to do work. • kinetic energy: The energy an object has due to its motion. • Define potential energy. • Solve problems involving gravitational potential energy. • Solve problems involving the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa. Shooting an arrow from a bow requires work done on the bow by the shooter’s arm to bend the bow and thus produce potential energy. The release of the bow converts the potential energy of the bent bow into the kinetic energy of the flying arrow. 
Potential  Energy 	  When an object is held above the earth, it has the ability to make matter move because all you have to do is let go of the object and it will fall of its own accord. Since energy is defined as the ability to make matter move, this object has energy. This type of energy is stored energy and is called potential energy. An object held in a stretched rubber band also contains this stored energy. Specifically, a rubber band (and the bow pictured above) has elastic potential energy. If the stretched rubber band is released, the object will move. If you hold two positive charges near each other, their electromagnetic potential energy pushes them apart when you let go. Potential energy is stored in chemical bonds (chemical). When these bonds are broken, the excess energy is seen as molecular motion and heat. If a cannon ball is fired straight up into the air, it begins with a high kinetic energy. As the cannon ball rises, it slows down due to the force of gravity pulling it toward the earth. As the ball rises, its gravitational potential energy is increasing and its kinetic energy is decreasing. When the cannon ball reaches the top of its arc, its kinetic energy is zero and its potential energy is at the maximum. As gravity continues to pull the cannon ball toward the earth, the ball will fall downwards, causing its height to decrease and its speed to increase. The ball’s potential energy decreases and its kinetic energy increases. When the ball returns to its original height, its kinetic energy will be the same as when it started upward. When work is done on an object, the work may be converted into either kinetic or potential energy. Work resulting in motion is caused when the work is converted into kinetic energy, while work resulting in a change of position is caused by a conversion into potential energy. Work is also spent overcoming friction and that work would be converted into heat, but we will consider primarily frictionless systems. If we consider the potential energy of a bent stick or a stretched rubber band, the potential energy can be calculated by multiplying the force exerted by the stick or rubber band by the distance over which the force will be exerted. The formula for calculating this potential energy looks exactly like the formula for calculating work done: W = Fd. The only difference is that work is calculated when the object actually moves and potential energy is calculated when the system is still at rest, before any motion actually occurs. In the case of gravitational potential energy, the force exerted by the object is its weight and the distance it can travel is its height above the earth. Since the weight of an object is calculated by W = mg, then gravitational potential energy can be calculated by PE = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height the object will fall. Example Problem: A 3.00 kg object is lifted from the floor and placed on a shelf that is 2.50 m above the floor. (a) What was the work done in lifting the object? (b) What is the gravitational potential energy of the object sitting on the shelf? (c) If the object falls off the shelf and falls to the floor in the absence of air resistance, what will its velocity be when it hits the floor? Solution: weight of the object = mg = (3.00 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 29.4 N (a) W = Fd = (29.4 N)(2.50 m) = 73.5 J (b) PE = mgh = (3.00 kg)(9.80 m/s2)(2.50 m) = 73.5 J (c) KE = PE so 1 (cid:114)2KE (cid:115) v = m = (2)(73.5 J) Example Problem: A pendulum is constructed from a 7.58 kg bowling ball hanging on a 3.00 m long rope. The ball is pulled back until the rope makes an angle of 45◦ with the vertical. (a) What is the potential energy of the ball? (b) If the ball is released, how fast will it be traveling at the bottom of its arc? Solution: You can use trigonometry to find the vertical height of the ball in the pulled back position. This vertical height is found to be 0.877 m. PE = mgh = (7.58 kg)(9.80 m/s2)(0.877 m) = 65.1 J When the ball is released, the PE will be converted into KE as the ball swings through the arc. 
E = 1 	  = 4.14 m/s (cid:115) v = (2)(65.1 kg· m2/s2) 
Summary 	  • Stored energy is called potential energy. • Energy may be stored by holding an object elevated in a gravitational field or by holding it while a force is attempting to move it. • Potential energy may be converted to kinetic energy. • The formula for gravitational potential energy is PE = mgh. • In the absence of friction or bending, work done on an object must become either potential energy or kinetic energy or both.

Questions 	  have at the top? • potential energy: Otherwise known as stored energy, is the ability of a system to do work due to its position or internal structure. For example, gravitational potential energy is a stored energy determined by an object’s position in a gravitational field while elastic potential energy is the energy stored in a spring. • State the law of conservation of energy. • Describe a closed system. • Use the law of conservation of energy to solve problems. There are many energy conversions between potential and kinetic energy as the cars travel around this double looping roller coaster. Throughout the ride, however, there will always be the same total amount of energy. 
Conservation of  Energy 	  The law of conservation of energy states that within a closed system, energy can change form, but the total amount of energy is constant. Another way of expressing the law of conservation of energy is to say that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. An important part of using the conservation of energy is selecting the system. Just as in conservation of momentum, energy is conserved only if the system is closed. In a closed system, objects may not enter or leave, and it is isolated from external forces so that no work can be done on the system. In the analysis of the behavior of an object, you must make sure you have included everything in the system that is involved in the motion. For example, if you are considering a ball that is acted on by gravity, you must include the earth in your system. If considered by itself, one can tell that the kinetic energy of the ball is increasing as it falls, but only by including the earth in the system can you see that the increasing kinetic energy is balanced by an equivalent loss of potential energy. The sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy of an object is often called the mechanical energy. Consider a box with a weight of 20.0 N sitting at rest on a shelf that is 2.00 m above the earth. The box has zero kinetic energy but it has potential energy related to its weight and the distance to the earth’s surface. 
E = mgh = (20.0  N)(2.00 m) = 40.0  	  If the box slides off the shelf, the only force acting on the box is the force of gravity and so the box falls. We can calculate the speed of the box when it strikes the ground by several methods. We can calculate the speed directly using the formula v f fall equal to the potential energy at the top, KE = PE, thus 1 Note that these formulas are essentially the same; when gravity is the acceleration and the height is the distance, they are the same equation. (2)(9.80 m/s2)(2.00 m) = 6.26 m/s v = Example Problem: Suppose a cannon is sitting on top of a 50.0 m high hill and a 5.00 kg cannon ball is fired with a velocity of 30.0 m/s at some unknown angle. What is the velocity of the cannon ball when it strikes the earth? Solution: Since the angle at which the cannon ball is fired is unknown, we cannot use the usual equations from projectile motion. However, at the moment the cannon ball is fired, it has a certain KE due to the mass of the ball and its speed and it has a certain PE due to its mass and it height above the earth. Those two quantities of energy can be calculated. When the ball returns to the earth, its PE will be zero. Therefore, its KE at that point must account for the total of its original KE + PE. T

Ignore air resistance. air resistance. • conservation of energy: An empirical law of physics (meaning it cannot be derived), states that the total amount of energy within an isolated system is constant. Although energy can be transformed from one form into another, energy cannot be created or destroyed • closed system: Means it cannot exchange any of heat, work, or matter with the surroundings. • mechanical energy: The sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. • Describe the difference between elastic and inelastic collisions and indicate what is conserved in each case. • Solve problems involving elastic collisions using both the conservation of momentum and the conservation of kinetic energy. This device is known as Newton’s cradle. As the balls collide with each other, nearly all the momentum and kinetic energy is conserved. If one ball swings down, exactly one ball will swing up; if three balls swing down, exactly three will swing back up. The collisions between the balls are very nearly elastic. 
Elastic and  Inelastic  Collisions 	  For all collisions in a closed system, momentum is conserved. In some collisions in a closed system, kinetic energy is conserved. When both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, the collision is called an elastic collision. Most collisions are inelastic because some amount of kinetic energy is converted to potential energy, usually by raising one of the objects higher (increasing gravitation PE) or by flexing the object. Any denting or other changing of shape by one of the objects will also be accompanied by a loss of kinetic energy. The only commonly seen elastic collisions are those between billiard balls or ball bearings, because these balls do not compress. And, of course, collisions between molecules are elastic if no damage is done to the molecules. Much more common are inelastic collisions. These collisions occur whenever kinetic energy is not conserved, primarily when an object’s height is increased after the collision or when one of the objects is compressed. Example Problem: A 12.0 kg toy train car moving at 2.40 m/s on a straight, level train track, collides head-on with a second train car whose mass is 36.0 kg and was at rest on the track. If the collision is perfectly elastic and all motion is frictionless, calculate the velocities of the two cars after the collision. (cid:48) (cid:48)2 (cid:48)2 (cid:48) + 36.0 v2 (cid:48) (cid:48) yields v1 (cid:48)2 = 1 (cid:48) and v2 (cid:48)) + (36.0 kg)(v2 (cid:48)) (cid:48) = 2.4− 3 v2 (cid:48))2 + 1 (cid:48) + m2v2 (cid:48) are unknown. When the known values are plugged into these Solution: Since the collision is elastic, both momentum and KE are conserved. We use the conservation of momentum and conservation of KE equations. 
Since m1,m2,v1, and v2 are known, only v1 	  two equations, we will have two equations with two unknowns. Such systems can be solved with algebra. (12.0 kg)(2.40 m/s) + (36.0 kg)(0 m/s) = (12.0 kg)(v1

(cid:48)2 − 14.4 v2 (cid:48) = 14.4 (cid:48) = 1.2 m/s (cid:48)2 (cid:48))2 + 3 v2 (cid:48) + 9 v2 (cid:48)2 + 3 v2 (cid:48) into this equation yields (cid:48) = 2.4− 3 v2 (cid:48) , we get v1 (cid:48) = −1.2 m/s.

 	  We often think of temperature and heat as the same thing. While they both involve molecular motion, they are not in fact interchangeable. Thermal energy, or heat, depends on more than just the temperature. In the image above of a river running across the surface of a glacier, the liquid water and the ice have the same temperature, and yet they are in different states. In this chapter, we will uncover the realities of thermal energy, heat, temperature, and changes in states of matter. 
Transfer 	  • Define heat. • Define temperature. • Describe thermal energy transfer. • Define Celsius and Kelvin temperature scales. • Convert Celsius temperatures to Kelvin and vice versa. The temperature of basalt lava at Kilauea (Hawaii) reaches 1,160 degrees Celsius (2,120 degrees Fahrenheit). A crude estimation of temperature can be determined by looking at the color of the rock: orange-to-yellow colors are emitted when rocks (or metals) are hotter than about 900 degrees Celsius; dark-to-bright cherry red is characteristic as material cools to 630 degrees Celsius; faint red glow persists down to about 480 degrees Celsius. For comparison, a pizza oven is commonly operated at temperatures ranging from 260 to 315 degrees Celsius. 
Heat,  Temperature, and  Thermal  Energy  Transfer 	  The first theory about how a hot object differs from a cold object was formed in the 18th century. The suggested explanation was that when an object was heated, an invisible fluid called “caloric” was added to the object. Hot objects contained more caloric than cold objects. The caloric theory could explain some observations about heated objects (such as that the fact that objects expanded as they were heated) but could not explain others (such as why your hands got warm when you rub them together). In the mid-19th century, scientists devised a new theory to explain heat. The new theory was based on the assumption that matter is made up of tiny particles that are always in motion. In a hot object, the particles move faster and therefore have greater kinetic energy. The theory is called the kinetic-molecular theory and is the accepted theory of heat. Just as a baseball has a certain amount of kinetic energy due to its mass and velocity, each molecule has a certain amount of kinetic energy due to its mass and velocity. Adding up the kinetic energy of all the molecules in an object yields the thermal energy of the object. When a hot object and a cold object touch each other, the molecules of the objects collide along the surface where they touch. When higher kinetic energy molecules collide with lower kinetic energy molecules, kinetic energy is passed from the molecules with more kinetic energy to those with less kinetic energy. In this way, heat always flows from hot to cold and heat will continue to flow until the two objects have the same temperature. The movement of heat from one object to another by molecular collision is called conduction. Heat is the energy that flows as a result of a difference in temperature. We use the symbol Q for heat. Heat, like all forms of energy, is measured in joules. The temperature of an object is a measurement of the average kinetic energy of all the molecules of the object. You should note the difference between heat and temperature. Heat is the sum of all the kinetic energies of all the molecules of an object, while temperature is the average kinetic energy of the molecules of an object. If an object was composed of exactly three molecules and the kinetic energies of the three molecules are 50 J, 70 J, and 90 J, the heat would be 210 J and the temperature would be 70 J. The terms hot and cold refer to temperature. A hot object has greater average kinetic energy but may not have greater total kinetic energy. Suppose you were to compare a milliliter of water near the boiling point with a bathtub full of water at room temperature. The bathtub contains a billion times as many water molecules, and therefore has a higher total kinetic energy and more heat. Nonetheless, we would consider the bathtub colder because its average kinetic energy, or temperature, is lower. 
Temperature  Scales:  Celsius and  Kelvin 	  A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers. The most commonly used temperature scale in the United States is the Farenheit scale. However, this scale is rarely used throughout the world; the metric temperature scale is Celsius. This scale, based on the properties of water, was devised by the Swedish physicist, Anders Celsius (1704 – 1744). The freezing point of water is 0◦C and the boiling point of water was assigned to be 100◦C. The kinetic energies between these two points was divided evenly into The Kelvin or “Absolute” temperature scale is the scale often used by chemists and physicists. 
It is based on 	  the temperature at which all molecular motion ceases; this temperature is called absolute zero and is 0 K. This temperature corresponds to -273.15◦C. Since absolute zero is the coldest possible temperature, there are no negative values on the Kelvin temperature scale. Conveniently, the Kelvin and Celsius scales have the same definition of a degree, which makes it very easy to convert from one scale to the other. The relationship between Celsius and Kelvin temperature scales is given by: 
K = ◦ C + 273.15 	  On the Kelvin scale, water freezes at 273 K and boils at 373 K. Example Problem: Convert 25◦C to Kelvin. Solution: K = ◦C + 273 = 25◦C + 273 = 298 K Blender, the Next Stove?

Underground water is heated by the earth’s molten core and, when sufficient pressure is built up, the water shoots out of the ground in an amazing display. 
Specific  Heat 	  When heat flows into an object, its thermal energy increases and so does its temperature. The amount of temperature increase depends on three things: 1) how much heat was added, 2) the size of the object, and 3) the material of which the object is made. When you add the same amount of heat to the same mass of different substances, the amount of temperature increase is different. Each substance has a specific heat, which is the amount of heat necessary to raise one mass unit of that substance by one temperature unit. In the SI system, specific heat is measured in J/kg•K. (Occasionally, you may also see specific heat expressed sometimes in J/g•K). The specific heat of aluminum is 903 J/kg•K. Therefore, it requires 903 J to raise 1.00 kg of aluminum by 1.00 K.

You should note that the size of a Celsius degree and a Kelvin degree are exactly the same, and therefore ∆t is the same whether measured in Celsius or Kelvin. Example Problem: A 0.500 kg block of zinc is heated from 295 K to 350. K. How much heat was absorbed by the zinc? Solution: Q = mc∆t = (0.500 kg)(388 J/kg· K)(350. K − 295 K) = 10,600 J Example Problem: 845 J of heat are added to a 0.200 kg block of aluminum at a temperature of 312.00 K. How high will the temperature of the aluminum rise? 
Solution: (t2 −t1) =  	  t2 = t1 + 4.68 K = 312.00 K + 4.68 K = 316.68 K (0.200 kg)(903 J/kg·K) = 4.68 K mc =

Questions 	  engine operates until 836,000 J of heat have been added to the water? • specific heat: The heat required to raise a unit mass of a substance by one unit temperature interval under specified conditions, such as constant pressure: usually measured in joules per kelvin per kilogram. • Understand the function of a calorimeter. • Apply the law of conservation of energy to calorimeter calculations of temperature changes due to heat transfer. Though not particularly beautiful machines, calorimeters are incredibly useful ones. They are used to determine the calories (food energy) in food, as well as the average heat yield from burning various grades of coal and oil. The price of coal is often dependent on the heat yield from samples burned in a calorimeter. 
Calorimetry 	  A calorimeter is a device used to measure changes in thermal energy or heat transfer. More specifically, it measures calories. A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by one degree Celsius. As such, the calorimeter measures the temperature change of a known amount of water. If a reaction is carried out in the reaction vessel, or if a measured mass of heated substance is placed in the water of the calorimeter, the change in the water temperature allows us to calculate the change in thermal energy. The function of the calorimeter depends on the conservation of energy in a closed, isolated system. Calorimeters are carefully insulated so that heat transfer in or out is negligible. Consider the following example. Example Problem: A 0.500 kg sample of water in a calorimeter is at 15.0ºC. A 0.0400 kg block of zinc at 115.0ºC is placed in the water. The specific heat of zinc is 388 J/kg•ºC. Find the final temperature of the system. Solution: The heat lost by the block of zinc will equal the heat gain by the water in the calorimeter. In order to set heat gain mathematically equal to heat loss, either one of the terms must be made negative or the temperature change must be reversed. You should also note that the final temperature of the water and the block of zinc will be the same when equilibrium is reached. (0.500 kg)(4180 J/kg◦C)(x− 15.0◦C) = (0.0400 kg)(388 J/kg◦C)(115.0◦C− x) mW cW (t2 −t1)W = mZncZn(t1 −t2)Zn x = 15.7◦C Example Problem: A 100. g block of aluminum at 100.0ºC is placed in 100. g of water at 10.0ºC. The final temperature of the mixture is 25.0ºC. What is the specific heat of the aluminum as determined by the experiment? (0.100 kg)(4180 J/kg◦C)(25.0◦C− 10.0◦C) = (0.100 kg)(x)(100.0◦C− 25.0◦C) mW cW (t2 −t1)W = mAlcAl(t1 −t2)Al x = 836 J/kg◦C Solution: 
Summary 	  • A calorimeter is a device used to measure changes in thermal energy or heat transfer. • If a reaction is carried out in the reaction vessel or if a measured mass of heated substance is placed in the water of the calorimeter, the change in the water temperature allows us to calculate the change in thermal energy.

Change of  State 	  Most substances may exist in any of the three common states of matter. In the gaseous state, the molecular motion has completely overcome any attraction between the particles and the particles are totally separate from each other. There are large spaces between the particles and they move large distances between collisions. In the liquid state, the molecular motion and the molecular attractions are more balanced. While the particles stay more or less in contact with each other, they are still free to move and can slide past one another easily. In the solid state, the attractive forces dominate. The particles are pulled together into a tightly packed pattern which does not allow the particles to pass each other. The molecular motion in this form is essentially reduced to vibration in place. Increasing the temperature of a substance means increasing the molecular motion (kinetic energy) of the molecules in the substance. The phase in which a substance exists is the result of a competition between attractive forces and molecular motion. For most substances, when the temperature of the solid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a liquid, and when the temperature of the liquid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a gas. We typically visualize a solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point. In order for the molecules to actually separate from each other, more energy must be added. This energy, called heat of fusion or heat of melting, is absorbed by the particles as potential energy as the solid changes to a liquid. Recognize that, once the temperature of a solid has been raised to the melting point, it is still necessary for the solid to absorb additional thermal energy in the form of potential energy as the molecules separate. The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the particles have sufficient molecular motion to exist in the form of a gas. Once again, however, in order for the particles to separate to the gaseous form, they must absorb a sufficient amount of potential energy. The amount of potential energy necessary for a phase change to gaseous form is called the heat of vaporization. Consider the heating curve shown below. The heating curve shown is for water but other substances have similarly shaped heating curves. Suppose you begin with solid water (ice) at -30°C and add heat at a constant rate. The heat you add in the beginning will be absorbed as kinetic energy and the temperature of the solid will increase. When you reach a temperature of 0°C (the melting point for water), the heat you add is no longer absorbed as kinetic energy. Instead, the added heat is absorbed as potential energy and the particles separate from each other. During the flat part of the curve labeled “melting”, heat is being added constantly but the temperature does not increase. At the left edge of this flat line, the water is solid; by the time enough heat has been added to get to the right edge, the water is liquid, but maintains the same temperature. Once all the water is in the liquid form, the added heat will once again be absorbed as kinetic energy and the temperature will increase again. During the time labeled “water being heated as a liquid”, all the added heat is absorbed as kinetic energy. When a temperature of 100°C (the boiling point of water) is reached, the added heat is once again absorbed as potential energy and the molecules separate from liquid form into gaseous form. When all the substance has been converted into gas, the temperature will again begin to rise. TABLE 10.2: Heats of Fusion and Vaporization of Some Common Substances 
Water 	  Heat of Fusion, Hf (J/kg) Heat of Vaporization, Hv (J/kg) When the temperature of a substance is changing, we can use the specific heat to determine the amount of heat that is being gained or lost. When a substance is changing phase, we can use the heat of fusion or heat of vaporization to determine the amount of heat being gained or lost. When a substance freezes from liquid to solid, the amount of heat given off is exactly the same as the amount of heat absorbed when the substance melts from solid to liquid. The equations for heat gained or lost are given here: The heat gained or lost during a temperature change: Q = mc∆t. The heat gained or lost during a phase change of solid to liquid: Q = mHf . The heat gained or lost during a phase change of liquid to gas: Q = mHv. Example Problem: 5000. Joules of heat is added to ice at 273 K. All the heat goes into changing solid ice into liquid water. How much ice is melted? 
Hf 	  Example Problem: Beginning with 1.00 kg of ice at -20.0°C, heat is added until the substance becomes water vapor at 130.0°C. How much heat was added? The specific heat of ice is 2108 J/kg◦C, the specific heat of liquid water is Solution: 5 steps. = The solution is the sum of these steps.

Questions 	  heat of lead is 130 J/kg·◦ C and the Hf of lead is 20,400 J/kg. • phase change: When a substance changes from one state, or phase, of matter to another we say that it has undergone a change of state, or we say that it has undergone a change of phase. • heat of fusion: The change in potential energy for the conversion of 1 mole or 1 gram of a solid to a liquid, at constant pressure and temperature and is usually denoted as ∆Hf . • heat of vaporization: The change in potential energy for the conversion of 1 mole or 1 gram of a liquid to a gas, at constant pressure and temperature and is usually denoted as ∆Hv. The calculation of heat change is not as simple as measuring the temperature of an object. Different objects have different specific heats, meaning they change temperature at different rates. Temperature and heat, though closely related, are not the same. While temperature is a measurement of the average kinetic energy of the molecules, heat is the total kinetic energy. Calculations of changes in heat over phase changes depend not only on the specific heat, but also on the heat of fusion and the heat of vaporization. earch/briefs/gornitz_09/ . be.jpg . 
 	  In the photo above, we see the water line of a large cargo ship. For this cargo ship, as for any object submerged or partially submerged in water, the upward force of the water that is displaced by the ship, called buoyancy, is exactly equal to the weight of the displaced ship. This cargo ship is unloaded, which means that the ship sinks into the water about 13 feet and that the water displaced by the volume of the ship underwater will have a weight equal to the weight of the empty ship. As cargo, and therefore weight, is added to the ship, it will submerge further. This ship can submerge another 9 feet as it is loaded with cargo. As it submerges, it displaces more water so that the buoyant force can support more weight. In this chapter, you will learn about the forces involved in fluids, in addition to fluid expansion and the laws governing the behavior of gases. • Define pressure. • Calculate the pressure below the surface of liquids using the formula P = ρgh. This is the Russian ocean submersible “Mir.” Submersibles like this are necessary for research or work at great depths in the ocean because of the massive pressure. This craft can operate as deep as 6000 meters below the surface. The pressure at 6000 meters below the ocean surface exceeds 8500 pounds per square inch. 
Pressure in  Fluids 	  Pressure is defined as force per unit area, where the force F is understood to be acting perpendicular to the surface area, A. Pressure = P = 
 	  The SI unit for pressure is N/m2. This unit is also known as a pascal (Pa): 1 Pa = 1 N/m2. Example: Consider a 80.0 kg person whose two feet cover an area of 500. cm2. Determine the pressure applied to the ground by his feet. Solution: The force exerted by this person on the ground would be (80.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 784 N. The area over which this force is exerted would be 0.0500 m2. P = 
 	  A = It has been determined experimentally that a fluid exerts pressure equally in all directions. In the sketch below, from any given point below the surface of the fluid, the pressure in all directions is the same. The fluid exerts the same pressure upward from this point as it does downward. We can calculate how the pressure of a fluid varies with depth, assuming the fluid has uniform density. Consider a gigantic tub filled with water as shown below. A column of water with a cross-sectional area of 1.00 m2 is designated. If we multiply the cross-sectional area by the height of the column, we get the volume of water in this column. We can then multiply this volume by the density of water, 1000. kg/m3, and get the mass of water in the column. We then multiply this mass by the acceleration due to gravity, g, to get the weight of the water in this column. The pressure exerted by this force would be exerted over the area at the bottom of the column. Fweight = (area)(height)(ρ)(g) P = 
 	  A = ρghA 
A = ρgh 	  Therefore, the pressure of a column of fluid is proportional to the density of the fluid and to the height of the column of fluid above the level. This is the pressure due to the fluid itself. If an external pressure is exerted at the surface, this must also be taken into account. Example Problem: The surface of the water in a storage tank is 30.0 m above a water faucet in the kitchen of a house. Calculate the water pressure at the faucet. Solution: The pressure of the atmosphere acts equally at the surface of the water in the storage tank and on the water leaving the faucet –so it will have no effect. The pressure caused by the column of water will be: P = ρgh = (1000. kg/m3)(9.80 m/s2)(30.0 m) = 294,000 Pa The pressure of the earth’s atmosphere, as with any fluid, increases with the height of the column of air. In the case of earth’s atmosphere, there are some complications. The density of the air is not uniform but decreases with altitude. Additionally there is no distinct top surface from which height can be measured. We can, however, calculate the approximate difference in pressure between two altitudes using the equation P = ρg∆h. The average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 1.013 × 105 Pa. This pressure is often expressed as 101.3 kPa.

A person is able to lift the entire rear end of the automobile using only one hand with the hydraulic jack shown in the image. Hydraulic systems are similar to simple machines in that they can produce very large mechanical advantages. 
Pascal’s  Principle 	  The earth’s atmosphere exerts a pressure on all objects with which it is in contact. Atmospheric pressure acting on a fluid is transmitted throughout that fluid. For example, the water pressure at 100. m below the surface of a lake is the water. The pressure of the air at the surface of the water is 1.0 × 105 Pa, or 1 atm (atmosphere). Therefore, the total pressure at 100. m below the surface of the water is 9.8 × 105 Pa + 1.0 × 105 Pa = 10.8 × 105 Pa. This is an example of Pascal’s Principle, which states that pressure applied to a confined liquid increases the pressure throughout by the same amount. A number of practical devices take advantage of this principle. Hydraulic brakes, hydraulic lifts, and hydraulic presses are three useful tools that make use of Pascal’s Principle. The sketch below is an example of a hydraulic lift. We have a confined liquid in contact with two pistons (A and B) of different sizes. The pressure of the liquid on these two pisons is the same (Pascal’s principle). Therefore, FA = FB, and Suppose that the area of piston A is 4.0 cm2 and the area of piston B is 200. cm2. If we place an automobile weighing machine and its ideal mechanical advantage is 50. The ideal mechanical advantage of a hydraulic lift equals the ratio of the large piston area to the small piston area. = AA

This cargo ship displaces an amount of water such that the weight of the displaced water is exactly equal to the weight of the ship and its cargo. The displacement of water is what produces the buoyancy to float this ship. When this photo was taken, the ship was empty so it did not sink very deep in the water to displace the necessary weight. When this ship is fully loaded with cargo, the water line will be where the black paint meets the red paint. 
Archimedes’  Principle and  Buoyancy 	  If an object is submerged in a liquid, the object displaces a volume of the liquid equal to the volume of the submerged object. Legend has it that this observation was made by Archimedes when he sat in a bath tub that was filled to the top of the tub. The volume of water that overflowed was equal to his own volume. The forces exerted by the fluid on the sides of the submerged object are balanced. However, the forces exerted by the fluid on the top and bottom of the object are not equal. The force exerted by the liquid below the object is greater than the force exerted by the liquid above it; the liquid exerts a net upward force on the submerged or floating object. This force is called buoyancy, and its magnitude is equal to the weight of the displaced water. Archimedes’ Principle states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. Example Problem: The density of steel is 9000. kg/m3 and the density of water is 1000. kg/m3. If a cube of steel that is 0.100 m on each side is placed in a tank of water and weighed while under water, what is the apparent weight of the cube? Solution: The volume of the cube is 0.00100 m3. The mass of the cube is 9.00 kg. The weight of the cube when not submerged in water = (9.00 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 88.2 N The mass of water displaced by the cube = 1.00 kg The weight of the water displaced by the cube = 9.80 N 
The buoyant force on the steel cube = 9.80  	  Apparent weight of cube under water = 88.2 N 9.80 N = 78.4 N Example Problem: A hollow metal cube 1.00 m on each side has a mass of 600. kg. How deep will this cube sink when placed in a vat of water? Solution: Since the weight of the cube is 5880 N, it will need to displace 5880 N of water in order to float. Volume of submerged portion of cube = (1.00 m)(1.00 m)(x m) = x m3 
Weight of water displaced = 9800x  	  x = 0.600 m The cube will sink such that 0.60 m are underwater and 0.40 m are above water.

In order to design hot air balloons like these, engineers must make gas law calculations, buoyancy calculations, and have knowledge of the density of air at different altitudes. 
Combined  Gas  Law 	  For a given quantity of gas, it has been found experimentally that the volume of the gas is inversely proportional to the pressure applied to the gas when the temperature is kept constant. That is, 
 	  at a constant T. For example, if the pressure on a gas is doubled, the volume is reduced to half its original volume. This relationship is known as Boyle’s Law. Boyle’s Law can also be written PV = constant at constant T . As long as the temperature and the amount of gas remains constant, any variation in the pressure or volume will result in a change in the other one, keeping the product at a constant value. Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We’ve already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 105 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol: Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as "millimeters mercury." Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. Temperature also affects the volume of a gas. Jacques Charles found that when the pressure is held constant, the volume of a gas increases in direct proportion to its absolute temperature. This relationship became known as Charles’ Law. V ∝ T at constant P. A third gas law, known as Gay-Lussac’s Law, states that at constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. P ∝ T at constant V. The kinetic-molecular theory assumes that there are no attractive forces between the molecules and that the volume of the molecules themselves is negligible compared to the volume of the gas. At high temperatures and low pressures, these assumptions are true and the gases follow the gas laws very accurately. However, these three laws are true only as long as the pressure and density are relatively low. When a gas is compressed to the point that the molecular volume is a significant portion of the gas volume, the gas laws begin to fail. Similarly, when gases become so dense that the molecules begin to attract each other, the gas laws also fail. These changes are expressed in the Van der Waals equations. These three gas laws can be combined into the Combined Gas Law as follows: 
T = constant 	  A commonly used form of the combined gas law states that, for a sample of gas, the ratio of the product of the original pressure and volume to the original temperature will equal the ratio of the product of a new pressure and volume to the new temperature, or 
T1 	  = 
T2 	  . This equation is useful when operating with the same sample of gas, and given five of the variables, to solve for the sixth. When solving problems with temperature in them, the calculations require that temperatures be in Kelvin. Be careful to convert to Kelvin when given temperatures in Celsius. Example Problem: A sample of gas has a volume of 2.00 L and a pressure of 0.750 kPa when its temperature is 25°C. If the volume is expanded to 4.00 L and the pressure reduced to 0.500 kPa, what must the temperature become? Solution: The relationships between volume and temperature and pressure and temperature expressed in the gas laws are only true when the kinetic energy of the molecules are directly proportional to the temperature. Therefore, when dealing with all gas laws, the temperatures must be expressed in Kelvin. Given: 
V2 = 4.00  	  T2 =? T2 = 
P1 V1 	  = (0.500 kPa)(4.00 L)(298 K) (0.750 kPa)(2.00 L) = 397 K

Questions 	  pressure. When the tank cools to 20.0°C, the pressure is 30.0 atm. What is the volume of the gas under these conditions? K? • gas laws: A series of laws in physics that predict the behavior of an ideal gas by describing the relations between the temperature, volume, and pressure. The laws include Boyle’s law, Charles’ law, and Gay-Lussac’s law, and are combined in the combined gas law. • State the universal gas law. • State the universal gas law constant, R. • Given three of the four unknowns in the universal gas law, solve for the fourth. Compressed gases provide vital fuels for industry and for homes and farms in rural areas. 
Universal  Gas  Law 	  The combined gas law, PV ∝ T , is true for a particular sample of gas. If any gas is added or allowed to leak out, however, the relationship is lost. In order to get a relationship that is true for any sample of gas, it is necessary to incorporate a term for the amount of gas. From observations as simple as blowing up a balloon, it is clear that increasing the amount of gas increases the volume. Because different gases have different weights per molecule, including a term for mass of gas does not produce a consistent equation. If, however, we include a term expressing the number of moles of gas rather than its mass, we can produce a constant proportionality. A mole is a unit representing the number of atoms present. The letter n is used to represent the moles of substance. Incorporating n into the equation yields PV ∝ nT . If we insert a letter, R, to represent the constant of proportionality, we get the normal form of the universal gas law, PV = nRT . The unit term for n is always moles and T is always in Kelvin. The units for pressure and volume, however, may vary. The value of R depends on the units that are used for pressure and volume.

Kelvin 	  Since the product of (liters)(atm) can be converted to joules, we also have a value for R where liters × atm have been converted to joules, R = 8.314 J/mol·K. The two common values of the universal gas law constant R are 0.0821 L· atm/mol· K and 8.314 J/mol· K. Most universal gas law problems are calculated at STP. STP stands for standard temperature and pressure, which is the most commonly calculated temperature and pressure value. STP is defined as 1.00 atm and 0◦C, or 273 K. Example Problem: Determine the volume of 1.00 mol of any gas at STP. Solution: First isolate V from PV=nRT. Then plug in known values and solve. V = nRT P = (1.00 mol)(0.0821 L· atm/mol· K)(273 K) (1.00 atm) = 22.4 liters For any gas at STP, one mole has a volume of 22.4 liters. This can be an extremely convenient conversion factor. Example Problem: A sample of oxygen gas occupies 10.0 liters at STP. How many moles of oxygen are in the container? Solution: n = 
 	  RT = (1.00 atm)(10.0 L) (0.0821 L· atm/mol· K)(273 K) = 0.446 moles 
Summary 	  • The universal gas law is PV = nRT , where P is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles, R is the universal gas law constant, and T is the absolute temperature. • The value of R varies depending on the units used for P and V . Two common values are 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K and R = 8.314 J/mol· K. • STP is standard temperature and pressure; 273 K and 1.00 atm. • One mole of a gas at STP has a volume of 22.4 liters.

Questions 	  in the cylinder has decreased to 6 atm while the volume and temperature remain the same. What fraction of the original amount of gas remains in the cylinder? • Universal gas law: PV = nRT • Universal gas law constant: Denoted by R, two common values are 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K and 8.314 J/mol·K. Fluid pressure equations apply to all fluids, including liquids and gases. Confined liquids are subject to the same pressure throughout, and gaseous fluids exert equal pressures on all sides of an object. As such, objects partially submerged in water are acted upon by a buoyant force, equal to the submerged weight. Finally, gases are subject to laws regarding the relationships between pressure, temperature, and volume; these laws are compiled into the Combined Gas Law and the Ideal Gas Law. 
 	  A surfer’s kinetic energy comes directly from the waves themselves. Of all the wave forms we will study, it is with water waves that we have the most personal experience. Water waves in large bodies of water, however, have movement that is not due to the natural characteristics of waves. In pure transverse waves—like water waves—the particles of media move perpendicularly to the direction of the energy movement. If we were to create a perfect water wave in a lab, the water molecules themselves would only move up and down, while the energy of the wave would move horizontally toward the sides of the pan. In such a perfect wave, the apparent movement of water toward the side of the pan is an illusion. After completing this chapter, you will understand different types of waves, as well as their properties. • Describe transverse waves. • Explain how waves transfer energy without transferring matter. • Define wavelength, frequency, and period of a transverse wave. • State the relationship between speed, wavelength, and frequency. • Solve problems using the relationships between speed, wavelength, frequency, and period. This surfer rides a giant wave at the legendary big wave surf break known as as "Jaws" in Maui, HI. Massive waves, such as this one, transfer huge amounts of energy. 
Types of  Waves 	  Water waves, sound waves, and the waves that travel along a rope are mechanical waves. Mechanical waves require a material medium such as water, air, or rope. Light waves, however, are electromagnetic waves and travel without a material medium. They are not mechanical waves. In all types of mechanical waves, energy moves from one place to another while the media carrying the wave only vibrates back and forth in position. One type of mechanical wave is the transverse wave. In the case of transverse waves, the movement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of the energy movement. In the sketch above, consider the transverse wave produced when the boy jerks one end of a rope up and down while the other end is tied to a tree. The energy spent by the boy transfers permanently down the rope to the tree. The rope, however, only moves up and down. If we stuck a piece of tape somewhere on the rope, we would see that the particles of medium do not travel with the energy. After the wave has passed by, the piece of tape would still be in the same place it was before the wave approached. In all transverse waves, the movement media vibrates perpendicularly to the direction of wave motion, and the medium is not permanently moved from one place to another. 
Frequency,  Wavelength, and  Velocity 	  Waves are identified by several characteristics. There is a center line where the medium would be if there were no wave, which is sometimes describes as the undisturbed position. The displacement of the medium above this undisturbed position is called a crest and the displacement below the undisturbed position is called a trough. The maximums of the crest and trough are equal and are called the amplitude. The distance between equivalent positions on succeeding waves is called the wavelength. The wavelength could be measured from a crest to the next crest or from a trough to the next trough, and is commonly represented with the Greek letter lambda, λ. The time interval required for one complete wave to pass a point is called the period. During the period of the wave, an entire wavelength from one crest to the next crest passes a position. The number of waves that pass a single position in one second is called the frequency. The period of a wave and its frequency are reciprocals of each other. f = 
 	  The units for the period are seconds and the units for frequency are s−1 or 1 Hertz (Hz). s. This unit has also been given the name Another important characteristic of a wave is its velocity. The wave velocity is different from the velocity of the medium; the wave velocity is the velocity of the linearly transferred energy. Since the energy travels one wavelength, λ, in one period, T , the velocity can be expressed as distance over time: v = λ T . Since period and frequency are reciprocals, the speed of the wave could also be expressed as v = λ f . Example Problem: A sound wave has a frequency of 262 Hz. What is the time lapse between successive wave crests? Solution: The time lapse between successive crests would be the period and the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. T = f = Example Problem: A sound wave has a frequency of 262 Hz has a wavelength of 1.29 m. What is the velocity of the wave? Solution: v = λ f = (1.29 m)(262 s−1) = 338 m/s

Questions 	  If a light wave has a wavelength of 5.80 × 10−7 m, what is its frequency? • transverse wave: A transverse wave is a moving wave that consists of oscillations occurring perpendicular (or right angled) to the direction of energy transfer • undisturbed position: The equilibrium or rest position of the medium in a wave. • crest: A crest is the point on a wave with the maximum value or upward displacement within a cycle • trough: A trough is the opposite of a crest, so the minimum or lowest point in a cycle • amplitude: The maximum displacement from a zero value during one period of an oscillation. • wavelength: The distance between corresponding points of two consecutive waves. • frequency: The number of waves that pass a fixed point in unit time. • period: A period is the time required for one complete cycle of vibration to pass a given point. • Describe longitudinal waves. Playing with a Slinky is a childhood tradition, but few children realize they are actually playing with physics. 
Longitudinal  Waves 	  Like transverse waves, longitudinal waves are mechanical waves, which means they transfer energy through a medium. Unlike transverse waves, longitudinal waves cause the particles of medium to move parallel to the direction of the wave. They are most common in springs, where they are caused by the pushing an pulling of the spring. Although the surface waves on water are transverse waves, fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) usually transmit longitudinal waves. As shown in the image below, longitudinal waves are a series of compressions and rarefactions, or expansions. The wavelength of longitudinal waves is measured by the distance separating the densest compressions. The amplitude of longitudinal waves is the difference in media density between the undisturbed density to the highest density in a compression. Example Problem: A sonar signal (sonar is sound waves traveling through water) of 1.00× 106 Hz frequency has a wavelength of 1.50 mm in water. What is the speed of sound in water? Solution: v = λ f = (0.00150 m)(1.00× 106 s−1) = 1500 m/s Example Problem: A sound wave of wavelength 0.70 m and velocity 330 m/s is produced for 0.50 s. a. What is the frequency of the wave? b. How many complete waves are emitted in this time interval? c. After 0.50 s, how far is the wave front from the source of the sound? Solution: λ = 330 m/s f = v a. b. complete waves = (470 cycles/s)(0.50 s) = 235 cycles c. distance = (330 m/s)(0.50 s) = 115 m

By detecting the time delay between the emission and return of a pulse, a bat can determine the location of the object.

If the frequency of the signal was 512 cycles per second and the wavelength of the signal was 2.93 m, how far away is the second submarine? • longitudinal wave: A wave in which the direction of media displacement is the same as the direction of wave propagation. • Define the Doppler shift. • Explain the Doppler shift with sound. • Make calculations based on the Doppler shift. At normal speeds, when an object generates sound, the sound travels away from the object and people hear the same sound that was generated by the object. In some unusual cases, like this airplane, the object can travel as fast or faster than the sounds it makes. The sound wave moves along with this airplane; as the airplane continues to generate more sound, this sound is added to the old sound. When this extra large sound wave front arrives, the sound is much louder than the sound that was originally generated. When this happens with airplanes, the sound is called a “sonic boom.” 
Doppler  Shift 	  If an emitted sound is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of sound relative to the receiver, it is possible for the sound emitted by a source and the sound received by a receiver to be different. This is called a Doppler shift. Suppose the trumpet player in the sketch below is playing a constant note with a wavelength equal to 1.00 m/s. If you are sitting down the road a ways and the truck is stationary, then the wavelength of the sound that reaches you will be 1.00 m long and you will hear a note corresponding to that wavelength. Suppose now, that the speed of sound is crest will move toward you at 333 m/s. In the first 0.003 seconds, that first crest will move exactly 1.00 m (which happens to be one wavelength for this sound). After the trumpet player generates the first crest, however, the truck also moves and in the first 0.003 seconds, the truck moves 0.50 m. After the first 0.003 seconds, the trumpet player creates a second crest and sends it on its way. When this second crest is generated, the first crest is only 0.50 m away. If the truck did not move, the crests would reach your ear with a wavelength of 1.00 m, but because the truck moves toward you at very high speed, the crests reach your ear at a distance of only 0.50 m apart. Therefore, the sound you hear will have shorter wavelengths than the sound that was emitted by the trumpet player. The frequency of the sound you hear would be double the frequency that was being emitted. If the truck was moving away from you, the opposite change of frequency would occur. That is, the received wavelength would be longer than the one emitted and the received frequency would be lower than the frequency emitted. You may have noticed frequency changes in automobile sounds when you stand near a highway. Or that an emergency vehicle’s siren is different when approaching you than when leaving. You can also hear the Doppler shift in the classroom simply by striking a tuning fork and then moving the tuning sharply toward you or away from you. Even though the tuning fork generates a constant tone, you will hear wavering tones as you move the tuning fork around. In terms of the listener, the train sketched on the left above is not moving and therefore the wavelengths and frequency heard in all directions will be the same as the frequency being emitted. For the train on the right, however, since the train is moving toward the right, the wavelengths measured to the right will be shorter than those emitted and the wavelengths measured to the left will be longer than those emitted. Christian Doppler (1803 –1853) did experiments in 1842 with trumpeters playing a single note as they sat on a railroad flatcar and were pulled back and forth past a stationary observer. The Doppler effect also occurs when the . source of the sound is stationary and the observer is moving (with a significant fraction of the speed of sound). The following formulas have been developed for calculating the observed frequency: 
When the source is moving toward you, fo = f 	  v when the source is moving away from you, fo = f In the equations fo is the perceived frequency, f is the emitted frequency, vR is the relative velocity and v is the speed of sound. Example Problem: The speed of sound is 340. m/s and a train whistle with a frequency of 512 Hz is emitted from a train coming toward you at 40.0 m/s. What frequency will you hear? 
Solution: fo = f 	  v = 580 Hz = 512 s−1 . vR v 
Summary 	  • The Doppler shift, or Doppler effect, occurs when a sound’s emission and the sound’s receiver travel relative to each other at a significant speed compared to the speed of sound. • If the sender and receiver are getting closer together, the perceived frequency will be higher than the emitted • If the sender and receiver are getting farther apart, the perceived frequency will be lower than the emitted frequency, given by the equation fo = f v . frequency, given by the equation fo = f . vR v

When mechanical waves strike a barrier, at least part of the energy of the waves will be reflected back into the reflection. 
Reflection of  Mechanical  Waves 	  When a wave strikes an obstacle or comes to the end of the medium it is traveling in, some portion of the wave is reflected back into the original medium. It reflects back at an equal angle that it came in. These angles are called the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection. The normal line, the incident and reflected rays, and the angles of incidence and reflection are all shown in the diagram sketched above. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. These rules of reflection apply in the cases of water waves bouncing off the side of a pool, sound waves echoing off a distant cliff, or wave pulses traveling down a rope or a slinky. Consider the change that would occur with a light rope joined to a heavier rope. When a wave pulse travels down the rope and encounters the media change, a reflection will occur. Look at the image below. In the top sketch, we see a lightweight (black) rope attached to a heavier rope (red). There is a wave pulse traveling down the rope from left to right. When the wave pulse encounters the barrier (the change in rope weight), part of the wave moves into the new medium and part of the wave is reflected back into the old medium. As you can see in the bottom half of the diagram, the transmitted portion of the wave continues into the new medium right side up. The transmitted wave is somewhat diminished because some of the energy of the wave was reflected and also because the rope to be lifted is heavier. The reflected wave is also diminished because some of the energy was transmitted through the barrier. The reflected wave is also inverted (upside down). This is a general rule for mechanical waves passing from a less dense medium into a more dense medium, that is, the reflected wave will be inverted. The situation changes when the wave is passing from a more dense medium into a less dense medium. As you can see in the sketch below, when a wave pulse moving in denser medium encounters a media interface to a medium of less density, the reflected wave is upright rather than inverted. It is also possible for a mechanical wave to encounter an impenetrable barrier, that is, a barrier which does not allow any transmission at all. In such a case, the complete wave pulse will be reflected and the reflected wave will be inverted. 
Summary 	  • When a wave strikes an obstacle or comes to the end of the medium it is traveling in, some part of the wave is reflected back into the original medium. • The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. • The general rule, for mechanical waves passing from a less dense medium into a more dense medium, the reflected wave will be inverted. • When a wave pulse moving in denser medium encounters a media interface to a medium of lesser density, the reflected wave is upright rather than inverted. • When a mechanical wave encounters an impenetrable barrier, the complete wave pulse will be reflected and the reflected wave will be inverted.

Will the reflected pulse be upright or inverted? • reflection: The change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated. • law of reflection: Says the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected. • angle of incidence: The angle formed by a ray incident on a surface and a perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence. • angle of reflection: The angle formed by a reflected ray and a perpendicular to the surface at the point of reflection. • Define and describe refraction of mechanical waves. • State and use the law of refraction. A straw in a glass of water seen from the side often appears broken, even though it is not. The apparent break is due to the bending of light rays leaving the straw; as the light passes from the water to the glass and from the glass to the air, the light rays are bent. Nonetheless, your eye traces the light ray backward as if the light has followed a straight path from its origin at the straw. Since the light appears to have come from a different place, your eye sees the straw as being broken. 
Refraction of  Mechanical  Waves 	  When any wave strikes a boundary between media, some of the energy is reflected and some is transmitted. When the wave strikes the media interface at an angle, the transmitted wave will move in a slightly different direction than the incident wave. This phenomenon is known as refraction. Consider the image sketched above. Suppose that the waves represented here are water waves. The wave crests are represented by the black lines in the image. As such, the distance between two consecutive black lines is the wavelength. Let the red line represent a transition from deep to shallow water. This transition is called the media interface. As the waves hit the boundary, the waves slow down. The right side of the wave reaches the boundary before the left side of the wave, causing the left side to catch up and the angle of propagation to change slightly. This change in direction can be seen in the yellow line, which is slightly angled at the boundary. The refraction of waves across boundaries operates similarly to the method by which tanks are steered. Tanks do not have a steering wheel. Instead, they have an accelerator to produce forward motion and separate brakes on each tread. The operator uses brakes on both treads at the same time in order to stop, but brakes on only one tread to turn the tank. By braking one side, the operator causes that side to slow down or stop while the other side continues at the previous speed, causing the tank to turn towards the slower tread. This sketch shows a wave ray striking an interface between old medium and new medium. A normal line has been drawn as a dotted line perpendicular to the interface. The angle between the incident ray and the normal line is called the angle of incidence, shown as θi, and the angle between the refracted ray and the normal line is called the angle of refraction, θr. We already understand that the change in the wave direction at the border depends on the difference between the two velocities. This relationship is conveniently expressed in a mathematical relationship: sinθr sinθi = vr vi = λr λi The ratio of the sine of the angle of refraction to the sine of the angle of incidence is the same as the ratio of the velocity of the wave in the new medium to the velocity of the wave in the old medium and equal to the ratio of wavelength (λ) in the old medium to the wavelength in the new medium. Example Problem: A water wave with a wavelength of 3.00 m is traveling in deep water at 16.0 m/s. The wave strikes a sharp interface with shallow water with an angle of incidence of 53.0◦. The wave refracts into the shallow water with an angle of refraction of 30.0◦. What is the velocity of the wave in shallow water and what is its wavelength in the new medium? 
Solution: sinθr 	  sinθi sin53◦ = vr so sin30◦ = vr vi If the wavelength of a wave in a new medium is = λr λi so 10.0 m/s vr vi Example Problem: The ratio of the sinθr to sinθi is 0.769 . Solution: λr λi so λi = = 6.50× 10−9 m 
Summary 	  • When any wave strikes a boundary between media, some of the energy is reflected and some is transmitted. • When a wave strikes the media interface at an angle, the transmitted wave will move in a different direction than the incident wave. This phenomenon is known as refraction. • At any media interface, sinθr sinθi = vr vi = λr λi

The primary topic of this chapter was wave motion. Mechanical waves are either transverse, like a swinging jump rope, or longitudinal, like a compressed slinky. Both types of waves have a wavelength, frequency, period, and wave velocity, which can be easily calculated. Waves are also subject to the Doppler effect: the apparent frequency of a wave can be lesser or greater than its actual, emitted frequency for an observer moving relative to its source, depending on the two’s relative speed and whether they are approaching or retreating from each other. This effect explains why the pitch of an emergency siren changes as it approaches a listener. Finally, this chapter explained why and how waves are refracted and reflected as they move from one medium to another. es-pictures/tanks-public-domain-images-pictures/m7-priest-self-propelled-105-millimeter-howitzer-tank.jpg-co pyright-friendly-image.html . 
 	  From 1665 to 1666, Isaac Newton studied sunlight and discovered that it can be broken down into a rainbow of colors with a prism. Today, we know that the rainbow of colors is a consequence of bending the different wavelengths of different colors. “White” sunlight is not really white—there is no wavelength of light that is white. Rather, it is a mixture of many different colors that appears white to our brains after being processed by our eyes and optic nerves. • Describe electromagnetic radiation. • State the speed of light in air. • Use the speed of light to solve problems. • Define luminous, illuminated, transparent, translucent, opaque and polarized. • Understand the difference between color from pigment and color from light. White light is composed of an infinite number of individual colors. Your eye blends the colors and your brain “sees” white light. A prism, such as the one shown above and on Pink Floyd’s album cover, is able to resolve the light back into individual colors. 
Electromagnetic  Radiation  Spectrum 	  We only see objects that have light waves that travel from them to our eyes. Objects either generate light or reflect it. Light is generated by incandescent and fluorescent lamps, light emitting diodes, flames, very hot objects, and even some animals. Our major source of light is the sun. Light is a small fraction of the energy we call electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields traveling at the speed of light. Electromagnetic waves carry this energy from one place to another and are similar to waves in a rope. Unlike the wave in a rope, however, electromagnetic waves do not require a medium to travel; the most prevalent electromagnetic waves we experience travel through the vacuum of outer space from the sun. The energy of an electromagnetic wave travels in a straight line along the path of the wave. The moving light wave has associated with it an oscillating electric field and an oscillating magnetic field. Scientists often represent the electromagnetic wave with the image below. The black line represents the straight path of the light itself. Along this path, there exists an electric field that will reach a maximum positive charge, slowly collapse to zero charge, and then expand to a maximum negative charge. Similarly, there is an changing magnetic field that oscillates from maximum north pole field to maximum south pole field. Along the path of the electromagnetic wave, these changing fields repeat, oscillating over and over again. However, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields demonstrate a weaving pattern that is not the way light travels. For an electromagnetic wave, the crests and troughs represent the oscillating fields, not the path of the light. Although light waves look different from waves in a rope, we still characterize light waves by their wavelength, frequency, and velocity. We can measure along the path of the wave the distance the wave travels between one crest and the succeeding crest, which is the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation. Like transverse waves through a medium, the frequency of electromagnetic waves is the number of full cycles of waves that pass a certain point in a set unit of time. The velocity for all electromagnetic waves traveling through a vacuum is the same: 3.00× 108 m/s, which is symbolized by the lower case c. The relationship, then, for the velocity, wavelength, and frequency of electromagnetic waves is: c = λ f . The entire spectrum of electromagnetic waves includes very low energy electric waves up to very high energy gamma rays. As you probably know, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and radio waves are also waves on the electromagnetic spectrum. The full electromagnetic spectrum is shown below. You can see that visible light is a very small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
Color 	  The colors that we see are blends of some number of individual frequencies of visible light. The surface of materials have chemical structures that cause particular frequencies of light to be either absorbed or reflected. Our eyes pick up the frequencies that are reflected (or generated) by the object and the frequencies are blended so that we see one color. If the surface of an object absorbs all frequencies of light, we see black. If all frequencies are emitted or reflected, we see white. If you had a book whose cover reflected only blue light and you placed this book in the presence of white light from an incandescent light bulb, all the colors except blue would be absorbed and the blue would be reflected, allowing you to see a blue book. If you placed the same book in the presence of only red light, no light would be reflected from the book and you would see a black book. Discussions of colors can sometimes become confusing because of the difference between light emitters and light absorbers. Light absorbers, such as dyes and pigments, absorb frequencies from those that you see, while light emitters add frequencies to what you see. If I were to shine red light, green light, and blue light into your eye all at the same time, you would likely see some variation of white. If I were to mix red paint, green paint, and blue paint together, you would likely see black or some very dark color. If an object emits light waves, we say the object is luminous (generates light). If an object merely reflects light that falls on it, we say the object is illuminated (reflects light). Many objects allow light rays to pass through them without disrupting the organization of the rays. When this happens, you can clearly identify the objects from which the light came. Objects that allow light to pass through undisrupted are said to be transparent. Air, glass, some plastics, and some other materials are examples of transparent objects. There are also objects that allow light to pass through them but they disrupt the rays so that the objects from which the light came cannot be identified. Objects that allow light to pass through but disrupt images are said to be translucent. Lampshades, frosted light bulbs, and fogged glass are examples of translucent materials. Many other objects do not allow any light to pass through. Such objects are said to be opaque. 
Polarization 	  Remember the illustration of electromagnetic radiation given above? These electric and magnetic waves may oscillate in any direction. That is, the oscillating fields may be oscillating vertically, horizontally, and in every other direction. Light typically consists of oscillating fields in all directions, but always travels in a straight line. Filters can be constructed such that only light with the fields oscillating in a certain direction can pass through the filter. This is much like having a large number of ropes passing through the slots in a picket fence. The ropes have transverse waves oscillating in all possible directions moving toward the fence. When the waves encounter the fence, only the oscillations that are vertical and fit through the slots in the fence will be allowed to pass through. Light that has all its field oscillations in the same direction is said to be polarized. 
Light in the  Shadows: the  Poisson  Spot 	  The wave theory of light predicts that there should be a bright spot right in the center of the shadow of a spherical object. This sounds crazy...but is it true? This MIT video discusses the Poisson Spot, named after the French mathematician Simeon Denis Poisson. See the video at URL .

Summary 	  • We see objects because they either generate or reflect light, which then enters our eyes. • Visible light is a small fraction of the energy we call electromagnetic radiation. • Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields traveling at the speed of light. • The energy of an electromagnetic wave travels in a straight line along the path of the wave. • In a vacuum, every electromagnetic wave has a velocity of 3.00× 108 m/s, which is symbolized by the lower case c. • The relationship of velocity, wavelength, and frequency of electromagnetic waves is: c = λ f . • Light that has all its field oscillations in the same direction is said to be polarized.

The designers of this sign used the fact that light can reflect off of many surfaces, including water, to make the sign legible. It takes a bit of thought, but words can be written in such a way that their reflection is legible, even though the words themselves are not. 
The  Law of  Reflection 	  When a light ray strikes a reflecting surface, the angle of incidence (measured from the normal line) is equal to the angle of reflection (also measured from the normal line). This is called the Law of Reflection. If the reflecting surface is a very smooth surface, the reflection will be a regular reflection, in which the light rays maintain their position relative to each other and objects will be visible and identifiable in the reflected image. If the reflecting surface is rough, the reflection will be a diffuse reflection, and objects will not be visible or identifiable in the reflection. When you are considering the size of things on the scale of wavelengths of light, even surfaces that appear smooth may be very rough in terms of light waves, and most surfaces produce diffuse reflection.

Questions 	  cement road and it becomes a smooth regular reflector. At night, when you are depending on the light from your headlights to show you the lines on the road, a wet road becomes much darker and it is more difficult to see the lines. Explain why this occurs. • law of reflection: The law of reflection says that the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected. • regular reflection: If a parallel beams of light falls on a smooth surface, the reflected beams are also parallel. • diffuse reflection: When the reflecting surface is rough, parallel incident beams of light would be reflected in non-parallel, random directions. • Define refraction. • Given data about the optical density of the media, predict whether the light will bend toward the normal or away from the normal. • State Snell’s Law and solve refraction problems using it. • Solve problems using the relationship between the index of refraction and the velocity of light in the media. • Explain effects caused by the refraction of light. When a light ray passes at an angle through the boundary between optically different media, the light does not travel in a straight line. The pencil in the glass of liquid shown above is a normal straight pencil. The light that travels from the pencil through the liquid, through the glass, and into the air is bent differently than light from the portion of the pencil that is not in the liquid. Your eye assumes the light from both portions of the pencil moved in a straight line, but the two portions of the pencil do not appear to be lined up. Your eye thinks the pencil is broken. 
Refraction of  Light 	  The speed of light is different in different media. If the speed of light is slower in a particular medium, that medium is said to be more optically dense. When a wave front enters a new medium at an angle, it will change directions. If the light is entering a more optically dense medium, the light bends toward the normal line. If the light is entering a less optically dense medium, the light will bend away from the normal line. Remember that the normal line is the line perpendicular to the medium interface. In the sketch below, light wave fronts are moving upward from the bottom of the page and encounter a boundary into a more optically dense medium. The light waves bend toward the normal line. Because the right end of the wave fronts enter the new medium first, they slow down first. When the right side of the wave front is moving more slowly that the left side, the wave front will change directions. When light is traveling from air into another medium, Snell’s Law states the relationship between the angle of incidence and angle of refraction is n = sinθi sinθr where θi is the angle of incidence, θr is the angle of refraction, and n is the ratio of the two sines and is called the index of refraction. Snell’s Law may be stated that a ray of light bends in such a way that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant. The index of refraction is also related to the relative speeds of light in a vacuum and in the medium. n = speed of light in a vacuum speed of light in the medium When a ray of light is traveling from medium into another medium, Snell’s Law can be written as ni sinθi = nr sinθr.

Bending the  Sun’s  Rays 	  Because air is slightly more optically dense than a vacuum, when sunlight passes from the vacuum of space into our atmosphere, it bends slightly towards the normal. When the sun is below the horizon and thus not visible on a direct line, the light path will bend slightly and thus make the sun visible by refraction. Observers can see the sun before it actually comes up over the horizon, or after it sets. 
Mirages 	  In the Figure 13.2, the sun shines on the road, heating the air just above the road. The difference in density between the hot air over the road and the surrounding air causes the hot air to refract light that passes through it. When you look at the road, you see a mirage. What appears to be water on the road is actually light coming from the sky that has been refracted as it passes through the hot air above the road. This phenomenon is common on hot roads and in the desert. 
Summary 	  • The speed of light is different in different media. • When a wave front enters a new medium at an angle, it will change directions. If the light is entering a more optically dense medium, the light bends toward the normal line. If the light is entering a less optically dense medium, the light will bend away from the normal line. • When light is traveling from air into another medium, Snell’s Law states that n = sinθi sinθr • The index of refraction is also related to the relative speeds of light in a vacuum and in the medium. n = . • When a ray of light is traveling from one medium into another medium, Snell’s Law can be written as ni sinθi = speed of light in a vacuum speed of light in the medium nr sinθr.

Questions 	  refraction? the angle of refraction in the block is 27◦. What is the index of refraction for the plastic? • refraction : The change of direction of a ray of light or sound in passing obliquely from one medium into another in which its wave velocity is different. • optically dense: Refers to the ability of a material to slow the light waves. The greater the optical density of a material, the greater the slowing effect. • Snell’s Law: For a light ray incident on the interface of two media, the sine of the angle of incidence times the index of refraction of the first medium is equal to the sine of the angle of refraction times the index of refraction of the second medium. • index of refraction: The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in a medium under consideration. • mirage: An optical phenomenon that creates the illusion of water, often with inverted reflections of distant objects, and results from the refraction of light by alternate layers of hot and cool air. • Describe total internal reflection. • Use the critical angle to determine when total internal reflection will occur. Total internal reflection allows the light to travel down the optical fiber and not pass through the sides of the tube. The light continuously reflects from the inside of the tube and eventually comes out the end. Optical fibers make interesting lamps but they are also used to transport telephone and television signals. 
Total  Internal  Reflection 	  We already know that when light passes from one medium into a second medium where the index of refraction is smaller, the light refracts away from the normal. In the image below, the light rays are passing into an optically less dense medium; therefore, the rays bend away from the normal. As the angle of incidence increases, the light ray bends even further away from the normal. Eventually, the angle of incidence will become large enough that the angle of refraction equals 90◦ , meaning the light ray will not enter the new medium at all. Consider a ray of light passing from water into air. The index of refraction for air is 1.00 and for water is 1.36. Using Snell’s Law, ni sinθi = nr sinθr, and allowing the angle of refraction to be 90◦, we can solve for the angle of incidence which would cause the light ray to stay in the old medium. ni sinθi = nr sinθr (1.36)(sinθi) = (1.00)(sin90◦) sinθi = 0.735 and θi = 47◦ This result tells us that when light is passing from water into air, if the angle of incidence exceeds 47◦, the light ray will not enter the new medium. The light ray will be completely reflected back into the original medium. This is called total internal reflection. The minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection to occur is called the critical angle. Total internal reflection is the principle behind fiber optics. A bundle of fibers made out of glass or plastic only a few micrometers in diameter is called a light pipe since light can be transmitted along it with almost no loss. Light passing down the fibers makes glancing collisions with the walls so that total internal reflection occurs. 
Summary 	  • When light passes from one medium into a second medium with a smaller index of refraction, the light refracts away from the normal. • If the angle of incidence becomes large enough that the angle of refraction equals 90◦, the light ray will not enter the new medium with the smaller angle of refraction. • Total internal reflection means the light ray will not enter the new medium but will be completely reflected back into the original medium.

A laser pointer is aimed through the opposite side of the bottle so that the light also exits through the hole. The stream of liquid acts like an optical fiber and the light undergoes total internal reflection as it follows the stream of liquid. As the amount of liquid in the bottle decreases, the arc of the stream of liquid changes and the direction of the light follows the stream of liquid.

If the angle of incidence in the plastic is • total internal reflection: When light is passing from a medium of higher index of refraction into a medium of lower index of refraction is completely reflected by the boundary between the two media. • critical angle: The smallest angle of incidence at which a light ray passing from one medium to another less refractive medium will be totally reflected from the boundary between the two. • fiber optics: The science or technology of light transmission through very fine, flexible glass or plastic fibers without energy loss making use of the principle of total internal reflection. Like transverse waves, light waves are characterized by amplitude, wavelength, and velocity. Unlike other waves, light waves—and all electromagnetic waves—can be transmitted through a vacuum, because they propagate as a result of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. They can reflect off surfaces and be refracted, and the change in angle as they travel from one medium to another can be calculated using Snell’s Law. When the angle is large enough, the light rays can undergo total internal reflection. ww.shutterstock.com . 
 	  We’ve all seen the message, shown above, written on the side-view mirror of cars: “Objects in mirror are closer than they appear.” Side-view mirrors are convex mirrors, which makes objects appear smaller, or farther away, then they actually are. Some mirrors, such as those in your bathroom, display accurately sized images, while others create images that are larger or smaller than reality. Lenses can be used to magnify or reduce images as well. This chapter will introduce you to convex and concave mirrors, lenses, and the properties of each. • Describe the image produced by a plane mirror. • Understand a virtual image. Is this a picture of one girl in front of a mirror or is this a picture of twins designed to look like a mirror image? The writing on the shirt is properly mirror reversed, and, as in plane mirror images, the right hand of the object becomes the left hand of the image. However, if you look closely, you will see that in the picture one girl is wearing a ring and the other isn’t. 
Image in a  Plane  Mirror 	  The sketch below shows how we see an image in a plane mirror. Plane mirrors work because the light rays create a virtual image behind the mirror. Light rays from the object strike the mirror and reflect according to the law of reflection. When some of the light rays enter our eye, our eye and brain interpret these rays as having traveled in a straight line path. Therefore, our eye and brain track the light rays backward to a position from which they appear to have come. At this position, we see an image. In a plane mirror, the image will be the same size as the object and will be the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror. This image is called a virtual image because the light does not actually pass through the image. Example Problem: A person 1.80 m tall stands in front of a plane mirror. What is the minimum height of the mirror, and how high must its lower edge be above the floor for the person to be able to see his/her whole body? Assume the person’s eyes are 6.0 cm below the top of the head. Solution: The law of reflection tells us that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. From this, we know that the light ray leaving the person’s toes will strike the mirror halfway between his toes and his eyes. The distance from the person’s toes to eyes is 1.74 m, so the bottom of the mirror must be 0.87 m above the floor. The light ray that leaves the top of the person’s head and reflects from the mirror into his eyes must strike the mirror 3.0 cm below the top of his head. Therefore, the top of the mirror is 1.77 m above the floor and the bottom of the mirror is 0.87 m above the floor. The height of the mirror is 1.77 m− 0.87 m = 0.90 m. It doesn’t take much analysis to recognize that the distance the person stands from the mirror does NOT affect the results. If you can’t see your feet in a mirror, getting closer or farther away from the mirror won’t make any difference. When you look at an image of yourself in a plane mirror, there are some differences that are apparent. In the image below, you see a woman cleaning a mirror. The object woman has the cleaning cloth in her left hand. The image woman, however, is holding the cleaning cloth in her right hand. Images in a plane mirror are reversed left and right but are not reversed top and bottom. 
Summary 	  • Our eye and brain interpret any light rays that enter an eye as having traveled in a straight line path. • For a plane mirror, the image will be the same size as the object and will be the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror. • Since the light forming the image does not pass through the image, it is called a virtual image. • Images in a plane mirror are reversed left and right but are not reversed top and bottom.

Concave mirrors are used in a number of applications. They form upright, enlarged images, and are therefore useful in makeup application or shaving. They are also used in flashlights and headlights because they project parallel beams of light, and in telescopes because they focus light to produce greatly enlarged images. The photograph above shows the grinding of the primary mirror in the Hubble space telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope is a reflecting telescope with a mirror approximately eight feet in diameter, and was deployed from the Space Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990. 
Image in a  Concave  Mirror 	  Reflecting surfaces do not have to be flat. The most common curved mirrors are spherical. A spherical mirror is called a concave mirror if the center of the mirror is further from the viewer than the edges are. A spherical mirror is called a convex mirror if the center of the mirror is closer to the viewer than the edges are. To see how a concave mirror forms an image, consider an object that is very far from the mirror so that the incoming rays are essentially parallel. For an object that is infinitely far away, the incoming rays would be exactly parallel. Each ray would strike the mirror and reflect according to the law of reflection (angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence). As long as the section of mirror is small compared to its radius of curvature, all the reflected rays will pass through a common point, called the focal point (f). If too large a piece of the mirror is used, the rays reflected from the top and bottom edges of the mirror will not pass through the focal point and the image will be blurry. This flaw is called spherical aberration and can be avoided either by using very small pieces of the spherical mirror or by using parabolic mirrors. A line drawn to the exact center of the mirror and perpendicular to the mirror at that point is called the principal axis. The distance along the principle axis from the mirror to the focal point is called the focal length. The focal length is also exactly one-half of the radius of curvature of the spherical mirror. That is, if the spherical mirror has a radius of 8 cm, then the focal length will be 4 cm. 
Objects  Outside the  Center  Point 	  Above is a spherical mirror with the principle axis, the focal point, and the center of curvature (C) identified on the image. An object has been placed well beyond C, and we will treat this object as if it were infinitely far away. There are two rays of light leaving any point on the object that can be traced without any drawing tools or measuring devices. The first is a ray that leaves the object and strikes the mirror parallel to the principle axis that will reflect through the focal point. The second is a ray that leaves the object and strikes the mirror by passing through the focal point; this ray will reflect parallel to the principle axis. These two rays can be seen in the image below. The two reflected rays intersect after reflection at a point between C and F. Since these two rays come from the tip of the object, they will form the tip of the image. If the image is actually drawn in at the intersection of the two rays, it will be smaller and inverted, as shown below. Rays from every point on the object could be drawn so that every point could be located to draw the image. The result would be the same as shown here. This is true for all concave mirrors with the object outside C: the image will be between C and F, and the image will be inverted and diminished (smaller than the object). The heights of the object and the image are related to their distances from the mirror. In fact, the ratio of their heights is the same ratio as their distances from the mirror. If do is object distance, di the image distance, ho the object height and hi the image height, then 
It can also be shown that do 	  di = do− f f and from this, we can derive the mirror equation, ho hi = do di . do + di = f . In this equation, f is the focal length do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. The magnification equation for a mirror is the image size divided by the object size, where m gives the magnification of the image. m = −di do Example Problem: A 1.50 cm tall object is placed 20.0 cm from a concave mirror whose radius of curvature is 30.0 cm. What is the image distance and what is the image height? 
Solution: 1 	  do both sides by 60x to get 3x + 60 = 4x and x = 60.0 cm. The image distance is 60.0 cm. The image is 3 times as far from the mirror as the object so it will be 3 times as large, or 4.5 cm tall. f The focal length is one-half the center of curvature so it is 15.0 cm. x = 1 + 1 di = 1 
Objects  Between the  Center  Point and the  Focal  Point 	  Regardless of where the object is, its image’s size and location can be determined using the equations given earlier in this section. Nonetheless, patterns emerge in these characteristics. We already know that the image of an object outside the center point is closer and smaller than the object. When an object is between the center point and the focal point, the image is larger and closer. These characteristics can also be determined by drawing the rays coming off of the object; this is called a ray diagram. Look again at the image above that was shown earlier in the lesson. If you consider the smaller arrow to be the object and follow the rays backward, the ray diagram makes it clear that if an object is located between the center point and focal point, the image is inverted, larger, and at a greater distance. Example Problem: If an 3.00 cm tall object is held 15.00 cm away from a concave mirror with a radius of 20.00 cm, describe its image. Solution: To solve this problem, we must determine the height of the image and the distance from the mirror to the image. To find the distance, use the mirror equation: di Next determine the height of the image: = 1 f − 1 do = 1 ho hi = do di = hi = Using this equation, we can determine that the height of the image is 6 cm. This image is a real image, which means that the rays of light are real rays. These are represented in the ray diagram as solid lines, while virtual rays are dotted lines. 
Objects  Inside the  Focal  Point 	  Consider what happens when the object for a concave mirror is placed between the focal point and the mirror. This situation is sketched at below. Once again, we can trace two rays to locate the image. A ray that originates at the focal point and passes through the tip of the object will reflect parallel to the principal axis. The second ray we trace is the ray that leaves the tip of the object and strikes the mirror parallel to the principal axis. Below is the ray diagram for this situation. The rays are reflected from the mirror and as they leave the mirror, they diverge. These two rays will never come back together and so a real image is not possible. When an observer looks into the mirror, however, the eye will trace the rays backward as if they had followed a straight line. The dotted lines in the sketch show the lines the rays would have followed behind the mirror. The eye will see an image behind the mirror just as if the rays of light had originated behind the mirror. The image seen will be enlarged and upright. Since the light does not actually pass through this image position, the image is virtual. Example Problem: A 1.00 cm tall object is placed 10.0 cm from a concave mirror whose radius of curvature is 30.0 cm. Determine the image distance and image size. Solution: Since the radius of curvature is 30.0 cm, the focal length is 15.0 cm. The object distance of 10.0 cm tells us that the object is between the focal point and the mirror. x = 1 do Multiplying both sides of the equation by 30x yields 3x + 30 = 2x and x = −30.0 cm. The negative image distance indicates that the image is behind the mirror. We know the image is virtual because it is behind the mirror. Since the image is 3 times as far from the mirror as the object, it will be 3 times as tall. Therefore, the image height is 3.00 cm. f and plugging known values yields + 1 di = 1

Wide angle images have benefits in rearview mirrors, in-store customer monitors, and for viewing large areas like intersections and parking lots. 
Images in a  Convex  Mirror 	  In convex mirrors, the reflecting surface is on the outside of the sphere, making the center of curvature and the focal point on the opposite side of the mirror from the object. Since the focal point is on the opposite side of the mirror from the object, the focal length is assigned a negative number. Light rays that come to the mirror aimed at the focal point on the back side will be reflected parallel to the principal axis. In the sketch, blue rays approach the mirror as if they would continue through the mirror toward the focal point (dotted blue lines). They reflect along the purple lines parallel to the principal axis. Similarly, light rays that approach the mirror parallel to the principal axis reflect as if they came from the focal point.

Since the image distance is negative, it means the image is behind the mirror and is virtual. The image will be upright. + 1 di = 1 f so m = −di do = −(−19.6) = 0.0196 or The image is reduced by a factor of 51. For a convex mirror, if the object is at infinity, the image will be a dot on the focal point. As the object moves from infinity toward the mirror, the image moves along the principal axis toward the mirror. When the object right next to the mirror, the image will be right next to the mirror on the other side. All ray diagrams for convex mirrors look essentially like the image below, with the placement of the image somewhere between the mirror and the focal point. The ray tracing for convex mirrors follow this general sketch. Two rays leave the tip of the object, one approaches the mirror parallel and reflects as if it came from the focal point. The top blue dotted line shows this imaginary route. The second ray leaves the object tip and approaches the mirror toward the focal point but reflects parallel at the mirror. The green solid line shows the reflected ray and the dotted green line shows the imaginary route behind the mirror. Where the two dotted lines intersect is the tip of the image. All images in convex mirrors are upright, virtual, and diminished. As the object moves toward the mirror, the image also moves toward the mirror and increases in size. This can be determined using the mirror and magnification equations. 
Summary 	  • For convex mirrors, the reflecting surface is on the outside of the sphere, placing the center of curvature and the focal point on the opposite side of the mirror from the object. • Light rays that approach the mirror aimed at the focal point will be reflected parallel to the principal axis. • Light rays that come to the mirror parallel to the principal axis reflect as if they came from the focal point. • Since the focal point is on the opposite side of the mirror from the object, the focal length is assigned a negative number. • Both the mirror equation and the magnification equation are true with convex mirrors.

Images in  Double  Convex  Lenses 	  Lenses are made of transparent material such as glass or plastic with an index of refraction greater than that of air. At least one of the faces is a part of a sphere; a convex lens is thicker at the center than the edges, and a concave lens is thicker at the edges than the center. Convex lenses are called converging lenses, because they refract parallel light rays so that they meet. They are one of the most useful and important parts of all optical devices, and are found in eyeglasses, telescopes, microscopes, magnifying glasses, cameras and many other objects. Both the mirror equation and the magnification equation also apply to lenses. However, when dealing with lenses, the mirror equation is renamed the Lens Equation. Double convex lenses have focal points on both sides of the lens, but it is also necessary to use points at twice the focal length to locate objects and images. Therefore, along the principal axis, there are points identified as F and as As with mirrors, we only need to trace two rays in order to locate the image for lenses. Both rays change direction while inside the lens, and their convergence point on the opposite side of the lens is the image location. As can be seen in the figure above, Ray 1 approaches the lens parallel to the principal axis and is refracted through the focal point on the other side. Ray 2 travels through the focal point and is then refracted parallel to the principal axis. The yellow arrow on the right of the lens is the inverted image. The diagram above shows the situation when the object is outside 2F. In this situation, the image will be between F and 2F on the other side and will be inverted, diminished, and real. A real image can be projected on a screen. That is, if you placed a sheet of paper at the image position, the image would actually appear on the paper. If the object is placed between 2F and F, the image will appear beyond 2F on the other side. The image will be real, inverted, and enlarged. You can do a ray tracing like the one shown to demonstrate this is true. If the object is placed inside F (between F and the lens), the image will be on the same side of the lens as the object and it will be virtual, upright, and enlarged. In the sketch below, the object is red and has been placed inside F. The ray that approaches the mirror parallel to the principal axis is dotted yellow. It refracts through the focal point, also shown in dotted yellow. The ray that approaches the mirror through the focal point is dotted blue and refracts parallel to the principal axis, also shown in dotted blue. As you can see, the refracted rays diverge, so there will be no real image. If the eye is placed beyond the object around the 2F shown in the sketch, the eye will see the rays as if they have traveled in a straight line. These imaginary rays will converge at the tip of the green arrow which is the image position. Example Problem: An object is 40.0 cm to the left of a convex lens of +8.00 cm focal length. Determine the image distance. 
Solution: 1 	  do f plugging in values + 1 di = 1 x = 1 Multiplying both sides by 40x yields x + 40 = 5x so 4x = 40 and x = 10.0 cm. Example Problem: An object 1.00 cm high is 8.00 cm to the left of a convex lens of 6.00 cm focal length. Find the image location and image height. 
Solution: 1 	  do Multiplying both sides by 24x yields 3x + 24 = 4x so x = 24.0 cm. Since the image distance is three times the object distance, the image height will be three times the object height or f plugging in values + 1 di = 1 x = 1 
Summary 	  • Lenses are made of transparent materials, such as glass or plastic, with an index of refraction greater than that of air. • One or both of the lens faces is part of a sphere and can be concave or convex. • A lens is called a convex lens if it is thicker at the center than at the edges. • Both the mirror equation and the magnification equation apply to lenses. Generally, when dealing with lenses, the mirror equation is renamed the Lens Equation. • Double convex lenses have focal points on both sides of the lens; these and the points at twice the focal length are used to locate objects and images. • When the object is outside 2F, the image will be between F and 2F on the other side and will be inverted, diminished, and real. • If the object is placed between 2F and F, the image will appear beyond 2F on the other side.

The three light rays traveling into the concave lens shown above travel away from each other. For this reason, concave lens are also called diverging lenses. As a result of this light divergence, concave lenses create only virtual images. 
Images in  Double  Concave  Lenses 	  Every concave lens causes all rays to diverge. Rays that approach the lens parallel to the principal axis refract as if they came from the focal point. As you can see in the figure above, the light rays hit the lens and refract away from each other. Since none of these rays will intersect, a real image cannot exist. Instead, all images created by a double concave lens are virtual images. Like in all ray diagrams, images can be found using two rays. The first ray, shown above, begins from the tip of the image and travels to the lens parallel to the principal axis. Within the lens, this ray is refracted away from the principal axis such that the virtual ray (shown as a dotted line) travels back to the focal point. The second ray also leaves from the tip of the object, and travels straight through the center of the lens. The image will be where these two rays intersect one real and one virtual. Since one ray is a virtual ray, the image will always be virtual, as well as upright and diminished. Like for convex lenses, the lens equation and magnification equations can be used to calculate image size and distance for double concave lenses. When using the lens equation with a concave lens, however, the focal length must be assigned a negative value. 
Summary 	  • A concave lens causes all rays to diverge. • Concave lenses create only virtual images. After the rays are refracted, they never converge and so there will be no real images. • All concave lens images will be upright, virtual, and diminished, and can be found between the F and the lens. • When using the lens equation with a concave lens, the focal length must be assigned a negative value.

R 15 Diffraction and  Interference 	  of Light 
 	  Light interference occurs when two light waves interact with each other. Light interference often creates beautiful patterns, such as those on the surface of the bubbles shown above. When light hits a soap bubble, one light ray is reflected by the outer layer of soap, while another light ray will travel through that layer and get reflected by the inner layer of soap. Since these waves have traveled slightly different differences, the waves are no longer perfectly synchronized; this interference results in iridescent patterns. • Define diffraction of light. • Define wave interference. • Describe double slit interference patterns. • Explain Thomas Young’s contibutions to physics. • Calculate the wavelength from a double slit interference pattern. When waves strike a small slit in a wall, they create circular wave patterns on the other side of the barrier. This is seen in the image above, where ocean waves create precise circular waves. The circular waves undergo constructive and destructive interference, which generates a regular interference pattern. 
Diffraction and  Interference 	  When a series of straight waves strike an impenetrable barrier, the waves stop at the barrier. However, the last particle of the medium at the back corner of the barrier will create circular waves from that point, called the point source. This can be seen in the image below. This phenomenon is called diffraction, and it occurs in liquid, sound, and light waves. While the waves become circular waves at the point source, they continue as straight waves where the barrier does not interfere with the waves. Any two waves in the same medium undergo wave interference as they pass each other. At the location where the two waves collide, the result is essentially a summation of the two waves. In some places, a wave crest from one source will overlap a wave crest from the other source. Since both waves are lifting the medium, the combined wave crest will be twice as high as the original crests. Nearby, a wave trough will overlap another wave trough and the new trough will be twice as deep as the original. This is called constructive interference because the resultant wave is larger than the original waves. Within the interference pattern, the amplitude will be twice the original amplitude. Once the waves pass through each other and are alone again, their amplitudes return to their original values. In other parts of the wave pattern, crests from one wave will overlap troughs from another wave. When the two waves have the same amplitude, this interaction causes them to cancel each other out. Instead of a crest or a trough, there is nothing. When this cancellation occurs, it is called destructive interference. . It is easy to see how waves emanating from multiple sources, such as drops of rainwater in still water, create interference patterns. But a single source of waves can create interference patterns with itself as a result of diffraction. 
The  Double  Slit  Experiment 	  A similar situation to the raindrops above occurs when straight waves strike a barrier containing two slits. These waves are cut off everywhere except for where the waves that pass through the two slits. The medium in the slits again acts as a point source to produce circular waves on the far side of the barrier. As long as these two circular waves have the same wavelength, they interfere constructively and destructively in a specific pattern. This pattern is called the wave interference pattern and is characterized by light and dark bands. The light bands are a result of constructive interference, and the dark bands occur because of destructive interference. In the early 1800s, light was assumed to be a particle. There was a significant amount of evidence to point to that conclusion, and famous scientist Isaac Newton’s calculations all support the particle theory. In 1803, however, Thomas Young performed his famous Double Slit Experiment to prove that light was a wave. Young shined a light onto the side of a sealed box with two slits in it, creating an interference pattern on the inside of the box opposite the slits. As seen above, interference patterns are characterized by alternating bright and dark lines. The bright lines are a result of constructive interference, while the dark lines are a result of destructive interference. By creating this interference pattern, Young proved light is a wave and changed the course of physics. 
Calculating  Wavelength from  Double  Slit  Pattern 	  Using the characteristics of the double slit interference pattern, it is possible to calculate the wavelength of light used to produce the interference. To complete this calculation, it is only necessary to measure a few distances. As can be seen below, five distances are measured. In the sketch, L is the distance from the two slits to the back wall where the interference pattern can be seen. d is the distance between the two slits. To understand x, look again at the interference pattern shown above. The middle line, which is the brightest, is called the central line. The remaining lines are called fringes. The lines on either side of the central line are called the first order fringes, the next lines are called the second order fringes, and so on. x is the distance from the central line to the first order fringe. r1 and r2 are the distances from the slits to the first order fringe. We know that the fringes are a result of constructive interference, and that the fringe is a result of the crest of two waves interfering. If we assume that r2 is a whole number of wavelengths (confirm for yourself that this is a logical assumption), then r1 must be one more wavelength. This is because r1 and r2 are the distances to the first order fringe. Mathematically, we can let r2 = nλ and r1 = nλ + λ, where λ is the wavelength and n is a constant. Using this relationship, we determine that r1 − r2 = λ. Looking again at the diagram, the red and blue triangles are similar, which means that the ratios of corresponding sides are the same. The ratio of x to L in the red triangle is equal to the ratio of λ to d in the blue triangle. For proof of this, visit URL . From this, we can determine that the wavelength is dependent on x, d, and L: λ = xd 
 	  Example Problem: Monochromatic light falls on two narrow slits that are 0.0190 mm apart. A first order fringe is 
Solution: λ = xd 	  = 6.68× 10−7 m L = (0.021 m)(0.000019 m) (0.600 m) 
Summary 	  • The last particle of medium at the back corner of an impenetrable barrier will act as a point source and produce circular waves. • Diffraction is the bending of waves around a corner. • Constructive interference occurs when two wave crests overlap, doubling the wave amplitude at that location. • Destructive interference occurs when a wave crest overlaps with a trough, causing them to cancel out. • Light is a wave, and creates an interference pattern in the double slit experiment. • An interference pattern consists of alternating bright and dark lines; the bright lines are called fringes. • In a double slit experiment, the wavelength can be calculated using this equation: λ = xd

Though it looks like a double slit interference pattern, the pattern on the screen are actually the results of light diffracting through a single slit with the ensuing interference. 
Single  Slit  Interference 	  Interference patterns are produced not only by double slits but also by single slits, otherwise known as single slit interference. In the case of a single slit, the particles of medium at both corners of the slit act as point sources, producing circular waves from both edges. These circular waves move across to the back wall and interfere in the same way that interference patterns were produced by double slits. In the sketch at below, the black lines intersect at the center of the pattern on the back wall. This center point is equidistanct from both edges of the slit. Therefore, the waves striking at this position will be in phase; that is, the waves will produce constructive interference. Also shown in the sketch, just above the central bright spot where the red lines intersect, is a position where destructive interference occurs. One of these red lines is one-half wavelength longer than the other, causing the two waves to hit the wall out of phase and undergo destructive interference. A dark bank appears at this position. Just as in double slit interference, a pair of similar triangles can be constructed in the interference pattern. The pertinent values from these triangles are the width of the slit, w, the wavelength, λ, the distance from the central bright spot to the first dark band, x, and the distance from the center of the slit to back wall, L. The relationship of these four values is λ 
L or λ = wx 	  w = x L . Example Problem: Monochromatic light of wavelength 605 nm falls on a slit of width 0.095 mm. The slit is located 
Solution: x = λ 	  w = (6.05×10−7 m)(0.85 m) = 0.0054 m (9.5×10−5 m)

These fringes are due to light from one side of the slit interacting (interfering) with light from the other side. • Understand the structure of a diffraction grating. • Explain the interference pattern formed by diffraction gratings. • Use diffraction grating interference patterns to calculate the wavelength of light. Suppose we had a light bulb that emitted exactly four frequencies of light; one frequency in each of the colors red, yellow, green, and blue. To our eye, this bulb would appear white because the combination of those four colors produces white light. If viewed through a diffraction grating, however, each color of light would be visible. The original white light bulb is visible in the center of the image, and interference causes the light bulb to appear in each color to the left and the right. 
Diffraction  Gratings 	  Diffraction gratings are composed of a multitude of slits lined up side by side, not unlike a series of double slits next to each other. They can be made by scratching very fine lines with a diamond point on glass, or by pressing plastic film on glass gratings so that the scratches are replicated. The clear places between the scratches behave as slits similar to the slits in a double slit experiment and the gratings form interference patterns in the same general way that double slits do. With more slits, there are more light waves out of phase with each other, causing more destructive interference. Compared to the interference pattern of a double slit, the diffraction grating interference pattern’s colors are spread out further and the dark regions are broader. This allows for more precise wavelength determination than with double slits. The image below shows the diffraction pattern emanating from a white light 
L = d sinθ ( Note that x 	  L = sinθ, using the small angle approximation theorem.) . Also in this image is the measurement for θ, which can be used to calculate the wavelength of the original light source. The equation from the double slit experiment can be adjusted slightly to work with diffraction gratings. Where λ is the wavelength of light, d is the distance between the slits on the grating, and θ is the angle between the incident (original) light and the refracted light, λ = xd 
Looking at the equation, x = λ 	  d , it should be apparent that as the distance between the lines on the grating become smaller and smaller, the distance between the images on the screen will become larger and larger. Diffraction gratings are often identified by the number of lines per centimeter; gratings with more lines per centimeter are usually more useful because the greater the number of lines, the smaller the distance between the lines, and the greater the separation of images on the screen. Example Problem: A good diffraction grating has 2500 lines/cm. What is the distance between two lines on the grating? Solution: d = Example Problem: Using a diffraction grating with a spacing of 0.00040 cm, a red line appears 16.5 cm from the central line on the screen. The screen is 1.00 m from the grating. What is the wavelength of the light? 
Solution: λ = xd 	  = 6.6× 10−7 m L = (0.165 m)(4.0×10−6 m) 
Summary 	  • Diffraction gratings can be made by blocking light from traveling through a translucent medium; the clear places behave as slits similar to the slits in a double slit experiment. • Diffraction gratings form interference patterns much like double slits, though brighter and with more space between the lines. • The equation used with double slit experiments to measure wavelength is adjusted slightly to work with diffraction gratings. λ = xd

In single slits, this pattern is a result of light diffraction around the back of each side of the slit, while double slits and diffraction gratings create interference due to light shining through each slit. . 
 	  Electricity is very rarely visible, but it can be seen in the form of lightning. Lightning is a large spark that occurs when many electrons move very quickly to even out an unequal distribution of electrons. Other, smaller sparks can be seen when you scuff your feet across carpet and then touch a metal doorknob. Both these sparks represent the same form of electricity: static electricity. Static electricity is also responsible for allowing a balloon that you rubbed on your sweater to cling to a wall and for causing your clothes to come out of the dryer stuck together. • Describe the changes that occur in the sub-atomic arrangement in matter when charged. • Describe how to charge an object. • Define conductors and insulators. • Understand the difference between conduction and induction. • Summarize the forces between charged objects. Lightning is the discharge of static electricity that has built up on clouds. Every year, the earth experiences an average of 25 million lightning strikes. Lightning bolts travel at speeds up to 60,000 miles per second, and can reach temperatures of 50,000°F, which is five times the temperature of the surface of the sun. The energy contained in a single lightning strike could light a 100 Watt light bulb 24 hours per day for 90 days. 
Forces on  Charged  Objects 	  Electric charges exist within the atom. At the turn of the 20th century, J. J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford determined that atoms contain very light-weight negatively charged particles called electrons and more massive, positively charged particles called protons. The protons are lodged in the nucleus of the atoms, along with the neutrally charged particles called neutrons, while the electrons surround the nucleus. When the number of electrons in the electron cloud and the number of protons in the nucleus are equal, the object is said to be neutral. Changes to the nucleus of an atom require tremendous amounts of energy, so protons are not easily gained or lost by atoms. Electrons, on the other hand, are held fairly loosely and can often be removed quite easily. When an object loses some electrons, the remaining object is now positively charged because it has an excess of protons. The electrons may either remain free or may attach to another object. In that case, the extra electrons cause that object to become negatively charged. Atoms that have lost electrons and become positively charged are called positive ions, and atoms that have gained electrons and become negatively charged are called negative ions. Electrons can be removed from some objects using friction, simply by rubbing one substance against another substance. There are many examples of objects becoming charged by friction, including a rubber comb through hair, and a balloon on a sweater. In both these instances, the electrons move from the second object to the first, causing the first object to become negatively charged and the second one positively charged. Friction between the tires on a moving car and the road cause the tires to become charged, and wind causes friction between clouds and air which causes clouds to become charged and can result in tremendous bolts of lightning. A common method of producing charge in the lab is to rub cat or rabbit fur against stiff rubber, producing a negative charge on the rubber rod. If you hold a rubber rod on one end and rub only the tip of the other end with a fur, you will find that only the tip becomes charged. The electrons you add to the tip of the rod remain where you put them instead of moving around on the rod. Rubber is an insulator. Insulators are substances that do not allow electrons to move through them. Glass, dry wood, most plastics, cloth, and dry air are common insulators. Materials that allow electrons to flow freely are called conductors. Metals have at least one electron that can move around freely, and all metals are conductors. Forces are exerted on charged objects by other charged objects. You’ve probably heard the saying "opposites attract," which is true in regards to charged particles. Opposite charges attract each other, while like charges repulse each other. This can be seen in the image below. When two negatively charged objects are brought near each other, a repulsive force is produced. When two positively charged objects are brought near each other, a similar repulsive force is produced. When a negatively charged object is brought near a positively charged object, an attractive force is produced. Neutral objects have no influence on each other. A laboratory instrument used to analyze and test for static charge is called an electroscope. Seen below, an electroscope consists of a metal knob connected by a metal stem to two very lightweight pieces of metal called leaves, shown in yellow. The leaves are enclosed in a box to eliminate stray air currents. When a negatively charged object is brought near the knob of a neutral electroscope, the negative charge repels the electrons in the knob, and those electrons move down the stem into the leaves. Excess electrons flow from the rod into the ball, and then downwards making both leaves negatively charged. Since both leaves are negatively charged, they repel each other. When the rod is removed, the electroscope will remain charged because of the extra electrons added to it. Conversely, if the rod is brought near the knob but doesn’t touch it, the electroscope will appear the same while the rod is near. That is, the negative charge in the rod repels the electrons in the ball, causing them to travel down to the leaves. The leaves will separate while the rod is nearby. No extra electrons were added to the electroscope, meaning that the electrons in the electroscope will redistribute when the negatively charged rod is taken away. The leaves return to neutral, and they stop repelling each other. If the rod touches the knob, the electroscope leaves are permanently charged but if the rod is brought near but does not touch the knob, the electroscope leaves are only temporarily charged. If the leaves are permanently charged and the rod removed, the electroscope can then be used to determine the type of unknown charge on an object. If the electroscope has been permanently negatively charged, and a negatively charge object is brought near the knob, the leaves will separate even further, showing the new object has the same charge as the leaves. If a positively charged object is brought near a negatively charged electroscope, it will attract some of the excess electrons up the stem and out of the leaves, causing the leaves to come slightly together. Similar to the results of a negatively charged rod, if a positively charged rod is brought near the knob of a neutral electroscope, it will attract some electrons up from the leaves onto the knob. That process causes both of the leaves to be positively charged (excess protons), and the leaves will diverge. If the positively charged rob is actually touched to the knob, the rob will remove some electrons and then when the rob is removed, the electroscope will remain positively charged. This is a permanent positive charge. Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction. This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. 
Summary 	  • Electric charges exist with the atom. • Atoms contain light-weight, loosely held, negatively charged particles called electrons and heavier, tightlyheld, positvely charged particles called protons. • When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, the object is neutral. • The loss of electrons gives an ion a positive charge, while the gain of electrons gives it a negative charge. • Materials that allow electrons to flow freely are called conductors, while those that do not are called insulators. • Opposite charges attract, and like charges repel. • Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction.

Electric cars are becoming more popular. One large advantage for electric cars is the low cost of operation, which may become an ever bigger advantage as gas prices climb. Energy costs for electric cars average about one-third of the cost for gasoline engine cars, but they can only travel about 200 miles per charge at this point. These cars run using the science of electrical charges and forces. 
Coulomb’s  Law 	  The questions regarding the relationship between the electrical force, the size of the charge, and the separation between the charges were solved by Charles Coulomb in 1785. He determined that electrical force between two charges is directly related to the size of the charges and inversely proportional to the distance between the charges. This is known as Coulomb’s Law. 
Fe =  Kq1q2 	  d2 In this equation, q1 and q2 are the two charges, d is the distance between the two charges, and K is a constant of proportionality. Fe is the electric force, which occurs as a result of interactions between two charged particles. For the purpose of calculating electric forces, we assume all charge is a point charge, in which the entire charge of the particle is located in a massless point. The SI unit of charge is the coulomb, C, which is the charge of 6.25×1018 electrons. The charge on a single electron is 1.60× 10−19 C. The charge on a single electron is known as the elementary charge. The charge on a proton is the same magnitude but opposite in sign. When the charges are measured in coulombs, the distance in meters, and the force in Newtons, the constant K is 9.0× 109 N · m2/C2. The electrical force, like all forces, is a vector quantity. If the two charges being considered are both positive or both negative, the sign of the electrical force is positive and this force is repulsive. If the two charges are opposite in sign, the force will have a negative sign and the force is attractive. Example Problem: Object A has a positive charge of 6.0× 10−6 C. Object B has a positive charge of 3.0× 10−6 C. If the distance between A and B is 0.030 m, what is the force on A? 
Solution:  Fe =  Kq1q2 	  d2 = (9.0×109 N·m2/C2)(6.0×10−6 C)(3.0×10−6 C) = 180 N (0.030 m)2 The positive sign of the force indicates the force is repulsive. This makes sense, because both objects have a positive charge. Example Problem: In the sketch below, the charges are q1 = 10.0× 10−6 C, q2 = 2.0× 10−6 C, and q3 = −6.0× 
Solution:  Fe =  Kq1q2 	  d2 = (9.0×109 N·m2/C2)(10.0×10−6 C)(2.0×10−6 C) (2.0 m)2 = 0.045 N (towards q3) d2 = (9.0×109 N·m2/C2)(2.0×10−6 C)(−6.0×10−6 C) 
Fe =  Kq2q3 	  Since the two forces act in the same direction, their absolute values can be added together; the total force on q2 is = −0.007 N (towards q3) (4.0 m)2

Questions 	  is the electrical force between them? attracting the red ball with a force of 626 N. What is the charge on the red ball? • Coulomb’s Law: States the force of attraction or repulsion acting along a straight line between two electric charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely to the square of the distance between them. Matter is made up of atoms, which consist of small, charged particles. The tightly held, heavier, positively charged particles are called protons, while the loosely held, lighter, negatively charged particles are called electrons. When there are excess electrons in an object, it is considered to be negatively charged; when there is a deficit of electrons, the object is considered positively charged. Charged objects exert a force on each other, which can be calculated based on the objects’ charges and distance from each other using Coulomb’s Law. Some materials transmit electrons easily and are called conductors, while other materials, called insulators, restrict the transmission of electrons. i/File:Lightning_hits_tree.jpg . (NSSL).

 	  When two objects are electrically charged, they exert a force on each other. If the objects have like charges, they repel; if they have opposite charges, they attract. The child above has become negatively charged after his ride down the slide. Since each of his individual strands of hair is negatively charged, they repel each other. The force of the attraction or repulsion between charges can be calculated using Coulomb’s Law. On some occasions, however, it is difficult to identify and/or quantify one of the charges involved. To work with such a situation, physicists consider what is called an electric field. These fields exist in the area around charged particles and exert forces on all charges within the field. By using the field for calculations, we need not know anything about the charge itself. • Define an electric field. • Solve problems relating to field, force, and charge. A plasma globe, such as the one pictured above, is filled with a mixture of noble gases and has a high-voltage electrode at the center. The swirling lines are electric discharge lines that connect from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator. When a hand is placed on the surface of the globe, all the electric discharge travels directly to that hand. 
The  Electric  Field 	  Coulomb’s Law gives us the formula to calculate the force exerted on a charge by another charge. On some occasions, however, a test charge suffers an electrical force with no apparent cause. That is, as observers, we cannot see or detect the original charge creating the electrical force. Michael Faraday dealt with this problem by developing the concept of an electric field. According to Faraday, a charge creates an electric field about it in all directions. If a second charge is placed at some point in the field, the second charge interacts with the field and experiences an electrical force. Thus, the interaction we observe is between the test charge and the field and a second particle at some distance is no longer necessary. The strength of the electric field is determined point by point and can only be identified by the presence of test charge. When a positive test charge, qt, is placed in an electric field, the field exerts a force on the charge. The field strength can be measured by dividing the force by the charge of the test charge. Electric field strength is given the symbol E and its unit is Newtons/coulomb. E = 
Fonqt 	  qt The test charge can be moved from location to location within the electric field until the entire electric field has been mapped in terms of electric field intensity. Example Problem: A positive test charge of 2.0× 10−5 C is placed in an electric field. The force on the test charge is 0.60 N. What is the electric field intensity at the location of the test charge? 
Solution:  E =  	  q = 0.60 N 
Summary 	  • An electric field surrounds every charge and acts on other charges in the vicinity. • The strength of the electric field is given by the symbol E, and has the unit of Newtons/coulomb. • The equation for electric field intensity is E = F q .

Often the star of science shows and museum installments, Tesla coils create magnificent displays of light and sound. They have low electrical current but incredibly large electric potentials. 
Electric  Potential 	  In the study of mechanics, the concept of energy, and the conservation thereof, was extremely useful. The same will be true for the study of electrical interactions. The work done moving a charged particle in an electric field can result in the particle gaining or losing both kinetic and potential energy. Lifting an object in a gravitational field requires work and increases the object’s potential energy. A similar situation occurs when you move two charged objects relative to each other. We already know that each object has an electric field surrounding it, which effects the other charge. If the two charged objects have the same charge, they repel each other. Moving these two objects closer to each other requires working against the repulsive force, which increases the potential energy of the system. Conversely, moving two like charges apart will decrease the potential energy. If the objects attract each other, the opposite situtations occur: if you pull them apart, you do work against the force, which increases the potential energy of the system, but bringing attractive charges closer together decreases the potential energy. It is often easy to think of the change in energy as a mountain or an inverted cone, depending on the situation. Imagine a positive point charge, with the corresponding electric field around it. If you are moving another positive point charge, the situation is like a mountain, with the original point charge at the peak. As the second charge moves towards the first, it must go up the mountain. This requires work, and increases the potential energy of the system. If, however, the second charge is a negative point charge, the two charges attract each other and the situation is like a cone: the second charge easily falls towards the first, decreasing the potential energy. It would then require work to get the second charge up and out of the cone, away from the first charge. 
Uniform  Electric  Fields 	  As we know from Coulomb’s law, the electric field around a point charge decreases as the distance from the point increases. However, it is possible to create a constant electric field between two large, flat conducting plates parallel to each other. If one of the plates is positively charged and the other negatively charged, the space between the plates will have a constant electric field except near the edges of the plates. A uniform electric field makes it easier to measure the difference in electric potential energy. This energy, also called the electric potential difference is commonly referred to as the voltage, based on the unit, volt (V). To measure the voltage across some distance, it is necessary to pick a position to be the relative zero, because voltage is the change in potential difference. Any point in a system can be given the value of zero volts, but it is typically the point of a point charge or one plate in a uniform electric field as shown above. The voltage is measured using a voltmeter, which measures the electric potential difference across two points. The electrical potential difference between the two plates is expressed as V = Ed, the electric field strength times the distance between the plates. The units in this expression are Newtons/coulomb times meters, which gives the final units Joules/coulomb. Voltage is an expression of the amount of potential energy per unit charge. The work done moving a charge against the field can be calculated by multiplying the electric field potential by the charge, W = V q. Example Problem: Two large parallel metal plates are 5.0 cm apart. The magnitude of the electric field between them is 800. N/C. (a) What is the potential difference between the plates? (b) What work is done when one electron is moved from the positive to the negative plate? Solution: (a) V = Ed = (800. N/C)(0.050 m) = 40. J/C = 40. V (b) W = V q = (40.0 J/C)(1.6× 10−19 C) = 6.4× 10−18 J Example Problem: A voltmeter measures the potential difference between two large parallel plates to be 50.0 volts. The plates are 3.0 cm apart. What is the magnitude of the electric field strength between the plates? 
Solution:  E =  	  d = 50.0 volts 
Summary 	  • The work done moving a charged particle in an electric field can result in the particle gaining or losing both kinetic and potential energy. • The difference in electric potential energy is measured with a voltmeter in units called volts. • A constant electric field can be produced by placing two large flat conducting plates parallel to each other. • The electrical potential difference in a uniform electric field is given as V = Ed. • The work done moving a charge against the field can be found by W = V q.

This is the original equipment used by Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in 1909 at the Univeristy of Chicago to measure the electric charge on a single electron. With incredible perserverence, they were able to determine the charge to within 1% of the currently accepted value. 
Millikan  Oil  Drop  Experiment 	  The sketch below shows a diagram of the Millikan oil drop experiment. Two parallel charged plates are placed with the positively charged plate above and the negatively charged plate below. The positively charged plate has a pinhole opening in its center. An atomizer is used to spray drops of oil into the apparatus. The friction of the oil passing through the narrow opening puts a charge on many of the oil drops. As the oil drops fall, one or more pass through the pinhole opening and enter the area between the plates. The charge on the plates is adjustable. By measuring the terminal velocity of the oil drops with the electric field off, Millikan could determine the mass of the drops. Millikan and his graduate assistant were able to determine the force of the field on the drops when it was turned on by comparing the velocity of the drops with the field on to their velocity with the field off. This is easily determined when the oil drop is stationary; namely, when the downward gravitational force exactly equals the upward electrical force on the drop. Example Problem: An oil drop weighs 1.9 × 10−14 N. 
It is suspended in an electric field whose intensity is 	  FE = Eq. What is the charge on the oil drop? 
Solution: q = weight 	  The charge on this particular oil drop was 4.8 × 10−19 C. 
In doing his experiment, however,  Millikan faced a 	  problem. When the oil is sprayed through the atomizer, some oil drops are negatively charged, but we don’t know how many extra electrons the drops acquire. The charge on this oil drop could be the result of having one extra electron, or having five extra electrons. In order to determine the charge on one electron, the oil drop experiment was carried out many times, and the charges on many oil drops was determined. The smallest charge was found to be 1.6× 10−19 C, and all the other charges on oil drops were found to be whole number multiples of 1.6× 10−19 C. In the example problem above, we would conclude that the oil drop held three extra electrons. 
Summary 	  • Using a uniform electric field between two charged parallel plates and oil drops, Millikan determined the charge on a single electron. • The friction of the oil passing through the narrow opening puts charges on many of the oil drops. • When an oil drop is stopped by adjusting the charge on the plates, its weight, mg, downward equals the electrical force, Eq, upward.

Charge 	  • Millikan oil drop experiment: The purpose of Robert Millikan’s oil drop experiment (1909) was to measure the electric charge of the electron. He did this by carefully balancing the gravitational and electric forces on tiny charged droplets of oil suspended between parallel charged metal plates. • Describe charge sharing and grounding. • Describe where charges reside on solid and hollow conductors. • Define capacitance. • Describe the function of a capacitor. • Solve capacitor problems. • Understand the capacitance equation. The circuit boards found in your computer, phone, calculator, and pretty much every other electronic device you own often look much like the one shown above. Many circuit boards have capacitors, including this one. Capacitors can be used to smooth out electrical impulses or to turn constant electric currents into a series of impulses. 
Sharing  Charge 	  We already know that insulators are materials that do not allow electrons to flow through them easily. When you place excess electrons on an insulator, the electrons remain where you put them and do not move around. Conversely, conductors are materials that allow electrons to flow thorugh them freely. Since electrons repel each other, excess electrons on a conductor move to positions as far apart as possible. The difference can be seen in the image below, where the electrons on the insulator remain clumped near each other, while the electrons on the conductor have spread out to cover the whole surface. Consider a charged conductor and an uncharged conductor. When the charged conductor is touched to the uncharged conductor, as far as the electrons are concerned, it has become one large piece of conducting material. The electrons on the charged object will run onto the uncharged object until the density of the charge is evenly distributed over the entire surface of both objects. If the objects are the same size, the charge will be shared equally throughout. This method is occasionally used to divide a charge by half. The earth is also a conductor. Touching a charged object to the earth is called grounding. When you touch a conductor to the earth, you allow the earth to share the charge. Since the earth is billions of times bigger than the object, the earth takes nearly all of the charge. The charged object that was grounded now has zero charge. It is very easy to ground an object. All that is necessary is to touch a conducting wire to both the object and the earth. Electrical devices that run the risk of picking up a large static charge are grounded, meaning they are connected to the earth via such a conducting wire. Virtually all household appliances, especially washers and dryers, are grounded in this way to eliminate static charge. Similarly, large trucks, especially gasoline tankers, are grounded via a large chain hanging off the back to prevent sparks when fuel is being unloaded. Spheres, whether hollow or filled, will always have the excess charge on the surface. In hollow spheres, the only place for an electron to exist is on the surface. Similarly, in a solid conducting sphere all the excess charge sits on the surface. This conclusion is a result of Gauss’s Law, which tells us that the symmetry of the sphere and the fact that the electric field within the sphere is 0 forces the charge to the outside. 
Capacitors  Store  Charge 	  Pieter Van Musschenbroek, a Dutch physician, invented a device in 1746 that could store electric charge. Though he named the device a Leyden jar, similar devices today are called capacitors. A typical capacitor consists of a pair of parallel plates of area A separated by a small distance d. The space between the two plates is most often filled with an insulator and frequently the plates are rolled into the form of a cylinder. If voltage is applied to a capacitor, it quickly becomes charged. One of the parallel plates acquires a negative charge and the other an equal amount of positive charge. For a given capacitor, the amount of charge, Q, acquired by each plate is proportional to the potential difference, V . 
Q =  	  Q is the charge in coulombs, V is the voltage in volts, and C is the particular capacitor’s constant of proportionality. C is also called the capacitance of the capacitor. The capacitance is the voltage the capacitor can reach before it discharges, allowing the voltage across the capacitor to drop to zero and the current to cross the capacitor. The SI unit for capacitance, according to the equation above, will be coulombs/volt, and this unit has been given the name farad (F). Most capacitors have capacitances in the range of one picofarad (10−12 F) to one microfarad (10−6 F). Example Problem: A sphere has a potential difference between it and the earth of 60.0 V when charged with 
Solution:  C =  	  = 5.0× 10−8 farads 
Summary 	  • Since electrons repel each other, when excess electrons are placed on a conductor, they will move to positions as far away from each other as possible. • When a charged conductor is touched to an uncharged conductor, the electrons will migrate until the density of the charge becomes evenly distributed over the entire surface. • Touching a charged object to the earth is called grounding. • A charged conducting sphere will always have all the excess charge on its surface. • A typical capacitor consists of a pair of parallel plates, separated by a small distance. • Q = CV , where Q is the charge in coulombs, V is the voltage in volts, and C is the constant of proportionality, or capacitance.

 	  One of the most important characteristics of electrical energy is its ability to be transferred over long distances. Highvoltage electric power distribution lines can be found scattered everywhere throughout the United States. They are a common reminder of our dependence on electricity. A great deal of engineering has gone into making those power distribution lines reliable and efficient. The enormous amount of potential energy harnessed by a power station like the Grand Coulee Dam is of no value to a factory ten miles away unless that energy can be transferred efficiently from the dam to the factory. This chapter will explore how electric currents function and how we control them. • Define electric current. • Understand a simple electric circuit. • Define amperes and watts. • Describe the conditions that allow current flow. • Make calculations involving charge and current. You’ve probably heard of vacuum tubes and large transistors, which were once common in electronics like televisions. These individual devices were mounted on large printed circuit boards. Then, in 1959, two researchers working independently developed the first integrated circuits. These circuits could combine several transistors and resistors into one circuit on one small chip of silicon. These chips, like the one pictured above, are used today in virtually every electrical device. 
Electric  Current 	  Remember that it often requires work to force electrons into a specific location. If we have two conducting spheres and we have forced excess electrons onto one of the spheres by doing work on the electrons, then that sphere, and those electrons, will have a higher potential energy than those on the uncharged sphere. If the two spheres are touched together, electrons will flow from the sphere with excess electrons to the sphere with no excess electrons. That is, electrons will flow from the high potential energy position to the lower potential energy position. The flow will continue until the electrons on the two spheres have the same potential energy. A flow of charged particles such as this is called an electric current. It is possible for an electric current to be either a flow of positively charged particles or negatively charged particles. In gases, both positive and negative ions can flow. The difficulty of freeing protons, however, makes it extremely rare to have an electric current of positive particles in solid conductors. Virtually all electric currents consist of the movement of electrons. 
Common  Misconceptions 	  It is easy to assume that current is the flow of positive charges. In fact, when the conventions of positive and negative charge were invented two centuries ago, it was assumed that positive charge flowed through a wire. In reality, however, we know now that the flow of positive charge is actually a flow of negative charge in the opposite direction. That is, when an electron moves from position A to position B, it is the same as a positive hole moving from B to A. Today, even though we know it is not correct, we still use the historical convention of positive current flow when discussing the direction of a current. Conventional current, the current we commonly use and discuss, is the direction positive current would flow. When we want to speak of the direction of electron flow, we will specifically state that we are referring to electron flow. Electric current flows from positions of higher potential energy to positions of lower potential energy. Electrons acquire higher potential energy from an electron pump that does work on the electrons, moving them from positions of lower PE to positions of higher PE. Electrons in galvanic cells (several cells together comprise a battery) have higher potential energy at one terminal of the battery that at the other. This difference in potential is related to chemical energy. When the two terminals of the battery are connected to each other via a conducting wire, the electric current will travel from the terminal with higher potential energy to that with lower potential energy. This setup is the most simple of electric circuits. 
Electric  Circuits 	  An electric circuit is any closed loop that goes from one battery terminal to the other and allows current to flow through it. A relatively simple circuit is shown in the image below. The charges move from the higher potential energy terminal on the battery, through the light bulb, through the switch, and back to the lower potential energy terminal on the battery. A circuit consists of a battery, or a charge pump, which increases the potential energy of the charges, and one or more devices that decrease the potential energy. As the potential energy is reduced, it is converted into some other form of energy. In the image above, the device that decreases the charges’ potential energy is the light bulb; the excess energy is converted into light energy. Any device that reduces the potential energy of the charge flowing through it is said to have resistance because it resists the flow of charge. Other resistors include motors, which convert energy into kinetic energy, and heaters, which convert it into thermal energy. The charges in the circuit can neither be created nor destroyed, nor can they pile up in one spot. The charged particles moving through the circuit move the same everywhere in the circuit. If one coulomb of charge leaves the charge pump, then one coulomb of charge moves through the light, and one coulomb of charge moves through the switch. The net change of energy through the circuit is zero. That is, the increase in potential energy through the charge pump is exactly equal to the potential drop through the light. If the generator (charge pump) does 120 J of work on each coulomb of charge that it transfers, then the light uses 120 J of energy as the charge passes through the light. The electric current is measured in coulombs per second. A flow of one coulomb per second is called one ampere, A, of current. (cid:16) Joules (cid:17)(cid:16)coulomb (cid:17) The energy carried by an electric current depends on the charge transferred and the potential difference across which it moves, E = qV . The voltage or potential difference is expressed in Joules/coulomb and multiplying this by the charge in coulombs yields energy in Joules. Electrical power is a measure of the rate at which energy is transferred, and is expressed in watts, or Joules/second. Power can also be obtained by multiplying the voltage by the current: = Joules second coulomb second = watts. Power, P = V I = Example Problem: What is the power delivered to a light bulb when the circuit has a voltage drop of 120 V and produces a current of 3.0 ampere? Solution: P = V I = (120 J/C)(3.0 C/s) = 360 J/s = 360 watts Example Problem: A 6.00 V battery delivers a 0.400 A current to an electric motor that is connected across the battery terminals. a. What power is consumed by the motor? b. How much electric energy is delivered in 500. seconds? Solution: a. P = V I = (6.00 V)(0.400 A) = 2.4 watts b. Joules = (J/s)(s) = (2.4 J/s)(500. s) = 1200 Joules

There are four color bands identified by letter: A, B, C, and D, with a gap between the C and D bands so that you know which end is A. This particular resistor has a red A band, blue B band, green C band, and gold D band, but the bands can be different colors on different resistors. Based on the colors of the bands, it is possible to identify the type of resistor. the A and B bands represent significant digits; red is 2 and blue is 6. The C band indicates the multiplier, and green indicates 105. These three together indicate that this particular resistor is a 26,000 Ohm resistor. Finally, the D band indicates the tolerance, in this case 5%, as shown by the gold band. These terms will be explained over the course of this lesson. 
Resistance and  Ohm’s  Law 	  When a potential difference is placed across a metal wire, a large current will flow through the wire. If the same potential difference is placed across a glass rod, almost no current will flow. The property that determines how much current will flow is called the resistance. Resistance is measured by finding the ratio of potential difference, V , to current flow, I. R = 
 	  When given in the form V = IR, this formula is known as Ohm’s Law, after the man that discovered the relationship. The units of resistance can be determined using the units of the other terms in the equation, namely that the potential difference is in volts (J/C) and current in amperes (C/s): R = volts amperes = joules/coulomb coulombs/second = joules· seconds coulombs2 = ohms The units for resistance have been given the name ohms and the abbreviation is the Greek letter omega, Ω. 1.00 Ω is the resistance that will allow 1.00 ampere of current to flow through the resistor when the potential difference is Ohm’s Law. There are two ways to control the current in a circuit. Since the current is directly proportional to the potential difference and inversely proportional to the resistance, you can increase the current in a circuit by increasing the potential or by decreasing the resistance. Example Problem: A 50.0 V battery maintains current through a 20.0 Ω resistor. What is the current through the resistor? 
Summary 	  • Resistance is the property that determines the amount of current flow through a particular material. • V = IR is known as Ohm’s Law. • The unit for resistance is the ohm, and it has the abbreviation Ω.

Approximately 5000 megawatt-hours of energy passes through this particular substation each year. 
Energy  Transfer in  Electric  Circuits 	  Electric power is the energy per unit time converted by an electric circuit into another form of energy. We already know that power through a circuit is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current in a circuit: P = V I. It is possible to determine the power dissipated in a single resistor if we combine this expression with Ohm’s Law, V = IR. This becomes particularly useful in circuits with more than one resistor, to determine the power dissipated in each one. Combining these two equations, we get an expression for electric power that involves only the current and resistance in a circuit. 
P =  I2 	  The power dissipated in a resistor is proportional to the square of the current that passes through it and to its resistance. Electrical energy itself can be expressed as the electrical power multiplied by time: 
E =  Pt 	  We can incorporate this equation to obtain an equation for electrical energy based on current, resistance, and time. The electrical energy across a resistor is determined to be the current squared multiplied by the resistance and the time. 
E =  I2 Rt 	  This equation holds true in ideal situations. However, devices used to convert electrical energy into other forms of energy are never 100% efficient. An electric motor is used to convert electrical energy into kinetic energy, but some of the electrical energy in this process is lost to thermal energy. When a lamp converts electrical energy into light energy, some electrical energy is lost to thermal energy. Example Problem: A heater has a resistance of 25.0 Ω and operates on 120.0 V. a. How much current is supplied to the resistance? b. How many joules of energy is provided by the heater in 10.0 s? Solution: a. I = V b. E = I2Rt = (4.8 A)2(25.0 Ω)(10.0 s) = 5760 joules 
R = 120.0  	  Think again about the power grid. When electricity is transmitted over long distances, some amount of energy is lost in overcoming the resistance in the transmission lines. We know the equation for the power dissipated is given by P = I2R. The energy loss can be minimized by choosing the material with the least resistance for power lines, but changing the current also has significant effects. Consider a reduction of the current by a power of ten: How much power is dissipated when a current of 10.0 A passes through a power line whose resistance is 1.00 Ω? P = I2R = (10.0 A)2(1.00 Ω) = 100. Watts How much power is dissipated when a current of 1.00 A passes through a power line whose resistance is 1.00 Ω? P = I2R = (1.00 A)2(1.00 Ω) = 1.00 Watts The power loss is reduced tremendously by reducing the magnitude of the current through the resistance. Power companies must transmit the same amount of energy over the power lines but keep the power loss minimal. They do this by reducing the current. From the equation P = V I, we know that the voltage must be increased to keep the same power level. 
The  Kilowatt- Hour 	  Even though the companies that supply electrical energy are often called “power” companies, they are actually selling energy. Your electricity bill is based on energy, not power. The amount of energy provided by electric current can be calculated by multiplying the watts (J/s) by seconds to yield joules. The joule, however, is a very small unit of energy and using the joule to state the amount of energy used by a household would require a very large number. For that reason, electric companies measure their energy sales in a large number of joules called a kilowatt hour (kWh). A kilowatt hour is exactly as it sounds the number of kilowatts (1,000 W) transferred per hour. Example Problem: A color television uses about 2.0 A when operated on 120 V. a. How much power does the set use? b. If the TV is operated for 8.00 hours per day, how much energy in kWh does it use per day? c. At $0.15 per kWh, what does it cost to run the TV for 30 days? Solution: a. P = V I = (120 V )(2.0 A) = 240 W b. E = (240 J/s)(8 h)(3600 s/h) c. Cost = (1.92 kW h)(30)($0.15) = $8.64 = 1.92 kW h 
Summary 	  • Electric power is the energy per unit time converted by an electric circuit into another form of energy. • The formula for electric power is P = I2R. • The electric energy transferred to a resistor in a time period is equal to the electric power multiplied by time, E = Pt, and can also be calculated using E = I2Rt. • Electric companies measure their energy sales in a large number of joules called a kilowatt hour (kWh) which is equivalent to 3.6× 106 J.

What is the current in the lines? • electrical energy: Energy is the ability to do work, so electrical energy is the work done by an electrical circuit. • kilowatt hour: An amount of energy equal to 3.6× 106 Joules. • Define and describe the function of an electrical fuse. • Define and describe the function of a circuit breaker. • Define and describe the function of a surge protector. The amount of electric current that passes through a circuit depends on the voltage pushing the current and the resistance opposing the flow of current. Circuits are designed for a specific voltage and resistance so that the current flow will be known. If the current is too large, the heat loss can damage the circuit, burn the resistors, or even burn the surrounding objects. Even with circuits designed to prevent such situations, accidents can happen, such as when wires touch each other unexpectedly. To prevent disasters, electrical circuits contain devices such as electrical fuses, circuit breakers, and surge protectors to control the amount of current in the circuit. Examples of these devices are shown above, and explained below. 
Controlling  Current in  Electric  Circuits 	  In the wiring of a building, the wires carrying the current in and out are different and never touch directly. The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit. In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires. For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat. There are multiple ways to prevent these situations from occurring. The three most common protective devices are fuses, circuit breakers, and surge protectors. 
Fuses 	  An electrical fuse is a device that sacrifices itself to provide over-current protection in an electrical circuit. Conducting wires have a small electrical resistance. The electrical resistance of a conducting wire is related to the type of metal used and inversely related to the cross-sectional area of the wire. The larger the diameter of a wire, the greater the cross-sectional area, and the lower the electrical resistance will be. When electrons flow through a wire, they repel each other and interfere with the passage of other electrons. If there are a very large number of electrons passing through a wire with small diameter, the electrons will experience a greater resistance than if the wire diameter were larger and the electrons had more space between them. The image above is one type of electrical fuse. This fuse has a specially designed wire inside glass housing. The wire inside the glass is made of a particular metal and with a particular thickness to give the wire an exact resistance. This resistance will allow passage of normal current plus a marginal percentage more. If, however, the current exceeds the allowed value, the wire in the fuse will heat and melt, thus interrupting current flow through the circuit. The fuse wire is placed in the glass housing and a fuse mount to insulate the melting wire from its surroundings. Any unintended increase in current, such as short circuits, overloading, mismatched loads, or device failure will cause the fuse to burn out –protecting the other parts of the circuit from overheating and further damage. This ’wire in glass’ fuse is only one type of electrical fuse. Most fuses consist of a wire with small cross-sectional area compared to the circuit conductors, mounted between electrical terminals, and enclosed in a non-combustible housing. Regardless of the specific type of fuse, it is placed such that it carries all the current passing through the protected circuit. If the current flow gets too high, the fuse will melt. This destroys the fuse, but protects the remainder of the circuit. 
Circuit  Breakers 	  The problem with fuses is they only work once. Every time you blow a fuse, you have to replace it with a new one. Like a fuse, a circuit breaker opens the circuit if the current reaches unsafe levels. Unlike a fuse, however, a circuit breaker can be used over and over again. The basic circuit breaker consists of a simple switch, connected to an electromagnet. The diagram below shows a typical basic circuit breaker design. The red wire is the electrical circuit and is closed when the two contact points are connected. When the switch is in the on position, electricity can flow through the red circuit, through the electromagnet, and out into the rest of the circuit. The electricity magnetizes the electromagnet. Increasing the current boosts the electromagnet’s magnetic force, while decreasing the current reduces the magnetic force. When the current reaches an unsafe level, the electromagnet’s magnetic field becomes strong enough to act on the soft iron bar, which is holding the left red wire in contact. When the soft iron bar is pulled down, the spring attached to the left red wire will lift the wire and break the circuit, causing the electricity to shut off. Once the circuit is broken, the electromagnet no longer emits a magnetic field, and the system can be reset by pushing the reset button. The reset button pushes the left red wire back in contact with the right red wire and also re-engages the soft iron bar that holds the contact in place. More advanced circuit breakers use electronic components (semiconductor devices) to monitor current levels rather than simple electrical devices. These elements are a lot more precise, and they shut down the circuit more quickly, but they are also a lot more expensive. For this reason, most houses still use conventional electric circuit breakers. When circuit breakers pop open due to excessive current, you do not have to replace the circuit breaker, you simply push a reset button. Of course, if the reason that the circuit breaker popped open is still present (like a short circuit), the circuit will simply pop open again when you reset it. When a circuit breaker pops open, you should determine the reason it opened and fix the problem before resetting the circuit breaker. 
Surge  Protection 	  A standard surge protector passes the electrical current along from the outlet to a number of electrical and electronic devices plugged into the power strip. If the voltage from the outlet surges or spikes (rises above the accepted level) the surge protector diverts the extra electricity into the outlet’s grounding wire. The most common type of surge protector contains a component called a metal oxide varistor, or MOV, which diverts the extra voltage. As you can see in the diagram below, an MOV forms a connection between the hot power line and the grounding line. An MOV has three parts: a piece of metal oxide material in the middle and two semiconductors that join it to the power and grounding lines. These semiconductors have a variable resistance that is dependent on voltage. When voltage is below a certain level, the electrons in the semiconductors flow in such a way as to create a very high resistance. When the voltage exceeds that level, the electrons behave differently, creating a much lower resistance. When the voltage is low, an MOV does nothing. When voltage is too high, an MOV can conduct a lot of current to the ground line, thus eliminating the extra voltage. As soon as the extra current is diverted into the MOV and to ground, the voltage in the hot line returns to a normal level, causing the MOV’s resistance to shoot up again. In this way, the MOV only diverts the surge current, while allowing the standard current to continue powering whatever machines are connected to the surge protector. Essentially, the MOV acts as a pressure release valve, only opening when the voltage exceeds set values. 
Summary 	  • An electrical fuse is a device that sacrifices itself to provide over-current protection in an electrical circuit. If too much current flows, the fuse wire rises to a higher temperature and melts, thus opening the circuit, but destroying the fuse. • A circuit breaker opens a circuit as soon as the current climbs to unsafe levels, and can be used repeatedly. • A standard surge protector passes a constant electrical current forward by diverting any extra electricity into a grounding wire.

Questions 	  have one part of the wire that is considerably more narrow than the remainder of the wire. What is the purpose of this narrowing of the fuse wire? • short circuit: A device in a circuit is said to be short-circuited if it is by-passed by a conductor of nearly zero resistance so that the voltage across the device drops to almost zero and the current in the by-pass circuit becomes huge. • electrical fuse: A safety device that protects an electric circuit from excessive current, consisting of or containing a metal element that melts when current exceeds a specific amperage, thereby opening the circuit. • circuit breaker: A reusable device used to interrupt an electrical circuit if the current flow exceeds a chosen level and becomes dangerous. • surge protector: A device used to eliminate sudden surges or spikes of electrical power in a circuit. • metal oxide varistor or MOV: A metal oxide varistor is a resistor whose resistance varies nonlinearly with voltage. Those MOVs used in surge protectors have high resistance with normal voltage, thus disallowing current flow, but their resistance decreases greatly when voltage sharply increases. Electrical power is the product of voltage, which is measured in watts, and current, which is measured in amperes. Resistance to the flow of electricity is measured in ohms. Anything in an electrical circuit that makes use of the flow of electricity provides some resistance. Electrical resistance within a wire is dependent not only on the material of the wire, but also on the length of the wire and the amount of current flowing through it. By converting electrical power to high voltage and low current, power companies can efficiently transfer energy over great distances with little loss. The power must be converted back at its destination for use in homes and businesses. Circuit breakers and fuses control the flow of current through a circuit and provide a measure of protection against excessive heat that may result from faulty circuits. 
 	  The string of Christmas lights on this tree may have cost $5 or $25, depending on how its circuit is constructed. One possibility is that the lights are connected along a single path, in a series circuit. In this case, if the filament in one of the bulbs were to burn out, then all the lights would go out. You wouldn’t be able to tell which one malfunctioned, unless you go through the string and replace each bulb one at a time. The only advantage to such a design is that it is inexpensive. Alternatively, each bulb could be placed in its own separate branch of the circuit. Since there are now multiple paths by which charge can travel through the circuit, a burnt out bulb would not affect the rest of the lights, and it’d be obvious which one would need to be replaced. Of course, a string of lights with this design, known as a parallel circuit, would cost much more than the first. In this chapter, we will examine and learn the mathematics involved in series circuits, parallel circuits, and those that are a combination of both. • Describe a series circuit. • Understand current as it passes through a series circuit. • Understand voltage drops in a series circuit. • Understand resistance in a series circuit with multiple resistors. • Calculate current, voltage drops, and equivalent resistances for devices connected in a series circuit. Resistors, including electrical appliances, have a particular current at which they operate most effectively and safely, and excessive current can cause irreparable damage. Therefore, it is important to limit the amount of current that may pass through a particular electrical circuit. There are a number of safety devices used in electrical circuits to limit the current: fuses, circuit breakers, and surge suppressors. When fuses, such as those shown above, are placed in an electrical circuit, all the current must pass through the wire in the fuse. 
Series  Circuits 	  Electrical circuits are often modeled by using water in a river. The potential energy of the water is the highest at the source of the river and decreases as the water flows down the river toward the end. When the water reaches the ocean, its potential energy has become zero. The circuit shown below has a similar situation. The current in this circuit is drawn in the direction of the electron flow. It starts at the battery on the left, where electrons leave the negative terminal and travel around the circuit. Since all of the current travels across each resistor, these resistors are said to be in series. A series circuit is one in which all of the current must pass through every resistor in the circuit. Returning to the water analogy, there is only one riverbed from the top of the mountain to the ocean. Consider the series circuit sketched above. This circuit has a voltage drop for the entire circuit of 120 V and has three resistors connected in series. The current in this circuit is drawn in terms of electron flow. The electrons leave the potential difference source at the negative terminal and flow through the three resistors, starting with R3. Though they have a small amount of resistance, the resistance of the connecting wires is so small in relation to the resistors that we ignore it. Therefore, we say that there is no voltage drop when the current passes through the connecting wires. The voltage drops occur when the current passes through each of the resistors and the total voltage drop for the entire circuit is equal to the sum of the voltage drops through the three resistors. 
T =  V1 + V2 + V3 	  The current through each of the resistors must be exactly the same because the current in a series circuit is the same everywhere. The current is moving in the entire circuit at the same time. 
T =  I1 =  I2 =  I3 	  Since the current passes through each resistor, the total resistance in the circuit is equal to the sum of the resistors. In the circuit above, the total resistance is: RT = R1 + R2 + R3 = 30 Ω + 15 Ω + 15 Ω = 60 Ω Therefore, the total current and the current through each resistor is I = 
 	  R = The individual voltage drops can be calculated using the current through each resistor and each resistor’s individual resistance. 
V3 =  I3 R3 = (2.0  A)(15 Ω) = 30  	  Example Problem: Four 15 Ω resistors are connected in series with a 45 V battery. What is the current in the circuit? Solution: RT = 15 Ω + 15 Ω + 15 Ω + 15 Ω = 60 Ω

Electrical circuits are everywhere: skyscrapers, jumbo jets, arcade games, lights, heating, security... Very few complex things work without electrical circuits. Since the late 1970s, electrical circuits have primarily looked like this. The circuits are formed by a thin layer of conducting material deposited on the surface of an insulating board. Individual components are soldered to the interconnecting circuits. Circuit boards are vastly more complicated than the series circuits previously discussed, but operate on many similar principles. 
Parallel  Circuits 	  Parallel circuits are circuits in which the charges leaving the potential source have different paths they can follow to get back to the source. In the sketch below, the current leaves the battery, passes through the orange switch, and then has three different paths available to complete the circuit. Each individual electron in this circuit passes through only one of the light bulbs. After the current passes through the switch, it divides into three pieces and each piece passes through one of the bulbs. The three pieces of current rejoin after the light bulbs and continue in the circuit to the potential source. In the design of this parallel circuit, each resistor (light bulb) is connected across the battery as if the other two resistors were not present. Remember that the current going through each resistor goes through only the one resistor. Therefore, the voltage drop across each resistor must be equal to the total voltage drop though the circuit. 
T =  V1 =  V2 =  V3 	  The total current passing through the circuit will be the sum of the individual currents passing through each resistor. 
T =  I1 +  I2 +  I3 	  If we return to the analogy of a river, a parallel circuit is the same as the river breaking into three streams, which later rejoin to one river again. The amount of water flowing in the river is equal to the sum of the amounts of water flowing in the individual streams. Ohm’s Law applies to resistors in parallel, just as it did to resistors in a series. The current flowing through each resistor is equal to the total voltage drop divided by the resistance in that resistor. I1 =

When solving problems with such circuits, use this series of steps. remains. Then you can determine the total circuit current. The voltage drops and currents though individual resistors can then be calculated. Example Problem: In the combination circuit sketched below, find the equivalent resistance for the circuit, find the total current through the circuit, and find the current through each individual resistor. Solution: We start by simplifying the parallel resistors R2 and R3. = 
R23 = 99 Ω 	  We then simplify R1 and R23 which are series resistors. RT = R1 + R23 = 110 Ω + 99 Ω = 209 Ω 
 	  All the current must pass through R1, so I1 = 0.11 A. The voltage drop through R1 is (110 Ω)(0.11 A) = 12.6 volts. Therefore, the voltage drop through R2 and R3 is 11.4 volts.

This photo is of the interior of the control room for a nuclear power plant. Many of the meters are reading information about the water temperature and the nuclear reaction that is occurring, but the majority of the meters are reading data about the electric energy being generated. 
Ammeters and  Voltmeters 	  Ammeters and voltmeters are cleverly designed for the way they are used. Ammeters measure the current of a circuit, and voltmeters measure the voltage drop across a resistor. It is important in the design and use of these meters that they don’t change the circuit in such a way as to influence the readings. While both types of meters are technically resistors, they are specifically designed to make their readings without changing the circuit itself. 
Ammeter 	  An ammeter measures the current traveling through the circuit. They are designed to be connected to the circuit in series, and have an extremely low resistance. If an ammeter were connected in parallel, all of the current would go through the ammeter and very little through any other resistor. As such, it is necessary for the ammeter to be connected in series with the resistors. This allows the ammeter to accurately measure the current flow without causing any disruptions. In the circuit sketched above, the ammeter is m2. 
Voltmeter 	  In contrast, a voltmeter is designed to be connected to a circuit in parallel, and has a very high resistance. A voltmeter measures the voltage drop across a resistor, and does not need to have the current travel through it to do so. When a voltmeter is placed in parallel with a resistor, all the current continues to travel through the resistor, avoiding the very high resistance of the voltmeter. However, we know that the voltage drop across all resistors in parallel is the same, so connecting a voltmeter in parallel allows it to accurately measure the voltage drop. In the sketch, the voltmeter is m1. 
Summary 	  • Ammeters measure the current through a resistor. • Ammeters have low resistances and are placed in the circuit in series. • Voltmeters measure the voltage drop across a resistor. • Voltmeters have high resistances and are placed in the circuit in parallel.

Series circuits are simple and comparatively inexpensive to design, but require every resistor or device in the circuit to be functional in order for the rest to work. Parallel circuits are more complex and expensive, but they have some advantages that may be worth the cost. There are applications for each type of circuit. More commonly, a combination of both types is used, which can offer capabilities and advantages that neither type can provide individually. Ammeters and voltmeters are tools used to evaluate the flow of current through a circuit and must be connected to the circuit appropriately in order to measure the flow without significantly changing it. 
 	  The interaction between moving electrons and magnetic fields can produce electricity. If a metallic wire that is part of a complete circuit is passed through a magnetic field, the electrons in the wire are pushed through the circuit, resulting in an electric current. An electric generator is any machine that is designed to generate electricity by passing metal wires through a magnetic field. All that is required is to spin the axle on the generator. The largest generators rely on turbines, which contain fan blades that spin when fluid—such as steam produced by burning coal or wind blowing through a windmill—is forced through. The generation of hydroelectric power harnesses falling water to spin turbines attached to electric generators. For instance, the Colorado River flows through the turbines of the Hoover Dam, shown above, generating more than 4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year for use in Nevada, Arizona, and California. • Describe magnetic fields around permanent magnets. • Understand ferromagnetism and magnetic domains. • Describe some properties of magnets. Some countries are using powerful electromagnets to develop high-speed trains, called maglev, or magnetic levitation, trains. These trains use the repulsive force of magnets to float over a guide way, removing the friction of steel wheels and train tracks. Reducing this friction allows the trains to travel at much higher speeds. 
Properties of  Magnets 	  Any magnet, regardless of its shape, has two ends called poles where the magnetic effect is strongest. If a magnet is suspended by a fine thread, it is found that one pole of the magnet will always point toward the north. This fact has been made use of in navigation since the eleventh century. The pole of the magnet that seeks the north pole is called the north pole of the magnet, while the opposite side is the south pole. It is a familiar fact that when two magnets are brought near one another, the magnets exert a force on each other. The magnetic force can be either attractive or repulsive. If two north poles or two south poles are brought near each other, the force will be repulsive. If a north pole is brought near a south pole, the force will be attractive. The Earth’s geographic north pole (which is close to, but not exactly at the magnetic pole) attracts the north poles of magnets. We know, therefore, that this pole is actually the Earth’s magnetic south pole. This can be seen in the image above; the geographic north and south poles are labeled with barber shop poles, and the Earth’s magnetic poles are indicated with the double-headed arrow. Only iron and few other materials such as cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium show strong magnetic effects. These materials are said to be ferromagnetic. Other materials show some slight magnetic effect but it is extremely small and can be detected only with delicate instruments. 
Ferromagnetic  Domains 	  Microscopic examination reveals that a magnet is actually made up of tiny regions known as magnetic domains, which are about one millimeter in length and width. Each domain acts like a tiny magnet with a north and south pole. When the ferrous material is not magnetized, the domains are randomly organized so that the north and south poles do not line up and often cancel each other. When the ferrous material is placed in a magnetic field, the domains line up with the magnetic field so that the north poles are all pointed in the same direction and the south poles are all pointed in the opposite direction. In this way, the ferrous material has become a magnet. In many cases, the domains will remain aligned only while the ferrous material is in a strong magnetic field; when the material is removed from the field, the domains return to their previous random organization and the ferrous material loses any magnetic properties. Magnets that have magnetic properties while in the field of another magnet but lose the magnetic properties when removed from the field are called temporary magnets. Under certain circumstances, however, the new alignment can be made permanent and the ferrous substance becomes a permanent magnet. That is, the ferrous object remains a magnet even when removed from the other magnetic field. The formation of temporary magnets allows a magnet to attract a non-magnetized piece of iron. You have most likely seen a magnet pick up a paper clip. The presence of the magnet aligns the domains in the iron paper clip and it becomes a temporary magnet. Whichever pole of the magnet is brought near the paper clip will induce magnetic properties in the paper clip that remain as long as the magnet is near. Permanent magnets lose their magnetic properties when the domains are dislodged from their organized positions and returned to a random jumble. This can occur if the magnet is hammered on or if it is heated strongly. 
Magnetic  Fields 	  When we were dealing with electrical effects, it was very useful to speak of an electric field that surrounded an electric charge. In the same way, we can imagine a magnetic field surrounding a magnetic pole. The force that one magnet exerts on another can be described as the interaction between one magnet and the magnetic field of the other magnet. Magnetic field lines go from the north magnetic pole to the south magnetic pole. We define the magnetic field at any point as a vector (represented by the letter B) whose direction is from north to south magnetic poles. 
Summary 	  • Any magnet has two ends called poles where the magnetic effect is strongest. • The magnetic pole found at the north geographical pole of the earth is a south magnetic pole. • The force that one magnet exerts on another can be described as the interaction between one magnet and the magnetic field of the other magnet. • Magnetic field lines go from the north magnetic pole to the south magnetic pole.

Powerful electromagnets are commonly used for industrial lifting. Here, a magnet is lifting scrap iron and loading it onto a railroad car for transporting to a scrap iron recovery plant. Other uses for lifting magnets include moving cars in a junk yard, lifting rolls of steel sheeting, and lifting large steel parts for various machines. Electromagnets are usually used for these jobs because they are magnets only when the electric current is on. The magnet will hold the iron object when the current is on and release it when the current is off. 
Electric  Currents and  Magnetic  Fields 	  Electricity and magnetism are inextricably linked. Under certain conditions, electric current causes a magnetic field. Under other conditions, a magnetic field can cause an electric current. A moving charged particle creates a magnetic field around it. Additionally, when a moving charged particle moves through a different magnetic field, the two magnetic fields will interact. The result is a force exerted on the moving charged particle. 
Magnetic  Field  Around a  Current  Carrying  Wire 	  In sketch (a) above, a current is being pushed through a straight wire. Small compasses placed around the wire point in a circle, instead of all towards the north pole. This demonstrates the presence of a magnetic field around the wire. If the current is turned off, the compass points return to pointing north. The current moving in a straight wire produces a circular magnetic field around the wire. When using conventional current, the direction of the magnetic field is determined by using the right hand rule. The rule says to curl your right hand around the wire such that your thumb points in the direction of the conventional current. Having done this, your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. Note that the right hand rule is for conventional current. If you are dealing with an electron flow current, the charges are flowing in the opposite direction, so you must use your left hand. That is, curl your left hand around the wire with your thumb pointing in the direction of the electron flow and your fingers will point in the direction of the magnetic field. 
Charged  Particles  Moving  Through a  Magnetic  Field 	  When a charged particle moves through a magnetic field at right angles to the field, the field exerts a force on the charged particle in a different direction. In the case sketched above, an electron is moving downward through a magnetic field. The motion of the electron is perpendicular to the magnetic field. The force exerted on the electron can be calculated by the equation, F = Bqv, where B is the strength of the field, q is the charge on the particle and v is the velocity of the particle. 
B is expressed in  Newtons 	  as a Tesla, after the Serbian physicist Nikola Tesla. You can see that the product of these three units is Newtons, the appropriate unit for force. Amp·meter ,while q is expressed in coulombs and v is expressed in m/s. The unit N 
Amp·meter · coulomb · meter 	  s and since amperes are coulomb 
F =  Bqv =  Newtons 	  cancels meters. The only unit remaining is Newtons. Again, we can determine the direction of the force acting upon the electron using a hand rule. Since the electron has a negative charge, the left hand rule is used. The fingers of the left hand are pointed in the direction of the magnetic field and the thumb points in the direction of the initial electron movement. The direction of the force acting on the electron is the direction the palm of the left hand faces. The direction of the magnetic field, the direction of the moving charge, and the direction of the force on the particle are all perpendicular to each other. second , amps cancels coulombs/second and meters In most situations, a positive test charged is used, instead of an electron. In these circumstances, the right hand rule is used. The right hand rule is the same as the left hand rule; the thumb is the direction of initial charge movement, the fingers are the direction of the field, and the palm is the direction of the acting force. In dealing with the relationships that exist between magnetic fields and electric charges, there are both left hand and right hand rules that we use to indicate various directions –directions of fields, directions of currents, directions of motion. To avoid errors, it is absolutely vital to know and express whether the system we are observing is using conventional current or electron current. This allows us to use the appropriate rule. Example Problem: An electron traveling at 3.0× 106 m/s passes through a 0.0400 N/amp· m uniform magnetic field. The electron is moving at right angles to the magnetic field. What force acts on the electron? Solution: F = Bqv = (0.0400 N/amp· m)(1.6× 10−19 C)(3.0× 106 m/s) = 1.9× 10−14 N When the current is traveling through a magnetic field while inside a wire, the magnetic force is still exerted but now it is calculated as the force on the wire rather than on the individual charges in the current. The equation for the force on the wire is given as F = BIL, where B is the strength of the magnetic field, I is the current in amps and L is the length of the wire in and perpendicular to the field. Example Problem: A wire 0.10 m long carries a current of 5.0 A. The wire is at right angles to a uniform magnetic field. The force the field exerts on the wire is 0.20 N. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field? 
Solution:  B =  	  IL = (5.0 A)(0.10 m) = 0.40 N 
Summary 	  • A moving charged particle creates a magnetic field around it. • Charge through a wire creates a magnetic field around it, the properties of which can be determined using a right hand rule. • When a moving charged particle moves through another magnetic field, that field will exert a force on the moving charged particle that can be expressed using F = Bqv. • The relationships between the moving charged particle, magnetic field, and the force exerted can be determined using the right hand rule if the particle is positive, or the left hand rule if it is negative. • When the current is traveling through a magnetic field while inside a wire, the magnetic force is still exerted but now it is calculated as the force on the wire rather than on the individual charges in the current, calculated using F = BIL.

These cars are certainly a part of our future. On the left in the image above is an all-electric vehicle, and on the right is a hybrid vehicle that uses gas part time and electricity part time. 
Electric  Motors 	  In an earlier concept, we described and calculated the force that a magnetic field exerts on a current carrying wire. Since you are familiar with Newton’s third law of motion, you know that if the magnetic field exerts a force on the current carrying wire, then the current carrying wire also exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction on the magnetic field. In the sketch above, a circuit is connected to a battery, with one part of the circuit placed inside a magnetic field. When current runs through the circuit, a force will be exerted on the wire by the magnetic field, causing the wire to move. If we choose to consider electron current in this case, the electrons flow from the back of the sketch to the front while the magnetic field is directed upward. Using the left hand rule for this, we find that the force on the wire is to the right of the page. Had we chosen to consider the current to be conventional current, then the current would be flowing from the front of the sketch to the back and we would use the right hand rule. The force on the wire would, once again, be toward the right. This movement is harnessed in electrical motors. Electrical motors change electrical energy into mechanical energy. The motor consists of an electrical circuit with part of the wires inside a magnetic field. This can be seen below. Positive charges move through the circuit in the direction of the light purple arrows. When the charges move up through the part of the coil that is right next to the north pole, the right hand rule tells us that the wire suffers the force, F, pushing the wire in the direction of the blue arrow, toward the back of the sketch. On the other side of the coil, where the charges are moving down through the field, the right hand rule shows the force would push this side of the coil toward the front. These two forces are working together, rotating the coil in the direction of the circular red arrow. Where the rotating coil (in grey) meets the wires attached to the power source (black), we find a split ring commutator. The coil turns, but the commutator and power source do not. As the coil turns, it moves off of the blue box connector and as it continues to turn, it connects to the other blue box connector. As the coil turns, it reverses its connections to the external circuit. Therefore, inside the coil, the current is always flowing in the same direction because the left side of the coil is always attached to the left side of the external circuit. This allows the coil, or armature, to continue to spin the same direction all the time. In electrical motors, these coils often consist of not just one, but many wires, as can be seen here: 
Summary 	  • When current runs through the circuit, a force will be exerted on the wire. • An electrical motor changes electrical energy into mechanical energy. • A split ring commutator keeps the current in the coil flowing in the same direction even though the coil changes sides every half turn.

One of the most famous electric car companies is Tesla, named after Nikola Tesla. These electric cars, and all others, require an electromagnet to run the engine. 
Electromagnets 	  A long coil of wire consisting of many loops of wire and making a complete circuit is called a solenoid. The magnetic field within a solenoid can be quite large since it is the sum of the fields due to the current in each individual loop. The magnetic field around the wire is determined by a hand rule. Since this description doesn’t mention electron flow, we must assume that the current indicated by I is conventional current (positive). Therefore, we would use a right hand rule. We grasp a section of wire with our right hand pointing the thumb in the direction of the current flow and our fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. Therefore, the field points down the cavity in these loops from right to left as shown in the sketch. If a piece of iron is placed inside the coil of wire, the magnetic field is greatly increased because the domains of the iron are aligned by the magnetic field of the current. The resulting magnetic field is hundreds of time stronger than the field from the current alone. This arrangement is called an electromagnet. The picture below shows an electromagnet with an iron bar inside a coil. Our knowledge of electromagnets developed from a series of observations. In 1820, Hans Oersted discovered that a current-carrying wire produced a magnetic field. Later in the same year, André-Marie Ampere discovered that a coil of wire acted like a permanent magnet and François Arago found that an iron bar could be magnetized by putting it inside of a coil of current-carrying wire. Finally, William Sturgeon found that leaving the iron bar inside the coil greatly increased the magnetic field. Two major advantages of electromagnets are that they are extremely strong magnetic fields, and that the magnetic field can be turned on and off. When the current flows through the coil, it is a powerful magnet, but when the current is turned off, the magnetic field essentially disappears. Electromagnets find use in many practical applications. Electromagnets are used to lift large masses of magnetic materials such as scrap iron, rolls of steel, and auto parts. The overhead portion of this machine (painted yellow) is a lifting electromagnet. It is lowered to the deck where steel pipe is stored and it picks up a length of pipe and moves it to another machine where it is set upright and lowered into an oil well drill hole. Electromagnets are essential to the design of the electric generator and electric motor and are also employed in doorbells, circuit breakers, television receivers, loudspeakers, electric dead bolts, car starters, clothes washers, atomic particle accelerators, and electromagnetic brakes and clutches. Electromagnets are commonly used as switches in electrical machines. A recent use for industrial electromagnets is to create magnetic levitation systems for bullet trains. 
Summary 	  • A solenoid is a long coil of wire consisting of many loops of wire that makes a complete circuit. • An electormagnet is a piece of iron inside a solenoid. • While the magnetic field of a solenoid may be quite large, an electromagnet has a significantly larger magnetic field. • Electromagnets’ magnetic fields can be easily turned off by just halting the current.

Questions 	  • solenoid: A current-carrying coil of wire that acts like a magnet when a current passes through it. • electromagnet: A temporary magnet consisting of an iron or steel core wound with a coil of wire, through which a current is passed. • magnetic levitation: The suspension of an object above a second object by means of magnetic repulsion. Magnets can be temporary or permanent, depending on their ability to retain charge when not in contact with another magnet. Ferromagnetic materials are substances that can be made into magnets. A ferromagnetic core wrapped with a current-carrying wire forms an electromagnet that can be many times stronger than the magnet alone. Magnets emit magnetic fields, and passing a wire connected to a complete circuit through such fields induces current through the circuit. This is the basic premise behind electric generators, which effectively convert the mechanical energy of the motion of the wire into electrical energy. . kimedia.org/wiki/File:Globe_%28PSF%29.png . le:Nissan_Leaf_%26_Chevy_Volt_charging_trimmed.jpg . 
 	  If you have ever looked up at power lines, you’ve surely seen these barrel-shaped devices attached to utility poles. The devices are called transformers. To understand their purpose, you should know that all metal transmission wires have some amount of resistance to the passage of electric current, which means that a fraction of electric power is converted to heat. The amount of energy lost to the surroundings is proportional to the square of the electric current. The electric power transmitted over these lines can be expressed in watts and is equal to the voltage times the amperage of the current. A current of 100 amps and a voltage of 50,000 volts transmits the same amount of power as 5 amps and 1,000,000 volts. Since the energy loss is related to the amperage squared, using the 5-amp current instead of the 100-amp current would make a tremendous difference in terms of efficiency. It is clearly wise to increase a current’s voltage and reduce its strength before sending it over long transmission lines. When the current reaches houses and other buildings, however, the appliances at those destinations cannot use a current of 5 amps with a voltage of 1,000,000 volts. Therefore, the most efficient system for the transmission of electric power is to “step-up” transform the current to a higher voltage before long-distance transmission and then “step-down” transform the current to a lower voltage to ready it for use. These transformations are carried out by the transformers on the power lines. In this chapter, you will learn more about transformers and other applications of electromagnetic induction. • Define EMF. • Calculate EMF for a wire moving in a magnetic field. Electrical generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Every electrical generator needs some method for spinning the coil inside the magnetic field. Hydroelectric generators use water pressure to spin the coil while windmills, of course, use the wind to spin the coil. The image here is a combination of steam turbine and generator. The steam can be produced by burning coal or diesel fuel or by a nuclear reaction and the steam then turns the coil and generates electricity. 
Electromotive  Force 	  When an individual charge flies through a magnetic field, a force is exerted on the charge and the path of the charge bends. In the case shown in the sketch below, the charge is positive and the right hand rule shows us the force will be upward, perpendicular to both the field and the path of the charge. If a wire that is part of a complete circuit is moved through a magnetic field, the force on the individual electrons in the wire occurs in exactly the same manner. Since the electrons in the wire are negatively charged, the force would be in the opposite direction but otherwise the situation is the same. When the wire is pulled downward through the magnetic field, the force on the electrons cause them to move within the wire. Since the charges are negative, the left hand rule shows that the electrons would move as diagrammed in the sketch. (Point fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, point thumb in the direction of wire movement, and palm shows direction of electron flow.) No current will flow, of course, unless the section of wire is part of a complete circuit. This process allows us to convert mechanical energy (the motion of the wire) into electrical energy (the current). This is the opposite of what happens in an electric motor where electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy. In order to maintain a constant current flow, it is necessary to have a potential difference or voltage in the circuit. The voltage or potential difference is also frequently referred to electromotive force. The term electromotive force, like many historical terms, is a misnomer. Electromotive force is NOT a force, it is a potential difference or potential energy per unit charge and is measured in volts. The potential difference in the case of moving a wire through a magnetic field is produced by the work done on the charges by whatever is pushing the wire through the field. The EMF (or voltage) depends on the magnetic field strength, B, the length of the wire in the magnetic field, l, and the velocity of the wire in the field. 
F =  Blv 	  This calculation is based on the wire moving perpendicularly through the field. If the wire moves an angle to the field, then only the component of the wire perpendicular to the field will generate EMF. Example Problem: A 0.20 m piece of wire that is part of a complete circuit moves perpendicularly through a magnetic field whose magnetic induction is 0.0800 T. If the speed of the wire is 7.0 m/s, what EMF is induced in the wire? Solution: EMF = Blv = (0.0800 N/A· m)(0.20 m)(7.0 m/s) = 0.11 N · m/C = 0.11 J/C = 0.11 V 
Summary 	  • If a wire that is part of a complete circuit is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts a force on the individual electrons in the wire, which causes a current to flow. • The potential difference in the case of moving a wire through a magnetic field is produced by the work done on the charges by whatever is pushing the wire through the field. • The EMF (or voltage) depends on the magnetic field strength, B, the length of the wire in the magnetic field, l, and the velocity of the wire in the field, EMF = Blv.

These large machines are electric generators. This particular row of generators is installed in a hydroelectric power station. The insides of these generators are coils of wire spinning in a magnetic field. The relative motion between the wire and the magnetic field is what generates electric current. In all generators, some mechanical energy is used to spin the coil of wire in the generator. In the case of hydroelectric power, the coil of wire is spun by water falling from higher PE to lower PE. Windmills and steam turbines are used in other types of power generators to spin the coil. 
Electric  Generators 	  Electric generators convert mechanical energy to electric energy. The generator consists of some number of wire loops wrapped around an iron core and placed in a strong magnetic field. The loops of wire and the iron core are called the armature. The armature is mounted so that it can rotate freely inside the magnetic field. Mechanical energy is used to spin the armature in the field so that the wire loops cut across the field and produce electric current. The EMF of this current is calculated by EMF = Blv. Consider the coil and magnetic field sketched above. When the right hand side of the coil moves up through the field, the left hand rule indicates that the electron flow will be from the front to the back in that side of the coil. The current generated will have the greatest EMF as the wire is cutting perpendicularly across the field. When the wire reaches the top of its arc, it is moving parallel to the field and therefore, not cutting across the field at all. The EMF at this point will be zero. As that same wire then cuts down through the field as it continues to spin, the left hand rule indicates that the electron flow will be from the back to the front in that side of the coil. In this second half of the arc, the direction of the electron flow has reversed. The magnitude of the EMF will reach maximum again as the wire cuts perpendicularly down through the field and the EMF will become zero again as the wire passes through the bottom of the arc. The current produced as the armature goes around will resemble a sine wave where the EMF reaches a maximum in one direction, then goes to zero, then goes to a maximum in the other direction. This type of current is called alternating current. By having more and more loops of wire on the armature, the crests and troughs overlap and fill in until a constant current is produced. A direct current is one that always flows in the same direction rather than alternating back and forth. Batteries produce direct currents. A generator can also produce direct current by using a split ring commutator that changes external connections every half turn of the armature so that even though the current in the coil changes direction, every time the current in the coil changes direction, the external connection switches so that the external current always goes in the same direction. Generators and motors are almost identical in construction but convert energy in opposite directions. Generators convert mechanical energy to electrical energy and motors convert electrical energy to mechanical. Because of the alternating direction in alternating current, the average value is less than the power supplied by a direct current. In fact, the average power of an AC current is one-half its maximum power and one-half the power of an equivalent DC current. The effective current of an AC generator is 0.707 times its maximum current. The same is true for the effective voltage of an AC generator. 
Veff = 0.707  Vmax 	  Example Problem: An AC generator develops a maximum voltage of 34.0 V and delivers a maximum current of a. What is the effective voltage of the generator? b. What is the effective current delivered by the generator? c. What is the resistance in the circuit? Solution: a. Veff = 0.707 Vmax = (0.707)(34.0 V ) = 24.0 V b. Ieff = 0.707 Imax = (0.707)(0.17 A) = 0.120 A c. R = V

What effective current flows through the bulb? • direct current: An electric current flowing in one direction only. • alternating current: An electric current that reverses direction in a circuit at regular intervals. • electric generator: An electric generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. • armature: The rotating part of a generator, consisting essentially of copper wire wound around an iron core. • State Lenz’s law. • Explain back EMF and explain how it affects motors and generators. This is a diagram of a hand-cranked demonstration generator. Turning the hand crank spins a coil inside horseshoe magnets and generates an electric current that lights the bulb. In order to generate an electric current in a conductor, the conductor must be part of a complete circuit. If the light bulb is removed from this apparatus, the crank is very easy to turn. If the light bulb is absent, the circuit is incomplete and no current is generated. When the light bulb is place in the circuit, the circuit is complete and turning the crank will generate a current and light the bulb. When the crank is turned with bulb in the circuit, it is more difficult to turn the crank. A great deal more effort is needed to turn the crank while current is generated. 
Lenz’s  Law 	  In the sketch below, moving the wire downward through the magnetic field causes electrons to flow in the wire as diagrammed. This is because relative motion between charged particles and magnetic fields produces a force on the charged particles . . . so the downward movement of the wire causes a force which moves the electrons, producing a current. When the electrons begin to flow, however, there is a second motion of the charged particles and this second motion will produce a second force on the particles. If we use the left hand rule on the electron flow, we point our fingers in the direction of the field and our thumb in the direction of electron movement and the palm of our hand indicates the direction of the force –UP ! This secondary force always opposes the first movement of the wire. Lenz’s law states the induced current produces a magnetic field that opposes the motion that caused the induced current. “An induced electromotive force generates a current that induces a counter magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field generating the current.” Lenz’s law also applies to electric motors. When an EMF is sent through a motor (aka, a current is passed through the armature of a motor) a force is produced that causes the armature to turn. This is electric energy converted to mechanical energy. The spin of the armature, however, now causes the motor to act like a generator and generate an EMF. The direction of the EMF is always the opposite of the original EMF that was sent through the motor. This second EMF is called back-EMF. 
Summary 	  • Lenz’s law states, “An induced electromotive force generates a current that induces a counter magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field generating the current.” • The spin of the armature, however, now causes the motor to act like a generator and generate an EMF. The direction of the EMF is always the opposite to the original EMF that was sent through the motor.

Questions 	  through? first? current? • Lenz’s law: An induced electromotive force generates a current that induces a counter magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field generating the current. • back-EMF: Back electromotive force is the voltage generated during the operation of a rotating machine (a generator or a motor). • Describe the function of a transformer. • Explain the relationship between turns and voltage ratio. • Solve mathematical problems involving transformers. Power loss in long transmission lines is related to the magnitude of the current. Specifically, the power loss can be decreased by decreasing the magnitude of the current. The amount of power passed through transmission lines can be calculated by multiplying voltage by current. The same power can be transmitted using a very high voltage and a very low current as with a low voltage and high current. Since power companies do not wish to waste power as it is transmitted to homes and businesses, they deliberately ’step up’ the voltage and reduce the current before transmitting the power over extended distances. That type of power transmits well without great loss of energy but it cannot be used in household appliances. It becomes necessary to convert it back (’step down’) to low voltage and high current for household use. That is the job of electrical transformers –those big gray barrels you see on power poles. 
Transformers 	  When we move a wire through a magnetic field, a force is exerted on the charges in the wire and a current is induced. Essentially the same thing happens if we hold the wire steady and move the magnetic field by moving the magnet. Yet a third way of causing relative motion between the charges in a wire and a magnetic field is to expand or contract the field through the wire. When a current begins to flow in a wire, a circular magnetic field forms around the wire. Within the first fractional second when the current begins to flow, the magnetic field expands outward from the wire. If a second wire is placed nearby, the expanding field will pass through the second wire and induce a brief current in the wire. Consider the sketch above. When the knife switch is closed, current begins to flow in the first circuit and therefore, a magnetic field expands outward around the wire. When the magnetic field expands outward from the wire on the right side, it will pass through the wire in the second circuit. This relative motion between wire and field induces a current in the second circuit. The magnetic field expands outward for only a very short period of time and therefore, only a short jolt of current is induced in the second circuit. You can leave the knife switch closed and the current will continue to flow in the first circuit but no current is induced in the second circuit because the field is constant and therefore there is no relative motion between the field and the wire in the second circuit. When the knife switch is opened, the current in the first circuit ceases to flow and the magnetic field collapses back through the wire to zero. As the magnetic field collapses, it passes through the wire and once again we have relative motion between the wire in the second circuit and the magnetic field. Therefore, we once again have a short jolt of current induced in the second circuit. This second jolt of induced current will be flowing in the opposite direction of the first induced current. We can produce an alternating current in the second circuit simply by closing and opening the knife switch continuously in the first circuit. Obviously, a transformer would have little use in the case of DC current because current is only induced in the second circuit when the first circuit is started or stopped. With AC current, however, since the current changes direction 60 times per second, the magnetic field would constantly be expanding and contracting through the second wire. A transformer is a device used to increase or decrease alternating current voltages. They do this with essentially no loss of energy. A transformer has two coils, electrically insulated from each other as shown in the sketch. One coil is called the primary coil and the other is called the secondary coil. When the primary coil is connected to a source of AC voltage, the changing current creates a varying magnetic field. The varying magnetic field induces a varying EMF in the secondary coil. The EMF induced in the secondary coil is called the secondary voltage and is proportional to the primary voltage. The secondary voltage also depends on the ratio of turns on the secondary coil to turns on the primary coil. secondary voltage primary voltage 
 	  = = number of turns on secondary number of turns on primary 
 	  If the secondary voltage is larger than the primary voltage, the transformer is called a step-up transformer. If the voltage out of the transformer is smaller than the voltage in, then the transformer is called a step-down transformer. In an ideal transformer, the electric power put into the primary equals the electric power delivered by the secondary. The current that flows in the primary depends on how much current is required by the secondary circuit.

 	  This photograph is of the world’s first observation of a neutrino in a hydrogen bubble chamber. The event was produced in a synchronized cyclotron on November 13, 1970. The invisible neutrino followed the dashed yellow line and struck a proton at the point from which the three particle tracks originate. The neutrino then turned into a muon, whose path is traced by the long blue line. The short red track, labeled “p,” follows the proton. The orange track marks the path of a pi-meson created by the collision. In this chapter, you will learn about the basic structure of the atomic nucleus. • Define atomic number. • Define mass number. • State the charge and mass of a nucleus. • Define isotopes. • Given the atomic and mass numbers of a nuclide, find the numbers of protons, electrons, and neutrons. The nuclei of atoms contain protons and neutrons while electron clouds surrounding the nuclei contain the electrons. The positively charged protons are very close together in an atomic nucleus and the repulsive force of the like charges is tremendous. The strong force is a type of interaction that binds together protons and neutrons. Without the strong force, the positively charged protons would blow the nucleus apart. 
Isotopes 	  Until 1932, the positively charged nucleus of an atom was known to exist, but it was believed to contain only protons. The nucleus was known to be surrounded by enough negatively charged electrons to make the atom electrically neutral. Most of the atom was empty space, with its mass concentrated in the tiny nucleus. Twelve years earlier, Lord Ernest Rutherford, a pioneer in atomic structure, had postulated the existence of a third, neutral, sub-atomic particle, with the approximate mass of a proton, that could result from the capture of an electron by a proton. This postulation stimulated a search for the particle. However, its electrical neutrality complicated the search because almost all experimental techniques of this period measured charged particles. James Chadwick bombarded hydrogen atoms in paraffin with beryllium emissions. By comparing the energies of recoiling charged particles from different targets, he proved that the beryllium emissions contained a neutral component with a mass approximately equal to that of the proton. He called it the neutron in a paper published in Since the identification of the neutron, the model of the atomic nucleus has changed very little. According to this model, a nucleus is considered to be an aggregate of protons and neutrons. A proton has a positive charge of 1.6× These two constituents of a nucleus are referred to collectively as nucleons. Although the hydrogen nucleus consists of a single proton, the nuclei of all other elements contain both neutrons and protons. The different types of nuclei are referred to as nuclides. The number of protons in a nucleus is called the atomic number and is designated by the symbol Z. The total number of nucleons, neutrons and protons, is designated by the symbol A and is called the mass number. A nuclide with 7 protons and 8 neutrons thus has Z = 7 and A = 15. The number of neutrons, N, is N = A−Z. To specify a given nuclide, we need give only A and Z. These can be shown in a complete nuclear symbol which takes the form 
 	  where X is the chemical symbol for the element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number. For example, a nitrogen nucleus containing 7 protons and 8 neutrons would be 15 nucleus, sometimes the 7 is omitted and the symbol is written simply as 15N. This same nuclide is also sometimes written as nitrogen-15. The identity of an atom is determined by the number of protons in the nucleus. All hydrogen atoms must have exactly 1 proton in the nucleus. The number of neutrons in the nuclei of atoms of a particular element, however, may vary. For example, a hydrogen atom will always have 1 proton, but may have zero, one, or two neutrons in the nucleus as long as it has 1 proton, it is a hydrogen atom. Nuclei that have the same number of protons in the nucleus but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes. Hydrogen has three isotopes. One isotope of hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons in the nucleus so it has a mass number of 1. Another isotope of hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 neutron in the nucleus so it has a mass number of 2. The third isotope of hydrogen has 1 proton and 2 neutrons in the nucleus so it has a mass number of 3. (The isotope of hydrogen with a mass number of 2 is sometimes called deuterium and the isotope of hydrogen with a mass number of 3 is sometimes called tritium, but they are all hydrogen.) Carbon has six isotopes; carbon-11, carbon-12, carbon-13, carbon-14, carbon-15, and carbon-16. The isotopes of a given element are not all equally abundant. For example, 98.9% of all naturally occurring carbon is carbon-12 and about 1.1% is carbon-13. The other isotopes of carbon are even less abundant. The periodic table is a complete listing of all the known elements. Each element has its own square in the periodic table. The square contains the chemical symbol for the element, the atomic number, and the atomic weight. The atomic weight of an element is a weighted average of its isotopes. Example Problem: The element boron consists of two isotopes, boron-10 and boron-11. The abundance of boron-10 is 20.0% and the abundance of boron-11 is 80.0%. What is the atomic weight of boron? Solution: Atomic weight = (0.20)(10.0 amu) + (0.80)(11.0 amu) = 2.0 + 8.8 = 10.8 amu

The machines in the image are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs). These are small nuclear reactors used for the generation of power. Primarily the nuclear energy is used to change water into steam and the steam then runs the machinery. Several hundred PWRs are used for propulsion in military vessels such as aircraft carriers, submarines, and ice breakers. These nuclear reactors were originally designed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for use as nuclear submarine power plants. 
Radioactivity 	  The total mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. This is known as mass defect. As an example of this, consider the mass of a 4 the masses of its constituent nucleons. 
The mass of a 4 	  (2)(1.007825 amu) = 4.032980 amu. Thus, the mass of the helium-4 nucleus is 0.030377 amu less than the masses of its constituents. The lost mass has gone into energy that is called binding energy. The binding energy is equal to the amount of energy that would have to be put into the helium-4 nucleus in order to break it into its constituent protons and neutrons. Without the binding energy, the repulsion between the protons would blow this nucleus apart. We often refer to the average binding energy per nucleon which is defined as the total binding energy of a nucleus divided by the number of nucleons in the nucleus. Each nucleus, therefore, has competing forces. The repulsive force between the protons tends to blow the nucleus apart and the binding energy tends to hold the nucleus together. If the average binding energy per nucleon overcomes the repulsion, the nucleus stays together and it referred to as stable. If the repulsion overcomes the average binding energy per nucleon, the nucleus may blow apart or undergo nuclear disintegration. When a nucleus disintegrates, it throws off pieces of itself and energy in the form of gamma rays. This disintegration process came to be called radioactivity. Early researchers in radioactivity found that the emissions from radioactivity could be classified into three distinct types according to their penetrating power. One type of radiation could barely penetrate a sheet of paper. The second type could pass through as much as 3 mm of aluminum. The third type was extremely penetrating and could pass through several centimeters of lead. They named these three types of radiation alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) respectively. Eventually, each type of radiation was further identified. Alpha particles are the nuclei of helium atoms, 4 x-rays). When a nucleus emits an α particle, the remaining particle will contain two less protons and two less neutrons. The new particle will have an atomic number two less and a mass number four less than the original nuclide. 
The daughter product, 222 	  changing of one element into another is called transmutation. Transmutation also occurs when a nucleus undergoes β decay. An example of beta decay is the emission of an electron by a carbon-14 nucleus. The symbol 0−1e represents an electron whose charge corresponds to Z = −1 and since it has no nucleons, A = 0. It must be carefully noted that the electron released during beta decay is NOT an orbital electron but an electron whose origin was in the nucleus. The process has one neutron becoming one proton and one electron and the electron being emitted as a beta particle. Since a neutron has been lost AND a proton has been gained, the mass number does not change. The atomic number, however, has increased one due to the gain of a proton. Therefore, as a result of beta decay, the daughter product will have the same mass number as the parent and an atomic number one greater than the parent.

This is known as mass defect. • The mass lost in mass defect has gone into energy that is called binding energy. • Each nucleus has competing forces.

Nuclear  Reactions 	  In all nuclear reactions, the total of the atomic numbers on the left side of the equation must equal the total of the atomic numbers on the right side of the equation. Furthermore, the sum of the mass numbers on the left of the equation must equal the sum of the mass numbers on the right of the equation. In addition to alpha and beta decay, there are a number of other types of nuclear reactions. Bombardment of nuclei with alpha particles or neutrons can often produce a nuclear reaction. Consider the bombardment of nitrogen-14 by an alpha particle, or the bombardment of uranium-235 by a neutron. Large unstable nuclei often become more stable by breaking into smaller pieces. The breakup of a larger nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei is called fission. Small nuclei often become more stable by joining together to form larger nuclei. This process is called fusion. Here is a reaction showing the fusion of a hydrogen-2 atom and a hydrogen-3 atom. The disintegration of unstable nuclei does not occur all at once. The rate of disintegration is a statistical process. The most convenient way to consider it is by a concept known as half-life. The time required for half of the atoms in any given quantity of a radioactive substance to decay is the half-life of that element. Each particular isotope has its own half-life. For example, the half-life of radium-226 is 1600 years. That is, beginning with 1.00 gram of radium-226, it would take 1600 years for half of it to decay and leave 0.50 gram remaining. After another 1600 years, only 0.25 gram would remain. In each half-life, exactly half of the beginning amount decays. 
Half-life 	  Example Problem: 4.00 grams of tritium (hydrogen-3) are produced in the lab. How much of it will remain after 
Solution: 24.6 years is two half-lives for hydrogen-3, so 1 	  gram.

The first suggestion of the existence of quarks was presented in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig. They suggested that protons and neutrons were composed of three quarks called up (u), down (d), and strange (s). A fourth quark was hypothesized just for reasons of symmetry and the name “charm” was suggested for the fourth quark by Sheldon Glashow and James Bkorken. The first evidence for quarks was produced by an experiment in the Stanford Linear Accelerator by James Bkorken and Richard Feynman in 1968. In 1974, Burton Richter and Samuel Ting, separately, announce on the same day that they discovered the same new particle. Ting and his collaborators at Brookhaven called this particle the “J” particle, whereas Richter and his collaborators at SLAC called this particle the psi particle. Since the discoveries are given equal weight, the particle is commonly known as the J/psi particle. The J/psi particle is a charm-anti-charm meson. After eighteen years of searching at many accelerators, experiments at Fermilab in 1995 discovered the top quark. 
Quarks 	  When the atomic theory was first suggested, the atoms were considered to be indivisible. Sometime later, it was determined that, in fact, atoms were not indivisible but had component parts, namely protons, neutrons, and electrons. At the time those particles were hypothesized, they were considered to be indivisible, having no smaller parts. In 1964, it was first suggested that protons and neutrons do have smaller component parts, namely quarks. The quark model was accepted very slowly because quarks had not been observed and weren’t all observed until

High energy family 	  Particles that are composed of three quarks are called baryons. The two best known baryons are protons and neutrons. A proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark (uud). The charge on the proton is the result of adding the charges on these quarks(cid:0)+ 2 quarks (udd). The charge on the neutron is the result of adding the charges on these quarks(cid:0)+ 2 Everyday objects are made up of quarks from the lowest energy family, namely up and down quarks. Quarks in the middle energy family are found in cosmic rays and are produced in particle accelerators. Particles in the high energy family are believed to have existed briefly during the earliest moments of the Big Bang and are created only in high energy collisions.

In nuclear naval vessels, the 	  nuclear reaction produces steam and the steam then runs the ship. 
Fission  Reactors 	  A nuclear reactor is a device in which a nuclear chain reaction is carried out at a controlled rate. When the controlled chain reaction is a fission reaction, the reactor is called a fission reactor. Fission reactors are used primarily for the production of electricity, although there are a few fission reactors used for military purposes and for research. The great majority of electrical generating systems all follow a reasonably simple design. The nuclear reaction boils water into steam, the steam is used to spin a turbine, and the turbine turns an electrical generator. After the water is turned into steam, the sequence in a fossil fuel generating plant and a nuclear generating plant are approximately the same. Of course, with the nuclear plant, the reaction chamber must be inside a containment building. 
Fissionable  Fuel 	  Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. Once the supply of U-235 is acquired, it is placed in a series of long cylindrical tubes called fuel rods. These fuel cylinders are bundled together with control rods (see diagram below) made of neutron-absorbing material. The amount of heat generated by the chain reaction is controlled by the rate at which the nuclear reaction occurs. The rate of the nuclear reaction is dependent on how many neutrons are emitted by one U-235 nuclear disintegration and how many strike a new U-235 nucleus to cause another disintegration. The purpose of the control rods is to absorb some of the neutrons and thus stop them from causing further disintegrations. The control rods can be raised or lowered into the fuel rod bundle. When the control rods are lowered all the way into the fuel rod bundle, they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction essentially stops. When more heat is desired, the control rods are raised so that the chain reaction speeds up and more heat is generated. The control rods are operated in a fail-safe system so that power is necessary to hold them up. During a power failure, gravity will pull the control rods down to shut off the system. U-235 nuclei can capture neutrons and disintegrate more efficiently if the neutrons are moving slower than the speed at which they are released. Fission reactors use a moderator surrounding the fuel rods to slow down the neutrons. Water is not only a good coolant but also a good moderator, so a common type of fission reactor has the fuel core submerged in a huge pool of water. This type of reactor is called a light water reactor or LWR. All public electricity generating fission reactors in the United States are LWRs. You can follow the operation of an electricity-generating fission reactor in the image above. The reactor core is submerged in a pool of water. The heat from the fission reaction heats the water, which is pumped into a heat exchange container. There the heated water boils the water in the heat exchanger. The produced steam is forced through a turbine that spins a generator and produces electricity. After the water passes through the turbine, it is condensed back to liquid water and pumped back to the heat exchanger. 
Breeder  Reactors 	  U-235 is the only naturally occurring fissile isotope, and it constitutes less than 1% of naturally occurring uranium. A fissile substance is a substance capable of sustaining a chain reaction of nuclear fission. It has been projected that the world’s supply of U-235 will be exhausted in less than 200 years. It is possible, however, to convert U-238 to a fissionable isotope that will function as a fuel for nuclear reactors. The fissionable isotope is plutonium-239 and is produced by the following series of reactions: The final product from this series of reactions is plutonium-239, which has a half-life of 24,000 years and is another nuclear reactor fuel. This series of reactions can be made to occur inside an operating nuclear reactor by replacing some of the control rods with rods of U-238. As the nuclear decay process proceeds inside the reactor, it produces more fuel than it uses. It would take about 20 such breeder reactors to produce enough fuel to operate one additional reactor. The use of breeder reactors would extend the fuel supply a hundred fold. The problem with breeder reactors, however, is that plutonium is an extremely deadly poison. Furthermore, unlike ordinary fission reactors, it is possible for out-of-control breeder reactors to explode. None of the civilian nuclear power plants in the U.S. are breeder reactors. 
Summary 	  • A nuclear reactor is a device in which a nuclear chain reaction is carried out at a controlled rate. • The nuclear reaction boils water into steam, the steam is used to spin a turbine, and the turbine turns an electrical generator. • It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. • Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium and can be used as fuel in a fission reactor. • Once the supply of U-235 is acquired, it is placed in a series of long cylindrical tubes called fuel rods. • These fuel cylinders are bundled together with control rods made of neutron-absorbing material. • The purpose of the control rods is to absorb some of the neutrons and thus stop them from causing further disintegrations. • The control rods can be raised or lowered into the fuel rod bundle. When the control rods are lowered all the way into the fuel rod bundle, they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction essentially stops. • When more heat is desired, the control rods are raised so that the chain reaction speeds up and more heat is generated. • The control rods are operated in a fail-safe system so that power is necessary to hold them up. During a power failure, gravity will pull the control rods down to shut off the system. • It is possible, however, to convert U-238 to a fissionable isotope that will function as a fuel for nuclear reactors. This process is carried out in reactors called breeder reactors. • None of the civilian nuclear power plants in the U.S. are breeder reactors.

Light water reactors are the most common type of nuclear reactor. • PWR: Pressurized water reactors (PWRs) constitute the large majority of all Western nuclear power plants. A PWR is one of three types of LWRs. In a PWR, the primary coolant (water) is pumped under high pressure to the reactor core where it is heated by the energy generated by the fission of atoms. The heated water then flows to a steam generator where it transfers its thermal energy to a secondary system where steam is generated and flows to turbines which, in turn, spin an electric generator. Atoms of the same element always have the same number of protons in their nuclei, but they may have differing numbers of electrons or neutrons. Radioactivity is the result of nuclear decay and the emission of subatomic particles. Quarks are the smallest particles known to date; they are the building blocks of the primary subatomic particles. Nuclear reactors can release vast quantities of energy by harnessing the interactions of atomic nuclei. ns.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Neutrino_bubble_chamber_decay_overlay.png . harbor,_Greece.jpg . 
The  Atom 	  Illustrated above is a spectrum tube containing helium. The light stripes to the right are the individual frequencies of light emitted by helium atoms. The color of the tube is the result of the eye mixing all the individual frequencies together. When electric current is passed through a tube filled with the gaseous atoms of an individual element, light is emitted. In the illustration above, the pinkish-colored tube on the left is a tube filled with gaseous helium, which has electric current passing through. When the light from this tube is passed through a prism, the light is separated into the individual frequencies that compose it. The spectrum of light from helium atoms contains around 9 separate frequencies. All helium samples emit exactly the same frequencies when excited. The frequencies emitted by the various elements are so specific that the spectra can be used to identify the element involved. It was these emissions of specific frequencies from atoms that led to the Bohr model of the atom and its successor, the quantum mechanical model. This chapter will investigate the historical development of the model of the atom. • Describe the nuclear model of the atom. • Describe the relationship between atomic emission spectra and electron configuration. • Calculate energy levels. • Describe the shortcomings of the Bohr model of the atom. The gold foil experiment was conducted under the supervision of Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester in 1909 by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. The popular theory of atomic structure at the time of Rutherford’s experiment was the “plum pudding model.” This theory held that the negatively charged electrons in an atom were floating in a sea of positive charge (the electrons playing the role of plums in a bowl of plum pudding). Rutherford’s gold foil experiment demonstrated that almost all of the mass of an atom is in a tiny volume in the center of the atom which Rutherford called the nucleus. This positively charged mass was responsible for deflecting alpha particles propelled through the gold foil. Rutherford’s “nuclear model” of the atom replaced the plum pudding model in 
Early  History of the  Atom 	  Hypotheses concerning the existence of atoms as indivisible particles were known as early as the ancient Greek philosophers Democritus and Epicurus. The concepts of atoms that prevailed in the 17th and 18th centuries were poorly defined. Some scientists supposed that atoms could combine into more complex particles but specific chemical and physical properties were not attributed to atoms. In the period 1780-1803, Lavoisier made careful quantitative measurements which allowed the compositions of compounds to be determined accurately, Proust established the Law of Definite Proportions (each compound always contained the same proportions of elements), and John Dalton had developed the Law of Simple Proportions (compounds composed of the same elements contained simple multiples of component elements). These laws provided a solid foundation for a more thorough atomic theory. 
Dalton’s  Atomic  Theory 	  John Dalton developed his atomic theory in 1803. Dalton’s theory was different from previous discussions of atoms because it had the weight of careful chemical measurements behind it. Dalton’s theory went beyond just a philosophical statement that there are atoms. Dalton’s theory proposed a number of basic ideas: 1) All matter is composed of indivisible, tiny particles called atoms, 2) atoms can neither be created nor destroyed, 3) all atoms of the same element are identical (have the same mass), 4) elements differ from one another because they have different types of atoms (different mass), 5) compounds are composed of combinations of different elements because the atoms of different elements are bonded to one another, and 6) chemical reactions occur when atoms in compounds are rearranged. Dalton’s theory did not convince everyone immediately. It did convince a number of chemists right away but several decades were required for all opposition to cease. Dalton’s theory underwent a number of modifications in the next that there were groups of elements which had the same (or very similar) chemical properties, the same valence, and similar physical properties and showed that the chemical and physical properties of the elements were periodically repeated. His periodic table remains a major idea in chemistry today. 
Discovery of  Electrons and  Radioactivity 	  During the investigation of the flow of electric current through gases, scientists discovered rays that were emitted from a cathode discharge tube and had the property of being deflected in electric and magnetic fields. 
It was 	  determined that these rays consisted of rapidly moving, negatively charged particles called electrons. It was also determined that upon heating or illumination by light, metals emitted electrons. Logically, neutral atoms containing electrons must also contain positively charged particles. Thus, the indivisibility of the atom was disproved. This was further emphasized by Marie Curie’s discoveries that through alpha and beta decay, atoms of one element could transmute into other elements. Curie’s discoveries also determined that atoms of the same element may have different masses (isotopes) and thus the idea that all the atoms of the same element are identical was also lost. 
Rutherford’s  Planetary  Model of the  Atom 	  Now that it was known that the atom had component parts, a new model was needed. In the model proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1903, the atom was represented as a positively charged sphere with the negatively charged electrons distributed around the exterior. This was the so-called “plum-pudding” model with the positive charge playing the role of the pudding and the electrons playing the role of the plums. The next big step in the development of the model of the atom occurred in 1911 with Rutherford’s gold foil experiment. In the Thomson model of the atom, the density of the atom was necessarily small. The mass of the atom divided by the volume of the atom and assuming an even distribution of mass resulted in a low density for the atom. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium compounds emitted penetrating rays, some of which were massive, high speed, positively charged particles which were later named alpha particles (α). These alpha particles would be detected by a zinc sulfide coated screen (scintillation counter) that emitted a small flash of light every time an alpha particle hit it. Rutherford used these alpha particles and the zinc sulfide coated screen in his gold foil experiment. The alpha particles were fired at a very thin sheet of gold foil. It was thought that all of the alpha particles would pass straight through the gold foil with no deflection. This was because the alpha particles were known to be very dense and, due to the “plum pudding” model of the atom where the mass of the atom was spread out evenly over the volume of the atom, the atoms of gold were thought to have very low density. While the great majority of the alpha particles did pass straight through the foil with no deflection, to everyone’s surprise, some alpha particles were deflected. In fact, some alpha were bounced almost straight backward by the foil. Rutherford, using Coulomb’s law and Newton’s laws found that the results could be explained only if all the positive charge of the atom were concentrated in a tiny, central core, now called the nucleus. Rutherford’s model of the atom is therefore, called the nuclear model of the atom. All of the positive charge and essentially all of the mass of the atom are in its nucleus. The atom is 10,000 times as large as the nucleus and is mostly empty space. It was known that electrons are outside the nucleus but how the electrons were arranged in an atom was still a mystery. 
Problems with the  Planetary  Model 	  The planetary model had two major problems immediately. According to classical mechanics, a charged particle being accelerated (speeding up, slowing down, or turning a corner) would always emit electromagnetic radiation. That means that an orbiting electron would constantly emit energy and thus move closer to the nucleus until eventually it would collapse into the nucleus. Clearly this doesn’t happen and thus it opposes the idea that electrons move like planets. The second problem was that atoms gain energy (in the form of heat or light) and re-emit the energy in an exact set of light frequencies. The magnitude of the energy involved in this light emission is too small to be involved with nuclear changes and therefore, the electron configuration must be responsible for the light emission by atoms. The planetary model offered no explanation for the light spectrum of atoms. A major clue to the electron arrangement in an atom came from studying the light emitted by atoms. When electricity is passed through gaseous atoms, the atoms emit a spectrum of light that is specific for that element. The hydrogen atom, for example, emits a pinkish light but when that light is passed through a prism, we see a very few frequencies of light that are quite specific for hydrogen. The energies of these light frequencies is much too small to be involved in the nucleus of atoms, therefore, any explanation of these wavelengths would have to involve the electron arrangement in atoms. 
The  Bohr  Model of the  Atom 	  Niels Bohr attempted to join the nuclear model of the atom with Einstein’s quantum theory of light and with his own idea of electron energy levels to explain the electron arrangement within the atom. Bohr started with the planetary model of electron arrangement but postulated that electrons in stable orbits would not radiate energy even though the electrons were being accelerated by traveling in circular paths. Bohr hypothesized that the electrons were organized into stepwise energy levels within the electron cloud and only radiated energy when the electrons moved from one energy level to another. Bohr’s hypothesis suggested that the energy of atomic electrons came in packages and only whole packages could be absorbed or emitted. This quantization of energy allowed electrons to only absorb or emit exact amounts of energy to move from one energy level to another. The quantization of energy is not apparent in everyday experience. If we could observe molecular sized automobiles traveling down miniature roads, we would see cars traveling at 7 miles per hour, or 14 miles per hour, or 21 miles per hour, but never at 9 or 17 miles per hour. The quantization of energy means that energy comes in packages and when energy is added to an object, whole packets of energy must be added. This is the explanation for why atomic electrons are only allowed to have certain amounts of energy and therefore, occupy certain energy levels. The lowest energy level for an electron is near the nucleus and each quanta of energy added moves the electron to the next distant energy level. Einstein’s theory says that each light photon has an energy of h f , where h is Planck’s constant, and f is the frequency. The emission of a photon of light from an atom indicates a change in energy level for an electron such that h f = Ehigher − Elower. The energy of an orbit is related to the inverse of the square of the orbit number. The energy of an electron in a given energy level of hydrogen is calculated by 
En = (−2.17× 10−18  J)(cid:0) 1 	  (cid:1). n2 The radius of an orbit is related to the square of the orbit number. Bohr calculated allowed electron energy levels for the hydrogen atom and found the emission spectrum of hydrogen to match perfectly with particular electron transitions between his suggested energy levels. Other electron transitions predicted electromagnetic frequencies outside the visible range and when those were looked for, they were present and also matched precisely with theoretical calculations. 
Example  Problem:  For the hydrogen atom, determine 	  a. the energy of the innermost energy level (n = 1). b. the energy of the second energy level. c. the difference between the first and second energy levels. Solution: a. En = (−2.17× 10−18 J)(cid:0) 1 b. En = (−2.17× 10−18 J)(cid:0) 1 n2 (cid:1) (cid:1) n2 
E2 = (−2.17× 10−18  J)(cid:0) 1 	  (cid:1) = −2.17× 10−18 J (cid:1) = −5.43× 10−19 J c. E2−1 = (−5.43× 10−19 J)− (−2.17× 10−18 J) = 1.63× 10−18 J This is the amount of energy that would need to be added to a 1st energy level electron to raise it to the second energy level. Example Problem: According to the Bohr model, how many times larger is the second level hydrogen orbit compared to the first level hydrogen orbit?

Erwin Schrödinger (1887 – 1961) was an Austrian physicist who achieved fame for his contributions to quantum mechanics, especially the Schrödinger equation, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1933. His development of what is known as Schrödinger’s wave equation was made during the first half of 1926. It came as a result of his dissatisfaction with the quantum condition in Bohr’s orbit theory and his belief that atomic spectra should really be determined by some kind of discrete energy value. 
The  Quantum  Mechanical  Model of the  Atom 	  Most definitions of quantum theory and quantum mechanics offer the same description for both. These definitions essentially describe quantum theory as a theory in which both energy and matter have characteristics of waves under some conditions and characteristics of particles under other conditions. Quantum theory suggests that energy comes in discrete packages called quanta (or, in the case of electromagnetic radiation, photons). Quantum theory has some mathematical development, often referred to as quantum mechanics, that offers explanations for the behavior of electrons inside the electron clouds of atoms. The wave-particle duality of electrons within the electron cloud limits our ability to measure both the energy and the position of an electron simultaneously. The more accurately we measure either the energy or the position of an electron, the less we know about the other. Our fact that we cannot accurately know both the position and the momentum of an electron at the same time causes an inability to predict a trajectory for an electron. Consequently, electron behavior is described differently than the behavior of normal sized particles. The trajectory that we normally associate with macroscopic objects is replaced for electrons in electron clouds, with statistical descriptions that show, not the electron path, but the region where it is most likely to be found. Since it is the electron in the electron cloud of an atom that determines its chemical behavior, the quantum mechanics description of electron configuration is necessary to understanding chemistry. The most common way to describe electrons in atoms according to quantum mechanics is to solve the Schrodinger equation for the energy states of the electrons within the electron cloud. When the electron is in these states, its energy is well-defined but its position is not. The position is described by a probability distribution map called an orbital. Schrodinger’s equation is shown below. ψ(r,t) = − ¯h ∇2ψ(r,t) +V (r,t)ψ(r,t) i ¯h ∂ ∂t √−1 ∂x2 + ∂2 ∂y2 + ∂2 ∂z2 (these refer to partial second derivatives) where i is the imaginary number, ¯h is Planck’s constant divided by 2π ψ (r,t) is the wave function m is the mass of the particle ∇2 is the Laplacian operator, ∂2 
V (r,t) is the potential energy influencing the particle 	  It should be quite clear that without years of high level mathematics, just seeing the equation is no value at all. Without understanding the math, the equation makes no sense. The stable energy levels for an electron in an electron cloud are those that have integer values in three positions in the equation. Schrodinger found that having integer values in these three places in the equation produced a wave function that described a standing wave. These three integers are called quantum numbers and are represented by the letters n, l, and m. Solutions to Schrödinger’s equation involve four special numbers called quantum numbers. (Three of the numbers, n, l, and m, come from Schrödinger’s equation, and the fourth one comes from an extension of the theory). These four numbers completely describe the energy of an electron. Each electron has exactly four quantum numbers, and no two electrons have the same four numbers. The statement that no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers is known as the Pauli exclusion principle. The principal quantum number, n, is a positive integer (1,2,3, . . .n) that indicates the main energy level of an electron within an atom. According to quantum mechanics, every principal energy level has one or more sub-levels within it. The number of sub-levels in a given energy level is equal to the number assigned to that energy level. That is, principal energy level 1 will have 1 sub-level, principal energy level 2 will have two sub-levels, principal energy level 3 will have three sub-levels, and so on. In any energy level, the maximum number of electrons possible is 2n2. Therefore, the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the first energy level is 2(2× 12). For energy level 2, the maximum number of electrons is 8(2× 22), and for the 3rd energy level, the maximum number of electrons is TABLE 23.1: Number of Sub-Levels and Electrons by Principal Quantum Number 
Total  Number of  Electrons 	  TABLE 23.1: (continued) The largest known atom contains slightly more than 100 electrons. Quantum mechanics sets no limit as to how many energy levels exist, but no more than 7 principal energy levels are needed to describe all the electrons of all the known atoms. Each energy level can have as many sub-levels as the principal quantum number, as discussed above, and each sub-level is identified by a letter. Beginning with the lowest energy sub-level, the sub-levels are identified by the letters s, p, d, f , g, h, i, and so on. Every energy level will have an s sub-level, but only energy levels 2 and above will have p sub-levels. Similarly, d sub-levels occur in energy level 3 and above, and f sub-levels occur in energy level 4 and above. Energy level 5 could have a fifth sub-energy level named g, but all the known atoms can have their electrons described without ever using the g sub-level. Therefore, we often say there are only four sub-energy levels, although theoretically there can be more than four sub-levels. The principal energy levels and sub-levels are shown in the following diagram. The principal energy levels and sub-levels that we use to describe electrons are in red. The energy levels and sub-levels in black are theoretically present but are never used for known atoms. The sub-energy levels are identified by the azimuthal quantum number, l. When the azimuthal quantum number l = 0, the sub-level = s. When the azimuthal quantum number l = 1, the sub-level = p. When the azimuthal quantum number l = 2, the sub-level = d. When the azimuthal quantum number l = 3, the sub-level = f . Quantum mechanics also tells us how many orbitals are in each sub-level. In Bohr’s model, an orbit was a circular path that the electron followed around the nucleus. In quantum mechanics, an orbital is defined as an area in the electron cloud where the probability of finding the electron is high. The number of orbitals in an energy level is equal to the square of the principal quantum number. Hence, energy level 1 will have 1 orbital (12), energy level 2 will have 4 orbitals (22), energy level 3 will have 9 orbitals (32), and energy level 4 will have 16 orbitals (42). The s sub-level has only one orbital. Each of the p sub-levels has three orbitals. The d sub-levels have five orbitals, and the f sub-levels have seven orbitals. If we wished to assign the number of orbitals to the unused sub-levels, g would have nine orbitals and h would have eleven. You might note that the number of orbitals in the sub-levels increases by odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9,11, . . .). As a result, the single orbital in energy level 1 is the s orbital. The four orbitals in energy level 2 are a single 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. The nine orbitals in energy level 3 are a single 3s orbital, three 3p orbitals, and five 3d orbitals. The sixteen orbitals in energy level 4 are the single 4s orbital, three 4p orbitals, five 4d orbitals, and seven 4 f orbitals. TABLE 23.2:

Maximum  Number of 	  Electrons (2n2) The Table 23.2 shows the relationship between n (the principal quantum number), the number of orbitals, and the maximum number of electrons in a principal energy level. Theoretically, the number of orbitals and number of electrons continue to increase for higher values of n. However, no atom actually has more than 32 electrons in any of its principal levels. Each orbital will also have a probability pattern that is determined by interpreting Schrödinger’s equation. The 3dimensional probability pattern for the single orbital in the s sub-level is a sphere. The probability patterns for the three orbitals in the p sub-levels are shown below. The three images on the left show the probability pattern for the three p orbitals in each of the three dimensions. On the far right is an image of all three p orbitals together. These p orbitals are said to be shaped like dumbbells (named after the objects weight lifters use), water wings (named after the floating balloons young children use in the swimming pool), and various other objects. The probability patterns for the five d orbitals are more complicated and are shown below. The seven f orbitals shown below are even more complicated. You should keep in mind that no matter how complicated the probability pattern is, each shape represents a single orbital, and the entire probability pattern is the result of the various positions that either one or two electrons can take.

Air Force scientist operates a laser in a test environment. The United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) conducts research on a variety of solid-state and chemical lasers. Most types of laser are an inherently pure source of light; they emit near-monochromatic light with a very well defined range of wavelengths. By careful design of the laser components, the purity of the laser light can be improved more than the purity of any other light source. Lasers are used in spectroscopy, range finding, photochemistry, and microscopy. Military uses for lasers may include target designation, communications, and directed energy weapons. 
Laser 	  Light is emitted by atoms that have been excited by thermal excitation, electron collision, or collisions with photons of exactly the right frequency. Light is emitted by an incandescent source at many different wavelengths and in all directions. Light produced by an atomic gas consists of only a few different wavelengths but still in all directions. Both of these light sources produce light waves that are not in step or at the same point in their cycle. Groups of light waves that are not at the same point in their cycle are called incoherent light. Einstein considered what would happen to an atom already in an excited state that is struck by another photon of the same energy as the original photon that put the atom in the excited state. He showed that the atom will emit a photon of the same energy and go to a lower state. This process is called stimulated emission. The two photons leaving the atom will not only have the same wavelength, they will also be in step (at the same point in their cycle). Either of the two photons can now strike other excited atoms and produce additional photons that are also in step. This group of light rays are called coherent light. A device that produces such light was invented in 1959 and is called a laser. The word laser is an acronym. It stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. A continuous electric discharge like that in a neon sign can be used to put atoms in the excited state. The laser light resulting from this process is continuous rather than pulsed. The helium-neon lasers often seen in science classrooms and used as laser pointers are continuous lasers. The photons emitted by the atoms are collected by placing the glass tube containing the atoms between two parallel mirrors. One mirror reflects all the light striking it while the other mirror allows some small percentage of the light to pass through. The light which passes out of the tube produces the laser beam. Laser light is highly directional because of the parallel mirrors. The laser beam is very small, typically around 1 in diameter. The light is monochromatic, coherent, and very intense. The concentrated power of laser light is used in a variety of ways. In medicine, lasers can be used to repair the retina in an eye. Lasers can also be used in surgery in place of a knife to cut flesh with little loss of blood (the laser cauterizes as it cuts). In industry, lasers are used to cut steel and to weld materials together. Lasers may, in the future, be used to start nuclear fusion reactions.

 	  One of the most recognized constellations is Orion, with its three prominent belt stars and four stars in the trapezium. This constellation can be seen at night ascending in the east, visible from all parts of the globe. In November of 2012, an international team of astrophysicists announced the result of their work in computer modeling, which suggests that a famous nebula –or cloud –in Orion known as the Orion Nebula has a black hole at its heart, whose mass is some 200 times the mass of our sun. • Identify major occurrences in the history of astrophysics and identify the individuals who make the contribution. This is a classic spiral galaxy known as the Whirlpool Galaxy. It is found in the Canes Venatici constellation. This constellation represents the hunting dogs, Asterion and Chara. 
Astronomy and the  Ancient  Greeks 	  The Astronomy of the ancient Greeks was linked to mathematics, and Greek astronomers sought to create geometrical models that could imitate the appearance of celestial motions. This tradition originated around the 6th century BCE, with the followers of the mathematician Pythagoras (~580 –500 BCE). Pythagoras believed that everything was related to mathematics and that through mathematics everything could be predicted and measured in rhythmic patterns or cycles. He placed astronomy as one of the four mathematical arts, the others being arithmetic, geometry and music. While best known for the Pythagorean Theorem, Pythagoras did have some input into astronomy. By the time of Pythagoras, the five planets visible to the naked eye Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn had long been identified. The names of these planets were initially derived from Greek mythology before being given the equivalent Roman mythological names, which are the ones we still use today. The word ’planet’ is a Greek term meaning ’wanderer’, as these bodies move across the sky at different speeds from the stars, which appear fixed in the same positions relative to each other. For part of the year Venus appears in the eastern sky as an early morning object before disappearing and reappearing a few weeks later in the evening western sky. Early Greek astronomers thought this was two different bodies and assigned the names ’Phosphorus’ and ’Hesperus’ to the morning and evening apparitions respectively. Pythagoras is given credit for being the first to realize that these two bodies were in fact the same planet, a notion he arrived at through observation and geometrical calculations. Pythagoras was also one of the first to think that the Earth was round, a theory that was finally proved around 330 BCE by Aristotle. (Although, as you are probably aware, many people in 1642 CE still believed the earth to be flat.) Aristotle (384 BCE –322 BCE) demonstrates in his writings that he knew we see the moon by the light of the sun, how the phases of the moon occur, and understood how eclipses work. He also knew that the earth was a sphere. Philosophically, he argued that each part of the earth is trying to be pulled to the center of the earth, and so the earth would naturally take on a spherical shape. He then pointed out observations that support the idea of a spherical earth. First, the shadow of the earth on the moon during a lunar eclipse is always circular. The only shape that always casts a circular shadow is a sphere. Second, as one traveles more north or south, the positions of the stars in the sky change. There are constellations visible in the north that one cannot see in the south and vice versa. He related this to the curvature of the earth. Aristotle talked about the work of earlier Greeks, who had developed an earth centered model of the planets. In these models, the center of the earth is the center of all the other motions. While it is not sure if the earlier Greeks actually thought the planets moved in circles, it is clear that Aristotle did. Aristotle rejected a moving earth for two reasons. Most importantly he didn’t understand inertia. To Aristotle, the natural state for an object was to be at rest. He believed that it takes a force in order for an object to move. Using Aristotle’s ideas, if the earth were moving through space, if you tripped, you would not be in contact with the earth, and so would get left behind in space. Since this obviously does not happen, the earth must not move. This misunderstanding of inertia confused scientists until the time of Galileo. A second, but not as important, reason Aristotle rejected a moving earth is that he recognized that if the earth moved and rotated around the sun, there would be an observable parallax of the stars. One cannot see stellar parallax with the naked-eye, so Aristotle concluded that the earth must be at rest. (The stars are so far away, that one needs a good telescope to measure stellar parallax, which was first measured in 1838.) Aristotle believed that the objects in the heavens are perfect and unchanging. Since he believed that the only eternal motion is circular with a constant speed, the motions of the planets must be circular. This came to be called “The Principal of Uniform Circular Motion.” Aristotle and his ideas became very important because they became incorporated into the Catholic Church’s theology in the twelfth century by Thomas Aquinas. In the early Claudius Ptolemy (90 –168 CE) was a citizen of Egypt which was under Roman rule during Ptolemy’s lifetime. During his lifetime he was a mathematician, astronomer, and geographer. His theories dominated the world’s understanding of astronomy for over a thousand years. While it is known that many astronomers published works during this time, only Ptolemy’s work The Almagest survived. In it, he outlined his geometrical reasoning for a geocentric view of the Universe. As outlined in the Almagest, the Universe according to Ptolemy was based on five main points: 1) the celestial realm is spherical, 2) the celestial realm moves in a circle, 3) the earth is a sphere, 4) the celestial realm orbit is a circle centered on the earth, and 5) earth does not move. Ptolemy also identified eight circular orbits surrounding earth where the other planets existed. In order, they were the moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the sphere of fixed stars. A serious problem with the earth-centered system was the fact that at certain times in their orbits, some of the planets appeared to move in the opposite direction of their normal movement. This reverse direction movement is referred to as “ retrograde motion.” If the earth was to remain motionless at the center of the system, some very intricate designs were necessary to explain the movement of the retrograde planets. In the Ptolemaic system, each retrograde planet moved by two spheres. The Ptolemaic system had circles within circles that produced epicycles. In the sketch above on the left, the red ball moved clockwise in its little circle while the entire orbit also orbited clockwise around the big circle. This process produced a path like that shown in the sketch above on the right. As the red ball moved around its path, at some times it would be moving clockwise and then for a short period, it would move counterclockwise. This motion was able to explain the retrograde motion noted for some planets. 
Astronomy and the  Late  Middle  Ages 	  It was not until 1543, when Copernicus (1473 –1543) introduced a sun-centered design ( heliocentric), that Ptolemy’s astronomy was seriously questioned and eventually overthrown. Copernicus studied at the University of Bologna, where he lived in the same house as the principal astronomer there. Copernicus assisted the astronomer in some of his observations and in the production of the annual astrological forecasts for the city. It is at Bologna that he probably first encountered a translation of Ptolemy’s Almagest that would later make it possible for Copernicus to successfully refute the ancient astronomer. Later, at the University of Padua, Copernicus studied medicine, which was closely associated with astrology at that time due to the belief that the stars influenced the dispositions of the body. Returning to Poland, Copernicus secured a teaching post at Wroclaw, where he primarily worked as a medical doctor and manager of Church affairs. In his spare time, he studied the stars and the planets (decades before the telescope was invented), and applied his mathematical understanding to the mysteries of the night sky. In so doing, he developed his theory of a system in which the Earth, like all the planets, revolved around the sun, and which simply and elegantly explained the curious retrograde movements of the planets. Copernicus wrote his theory in De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (“On the Revolutions of the Celestial Orbs”). The book was completed in 1530 or so, but it wasn’t published until the year he died, 1543. It has been suggested that Copernicus knew the publication would incur the wrath of the Catholic church and he didn’t want to deal with problems so he didn’t publish his theory until he was on his death bed. Legend has it that a copy of the printer’s proof was placed in his hands as he lay in a coma, and he woke long enough to recognize what he was holding before he died. Tycho Brahe (1546 –1601) was born in a part of southern Sweden that was part of Denmark at the time. While attending the university to study law and philosophy, he became interested in astronomy and spent most evenings observing the stars. One of Tycho Brahe’s first contributions to astronomy was the detection and correction of several serious errors in the standard astronomical tables. Then, in 1572, he discovered a supernova located in the constellation of Cassiopeia. Tycho built his own instruments and made the most complete and accurate observations available without the use of a telescope. Eventually, his fame led to an offer from King Frederick II of Denmark & Norway to fund the construction of an astronomical observatory. The island of Van was chosen and in 1576, construction began. Tycho Brahe spent twenty years there, making observations on celestial bodies. During his life, Tycho Brahe did not accept Copernicus’ model of the universe. He attempted to combine it with the Ptolemaic model. As a theoretician, Tycho was a failure but his observations and the data he collected was far superior to any others made prior to the invention of the telescope. After Tycho Brahe’s death, his assistant, Johannes Kepler used Tycho Brahe’s observations to calculate his own three laws of planetary motion. In 1600, Johannes Kepler (1571 –1630) began working as Tycho’s assistant. They recognized that neither the Ptolemaic (geocentric) or Copernican (heliocentric) models could predict positions of Mars as accurately as they could measure them. Tycho died in 1601 and after that Kepler had full access to Tycho’s data. He analyzed the data for 8 years and tried to calculate an orbit that would fit the data, but was unable to do so. Kepler later determined that the orbits were not circular but elliptical. 
Kepler’s  Laws of  Planetary  Motion 	  (Therefore, the earth’s orbital speed varies at different times of the year. The earth moves fastest in its orbit when closest to the sun and slowest when farthest away.) Kepler’s Second Law of Planetary Motion was calculated for Earth, then the hypothesis was tested using data for Mars, and it worked! 
R ( 1 	  units (that is, distance in multiples of earth’s orbital radium and time in multiples of earth years). Kepler’s three laws replaced the cumbersome epicycles to explain planetary motion with three mathematical laws that allowed the positions of the planets to be predicted with accuracies ten times better than Ptolemaic or Copernican models. 
Galileo and  Newton 	  Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy, both because of his contributions directly to astronomy, and because of his work in physics. He provided the crucial observations that proved the Copernican hypothesis, and also laid the foundations for a correct understanding of how objects moved on the surface of the earth and of gravity. One could, with considerable justification, view Galileo as the father both of modern astronomy and of modern physics. Galileo did not invent the telescope, but he was the first to turn his telescope toward the sky to study the heavens systematically. His telescope was poorer than even a cheap modern amateur telescope, but what he observed in the heavens showed errors in Aristotle’s opinion of the universe and the worldview that it supported. Observations through Galileo’s telescope made it clear that the “earth-centered” and “earth doesn’t move” solar system of Aristotle was incorrect. Since church officials had made some of Aristotle’s opinions a part of the religious views of the church, proving Aristotle’s views to be incorrect also pointed out flaws in the church. Galileo observed four points of light that changed their positions around the planet Jupiter and he concluded that these were moons in orbit around Jupiter. These observations showed that there were new things in the heavens that Aristotle and Ptolemy had known nothing about. Furthermore, they demonstrated that a planet could have moons circling it that would not be left behind as the planet moved around its orbit. One of the arguments against the Copernican system had been that if the moon were in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, the Earth would leave the Moon behind as it moved around its orbit. Galileo used his telescope to show that Venus, like the moon, went through a complete set of phases. This observation was extremely important because it was the first observation that was consistent with the Copernican system but not the Ptolemaic system. In the Ptolemaic system, Venus should always be in crescent phase as viewed from the Earth because the sun is beyond Venus, but in the Copernican system Venus should exhibit a complete set of phases over time as viewed from the Earth because it is illuminated from the center of its orbit. It is important to note that this was the first empirical evidence (coming almost a century after Copernicus) that allowed a definitive test of the two models. Until that point, both the Ptolemaic and Copernican models described the available data. The primary attraction of the Copernican system was that it described the data in a simpler fashion, but here finally was conclusive evidence that not only was the Ptolemaic universe more complicated, it also was incorrect. As each new observation was brought to light, increasing doubt was cast on the old views of the heavens. It also raised the credibility issue: could the authority of Aristotle and Ptolemy be trusted concerning the nature of the Universe if there were so many things in the Universe about which they had been unaware and/or incorrect? Galileo’s challenge of the Church’s authority through his refutation of the Aristotelian concept of the Universe eventually got him into deep trouble. Late in his life he was forced, under threat of torture, to publicly recant his Copernican views and spent his last years under house arrest. Galileo’s life is a sad example of the conflict between the scientific method and unquestioned authority. Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), who was born the same year that Galileo died, would build on Galileo’s ideas to demonstrate that the laws of motion in the heavens and the laws of motion on the earth were the same. Thus Galileo began, and Newton completed, a synthesis of astronomy and physics in which astronomy was recognized as but a part of physics, and that the opinions of Aristotle were almost completely eliminated from both. Many scientists consider Newton to be a peer of Einstein in scientific thinking. Newton’s accomplishments had even greater scope than those of Einstein. The poet Alexander Pope wrote of Newton: Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night; God said, Let Newton be! and all was light. In terms of astronomy, Newton gave reasons for and corrections to Kepler’s Laws. Kepler had proposed three Laws of Planetary motion based on Tycho Brahe’s data. These Laws were supposed to apply only to the motions of the planets. Further, they were purely empirical, that is, they worked, but no one knew why they worked. Newton changed all of that. First, he demonstrated that the motion of objects on the Earth could be described by three new Laws of motion, and then he went on to show that Kepler’s three Laws of Planetary Motion were but special cases of Newton’s three Laws when his gravitational force was postulated to exist between all masses in the Universe. In fact, Newton showed that Kepler’s Laws of planetary motion were only approximately correct, and supplied the quantitative corrections that with careful observations proved to be valid. 
The  Big  Bang  Theory 	  The Big Bang Theory is the dominant and highly supported theory of the origin of the universe. It states that the universe began from an initial point which has expanded over billions of years to form the universe as we now know it. In 1922, Alexander Friedman found that the solutions to Einstein’s general relativity equations resulted in an expanding universe. Einstein, at that time, believed in a static, eternal universe so he added a constant to his equations to eliminate the expansion. Einstein would later call this the biggest blunder of his life. In 1924, Edwin Hubble was able to measure the distance to observed celestial objects that were thought to be nebula and discovered that they were so far away they were not actually part of the Milky Way (the galaxy containing our sun). He discovered that the Milky Way was only one of many galaxies. In 1927, Georges Lemaitre, a physicist, suggested that the universe must be expanding. Lemaitre’s theory was supported by Hubble in 1929 when he found that the galaxies most distant from us also had the greatest red shift (were moving away from us with the greatest speed). The idea that the most distance galaxies were moving away from us at the greatest speed was exactly what was predicted by Lemaitre. In 1931, Lemaitre went further with his predictions and by extrapolating backwards, found that the matter of the universe would reach an infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past (around 15 billion years). This meant that the universe must have begun as a small, extremely dense point of matter. At the time, the only other theory that competed with Lemaitre’s theory was the “Steady State Theory” of Fred Hoyle. The steady state theory predicted that new matter was created which made it appear that the universe was expanding but that the universe was constant. It was Hoyle who coined the term “Big Bang Theory” which he used as a derisive name for Lemaitre’s theory. George Gamow (1904 –1968) was the major advocate of the Big Bang theory. He predicted that cosmic microwave background radiation should exist throughout the universe as a remnant of the Big Bang. As atoms formed from sub-atomic particles shortly after the Big Bang, electromagnetic radiation would be emitted and this radiation would still be observable today. Gamow predicted that the expansion of the universe would cool the original radiation so that now the radiation would be in the microwave range. The debate continued until 1965 when two Bell Telephone scientists stumbled upon the microwave radiation with their radio telescope.

The  Life  Cycle of  Stars 	  Space may seem empty, but actually it contains thinly spread gas and dust, called interstellar medium, that gradually collapses over immense stretches of time and collects into denser clouds of gas and dust. The atoms of gas are mostly hydrogen and are typically about a centimeter apart. The dust is mostly carbon and silicon. In some places, this interstellar medium is collected into particularly dense clouds of gas and dust known as a nebula. A nebula is the birthplace of stars. Our sun was probably born in a nebula around 5 billion years ago. Within a nebula, there are varying regions where gravity has caused the gas and dust to clump together. The gravitational attraction of these clumps pull more atoms into the clump. As this accretion continues, the gas pressure increases and the core of the protostar gets hotter and hotter. If the protostar gets dense enough and hot enough, a fusion reaction will ignite and the star lights up. The minimum mass for the formation of a star is about core. Stars spend the majority of their life fusing hydrogen into helium. When the hydrogen is nearly used up, the star can fuse helium into heavier elements. Throughout this process, a battle goes on in the core of the star between gravity trying to collapse the star and temperature-produced gas pressure pushing the material in the star outward. During the life of a star, there is a balance between the gas pressure pushing out and gravity pushing in. Once a star has achieved nuclear fusion in its core, it radiates energy into space. While the temperature-produced gas pressure balances gravity, the star attains a stable state and enters the main sequence phase of its life. The temperature of a main sequence star is about 15,000,000°C. For the major part of its life span, a star stays in this main sequence phase, with hydrogen being fused into helium and a balance between force pushing out and force pushing in. How long a star lives depends on its initial size. Stars can live from many millions of years to many billions of years. The most massive stars (many times the size of our sun) become extremely dense and hot in the core and therefore, have a very high fusion rate. The largest stars use up their hydrogen fuel fastest and therefore live for the shortest time, perhaps only millions of years. Stars that are the size of our sun fuse hydrogen much more slowly and therefore live much longer. Medium sized stars live billions of years. As a star begins to run low on hydrogen, since the initial quantity has been fused into the denser helium gas, the core will contract due to gravity. The collapsing core increases temperature to the point that the star can begin to fuse helium into carbon. When that happens, the outer portion of the star expands greatly due to the higher temperature. The star can expand to 1000 times the diameter of the sun. At this point, the star is called a red giant. If our sun became a red giant, its surface would expand out past the orbit of Mars. Red giants are red because the surface of the star is cooler than white or blue stars, but remain highly visible because of their gigantic size. After a star becomes a red giant, it will take one of several different paths to end its life. Which path is followed by a star after the red giant phase depends on its mass. During the fusion life of a star, its size is the result of a competition between fusion heat pushing the material out and gravity pulling the material in. At the end, gravity always wins. After the star has lived through its red giant stage, the fusion essentially ends (the star runs out of fuel) allowing gravity to collapse the star. Some of the outer layers of material will be blown away and the core becomes smaller and denser. The core will become either a neutron star, a white dwarf, a black dwarf, or a black hole. Low-mass stars (less than 0.5 times the mass of our sun) become a red giant and then blow off some outer material which dissipates in the interstellar medium after a few hundred thousand years. The remainder of the star shrinks to a white dwarf. After a few billion years, white dwarfs cool to become black dwarfs. Medium-mass stars (less than 3 times the mass of our sun) become a red giants and eventually become a supernova. A supernova is the massive explosion of a star accompanied by emission of light and matter so intense that it can outshine an entire galaxy. After a supernove, when all the accessible fuel in a medium-mass star is exhausted, the iron core collapses and proton-electron pairs are converted into neutrons. Such stars are called neutron stars. Neutron stars might spin rapidly giving off light and X-rays or they might emit pulses of energy regularly and be known as pulsars. The largest-mass stars become black holes. These extremely large stars end their life in the same way as a mediummass star in that they become a supernova. After the outer layers are blown away in the supernova, however, the core of the star shrinks down in volume but still has a huge mass. The density of this object is extremely high, even denser than neutron stars. This dense object will have a gravitational force so large that not even light can escape from the body. (A companion topic to this occurs in The General Theory of Relativity where we see than extremely strong gravitational attraction can even attract light.) These objects appear black because light cannot leave them, that is, they pull all light back to their surface. Black holes capture everything nearby due to their massive gravity and so they grow in size. Black holes are a common topic for science fiction but keep in mind, they are simply a very dense ball of matter with intense gravitational attraction. 
Summary 	  • A star begins its life in a nebula, struggles to balance gravitational pull and internal pressure during its main sequence period, and ends its life in an explosion to eventually become a white or black dwarf, or a neutron star, or a black hole.

The star constellation “Orion, The Hunter”. Orion is one of the most beautiful of all constellations, and one of the easiest to find. It looks like a large (slightly twisted) rectangle high in winter’s south-southeastern sky. Two of the brightest stars in the evening sky lie at opposite corners of the rectangle: bright orange-red Betelgeuse at the northeastern corner (upper left in the photo) and even brighter Rigel at the southwest (lower right in the photo). Betelgeuse is at least 300 times the Sun’s diameter, and perhaps much more. It puts out about 100,000 times more energy than the Sun does. When Betelgeuse dies, it will create a fireball that will briefly outshine billions of normal stars. Betelgeuse is a red giant and Rigel is a blue giant. 
Hertzsprung- Russell  Diagram 	  The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (often referred to as the H-R diagram) is a scatter graph that shows various classes of stars in the context of properties such as their luminosity, absolute magnitude, color, and effective temperature. Created around 1910 by Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell, the diagram provided a great help in understanding stellar evolution. There are several forms of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and the nomenclature is not very well defined. The original diagram displayed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the absolute magnitude on the vertical axis. The form below shows Kelvin temperature along the horizontal axis going from high temperature on the left to low temperature on the right and luminosity on the vertical axis. We can think of the luminosity as brightness in multiples of the Sun. A luminosity of 100 on the axis would mean 100 times as bright as the Sun. Most of the stars occupy a region in the diagram along a line called the Main Sequence. During that stage, stars are fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. The position of the Sun in the main sequence is shown in the diagram. You should note that the axial scales for this diagram are not linear. The vertical scale is logarithmic, each line is between 1,000 and 10,000 degrees K between each line. If all other factors were the same, the highest temperature stars would also be the most luminous (the brightest). In the main sequence of stars, we see that as the temperature increases to the left, the luminosity also increases, demonstrating that the hottest stars in this grouping are also the brightest. There are stars, however, that are less bright than their temperature would predict. This group of stars is called white dwarfs. These stars are less bright than expected because of their very small size. These dwarf stars are only one one-thousandth the size of stars in the main sequence. There are also stars that are much brighter than their temperature would predict. This group of stars are called red giants. They are brighter than their temperature would predict because they are much larger than stars in the main sequence. These stars have expanded to several thousand times the size of stars in the main sequence. Stars that are reddish in color are cooler than other stars while stars that are bluish in color are hotter than other stars. A white dwarf is a stellar remnant that is very dense. A white dwarf’s mass is comparable to the Sun and its volume is comparable to that of Earth. The very low brightness of a white dwarf comes from the emission of stored heat energy. White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of any star whose mass is not great enough to become a neutron star. Approximately 97% of the stars in our galaxy will become neutron stars. After the hydrogen–fusing lifetime of a main-sequence star of low or medium mass ends, it will expand to a red giant which fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core. If a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon, around 1 billion K, an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center. After blowing off its outer layers to form a planetary nebula, the core will be left behind to form the remnant white dwarf. White dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen. A white dwarf is very hot when it is formed, but since it has no source of energy (no further fusion reactions), it will gradually radiate away its energy and cool down. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool to temperatures at which it will no longer emit significant light, and it will become a cold black dwarf. A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system.

Questions 	  diagram? the white dwarf? • luminosity: Luminosity is the rate at which a star or other object emits energy, usually in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Astronomy is a fantastically old science, and the accuracy of some historical observations is truly remarkable. Stars function as immense fusion reactors, converting smaller into larger elements. All stars initially convert hydrogen into helium, and the rate of conversion is dependent on the mass of the star. As the hydrogen is exhausted, the increased density of star allows it to begin converting heavier elements, which releases exponentially more energy and causes the star to expand once more. Depending on the initial mass of the star, it will end its life after millions or billions of years as a white or brown dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole.

Relativity 	  According to the Theory of Special Relativity, time on an object traveling near the speed of light passes more slowly than time on a non-moving reference object. This phenomenon is called time dilation. There is an interesting consequence of time dilation. Imagine two twins, one who stays on Earth (the non-moving reference object in this case) while the other twin travels into space on a rocket traveling at 90% of the speed of light. After reaching some distant point, the space-traveling twin immediately turns around and returns to Earth. If the trip covered a distance of 4.3 light-years, the stay-at-home twin would perceive the trip as having taken 9.6 years on his normal clock. The traveling twin would find, however, that the trip according to his watch (having undergone acceleration and high velocity) has taken only 4.0 years. The closer one gets to the speed of light, the slower time moves and the less one ages. Therefore, when the traveling twin returns home, he will find that his twin brother has aged 5.6 years more than he has. In this chapter, you will come face-to-face with Einstein’s theories of relativity and some of the very strange conclusions resulting from it. • Describe time dilation. • Describe the twin paradox. • Calculate time interval changes when reference frames have relative motion approaching the speed of light. • Calculate relativistic length for objects observed traveling at near the speed of light. • Calculate relativistic mass. E = mc2 as derived in the special theory of relativity explains the equivalence of mass and energy, which is how nuclear reactions produce the amazing amounts of energy available in thermonuclear weapons. 
The  Theory of  Special  Relativity 	  The theory of relativity refers to two different elements of the same theory: special relativity and general relativity. The theory of special relativity was first introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905 and was later (1916) considered to be a special case of the more comprehensive theory of general relativity. The special theory of relativity was accepted reasonably quickly by physicists considering that it was introduced in 1905 and widely accepted by 1920. The theory of general relativity was not accepted as quickly. Some physics historians insist that considerable resistance to the theory existed even into the 1950’s and 1960’s. At least part of the problem for the acceptance of the theory was that some conclusions from the theory went against common sense and also, there was very little experimental evidence to support the theory. The special theory of relativity essentially explains how to interpret motion between different inertial frames of reference, that is, places that are moving at constant speeds relative to each other. Special relativity is based on two postulates: of the source of the light. An inertial reference frame is one in which Newton’s first law, the law of inertia, is valid. That is, if an object experiences no net force due to other bodies, the object either remains at rest or remains in motion with constant velocity in a straight line. 
A  Closer  Look at  Postulate 1 	  Consider dropping a child’s toy block in a railroad boxcar. The block will fall straight down and come to rest on a spot directly underneath the position from which it was dropped. For an observer inside a stationary boxcar, there will be a measureable distance the block fell, a time required to fall and an average velocity for the fall. If the boxcar is moving at a constant horizontal velocity 10 m/s, the observer inside the boxcar will find the all measurements to be exactly the same as when the boxcar was stationary, including the spot where the block came to rest. For an observer inside the boxcar, the frame of reference is the same whether the car is moving or not and all the laws of physics will be the same in both cases. Consider the block falling in the moving boxcar as observed by a stationary observer outside the boxcar. As observed in this frame of reference, the block does NOT fall straight down but rather follows a parabolic path. The distance it falls is NOT the same and the average velocity calculated is NOT the same. For the outside observer, the block has a constant horizontal velocity equal to the velocity of the boxcar and the vector sum of the horizontal velocity and the vertical fall result in the parabolic path sketched. For the inside observer, there is no horizontal velocity. For the outside observer, the distance traveled along the parabolic path is longer than the path straight down but the time for the fall is the same. For the outside observer, the average velocity is greater. Inside each frame of reference, all the laws of physics hold, but the measurements are not the same between the two frames of reference. 
A  Closer  Look at  Postulate 2 	  Suppose you are sitting on the hood of a stationary car and your brother is standing alongside the road some 50 feet ahead of the car. If you throw a ball to your brother with a velocity of 10 m/s, it will travel, relative to you, at a velocity of 10 m/s and it will travel, relative to your brother, as 10 m/s. Suppose then, that you repeat the throw except this time, you toss the ball while the car is moving toward your brother at 10 m/s. This time, the ball will move, relative to you, with a velocity of 10 m/s but it will move, relative to your brother, with a velocity of 20 m/s. In this case, the velocity of the source of the ball is added to the velocity of the ball to get the velocity relative to a stationary observer. Common sense would tell us that if we did this same experiment with light, that is, shine a flashlight off the hood of a moving car in the same direction the car is moving, the velocity of the light relative to a stationary observer would be increased by the velocity of the car. In fact, such an increase in the speed of light has never been found. In fact, in experiments carried out to test for the effect of the movement of the source on the speed of light (Michelson-Morley), the results indicate that the speed of light is completely unaffected by the motion of the source. It appears that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant regardless of relative motion. Hence, the suggestion in postulate 2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion or the motion of the source of the light. The special theory of relativity copes with the results of the Michelson-Morley experiments much better than does classical mechanics, but it also has some surprising consequences. For example, according to the theory of special relativity, • Two events that occurred simultaneously for one observer were not simultaneous for another observer if the two observers had relative motion to each other. (Relativity of simultaneity). • Clocks in a moving frame of reference tick more slowly than an observer’s “stationary” clock. (Time dilation). • Objects are measured to be shorter in the direction that they are moving with respect to a stationary observer. (Length contraction). • E = mc2, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable. (Mass-energy equivalence). • No physical object can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. (Maximum speed is finite). 
Time  Dilation 	  Suppose we are in a rocket ship sitting at rest on the earth and we turn on an overhead light. The light will travel downward (and all other directions as well) and land on the table below. The observer in the rocket ship can measure the distance traveled to the table, the time required for the light to arrive on the table and an average velocity for the light. If repeat the experiment in the rocket ship while the rocket is flying past the earth at a constant horizontal velocity, the observer inside will find all the measurements and calculations to be exactly the same as when the rocket was at rest. Suppose now that the rocket ship is flying past the earth at the same constant horizontal velocity and that the observer is stationary on the earth. For the observer in the rocket ship, the light falls down on the table traveling at the regular speed of light, c. For the observer on the earth, the light travels horizontally with the ship and also falls down onto the table. For the observer on the earth, the path appears to be longer since the light not only went downward but also horizontally. However, since we have postulate 2, it is not allowed for the light to travel farther in the same time and therefore have a greater average velocity. According to postulate 2, the speed of the light as observed inside the space ship by that observer must be 3× 108 m/s and the speed of light observed by the observer on the earth (the light moving diagonally) must ALSO be 3× 108 m/s. So, how is it possible for both observers to measure the speed of light as the same number when the distance traveled is clearly NOT the same? There is an unstated assumption involved here that indicates the passage of time in the two reference frames is the same and that is where the special theory of relativity changes our ideas. The special theory of relativity tells us that the observer on earth will see the clocks on the rocket ship ticking more slowly than his own clocks. So, while the observer on the rocket ship sees the light travel a distance x meters in 1.00 second as measured on his clock, the observer on the earth sees the light travel 2x meters in 2.00 seconds as measured by his clock. In both cases, the speed of light is measured to be c. It is important to note that this is not an optical illusion or some strange effect on the mechanical operation of the clock, the actual time on the ship slows down compared to the time of the stationary observer. This is referred to as time dilation. The equation for time dilation is ∆T = ∆t(cid:113) c2 where ∆t is the time interval between two events in the moving reference frame and ∆T is the time interval as measured in a stationary frame of reference. “v” is the relative velocity of the moving reference frame and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. It should be clear from the equation that if the relative velocity between the two frames of reference is zero, then ∆T = ∆t and there is no time dilation. We can also use the equation to show that for relative speeds like 100 m/s, which seems very fast to us, the comparison to the speed of light would show no noticeable time dilation. ∆T = = 10 s (cid:113) ∆t(cid:113) = c2 (3×108)2 for any noticeable effect to occur, the relative velocity of the reference frames must be a significant fraction of the speed of light. Example Problem: A muon has a rest lifetime of 2.2× 10−6 s. If it travels with a speed of 0.95c relative to you, how far will you see it travel before it decays? Solution: 
Muon’s lifetime according to your reference frame 	  ∆T = = 7.0× 10−6 s (cid:113) = 2.2×10−6 s c2 √ = 2.2×10−6 s ∆t(cid:113) c2 distance = (3.0× 108 m/s)(0.95)(7.0× 10−6 s) = 2.0× 103 meters 
The  Twin  Paradox 	  Shortly after Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity, an apparent paradox was pointed out. This paradox involved a pair of twins, one of whom traveled away from the earth and returned at very high speeds. The other twin remained at home on earth. Since one twin was traveling at very high speed, time for him was running slower than for the twin who remained on earth. Thus the traveling twin would return home younger than the twin who remained on earth. The paradox comes about when each twin thinks that their frame of reference was at rest and the other twin’s frame of reference was moving at high speed. Therefore, each twin would find the other one to be younger. The resolution lies in the fact that the traveling twin must accelerate at the beginning and end of the trip and this acceleration guarantees that this twin is traveling and his clock is actually running slower. The traveling twin will return home younger than his twin brother. This result was tested in 1971 with a pair of very precise clocks. One clock was sent around the world in high speed jet planes while the matched clock remained at rest. When the traveling clock was returned and placed next to the other clock, the traveling clock had less time passed. 
Length  Contraction 	  In a similar manner, an observer on the rocket ship and an observer on the earth will not measure the length of the rocket ship to be the same length in the direction of its motion. The observer on the ship takes out his meter stick and measures the rocket ship to be 15 meters long while the ship sits at rest on the earth. An observer outside the ship, standing on the earth, will also measure the ship to be 15 m with his meter stick. When the rocket ship flies past the earth at a significant fraction of the speed of light, the observer on the ship takes out his meter stick and measures the length of the ship and again finds it to be 15 m. The “stationary” observer on the earth with his meter stick measures the moving rocket ship to be less than 15 m. Just for the sake of clarity, let’s say he measures the rocket ship to be How is it possible that the two observers measure the same rocket ship to be two different lengths? When the rocket ship is at rest on the earth, the on-ship meter stick and the off-ship meter stick are exactly the same but when the rocket ship flies past the earth at significant fraction of the speed of light, the on-ship meter stick as seen by the on earth observer has shrunk. When the observer on ship says the ship is still 15 m long, the observer on earth says, “Nope, your meter stick has shrunk and so has your ship. The ship now measures 7.5 m long using my meter stick.” The on-ship meter stick shrinks by the same percentage that the ship shrinks. It is important to note that the shortening of the moving object does not produce just a smaller object of the same shape. The object is only shortened in the direction of motion. Therefore, a long, slender rocket ship would NOT become a smaller version of itself, but rather, would become a short, stubby rocket ship. At some point in history, the length contraction was known as the Fitzgerald contraction and physicists have been known to quote an applicable limerick. There once was a young man named Fisk, Whose fencing was exceedingly brisk, So fast was his action, The Fitzgerald contraction reduced his sword to a disk. 
The equation for length contraction is  L =  Lo 	  length measured on the stationary body, v is the relative speed of the reference frames, and c is the speed of light. You can see by analysis of the equation that when the relative velocity is zero, the two lengths are the same, when the relative speed is less than 1000 m/s, the effect is too small to notice, and only when the relative speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light is the contraction measureable. Example Problem: A spaceship passes the earth at a speed v = 0.80 c. c2 where Lo is the length measured on the moving body, L is the (cid:114) a. What is the length of a meter stick laying on a table in the ship and pointing in the direction of motion of the ship as measured by a person on the ship? b. What is the length of a meter stick laying on a table in the ship and pointing in the direction of motion of the ship as measured by a person on the earth? Solution: a. relative to a person on the ship, the meter stick is at rest and therefore its length is 1.0 m = (1.0 m) √ (cid:114) (cid:114) c2 b. L = Lo c2 = (1.0 m) 
Relativistic  Mass 	  The three basic mechanical quantities are length, time, and mass. Since length and time have been shown to be relative (their value depends on the reference frame from which they are measured), it might be expected that mass is also relative. Einstein showed that the mass of an object increases as its speed increases according to the formula M = mo(cid:113) c2 where M is the mass of the moving body, mo is the mass of the body at rest (or rest mass), v is the velocity of the body and c is the velocity of light. For many years it was conventional to enter the discussion of dynamics through derivation of the relativistic mass and this is probably still the dominant mode in textbooks. More recently, however, it has been increasingly recognized that relativistic mass is a troublesome and dubious concept. Many physicists reject the concept of relativistic mass and oppose teaching the concept. Instead, they prefer to approach relativism through momentum rather than through relativistic mass. If momentum is the preferred place to express relativistic dynamics, the equation is mov(cid:113) c2 p = Where p is momentum, mo is rest mass, v is the velocity of the body and c is the velocity of light. Example Problem: An electron has a rest mass of 9.1× 10−31 kg. If the electron were traveling at 0.50 c relative to an observer, what electron mass would the observer measure? Solution: M = = 1.1× 10−30 kg = (cid:113) mo(cid:113) c2 c2 = √ 
The  Ultimate  Speed  Limit 	  A result of the special theory of relativity is that no physical object can equal or exceed the speed of light. From the equation for relativistic mass, it can be seen that as the object is accelerated faster and faster, its mass becomes greater and greater. The greater mass would require an even greater force to accelerate it. If the velocity of the mass ever reached the speed of light, the denominator of the equation would become zero and the mass would become infinite. The energy required to accelerate an infinite mass would also be infinite. The fact that light itself travels at the speed c, implies that light has a zero rest mass. Of course, light is never at rest. 
The  Equivalence of  Mass and  Energy 	  The special theory of relativity is also the origin of Einstein’s most famous equation, E = mc2, and the concept that mass and energy are different forms of the same thing. Einstein himself described the equivalence of mass and energy as the “most important upshot of the special theory of relativity”. The idea is not that mass and energy can be mathematically related but that they two are, in fact, simply different forms of the same thing. Each may be converted into the other and the conversion factor is the speed of light squared. Example Problem: How much energy would be released if a π meson (rest mass = 2.4×10−28 kg) was transformed by decay completely into energy? Solution: E = mc2 = (2.4× 10−28 kg)(3.0× 108 m/s)2 = 2.2× 10−11 joules 
The  Impact of the  Theory of  Special  Relativity 	  A great many experiments have been performed to test the predictions of special relativity. No contradictions have been found. Scientists have therefore accepted special relativity as an accurate description of nature. When the relative velocities of objects are considerably less than the speed of light, the formulas for relativistic time, length, and mass all reduce to the classical formulas. It is required that the two theories correspond where they overlap at speeds much less than c. Special relativity does not contradict classical mechanics. Rather, it is a more general theory needed for object speeds approaching the speed of light.

In Special Relativity, a clock moving with respect to an observer appears to run more slowly than to an observer moving with the clock. In General Relativity, time dilation is also caused by gravity; clocks on the earth’s surface, for example, run more slowly than clocks at high altitudes, where gravitational forces are weaker. • length contraction: One of the aspects of Einstein’s theory of special relativity is that the length of objects moving at relativistic speeds undergoes a contraction along the dimension of motion.

In a new study, scientists may have unexpectedly detected a merger of black holes about 160 million light-years away in a galaxy dubbed NGC3393. Using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, investigators have detected two black holes at its center, one about 30 million times the mass of the sun, and one at least 1 million times the mass of the sun, separated by only about 490 light-years. They are the closest super-massive black holes to Earth ever seen, according to a NASA statement. The scientists originally looked at this galaxy only to learn more about what they thought was the sole black hole at its center. 
The  General  Theory of  Relativity 	  In 1905, Albert Einstein published the theory of special relativity, a theory about space and time. In the following years, Einstein worked on the fact that acceleration produced the same effect as gravitation. For example, if you were in an accelerating spaceship, or just an elevator, you could not tell if the force on you was from inertia or gravitation. While Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation works well for ordinary gravitational fields, it is inaccurate when the gravitational intensity is high. Albert Einstein formulated the theory of general relativity in 1914 as a new way to explain gravity. The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line. Suppose we take a model of the earth in the shape of a globe and draw a straight line on the globe that travels from Kodiak Island, Alaska to the southern tip of Greenland. This straight line passes northward of Hudson’s Bay, missing it entirely. Now suppose we take a map of Canada that has been flattened to exist in two dimensions and once again, draw a straight line from Kodiak Island, Alaska to the southern tip off Greenland. This time, the straight line cuts right through the middle of Hudson’s Bay. Why the difference? The actual space occupied by the earth is three dimensional and spherical. When that space is altered in order to fit it onto a two-dimensional sheet of paper, the actual geometry of the surface is altered. A straight line on a curved surface does not mean the same thing as a straight line on a flat surface. When an object travels through curved space, it must follow the curvature of the space in order to move in a straight line. When there is no mass in a volume of space, the space is not curved. An object passing through such space would follow a straight line in our normal way of thinking of a straight line. When a large mass is placed in the space, however, the space is curved due to the presence of the mass. In this case, an object passing through the space must follow the curvature of the space in order to follow a straight line. Thus the path of the object bends toward the mass. The change in the direction the object appears to be exactly the same as it would have been following Newton’s law of gravity. In the general theory of relativity, objects move toward each other not because of a force that acts at a distance but because they are following curved space. The mathematical expressions describing the properties of a gravitational field around a mass are given in a set of formulas called the Einstein Field Equations. These formulas are a highly complex system of partial differential equations, which are beyond the scope of our material. Under normal levels of gravitational field strength, however, the relativistic mathematics for gravity reduce to Newton’s mathematics for gravity. When gravitational field strength is extremely high, however, the correct movement of objects can only be calculated with Einstein’s relativistic gravity. Mass tells space how to curve and space tells mass how to move. Experimental tests to garner support for the general theory of relativity were not easy to find. The first involved the orbit of the planet Mercury. The orbit of Mercury (the closest planet to the sun) exhibits perturbations and a precession that could not be fully explained by Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation. The motion of Mercury was in much greater agreement with the predictions from the equations of general relativity. The acceptance of the theory of general relativity increased greatly after it was shown to correctly predict the orbit of Mercury. Both Newton’s theory of universal gravity and the theory of general relativity predict that light can be deflected by gravity. The calculation of the amount of deflection predicted by Einstein’s theory was approximately double that predicted by Newton’s theory. The deflection of light by gravity was tested in 1919, five years after general relativity was proposed. Two British groups took photographs of a region of the sky centered on the sun during the May 1919 total solar eclipse and compared the positions of the photographed stars with those of the same stars photographed from the same locations in July 1919 when the sun was far from that region of the sky. The results showed that light was deflected when the sun was present, and also that this deflection was consistent with general relativity but not with “Newtonian physics”. The subsequent publicity catapulted Einstein to world fame. (To date, he is the only scientist to ever have a ticker-tape parade in New York City.) 
Other  Predictions of the  General  Theory of  Relativity 	  Einstein’s general theory of relativity states that time is a fourth dimension adding to the three dimensions of space. Einstein called this four-dimensional geometry spacetime. The general theory of relativity also predicted light coming from a strong gravitational field would have its wavelength shifted toward longer wavelengths, called a red-shift. The theory also predicted that when gravity becomes great enough, it would produce objects called black holes. Black holes are objects whose gravity is so massive that light cannot escape from the surface at all. Since no light can escape, such objects would appear black. Both gravitational red-shift and black holes were considered possible in the Newtonian theory, but measurements correspond better with Einstein’s theory. There are also interesting effects having to do with the “curved time” predicted by the theory of relativity. This effect manifests itself by causing time to go slower near a massive object. The theory suggests that time on the top of a mountain runs faster than it does at sea level. Gravity’s slowing down of time also affects the frequency of light waves and therefore their color. Light becomes bluer as it approaches a massive object and redder as it moves away. This effect was first observed in 1960 by Robert Pound and Glen Rebka, who shot gamma rays up to the top of a building and measured the change in their color as they got farther away from the Earth. 
Summary 	  • Masses placed in space cause the space to be curved. • Curved space causes masses moving in a straight line to follow a curved path. • Curved space also caused time to run more slowly.
